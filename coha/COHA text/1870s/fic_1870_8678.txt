H.  --  Night . Marietta discovered C. Enter Cook from chateau whipping a syllabub . Cook . Cook Are they coming , Marietta ? The wedding must be over . Marietta . Marietta No , not yet . Poor dear Miss Louise , I wonder if she will be happy with her husband . Cook . Cook In course she will . Mr. Ernest is a man who has a proper respect for his stomach ; and a man with a good digestion always makes his wife happy . That 's a fundamental culinary principle . Mar . Marietta Then I 'll take care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard without . There they go , into the house . Run , Robert , they 'll want that syllabub . Exit Cook hastily into chateau . I wonder now , how you know a man that has a good digestion ? I wonder what 's a sign of it , if freckles are , for instance . Ah ! here comes the bride 's sister , my mistress . Enter Griselda from chateau . Gris . Griselda Oh ! dear me ! I must have the fresh air . I ca n't remain in the house . I believe I should have felt no worse if I had been married myself . Married myself ? And yet there is nothing unnatunatural in that ; am I not the elder sister ? Ah , Victor ! Sighs . Mar . Marietta Advancing . Are they married , ma'am ? Gris . Griselda Yes , child ; she has made herself over , for better or worse , for ever and ever , Amen ! Mar . Marietta And how did Miss Louise behave during the ceremony , ma'am ? Gris . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Ah ! Marietta , marriage is a rascally invention ! Enter Lafontaine , mysteriously , R. H. Lafont . Lafontaine I have the honor of addressing Miss Marietta ? Mar . Marietta Mr. Lafontaine , I believe , Mr. Ernest 's gentleman ? Laf . Lafontaine Yes , Miss . Confidentially . My master directed me to apply to you to learn where I am to put this little package . Gris . Griselda What little package ? Mar . Marietta Aside . I wonder what 's in it ? Laf . Lafontaine To Griselda . Why his brushes madame ; his shaving apparatus ; in short the accessories of his toilet . Gris . Griselda Horrified . Pah ! I declare ! on his wedding day ! Mar . Marietta What can he want to shave for , to-night ? Laf . Lafontaine C. You understand , ladies , that it would be annoying for him not to have at hand , to-morrow morning , the conveniences to which he is accustomed . Mar . Marietta He 's got a good digestion , I vow ! Gris . Griselda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it where you like  --  your little package , I would not touch it with the tips of my fingers . Laf . Lafontaine May I ask what there is disgusting in a gentleman wishing to shave in the morning ? Gris . Griselda Perhaps you 've brought his night-cap , too ! Goes up , indignantly . Mar . Marietta Here , give it to me . Shaving-tackle on the night of his wedding ! No one but a man , now , would have such an idea as that ! Exit , contemptuously , into chateau . Laf . Lafontaine What better can we expect of people educated in the rural districts ! Exit , loftily , R. H. Gris . Griselda Coming down . Ah , Victor , Victor ! Yes ; why should n't it be so ? the elder brother , Ernest , marries the younger sister , Louise ; what would be more natural than for the younger brother , Victor , to marry the elder sister , Griselda ? We should be a nice family party , and could play whist together without that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing . Enter Louise , from the chateau . Louise . Louise Devereux Griselda dear , I want to tell you a secret . Gris . Griselda Well , love , what secret can you have for me on your wedding night ? Louise . Louise Devereux I am so happy , Griselda  --  I am too happy ! Gris . Griselda Heaven grant that you may continue so , Louise . Louise . Louise Devereux Oh , my heart would have burst , sister , had I not found some one to tell how happy I am ! Oh , Griselda , after the title of Mother , do you know what is the prettiest title ? Elder sister . Gris . Griselda No , Louise , Younger sister is a prettier still . Louise . Louise Devereux Do you remember , a year ago , Griselda , how I told you of my dreams , and the romances of which I was the heroine , and of which I created the hero from my own imagination . And when I told you of the portrait I had drawn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my dream . Such as I pictured him , Griselda , heaven has sent him . He lives ! He stood by me in the church ; he loves me  --  I am his wife . This is the secret that I had to tell you , Griselda  --  to you , whom I love more than ever  --  you who shall be the confidant of that love I dare not yet confide to him . Gris . Griselda You can not love me more than I love you , Louise . But you are lost to me now ; I lose a sister , and gain  --  a brother-in-law . Louise . Louise Devereux A brother , Griselda  --  he shall be your brother . But I am afraid of one thing : that I am not worthy of him . Gris . Griselda Nonsense , love ; it is quite as likely he is not worthy of you . Louise . Louise Devereux Why , he is as bold as a lion . I asked about his adventures in Africa , of his brother Victor , whose life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has Ernest ever been a soldier ? and did he save Victor 's life ? How I love him for that ! Louise . Louise Devereux Yes , and among the Arabs , too . And to think , Griselda , that this terrible man sits humbly at my feet , and holds my hand in his ! Oh , I love him ! How I love him ! Gris . Griselda Love him as much as you like , Louise , but take my advice  --  I am five years older than you  --  do nt tell him of it  --  at least , in the way you tell me of it . Louise . Louise Devereux Why , I should not dare , Griselda ; I hardly know him . Still , we are now husband and wife . For myself , I am sure that this charming future , which begins to-night , will teach me nothing of him which I have not already guessed , and which will not justify his triumph , and my enslavement . Gris . Griselda I thought him somewhat cold during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband , I should have thought so . Louise . Louise Devereux Why , you would not have him shed tears like a woman , would you ? Gris . Griselda Hark ! Louise . Louise Devereux It is he and M. Victor . Gris . Griselda They are coming this way ; let us listen . Louise . Louise Devereux They are talking of me  --  would it be wrong to listen ? Why , no ; is he not my husband ? Here , Griselda , in this bower  --  quick  --  there . They conceal themselves in bower . Enter Victor and Ernest , arm-in-arm , L. 3 E. Ern . Ernest Devereux Is it for propriety 's sake , Victor , that you leave us so soon ? Vic . Victor No ; for necessity 's sake . My furlough expires to-morrow . Ern . Ernest Devereux I am sorry , Victor . Promise , at any rate , to return in a month or so  --  in time for the shooting season . Vic . Victor No , I thank you ; a third party in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more trying to all concerned . Ern . Ernest Devereux It is quite plain that you are lately from Africa , Victor . Let me tell you that a tete-a-tete of two months is , now-a-days , considered quite sufficient , and that a friend , more especially a brother , does but his duty in coming to interrupt it . Vic . Victor By the saints , if I had such a wife , I would shut myself up with her in a tower ! Ern . Ernest Devereux And so you like my wife , do you , Victor ? Why , with your ideas , you ought to get married yourself . Gris . Griselda In bower . Oh ! Vic . Victor On the contrary : with my ideas , I ought not to get married unless your wife has a duplicate . Gris . Griselda Aside . Am not I a duplicate ? Ern . Ernest Devereux Why , what is there so extraordinary in my wife ? She is pretty , of course  --  but really , enthusiasm is out of place . Vic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confess that you adore her . Ern . Ernest Devereux Victor , have I manifested any symptoms of lunacy since you have been here ? Vic . Victor You did not marry her without loving her , I suppose ? Ern . Ernest Devereux I married her precisely because I was not in love with her ; because I have been in love till I am done with it ; because I have had enough of it ; because I am thirty years old , and an old bachelor is a disagreeable member of society . The estate of Louise , Victor , joined mine , and this propinquity , with the alliance it suggested , was the prologue to the little pastoral drama , of which you have just witnessed the finale . Vic . Victor You will never persuade me that in marrying Louise , you were moved solely by such a miserable consideration . Ern . Ernest Devereux Not altogether , for I was already contemplating marriage . Had I found Louise deformed , or idiotic , of course I should have abandoned my plan of uniting her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I found her to be a young lady of good position and of decent manners , and I felt that I could conceive for her that calm and solid affection that an honest man owes to the mother of his children . Vic . Victor No matter ; you have deceived her . You are very wrong , Ernest . Ern . Ernest Devereux In what have I deceived her , pray ? Vic . Victor Do you suppose that this child , whose portrait you are far from flattering , expects of you nothing but a calm and solid affection ? Ern . Ernest Devereux What would you have her expect ? I take it that she looks upon marriage as marriage , a cat as a cat , and a husband as a husband ? Vic . Victor But she is not twenty years old ; youth sparkles in her eyes , and blood courses in her veins ! Where is the girl , educated in wealth and refinement , who does not build her nuptial palace in the very bosom of the clouds ? Ern . Ernest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air , instead of on dry ground ? Am I to consume my days in eternal celibacy , because young ladies are romantic and perverse ? Vic . Victor Ernest , farewell ! Ern . Ernest Devereux Are you angry , Victor ? Vic . Victor No ,  --  but deeply pained , Ernest ! I can no longer hear you treat with this affectation of contempt , the noblest sentiments of the heart ! Farewell ! Hark ! Some one comes this way ! Ern . Ernest Devereux They are looking for me  --  it is high time ! Two words more  --  you asked me why I married . It is my supreme effort , Victor , my forlorn hope ! Marriage appeared to me as a last means of regeneration . I imagined that a fresh baptism of life and the contact of a young and innocent heart , would rekindle my blood , and renew my soul ! Vic . Victor Well ? Ern . Ernest Devereux Well , Louise is a good girl , and is worthy of love  --  but she has not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past of an idler , a debauchee , and a disbeliever :  --  so far from it , she revives my most odious souvenirs ,  --  her gestures , her features , her familiar language , remind me of  --  ah ! I dare not say whom !  --  In short , to me , she is but the cold copy of a dozen who have gone before her !  --  Vic . Victor Say no more ! Adieu ! I hardly know which of you is the most to be pitied ! Ern . Ernest Devereux I am , Victor ! These infamies are a closed book to Louise ,  --  and she can not torment herself with what she knows not of ! Vic . Victor Promise to write me the sequel of this  --  for I love you , notwithstanding ! Ern . Ernest Devereux Thank you , Victor ? I will write to you , certainly : but there will be no sequel ! I shall expect you in two months , at the farthest :  --  good night ! Vic . Victor Brother , good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Victor into chateau  --  Ernest paces up and down  --  Louise goes up , and comes down , as from the house . Louise . Louise Devereux Ernest ! Ern . Ernest Devereux Louise ! you here ! why how pale you are ! Louise . Louise Devereux A mere trifle  --  it will pass off ! Ern . Ernest Devereux You are agitated , Louise ! not afraid , I trust ? why it is I who should be afraid ! your youth and beauty may well disturb  --  intimidate even ! I shall be jealous of you , child ! Louise . Louise Devereux Indeed . Ern . Ernest Devereux You are my wife before heaven and earth , Louise ! but in your own heart , am I your husband ? do you love me ? Louise . Louise Devereux And you , sir ? do you love me ? Ern . Ernest Devereux To assume your chains requires but an instant , while it would take a life-time to break them ? Louise . Louise Devereux You mean by this poetic phrase , that you love me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I do love you , and more than I had imagined possible ! Smiles . Louise . Louise Devereux But why that smile ? Can you not say so seriously ? Ern . Ernest Devereux Seriously and tenderly , most coquettish of wives , I love you ! Louise . Louise Devereux Very good :  --  You are at least polite , if you are not sincere ! I merely wished to see with what face a man can prevaricate ! Release my hand sir !  --  Ah , your mask is falling !  --  I never saw you wear that countenance before ! Ern . Ernest Devereux Violently . Are you mad , madame ? Louise . Louise Devereux No , Ernest ,  --  I am perfectly sane , and I hope you will be no less so !  --  I overheard , by accident , your conversation with your brother . I did not seek , nor desire , believe me , the sad intelligence that your words conveyed !  --  But still I can not refuse to be guided by the light thus unwittingly obtained , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself , if after such a revelation , I still adhered to the vows of submission I made you in my ignorance ! Ern . Ernest Devereux After walking agitatedly . Speak !  --  What are your plans ? Louise . Louise Devereux I have little knowledge of the law ,  --  but would like to know whether there is not some means of sundering , without dishonor , ties as slight as ours ? Ern . Ernest Devereux Impossible ! The least step in that direction would occasion irreparable scandal ! Louise . Louise Devereux And yet this marriage is a mockery . Ern . Ernest Devereux Who has filled your head with these ideas ?  --  and who has put these unintelligible words upon your lips ? Louise . Louise Devereux Ernest , you have not , I think , fully understood my character , and you place too low an estimate upon my capacity ! Do you suppose that your interview with Victor was beyond the intelligence of a woman of my age ? You seem astonished at my language !  --  why , what strange opinions you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you would disdainfully dismiss to their dolls and samplars , there is not one , who could not speak to you as I speak ,  --  if she dared ,  --  or could not suffer , as I suffer ,  --  if Heaven so decreed ! Ern . Ernest Devereux More kindly . Louise ! listen to reason . You exaggerate , at your age all do . Suppose that in this unlucky conversation , that you have innocently overheard , I myself exaggerated nothing , do you consider yourself the victim of an exceptional and monstrous misfortune ? If you do , your education has been neglected . In our condition of life , a married couple consists , nine times out of ten , of a girl full of romance and illusion , and of a man who has no romance or illusion left ; and this is even considered an advantage , and the experience and maturity of the husband is looked upon as a sort of necessary counterpoise to the dreams and miscalculations of the wife . Society is thus constituted , and you can not change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : as far as I am concerned I will change it ! Ern . Ernest Devereux You might be better employed , madame !  --  Every young woman has had , like you , her dreams , and the reality , at first , shocks her as it has you ,  --  but she resigns herself , at last , to being an amiable wife and a good mother , and I have yet to learn that she has been accursed or dishonored for it ! Louise . Louise Devereux With concentration . But do they possess the secret which I possess ,  --  do all overhear what I have overheard ? No ! They are deceived , as I was ! I must believe , since you tell me so , that all husband 's bring their wives this dowry , but their wives do not know it ! and there 's their excuse ! Great Heaven ! What a craven creature would she be , who , knowing as I know , to what decrepitude she has enchained her youth , would accept from this impious union , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Devereux Louise , Louise , you drive me to despair ! Louise . Louise Devereux Am I to believe , sir , that we were meant only for subalterns , whose instincts , faculties , and passions are to be subject to your despotic caprice ? Has woman a soul ? Am I a human being ? What sir , because it pleased you to cast a favorable eye upon my person , or rather upon my estate , am I suddenly to forget my dearest hopes ,  --  to command my brain to stop thinking , and my heart to cease beating ! You ask me to share your lassitude  --  I who have never traveled ,  --  and to partake of your death , I who have never lived ! Is it just ?  --  Is it decent ?  --  Is it possible ?  --  Come , sir !  --  I call upon your honesty for a reply ! Ern . Ernest Devereux My honesty ! my honesty , Madame , will make a reply which has become trite by dint of being true ; that life is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you were younger , sir , and heard this truism , did you believe it ? did you take upon trust this heartless maxim ? oh , no ! you sought for your romance  --  and you have had it ! It was not a happy one  --  be it so ! and at present , mine promises as little . But , at any rate , I will never consent to see my romance , a dream though it was , dragged down to the level of your romance , realized to satiety as you have admitted it to be . Ern . Ernest Devereux Explain yourself , Louise . What is your purpose ? Louise . Louise Devereux As we can not separate , then , without incurring scandal and disgrace , let us in the eyes of the world , remain united . But now that you know me better , I hope you will believe me when I say that I shall henceforth be a stranger to you ! I rely upon your honor , as well as upon your pride , to spare me any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Devereux You shall be scrupuously obeyed , Madame . Still , is it necessary , for the repose of your conscience , that our two lives be not only distinct , but hostile ? As we are to be fellow travelers , may we not bestow upon each other those reciprocal attentions , which so enhance the charm of a journey ? Louise . Louise Devereux Oh , with all my heart ? Ern . Ernest Devereux May we not be friends , even ? good friends ? you smile ! heaven be praised ! Will you give me your hand in witness of the compact ? that 's well ! and if one day your ideas undergo one of those changes of which there are so many instances ,  --  you will find in me , Louise , a man that bears no malice ! Louise . Louise Devereux We shall see , we shall see . But I must have my romance first . It is getting late , sir , and I am very tired . Ern . Ernest Devereux Enough , madame , enough . I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complain , either of my temper or my presence . Pleasant dreams to you , and a conscience void of all reproach . Farewell . Aside . Damnation , what a wedding night ! Exit into chateau . Enter Griselda  --  Louise falls upon her neck sobbing . Gris . Griselda Poor sister ! I said it before , and say it again  --  marriage is a rascally invention !

Enter Lafleche , L. H. Lafl . Lafleche Here I am , sir . Are all my limbs in their places ? Have I killed anybody , or has anybody killed me ? Caval . Count Cavalcanti That 's what it is to have such a romantic nature  --  I can not exist without adventure . I am Don Juan , Rochester , and Richelieu combined  --  three single gentlemen rolled into one . Lafl . Lafleche And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the poor girl spoke of marriage , I stood transfixed . She screamed ; the father and brothers entered , with pitchforks and flails . It was then that I jumped out of the window . And where were you all this time ? Lafl . Lafleche I was at the feet of the chambermaid , when suddenly I receive a blow behind which wounded my  --  pride . Caval . Count Cavalcanti You are fortunate if it wounded nothing more sensitive . Lafl . Lafleche I saw that all was discovered , and again had cause to bless the man who first invented flight . Who have we here ? Enter Marietta , L. H. Caval . Count Cavalcanti To whom does yonder chateau belong , my dear ? Mar . Marietta To Madame Devereux , sir , in part . Caval . Count Cavalcanti A dowager of seventy , doubtless ? Mar . Marietta A bride of nineteen , sir  --  she was married but three weeks ago . Caval . Count Cavalcanti I did intend to ask her hospitality till we can obtain fresh horses , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mar .

When I am by she is said to be much prettier than when she is alone . Lafl . Lafleche It must be reflection , most amiable foil . Caval . Count Cavalcanti The effect of contagion , most appetizing contrast . You are not afraid of contagion ? Offers to kiss her . Mar . Marietta Yes , but I am , though . Lafl . Lafleche No , she is not . Kisses her . Caval . Count Cavalcanti Well , dear , go on , and lay our request at your mistress 's feet . Mar .

Count Cavalcanti Naturally enough . No sooner has a woman got a lover than she is mad to make him her husband . She is like a snuffy botanist , who snips up flowers blooming in the sun , to make dry and withered curiosities of them in a museum . Lafl . Lafleche Honor and virtue compel her to do so . Caval . Count Cavalcanti I know it ! and that 's the worst of it . Follow the argument , Lafleche . I adore the sex ; I make a public profession of my adoration , and therefore , as I am notoriously a bachelor , women are sure to seize upon that frivolous pretext to convert me into the snuffy curiosity aforesaid . Do you follow the argument ? This elder sister now , how old did that girl say she was ? Lafl . Lafleche Nineteen and five make twenty-four . Caval . Count Cavalcanti Twenty-four ! Sweet age ! Saccharine moment of life ! Now , were I to squeeze her waist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think I wanted to marry her ! What can I do ? Lafl . Lafleche Say you 're already married . Caval . Count Cavalcanti No , a married man labors under a whirlwind of disadvantages . I have it . I will give myself out as a Knight of Malta , as every body knows that the rules of the order enforce celibacy . A Knight of Malta ,  --  Yes ! It will be as if I wore a notice upon my hat , thus : " No marrying done here ! " Lafl . Lafleche I will be a lay brother of the same order ! But our ambassadress must have delivered our message , sir . Caval . Count Cavalcanti Very well ; follow me , Lafleche . I never was so easy in my conscience before ! what a blessing it is to be a Knight of Malta ! Exit , R. H. Lafl .

Griselda Three weeks married , and the wife not visited the husband in his den ! Louise . Louise Devereux Dear me ! how dusty everything is ! Ah ! he needs a woman to look after him ! Gris . Griselda Come , Louise , we 're alone  --  let us read the letter . I saw the handwriting  --  I know it 's from Victor . Louise . Louise Devereux Taking a letter from her pocket .

The morning after our wedding , my wife and I met upon the grand staircase . We descended to the parlor , arm-in-arm . Everybody looked mysterious , and our maiden aunt winked . After breakfast we took a ride through the village , during which my wife never made the slightest allusion to the singularity of our position . She never alludes to it ; nor does her manner intimate that she even remembers it . Then she showed me the chateau and the stables , and presented me to her wonderful saddle-horse Darius . Tell me , if you can , Victor , what species of woman I have taken for my wife . "  --  Oh ! here 's the conclusion .  --  " One thing is certain , she loves me .

Marietta Yes , madame ; and so handsome ! and he 's got such an engaging valet ! Gris . Griselda We can not refuse , Louise , of course ; and as we have no gentleman protector  --  your husband , my dear , not being of the least assistance  --  I 'll even send for that stupid old intendant , Mudwit .

She 's struck ; I thought this color would do it . Gris . Griselda Why , the last time I saw you it was jet black . Mud . Mudwit Aside . She notices the change .

You shall be the General Count Chateaufort , my husband , whom rumor declared was killed in the Crimea , a year ago . Now , as a married woman , I 've a right to coquet with this young man as much as I please , and he can not accuse me of the consequences . Mr. Mudwit , mind and assent to all I say . Mud .

Griselda I did not know that bachelors had any virtues  --  a natural reason , perhaps , for their pursuit of virtue in other people . Caval . Count Cavalcanti General , you seem dim  --  are you unwell ? Gris . Griselda Excuse him , sir , pray . The unexampled suffering he underwent in the Crimea has rendered him taciturn . Mud . Mudwit Taciturn . Gris . Griselda He distinguished himself in a violent skirmish . Hacked to pieces by the enemy , he was discovered at last beneath an artillery cart , whither he had crawled to die . A loaded gun was by his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was proved by the musket , which was found to contain eleven ball cartridges . Mud . Mudwit Cartridges . Gris .

Griselda He returned late one night , in the dress of a Canterbury pilgrim . Mud . Mudwit Pilgrim . Caval . Count Cavalcanti Aside . Why , it 's an echo disguised as a man ! Aloud . General , accept my sympathy ! Countess , if you will permit me , I will stroll over your park . It seems to me a very Eden ! Gris . Griselda Unless I act as your guide , you will lose yourself . So I will go with you . Mud . Mudwit I will accompany you and the Count , dearest , in your excursion . Gris . Griselda Oh , no ! it is not necessary , husband !  --  The Count will excuse you , I am sure ! Caval . Count Cavalcanti With ecstacy , general .

Count , your arm . You need not follow us , husband . Remember ! Exeunt Griselda and Cavalcanti , through doors at back . Mud . Mudwit I am their go-between . I am a supernumerary on a minute salary . This pretentious stranger must have conceived a ridiculous idea of me . But then she has introduced me as her husband , and a husband has privileges which I will abuse . It is hardly professional , but the attenuating circumstances are considerable , not to say more . I 'll stick to them like a leech . I 'll haunt her like her shadow . I 'll take advantage of every moment to indulge in uxorious caresses and marital endearments , which of course , she can not repudiate . It will be shabby , precious shabby , not to say dammed indelicate , but I 'll do it . Exit through doors at back . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joke which lasts three weeks should be a good one , which this is not . What has come , may I ask , of Louise 's magnificent demonstration the other night  --  a scene of reproach , tears and defiance  --  all ending in nothing . My wife is as placid as a saint on a pedestal or a cherub in heaven . She puzzles me beyond conception , and of the two , is by far the most composed . She seems to have found marriage , as she and I practise it , the very summit and acme of human felicity . Yesterday , now , she compelled me to listen to a course of farm-yard instruction that lasted the day out . I had to pass in review every beast on the estate ; horned cattle , sheep , pigs , fowls , Durhams , Bantams , half-breeds , hybrids , guinea-pigs , and a whole state fair of them besides . What was the consequence ? Last night , I dreamed I was Noah 's Ark , receiving into my swollen sides select specimens of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Then came two human specimens , intended to transmit their type to the latest posterity ! I looked at them :  --  Great Heaven ! I knew them !  --  myself and wife !  --  Just then I awoke ! Louise .

I 'll call another day . Ern . Ernest Devereux Stay ! Come in , madame . Louise . Louise Devereux Wait a few moments . I 'll be back directly . Exit . Ern . Ernest Devereux What on earth can she want ? This is the first time since our marriage that she has sought me in my room . The incident positively agitates me . After all , if Louise wants a hero for her romance , she ca n't do better than to take me , for I am the best dressed man in the country round about . Hist ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large armful of papers and account books  --  she puts them on the table . Louise . Louise Devereux Pah ! how dirty they are ! I should think grandpa had never dusted them once ! Ern . Ernest Devereux And pray what are these musty relics ? your complete works in the original mauscript ? Louise . Louise Devereux No sir . They are all the papers relating to our estate , and the two mills . I wish you would put them a little in order . Ern . Ernest Devereux Excuse me , my dear , but if the tenants pay , and the mills turn , they seem to me in the best possible order . Louise . Louise Devereux They do n't seem so to me , and as you married me for my fortune , it can not be unreasonable to ask you to assume the control of it . Ern .

Are there any books here selected for a gentleman 's light reading ? No ; ledgers , journals , vouchers , blotters , and an old almanac , pah ! Louise . Louise Devereux Well , sir , I 'll leave you to your studies , and take a ride on Darius over the farm . Ern . Ernest Devereux I 'll go with you . Louise . Louise Devereux I prefer to go alone . Good morning . Aside . And now my romance is begun ! Exit R. H. Ern . Ernest Devereux What an infernal glance of satisfaction gleamed in her eyes as she left the room !

So much profit , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Throws book aside  --  takes another .

Hark ! I thought I heard Louise 's horse .  --  What 's this red line , starting here in the Northeast , and careering in this extraordinary manner to the Southwest ? Oh ! I 'm to be an accountant , am I , and a farmer , and an ornamental gardener , perhaps , and have my name put into the country papers as godfather to a mammoth gooseberry ? Who knows but that I may be so lucky as to have a three-legged calf ? Curse the whole business , I 'll have nothing to do with it . There goes Darius ! I 'll take Cyrus and be after him .

Count Cavalcanti The emblem of conquest . Though I can not paint your portrait , madame , I will paint you mine . Properly speaking , I have no face , but only phases , like the moon . During the rainy season , I could plunge my fatherland into conflagration and civil war , but the blue canopy of the skies attunes my soul to tenderness , and I could open my heart to the five races of men !

Griselda What have I done to him that he should behave as he does ? He treats me like a servant before this young man , and has done so for a fortnight . Mar . Marietta That 's easy enough to explain ; he loves you , madame , and is jealous of Count Cavalcanti . Gris . Griselda What ! Mudwit ? Ah , dear me ! one can not have an intendant , it seems , now-a-days . I wonder if there is any truth in this business of the Order of Malta ? I have never thought to look ; Marietta , give me one of those large red books  --  the letter M  --  looking  --  M  --  Mal  --  Malta  --  Knight of Malta . Reading to herself , and then closing book . Yes  --  it 's quite serious ; they ca n't marry . Mar . Marietta What ! Oh ! Crying . Lafleche told me it was only a banter  --  and I believed him .

Let me forever dry your source of tears . Gris . Griselda No , let them flow ; they are tears of joy . Cavalcanti falls at her feet .

Griselda There are certain formalities to be attended to first , sir : You must write to your father , and I must ask the consent of my grandfather .

Exit at back followed by Lafleche and Marietta  --  the latter brandishing her paper . Gris . Griselda Well , this is a foolish adventure , happily over ! How could I have been so deceived , for I thought I liked him ? Enter Mudwit , with a gray wig . Mud . Mudwit It was a good thought of mine , to wear a gray wig . Colors have a meaning , if people only understood the language of the prism . What does gray mean ? It means experience , ripeness , discretion . What does the black hair of Cavalcadando mean ? It means youth , folly , and inconstancy ; it means that he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ besides , he 's a Knight of Malta . Bless me , here she is ! Griselda , dear ! Gris . Griselda Mr. Mudwit , I have told Count Cavalcanti that you are not my husband . There is no longer any occasion , therefore , for this ridiculous masquerade . Mud . Mudwit Aside . She 's sorry it is only a masquerade ! She wishes it were real . Aloud . Sweet Griselda ! lift your eyes for a moment upon the silvery locks which surmount this ample brow ! Gris . Griselda Ah ! It 's a gray wig , to-day , is it ? Mud . Mudwit Gray , madame , is typical of the ravages you have wrought in this brain ,  --  of the havoc you have left in this heart ! Gray is the color of sober middle age : it is a sort of human russet that the skull of man assumes in the autumn of his life ! I am ripe , Griselda ; Cavalcado is but a raw , unseasoned youth ! But though I am ripe , Griselda , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the gentle powers which  --  Gris . Griselda Mr. Mudwit , I have borne with your absurdities long enough !

Mudwit One thing is certain , gray is n't her favorite color ; and there 's only one left that I have n't tried !  --  the color of blaze and conflagration ! I 'll have a red wig ! I 'll wrap my caput in incendiary flames , if I have to be hung for arson ! I 'll be the modern Salamander , and ignite the neighborhood with the fierce radiance of my cranium ! The fountain shall sizzle at my approach , and the cistern emit vapor as I pass ! I 'll be red hot and carbonize creation ! If Griselda does n't melt then , it 's because there 's no melt in her !

It beats billiards ! There 's your true billiard cue ! Showing the pitchfork . Darius now , knows which is my hay , for he 'll touch no other . I wish that late wheat I sowed would come up . It 's been under ground long enough , one would think . I believe wheat wo n't come up for a gentleman , and only grows for farmers . However , I 've got a boy to watch , and come and tell me the moment it 's up . Ah ! this is a great life ! I work like a Trojan ; I eat like a coal-heaver and I sleep like a top . If I were but reconciled to Louise , I believe I should be the happiest man in the canton ! Takes a white kid glove from his pocket .

I wish Victor would answer the letter in which I told him I wanted to make a frank confession to Louise . I 'll do it , if he but give me encouragement . She 's 19 years old today , and I might honestly own up at her rustic ball to-night . Hallo ! here she comes ! and a letter in her hand ! She seems quite tickled with it too . I wonder who it 's from . Retiring up . Enter Louise , with a letter . Louise . Louise Devereux Reading aside . " My pride has fled ; heaven has humbled it by giving me a child for a guide . I love her ! I love her ! " She presses the letter to her bosom . Ern . Ernest Devereux Hey day ! what 's this ? Louise . Louise Devereux Reading . " The truth must out ! I collect relics and souvenirs ! I live upon flowers that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I am her secret and fervent disciple , and when my lips aspire to what her hand has pressed , I almost feel that I am outraging with sacrilegious thought , the hallowed purity of my vestal wife !

Perhaps he received the encouragement he wanted by the same mail . Aloud . Good afternoon , Ernest ! Ern . Ernest Devereux Aside . Tears in her eyes , emotion in her voice , and the letter in her bosom ! A malediction on the hand that wrote it ! Louise . Louise Devereux Aside . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aside .

Louise Devereux Yes , I heard from him to-day . Ern . Ernest Devereux Much relieved . Ah ! You had a letter from him just now ! Louise . Louise Devereux No , but I met Mr. Bernard at the village , this morning , and he told me that he had seen grandpa last week , and that he looked younger than ever . Aside . Why does he talk about grandpa , I wonder ! Ern . Ernest Devereux Aside . Rot grandpa ! Aloud . I have sometimes thought , Louise , that you must miss the young friends that you knew before our marriage . Do n't you think you 'd better renew intercourse with them by correspondence ? How pleasant it would be to receive a letter from a schoolmate !  --  Perhaps you have already done so ? Louise . Louise Devereux No . I have no acquaintances but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have received no letter . Ern . Ernest Devereux Aside . A lie , now , to complete the infamy ! Enter Marietta , hastily . Mar . Marietta He 's come , madame . Louise . Louise Devereux Hush ! They whisper . Why , then , I must interrupt Ernest 's full and frank confession before he has even begun it . Good bye , Ernest ; there will be company to dinner . Exeunt Louise and Marietta . Ern . Ernest Devereux Company to dinner ! as if I cared for company or dinner either . My wife has a lover , that 's clear . Whoever he is , he is absent , as is evident from the letters he writes . That accounts for her contentment and placidity  --  she was enjoying the zest of a forbidbidden intrigue . I would as soon allow my wife a passion as an idyl ; a fancy as a paramour  --  the treachery is the same . Mudwit crosses the stage without . Mr. Mudwit , come here . Enter Mudwit . Can you tell me , sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or at the time of , her marriage with me ? Mud . Mudwit She used to have dealings , by letter , with the butcher , the miller , and the agent of the Liquid Manure Company . Ern . Ernest Devereux Tush , sir ; that 's not what I ask  --  I wish to know if , among her acquaintances , as a girl , there were any who would be likely to continue their intimacy with her as a wife ? Mud . Mudwit I know of none  --  except , perhaps , her grandfather . Ern . Ernest Devereux Mr. Mudwit , my wife receives letters , which I have reason to think are such that she can not show them to her husband . Have you any idea who they can be from ? Mud . Mudwit Reflects . Perhaps from Count Cavalcanti  --  he is absent at intervals . Aside . Perhaps he 'll get his nose pulled now . Ern . Ernest Devereux Pshaw ! sir . He is in love with my sister-in-law ; I thought you knew that . Mud . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But then the Count has been a great traveler , sir . He has visited Constantinople , where they have a plurality of wives , and has been among the Mormons at Salt River , where one man thinks himself equal to half-a-dozen women , at least ! He was intimately acquainted with Brigham Young . Who knows what polygamian notions he may not have brought back ? Aside . I hope it is Louise , and not Griselda , he 's in love with . Ern . Ernest Devereux I might have known I should be no wiser for consulting this addle-pate . Mud . Mudwit Looking off . Sir ! sir ! look here ! Ern . Ernest Devereux A man cloaked to the eyes , and entering by Louise 's private door ! And under the guidance of Marietta ! And it was Marietta that came to summon her under my very nose . Well , I 'm glad of it . Weak and vacillating as I have been in presence of doubt and uncertainty , I hope the fact and the evidence will find me resolute and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step too far ! Conscience and generosity are dead within me , and we must meet  --  husband , wife , and lover  --  face to face ! Exit , at back . Mud . Mudwit Calling after him . It 's Count Cavalcanti , sir . He 's gummy in the knees , and I know his walk . He 'll get something else pulled besides his nose , I 'll be sworn ! I 'll go and tell Griselda the news . But stay ! Taking off his gray wig . This thing was an unmitigated flam ; I 'll try my last . Draws a tremendous red wig from his pocket , puts it on , and rubsh is hands through it . Ah , ha ! I rather think that this will do . Would that it were but dyed in Cavalcanti 's blood ! And now to melt Griselda . I am the torrid zone ; Griselda must simmer now , not to say swelter . Exit , at back .

Enter Louise and Victor  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you see , my dear sister  --  I wo n't call you sister-in-law  --  as I saw from my brother 's last letter , that the finale of your little drama was approaching , I thought I would come and help you through with it . Louise . Louise Devereux I 'm glad you 've come ; poor Ernest is in a terrible state ; he 's jealous at last ; and I do n't think he would be jealous of me , unless he loved me , do you ? Vic . Victor No ; unless , instead of the lover 's agonizing fears , his jealousy were merely the husband 's offended pride . But I do n't think that 's likely . Louise . Louise Devereux It 's well it is so ; for it is not easy to play a part for six long weeks , and live on in a false position from month to month . I 'm nineteen years old to-day , Victor ; try and reconcile us to-night , wo n't you ? Vic . Victor Ah ! then it 's your birth-day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noticed in the village  --  the peasants in their holiday costumes , a sort of May-pole on the green , and a general festive aspect all around . I saw , too , a blind fiddler coming towards the chateau . Louise . Louise Devereux Yes , we 're to have a ball in our big barn ; I am going there now , to see that all is ready . You shall hide in the hay and watch the finale of my little drama , as you call it . I 've come prepared ; you 'll not have long to wait . Come ! Vic . Victor Let us hope for the best . Good luck attend you . Exeunt , R. H. Enter Ernest , L. H. Ern . Ernest Devereux She had fled before I reached the chamber ; but I have tracked them thus far , and they must be near by .

When I asked Madame Devereux what I should give the villagers for supper , she said in her sweet voice : " Give them the best you have , Robert , and plenty of it . " When I asked Mr. Ernest the same question , he said , with a scowl : " A barrel of sour wine , and be damned to you . " Mar . Marietta That 's the difference between master and missis . I do n't think much of your fundamental culinary principle  --  a good digestion . Come , you must be rested , now , and madame went an hour ago . Cook picks up his basket . But what 's the use of a good digestion , if you 've got a bad heart ? Oh ! that deceitful Lafleche ! Cook . Cook Never mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mar . Marietta Slapping his face . Aha ! just you try that again , that 's all ! Exeunt , R. H. SCENE III .  --  A barn , decorated and illuminated , cleared for a dance ; folding doors at back , closed ; heap of straw in one corner ; sacks of corn at back . Enter Louise and Victor . Louise . Louise Devereux Here we are , and everything seems in order . Mind , Victor , you are not to be discovered here ; you must hide if you hear anybody coming . Hark ! They listen . I hear footsteps ! It may be he . Hide ; quick ! Victor conceals himself behind the sacks of corn . Enter Ernest , suddenly . Ern . Ernest Devereux Aside . Alone ! To Louise . You did not expect me , madame . Louise . Louise Devereux I did not ; but what means this sudden intrusion ? It is not your way to be discourteous to a woman ! Ern . Ernest Devereux Have no fears for yourself . Louise . Louise Devereux @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Are you sure of that ? Louise . Louise Devereux You say so , yourself ; besides , I have your solemn promise . Ern . Ernest Devereux But have you not forgotten the conditions of that promise ? Louise . Louise Devereux I do not think I have . Ern . Ernest Devereux Listen , madame . I promised you your liberty and my own indifference ; but you already bore my name  --  a name , madame , which no woman ever yet disgraced with impunity . Suppose I were to exact an account of your guardianship of my honor , would you dare reply ? Louise . Louise Devereux Yes , Ernest . Ern . Ernest Devereux Well , then , speak . The dreams that you reproached me for not encouraging , you have dreamed them with another . You have experienced the emotions of a romantic love , and you have dwelt at last in a castle in the clouds . Louise . Louise Devereux Oh , yes ! Listen , Ernest ; I will confess all . Step by step I have followed the path @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have found , and accompanied on their way , the sweet realities which you declared to be but phantoms ! Oh ! I have known what intoxication there is in tears ,  --  what mortal anguish may exist in a word ,  --  what infinite hope may be kindled by a glance ! I have known the luxury of love ,  --  for I have loved and been beloved ! Ern . Ernest Devereux I listen , madame ; and you will do justice to my forbearance , I trust ! Your excuse is in the aberration of your mind , and the violence of your language . You have found the romance you sought . Very well . Madame , you have received letters unknown to me ,  --  love letters ! I have seen you kiss them , and press them to your bosom . Give me those letters ! Louise . Louise Devereux But consider , Ernest , what my married life has been  --  Ern . Ernest Devereux Give me those letters ! Louise . Louise Devereux I confess it . I have received letters ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Devereux Confess , madame , that he who wrote them was a heartless , designing villain ! Louise . Louise Devereux Oh ! I 'll confess that ! Ern . Ernest Devereux Some rascal , doubtless , who has a wife of his own ! Louise . Louise Devereux He has . But , Ernest , spare him ; my life is bound up in his . I love him tenderly , devotedly , eternally ! Ern . Ernest Devereux Enough of this ! I am beside myself ! Give me the letters ! Louise . Louise Devereux Drawing from her pocket a number of letters , stitched together in book form . Here they are , Ernest ; kill me now , if you can ! Falls upon her knees . Ern . Ernest Devereux Reading from the cover of the letters . " Romance after Marriage ; or , The Maiden Wife . A Novel , in Twenty Chapters By Ernest Devereux . " Louise . Louise Devereux Interrupting . No , here 's the twentieth ! Drawing letter from her bosom . Ern . Ernest Devereux My letters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I have been ! Drops upon his knees . Louise , can you , can you forgive me ? They embrace . Vic . Victor Rising behind the sacks of wheat , and extending his arms in benediction . Bless you , my children ! Ern . Ernest Devereux Rising . Ah ! Victor ! Falls upon his neck . Vic . Victor I sent your letters back , Ernest . Do you forgive me my apparent treachery ? Ern . Ernest Devereux Ah ! Victor , you and Louise are of the saints of earth . Enter Griselda , hastily . Gris . Griselda Bless me ! So it 's settled at last ? Louise . Louise Devereux Come in this corner , Ernest , where Griselda can not hear . Gris . Griselda You here , Victor ! But I have no time to talk to you now . That horrid Knight of Malta , whom I dismissed to-day , has just come back , and I ran here for refuge . I do n't want to see him . Enter Marietta . Mar . Marietta Madame , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought them here . Enter Cavalcanti and Lafleche . Caval . Count Cavalcanti To Griselda . Madame , deign to listen to the abject retraction of a repentant and contrite sinner . Gris . Griselda I wo n't listen to you , sir ! Aside . After all there is nothing very extravagant in his foot . Caval . Count Cavalcanti Aside . On second thoughts , I see nothing objectionable in her chin . Gris . Griselda Are you in earnest , Count ? Caval . Count Cavalcanti Oh ! put me to the test ! Gris . Griselda Looking at his boots . You wear sixes and a half , I believe ? Caval . Count Cavalcanti Fives and a quarter , madame . Gris . Griselda Well , then , I consent . Here is my hand . Caval . Count Cavalcanti With rapture . Countess , do you know what , at this moment , is your most beautiful feature ? Gris . Griselda My eyes . You 've told me so often ! Caval . Count Cavalcanti No , Countess , your chin ! Retire up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more ready for an eruption than I am ! I feel as if I could boil over , and spout lava for a century ! If Ned , the bull , were to see my hair , he 'd go stark mad , as he did the day the dairy maid wore a red flannel-petticoat ! But will not Griselda , now that she is relieved of that tedious Cavalcadido , listen with interest to my inflammable tale , and look with favor upon my rubicund head ? To doubt it would be to wrong her ! I 'll speak to her at once ! Turns and meets Griselda and Cavalcanti . Gris . Griselda I once presented Count Cavalcanti to you , Mr. Mudwit , asserting that you were my husband ; that time it was false ! I now present you to him , asserting that he is my husband ; this time it is true ! Mud . Mudwit Oh ! Griselda ! Oh , Count ! Do n't marry her ! I 've known her longer than you ! I love her more than whole squads of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ; it 's turned my hair to fire , and my brain to ashes ! Oh ! what shall I do ! I shall go as crazy as Bedlam ! I ca n't survive it ! I 'd commit self-destruction if I only knew of some easy means of death ! Shout within . Shout Hurrah for Madame Devereux ! Louise . Louise Devereux Coming down with Ernest . Well , as it is all happily settled , Ernest , let us invite our good people yonder to share our joy . Ern . Ernest Devereux Oh yes ; let 's have them in , by all means .

Madame , would n't you be good enough to make Mr. Lafleche keep his promises ? He is n't behaving at all right , madame , and if you would just tell him , madame , that though people can break promises when they only speak them , they ca n't get off so easily when they put them down on paper . Gris . Griselda Why , has he made you a promise on paper , child ? Mar . Marietta Yes , madame , here it is  --  in his own handwriting . Gris . Griselda Here , Mr. Mudwit , you are the legal gentleman of the party , read this formidable document . Mud . Mudwit Reads . " On demand , I promise to marry Marietta Blangy . Value received .

From what I gather from them of the charms of Romance before Marriage , and from what I know of the quiet ecstacy of that Romance which may sometimes follow and survive it , I feel that in taking my leave , I am uttering a beneficent wish , when invoking for all the women that hear me  --  whether maids or wives  --  Gris .
