txt A telegraphic dispatch from Detroit announces that the Michigan Greenbackers have changed the date of their convention to Feb. 28 . This is not a matter of - great importance , but it is a sign that the Greenbackers and the Democrats of Michigan propose a final fusion . On the first Monday in April , township officers will be chosen throughout the State , and a Justice of the Supreme Court and two Regents of the State University will be elected . The State ticket does not carry any great prizes , but all parties are desirous of securing control ? of township officers . For this reason , if for no other , the Greenbackers have evinced a desire to coalesce with the Democrats at any sacrifice . The majority of the Greenback or " National " Party in Michigan is made up by deserters from the Democracy . In other words , the Democratic Party in that State is split in twain , the soft-money wing being known as " the Nationals , " and the hardmoney wing retaining the name and traditions of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether the inflationists or the hard-money men shall manage the Democratic Party . . The course pursued ' by the Michigan Greenbackers admirably illustrates the lowest form of American politics . Bearing in mind the fact that the ? Greenback Party in Michigan is only an offshoot from the Democratic Party , and that a Union of these two factions is necessary to beat the Republicans , it is easy to see that the main question before the leaders of each organization is as to which shall appear to swallow the other . The Democrats called a convention to meet at Lansing , March 5 , by a vote in their Central Committee . Immediately , - ' the Greenbackers called a convention for March 4 . This was intended to mean that the Greenbackers , being first in the field , would take up a line of battle . The Democrats , coming later , must fall in with those who had preceded them , or run the riskI of being defeated . This was a challenge toi the Democracy . But the Democratic State Central Committee , being wise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their convention to Feb .. 28 , thus putting it so far before the Greenbackers ' date of assembling that the responsibility of indorsement would be thrown upon the , , " Nationals . " Now comes FIELD , the Greenback ' manager , and , rescinding the previous call which he had issued , he fixes the date of his party convention at Feb. 28 , and puts the place of assembling at Lansing . Thus the ? two conventions will meet on the same day and in the same city . FIELD 'S manceuvring was to get his convention at work before that of the hardmoney Democracy . Finding that lie has been thwarted by a change in the date of holding the Democratic convention , he compromises by accepting the same date . Nothing could more faithfully illustrate the meanness to which Democratic politics have sunk than this little episode . Practically , the issue of hard money and soft money has been taken out of politics . Sooner or later , the Democrats who left their party under the influence of the Greenback craze , must drift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to carry with them the few Republican 's whom they succeeded in seducing from the true faith . The leaders , such men as FIELD , of Michigan , want to keep up a show of party authority , in order to make terms with the managers of the party into whose embraces they will finally fall . A man like FIELD who has led a party , does not propose to be absorbed by another organization and be relegated to the unrecognized rank and file of the party which swallows him . He wants preferment of some sort , and he says , in substance , to the Democratic Party , " Let us be at one , but be sure and keep me in , the front rank , where I shall have as good a chance at the spoils of office as any of you . " This is all there is in the grotesque intrigue which has been going on in Michigan . In his address announcing the Change of his convention to Feb. 28 , FIELD " gives away " the whole case when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fusion , but in order to unite all good and true patriots " against Republican ruin and misrule . " This is the utterance of as arrant a demagogue and political adventurer as ever lived . The fact remains that the Democratic Party in Michigan has been divided , and that the Greenbackers , their occupation being gone , are anxious to coalesce with their hard-money brethren who have remained by the old organization . This must be accomplished , however , without any sacrifice of status by the Greenback leaders . They , at least , must be in a position to claim their share of possible spoils . If they swallow the Democrats , after organizing and waiting for results , they will keep up their name and be ready to demand their proportion of the offices . If they are swallowed by the Democrats , the hope of their gains is gone . Therefore , the Michigan canvass , like the recent contest in Maine , is a vulgar and sordid squabble for the spoils of office . There is neither principle nor party life involved in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with lively curiosity to see which of the two bands of schemers will outwit the other .
