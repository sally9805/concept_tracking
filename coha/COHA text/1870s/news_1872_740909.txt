txt Within a short distance of the splendid . depot of the Great Western Railway , at the West End of London . is a district known as Lisson Grove . Sixty years since it was an agreeable suburb , but it was long ago absorbed into the mass of brick and mortar , ' covered with mean houses , and made the home of thousands of the neediest and most miserable of the human race . In two mean rooms of a tenement-house in this district were living at the beginning of last month a journeyman shoe-maker , his wife , and several children . A native of Cornwall , Nicuoixs had migrated to that loadstone , the metropolis , in search of work , and , like so many who have done the same , been disappointed in obtaining the amount of employment he anticipated . He was an industrious and a sober man , had been married eighteen years . and was burdened with a large family . Some time since , his sister had been murdered in Australia , and . being of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a permanently depressing effect on Ins system . Of late his trials bad increased . A severe attack of rheumatism had disabled his right arm , and his children were down with measles . He became very desponding , and frequently expressed the fear that they were doomed to the workhouse . For some slight mistake he was discharged from his work , and this seemed to give the finish to his deep depression . His mind at length gave way , and in a paroxysm of frenzy and despair he destroyed four of his children , toward whom there was evidence that he had been a most tender parent , and then : put an end to himself . The deed was done while his wife had gone to earn what she could by doing a day 's washing . A child in the house saw blood trickling through the floor , and gave the alarm , when the horrible discovery was made . The evidence of the surviving children who appeared at the inquest was singularly pathetic . Though so young they gave a very lucid account of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committing the terrible act . One of them stated : " My lather , before he killed himself , used to work for Mr. DAVID Moan , shoe-maker , of Edgware road ; he could not get much work to do , and sometimes he was so ill when he did have it he could hardly do it all ; he had a pair to make on Saturday . and they were to have been rights and lefts ; my father made a mistake , and made them both for the right foot , and when he took them in on Saturday night they went on at him ; then my father told them that he would make them two lefts to match , but his master said he could n't be bothered with him in that way , and that my father was to take the lasts back , and all the materials that he had got , and that he should n't give him any more work ; then when be came home on Saturday night he told mother he did n't know whatever he should do . and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that he could get back again to Plymouth . where we could have a house again all to ourselves , like we used to have ; he said he did n't like us living and sleeping in those two little close rooms , where we could n't get any air , and now the master had took his work away we should be all starved ; my mother then told him to never mind , as we had n't been quite starved yet , and we should n't quite starve as long as she could go out and get a day 's washing ; and then she said be must n't be downhearted , as his master 's was n't the only place in the world , and she dared say that after a bit he would be able to get a bit of work somewhere ; they were talking in that way when we went to bed ; and then on Sunday , when my father got up , he was very ill , and said his head ached so bad he did n't know wbat to do ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with vinegar , and telling him to never mind , as we should get on all right after a bit ; he said he - would not care if be could get some work himself , but he could not bear the idea of metier having to go out to get work for all of IP be then told mother he thought he should make away with himself , and he was going on so bad on Sunday night that mother put his razor away , and we went to bed : I do n't know whether he went to the work-house to get some relief on Monday morning or not , but I think he went out for a little while ; I was out when he killed my brothers and sisters , and did not know anything of it till little JOEY MINNEAR camp and told me he saw blood under the door , and I fetcned my mother . " It would scarcely be possible to tell a more harrowing story than is here revealed . The deserving poor  --  those who are willing to work and can find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than any other class , and get less . The above affecting story is only another illustration of the terrible hardships which the industrious poor are called upon to endure in England . Will there never arise a statesman adequate to deal with this appalling evil ?
