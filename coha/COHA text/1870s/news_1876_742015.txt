txt The first and last ' of the following provisions of the State Constitution in relation to the contraction of debts were violated in the years 1870 and 1871 , when JOHN T. HOFFMAN was Governor of the State , both branches of the Legislature Democratic , SAMUEL J. TILDEN , Chairman of the Democratic State Committee , and WILLIAM M. TWEED in full control of the Democratic Party , both in this City and in the State : Sac . 10 . The State may , to meet casual deficits or failures in revenues , or for expenses not provided for , contract debts , but such debts , direct *and con. tingent , singly or in the aggregate , shall net at any time exceed s1,000,000 , and the moneys arising from the loans creating such debts shall be applied to the purpose for which they were obtained or to repay the debt so contracted , and to no other purpose whatever . sac . 11 . In addition to the above limited power to contract debts , the State may contract debts to repel invasion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the money arising from the contracting of such debts , shall be applied to the purpose for which it was raised or to repay such debts , and to no other purpose whatever . SEC. 12 . Except the debts specified in the tenth and eleventh sections of this article , no debt shall be hereafter contracted by or on behalf of this State , unless such debt shall be authorized by a law for some single work or object , to be distinctly specified therein ; and such law shall impose and provide fox the collection of a direct annual tax to pay , and sufdeient to pay the interest on such debt as it falls due , and also to pay and discharge the principal of such debt within eighteen years from the time of the contracting thereof . In violation of these plain mandates of the Constitution , the expenditures of the State were carried millions of dollars beyond the taxes levied ; the " general fund , " as it is called , was made to swallow up the sinking funds provided for in section @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that section in respect to the payment of the bounty debt were rendered impossible except by an enormous increase in the taxes . In November , 1871 , the effect of exposures made in this journal was that the Democrats were overwhelmingly defeated , although Mr. TILDEN still retained his Chairmanship of the State Committee . The Legislature met in January , 1872 , and passed a law for filling up the sinking funds by au issue of State bonds , provided the people should approve of that course . This law vt.ts a manifest evasion of the State Constitution , and was so pronounced by the Court of Appeals . In November , 1872 , JOHN A. Dix was elected Governor , and the Legislature was again Republican . That Legislature met in 1873 , and passed , and Gov . Dix approved , a law , by which the entire deficiency was made a part of the State tax of 1872 , the Court of Appeals having previously decided that the act of 1872 , leaving it to the people to decide whether to levy a tax or issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ average State taxation for the three years , 1872 , 1873 , and 1874 , during the last two of which Gen. Dix was Governor , and in all three the Legislature Republican , amounted to no less than $16,703,089 per year , of which about seven million dollars were to replace the money abstracted from the sinking funds while HOFFMAN was Governor , TILDEN Chairman of the State Committee , and the Tammany Ring in complete possession of the State Government . We make no claims in behalf of the Republican Legislatures of that period as reformers in the matter of " governmental expenditure . " We simply say that they filled up the sinking funds by levying taxes which Twiinals Legislatures would have levied had there been in those days any honesty in the Democratic Party or any respect for the Constitution of the State . The time has now come when the bounty and canal debts under section 12 are to be extinguished . At the last session of the Legislature it was found necessary to raise less than $800,000 for these debts , instead of from $4,250,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during which they have been running . Hereafter the entire $4,500,000 required on their account by the Constitution will be saved to the people , and the funded debt of New-York State will be less than nine million dollars , that being the remnant Unpaid of the canal debt . Gbv . Dix has the honor of having restored during his administration the seven millions which had been pillaged from the sinking funds by the Hoffman , Tweed , and Tilden Democracy . He it was who made it possible to extinguish the debts as the Constitution required . Gov . TILDEN has the distinction of having endeavored in a State paper to rob Gov . Dix of this honor , and to appropriate to himself the credit of the large reduction in taxes caused by the final payment of about forty millions of bonds . We know that politicians are cunning and unscrupulous , but is not this performance of Gov . TILDEN a little more unscrupulous than people are accustomed to , even in these degenerate times ' ?           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
