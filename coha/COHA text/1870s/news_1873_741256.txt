txt The stockholders of the Brooklyn Trust Company have determined to , make up the deficit in their capital caused . by fraud and mismanagement , and to invite the public to again place its money in the hands of their officers . This action has been taken with some flourish , and with an air of having offered convincing proof that the company is a sound and safe concern . But , as a matter of fact , however much virtue may have gone to the act , it was the only course open to the stockholders . The deficit they have concluded to make up voluntarily they would in any event have had to make up in the end . If they delayed or refused , they made themselves liable to expensive litigation , with only one result possible . Moreover , until the deficit was paid in , and depositors offered their money , there was no possibility of resuming business , and unless business can be resumed there is no way for the stockholders to get back the money that has been ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it . Plainly , the stockholders only obeyed the suggestions of their most obvious interest . We have no fault to find with the course the stockholders have undertaken to pursue . They were unquestionably- at liberty to make every legal effort to reimburse themselves for the losses that had been inflicted upon them . They are , doubtless , aware that they have a difficult task before them . Whether they will succeed depends very much more on the public than on themselves . We fear , too , that it depends more on the weakness of the memory of the public than upon anything else . If it can be forgotten under what circumstances this company fell into disgrace , the road will be tolerably clear . As long as that is borne in mind , the company will not find business plenty or profitable . Nor were the opinions expressed by some of the more active stockholders , at the recent meeting , calculated to make the future of the company any brighter . It will be remembered that the company fell into its present plight through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made on bonds that proved to be worthless ; second , by the appropriation of the money of the depositors by the President ; and third , by a loan  --  illegal , and in violation of the charter  --  made to the Secretary , or Cashier . These losses the directors did not prevent . When asked why , they say they could not , and Mr. S. B. CurTTENDEN , a stockholder , an experienced director in financial institutions , and a highlyreputable merchant , assents to this view . Directors , ho declares , " can not protect a bank or trust company when its president and secretary , or cashier , both combine to commit a wrong . " This is certainly not an attractive doctrine for those who are invited to put their money in the hands of this Trust Company . It shows only too plainly , what we pointed out with great regret when this disgraceful default was discovered , that the popular idea that reputable directors strengthen such institutions had very little support in fact . The people do trust directors . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subordinate officials , the people are victims of a misplaced confidence . There might as well be no directors . They seem to be in effect an illusion and . a snare . Their names induce the public to repose a confidence which would not be reposed in a pair of bank officers , but the bank officers are after all the only ones who can determine whether the trust ' shall be justified or betrayed . The situation would be ludicrous in its absurdity if it were not so painful in its consequences . Mr. CRITTENDEN was equally unfortunate in another of his suggestions . He announced that all of the stockholders considered the charter an " excellent one . " It might be answered that a charter never so excellent might prove a less effective protection to depositors than even the perfunctory Board of Directors , should the President and Secretary again choose to set it aside . But apart from this obvious consideration , it must be remarked , that the . charter is , in respect of one important matter , not at all an excellent one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directors authority to invest moneys received by them in trust " iu such real or personal security as thay deem proper . " If the Trust Company were merely a bank of deposit , we should not object to this free dom . But it is not merely such a bank . It is an institution expressly designed for the most ? delicate trusts , such as no ? bank of deposit is fit for . It is not merely a contrivance for its depositors ' convenience , which they use according to their own discretion , and at , their known risk . It is authorized to transact trust business both extensive and complicated , including especially the " administration and management of estates of women and minor heirs . Such an institution should be carefully guarded . It was a shameful negligence of tl4o Legislature which over put such great powers in the unchecked control of a dozen careless men . A charter that does this is not " excellent . " Under the circumstances , if the Brooklyn Trust Company can resume business successfully , it will afford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public as to the principles which Ahould govern institutions of this character .
