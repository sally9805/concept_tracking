txt Within a few weeks there has been a general investigation of the affairs of some of the banks iu this city , with what result is only partially known , for the Direetors in each instance were pledged to secrecy . The name of the Bridgeport City National Bank has been frequently mentioned in connection with a forgery estimated at from $28,000 to $80,000 . The matter was compromised in consequence of the high standing of the persons involved , and it is asserted that all proof of forgery has been destroyed . President Morgan will shed no light upon the subject , further than stating in the most positive terms that the bank has not lost a penny in consequence of any dealings with its customers . While he will not ad. mit that a forgery has been perpetrated , he will not deny it . Another transaction which , notwithstanding the groat secrecy maintained , has come to light , is an embezzlement in the Pequonnoek National Bank , in which Frank E. Bennett , the book-keeper , is prominent . Bennett is a young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own with the young men of ' wealth of the City . He began life in a minor position in the bank , and by his intelligence and business aptitude worked his way to the book-keeper 's desk , behind which he sat at the time that he was requested by the Directors to resign , a few weeks ego . Though not regarded by his acquaintances as an extravagant man , Bennett 's free use of money was commented upon as somewhat significant , for his salary was only $1,200a year , His livery bills alone ate up a large share of that amount in the course of a veer . He was a constant companion of William Burroughs , who was recently found to be a defaulter to the New-York and New-Haven Road , of which he was Treasurer . to the amount of nearly $40,000 . These circumstances drew the suspicions of the Directors to young Bennett , and President Hotchkiss began an investigation . It was carried on quietly , so that Bennett should mistrust nothing , and in the examination of his books , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found to be short $6,200 . How he had so skillfully balanced his books as to avoid discovery was a mystery . His pecnlations were found to extend over a series of years , and it is supposed that some of the money found its way into the New York stock market . The degree of concern manifested by bank Directors for the feelings of delin. quents in this City has been very considerable . It has become a common topic of conversation ; one of the old residents expressed this feeling in the words , " There has been a good deal of looseness in the management of Bridgeport banks ' affairs of late . " There was no exception made in Bennett 's case . His bondsman , Capt . Bertram , of Black Rock , had justified in $10,000 , and was known to be good for every penny of that amount . Bennett had come to be a regular visitor at the Bertram homestead , and finally became engaged to one of the daughters . The fact had much to do with his escape from prosecution , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whereby that gentleman made good to the bank the whole amount of the embezzled funds . The engagement was broken , and soon after Bennett left Bridgeport for Colorado , in the employment of a company which had made arrangements to establish a cattle ranch there .
