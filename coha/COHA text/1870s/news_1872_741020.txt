txt Mr. GREELEY 'S campaign speeches are the most remarkable productions which our political history has seen . Even the wanderings of ANDREW JOHNSON , and the records thereof by Mr. Petroleum V. Nasby , furnish nothing which , for sheer and obstinate folly , can equal this series of wayside babblings . Had Mr. GREELEY determined , before setting out on his journey , to justify every essential allegation in regard to the foolishness and waywardness of his mind . and its incapacity to deal with serious affairs in a practical manner , he could . hardly have made speeches different from those actually reported . It has been objected to Mr. GREELEY as a Presidential candidate that he was averse to comprehensive views . and likely to be carried away by notions of very inferior importance . Can any one deny this of a man who declares that he is , " above all things , the candidate of universal amnesty "  - -  f. e. , that he asks the country to elect him President , that he may do what he can to remove the disqualification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ original plotters of secession in each of the lately rebellious States ? His critics have declared that be was unjust to his opponents , and given to violent misrepresentation of their motives . Does not this find ample proof in the malignant attack made by Mr. GREELEY on the Soldiers ' Convention at Pittsburg. which he charged with endeavoring to stir up hatred , and treated generally iu a most offensive and even scurrilous tone ? Even Mr. GREELEY 'S admirers admit that he is sometimes blinded by partisan- zeal to well-established . historical facts . His opponents believe that this is carried by him to such an . extent that it would seriously impair his impartiality and independence as the Executive of the nation . Who can doubt that it would , after reading the gross misstatements of Mr. GREELEY concerning the temper of the portion of the South he now represents with reference to the conditions of reconstruction I He declares that the South surrendered their arms , abolished slavery , abandoned the rebel debt , relinquished all claims for slave property , gave the negro a vote , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fact , all these things were obtained from the South either by compulsion , as was the case with the surrenter of their arms , or by means of the negro vote co-operating with the Republican party of the North , as was the case with all the other matters mentioned . To all these measures the Southerners , who now support Mr. GREELEY as the forlorn hope of the lost cause , were bitterly and persistently apposed . Is a man capable of such wide variations from familiar truths the kind of man required for President of the United States f One of the very gravest causes of the universal distrust of Mr. GREELEY is that in financial and business matters he has the zeal of a theorist combined with a rooted ignoracce of the subject . Does not thisview of him exactly tally with the exhibition he made of himself before the Louisville Chamber of Commerce ? He there reiterated his notion that the Government ought to resume specie payments , without specie enough to pay with , and ought to part with all its gold to prevent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naked statement of these preposterous crotchets is enough to expose the character of the mind that could entertain them . But the one thing which makes reasonable and patriotic men fear to see Mr. GREELEY in power is , that in the trying period of our history he was unreservedly in favor of granting the right of secession . Could it be supposed . that , after this nation bad gone through what it has to bury that doctrine forever  --  to wipe every vestige of it out of American politics  --  a man could be found who , in the character of a Presidential candidate , would reannounce this position , and declare his present as well as his past adherence to it ? At Pittsburg he asserted that he would hove consented to lot the Southern States go , if , on a fair vote . they had decided to do so . and . he says that if a similar case were now presented he " would take the chances . " That Mr. GREELEY 'S mind was weak enough to admit this crazy and mischievous idea in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the American people ; but that , after all the lessons of the war . and after the exhaustive discussion of the force and scope of our Constitution , and the needs of the nation to which the war gave rise , he should now proclaim the same idea as a guide for judgment of his future course . is a piece of folly too glaring to need exposure . We speak that which any of Mr. GREELEY 'S friends can confirm by very limited observation when we say that these speeches have given rise to a very general impression that their author is forfeiting the few chances of election he ever had . The vices of his mind are incurable . He may be more consumed by ambition in this last desperate struggle for public honors . But even this is a difference of degree , not of kind . The same erratic , self-confident , narrow-minded politician he is now he has been for many years . That neither himself nor his friends could prevent his making this last display of his unfitness for the grave and delicate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ congratulation.
