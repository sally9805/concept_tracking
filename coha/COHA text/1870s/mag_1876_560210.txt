OLD WOMAN 'S GOSSIP . x . I CAN NOT remember any event or series of events the influence of which could , during my first stay in Edinburgh , have made a distinctly serious or religious impression on my mind , or have directed my thoughts especially towards the more solemn concerns and aspects of life . But from some cause or other my mind became much affected at this time by religious considerations , and a strong ( levotional element began to predominate among my emotions and cogitations . In my childhood in my father 's house we had no special religious training ; our habits were those of average English Protestants of decent respectability . My mother read the Bible to us in the morning before breakfast ; Mrs. Trimmer 's and Mrs. Barbauld 's Scripture histories and paraphrases were taught to us ; we learnt our catechism and collects , and went to church on Sunday , duly and decorously , as a matter of course . Grace was always said before and after meals by the youngest member of the family present , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when my father happened to be at home at our bedtime , we used to kneel down by his chair to receive , and with which he used to dismiss us for the night : " God bless you ! make you good , happy , healthy , and wise ! " These , with our own daily morning and evening prayers , were our devotional habits and pious practices . In Mrs. Harry Siddons 's house religion was never , I think , directly made a subject of inculcation or discussion ; the usual observances of Church of England people were regularly fulfilled by all her family , the spirit of true religion governed her life and all her home relations , but special , direct reference to religious subjects was infrequent among us . God 's service in that house took the daily and hourly form of the conscientious discharge of duty , unselfish , tender affec tion towards each other , and kindly Christian charity towards all . At various times in my life , when hearing discussions on the peculiar ( technical , I should be disposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very good people of a certain way of thinking to be the only indication of what they considered real religion , I have remembered the serene , courageous self-devotion of my dear friend , when , during a dangerous ( as it was at one time apprehended , fatal ) illness of her youngest daughter , she would leave her child 's bedside to go to the theatre and discharge duties never very attractive to her , and rendered distasteful then by cruel anxiety , but her neglect of which would have injured the interests of her brother , her fellow - actors , and all the poor people employed in the theatre , and been a direct infringement of her obligations to them . I have wondered what amount of religion a certain class of " professing Christians " would have allowed entered into that great effort . We attended habitually a small chapel served by the Rev. William Shannon , an excellent but not exciting preacher , who was a devoted friend of Mrs. Harry Siddons ; and occasionally we went to Dr. Allison 's church and heard him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his young assistant , Mr. Sinclair , whose eloquent and striking sermons , which impressed me much , were the only powerful direct appeals made to my religious sentiments at that time . I rather incline to think that I had what a most unclerical young clergyman of my acquaintance once assured me I had ( and which he certainly had not ) , a natural turn for religion . I think it not unlikely that a great deal of the direct religious teaching and influences of my Paris school-days was , as it were , coming up again to the surface of my mind , and occupying my thoughts with serious reflections upon the most important subjects . // The freedom I enjoyed gave scope and leisure to my character to develop and strengthen itself ; and to the combined healthful repose and activity of all my faculties , the absence of all excitement and irritation from external influences , the pure moral atmosphere and kindly affection by which I lived surrounded during this happy year , I attribute whatever perception of , desire for , or endeavor after goodness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and liberty of my life at this time , I think , what.ever was best in me had the most favorable chance of growth , and I have remained ever grateful to the wise forbearance of the gentle authority under which I lived , for the benefit as well as the enjoyment I derived from the time I passed in Edinburgh . I think that more harm is frequently done by over than by under culture in the moral training of youth . Judicious letting alone is a precious element in real education , and there are certain chords which , often touched and made to vibrate too early , are apt to lose instead of gaining power ; to grow first weakly and morbidly sensitive , and then hard and dull ; and finally , when the full harmony of the character depends upon their truth and depth of tone , to have lost some measure of both under repeated premature handling . I sometimes think that instead of beginning , as we do , with a whole heaven and earth embracing theory of duty to God and man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ method of dealing only with each particular instance of moral obligation empirically as it 0cc urs ; with each particular incident of life , detached , as it were , from the notion of a formal system , code , or theory of religious belief , until the recurrence of the same rules of morality under the same governing principle , invoked only in immediate application to some instance of conduct or incident of personal experience , built up by degrees a body of precedent which would have the force and efficacy of law before it was theoretically inculcated as such . Whoever said that principles were moral habits spoke , it seems to me , a valuable truth , not generally sufficiently recognized or acted upon in the task of education . The only immediate result , that I can remember , of my graver turn of thought at this time upon my conduct was a determination to give up reading Byron 's poetry . It was a great effort and a very great sacrifice , for the delight I found in it was intense ; but I was quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I came to the conclusion that I would forego it . Cain and Manfred were more especially the poems that stirred my whole being with a tempest of excitement that left me in a state of mental perturbation impossible to describe , for a long time after reading them . I suppose the great genius touched in me the spirit of our time , which , chit as I was , was common to us both ; and the mere fact of my being un enfant du si*cle rendered me liable to the infection of the potent , proud , desponding bitterness of his writing . The spirit of an age creates the spirit that utters it , and though Byron* s genius stamped its impress powerfully upon the thought and feeling of his contemporaries , he was himself , after all , but a sort of quintessence of them , and gave them back only an intensified , individual extract of themselves . The selfish vanity and profligate vice which he combined with his extraordinary intellectual gifts were as peculiar to himself as his great mental endowments ; and though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heart of all Europe was not stirred by a fashion of which he set the example , but by a passion for which he found the voice , indeed , but of which the key - note lay in the very temper of the time and the souls of the men of his day . Goethe , Alfieri , Chflteaubriand , each in his own language and with his peculiar national and individual accent uttered the same mind ; they stamped their own image and superscription upon the coin to which , by so doing , they gave currency , but the mine from whence they drew their metal was the civilized humanity of the nineteenth century . It is true that some of Solomon 's coining 592 May , // rings not unlike Goethe 's and Byron 's , but Solomon forestalled his day in being blase ' before the nineteenth century . Doubtless the recipe for that result has been the same for individuals ever since the world rolled , but only here and there a great king , who was also a great genius , possessed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that preceded it to make the blas6 age , and Byron , preeminently , to speak its mind in English , - which he bad no sooner done than every nineteenth - century shop - boy in England quoted Byron , wore his shirt collar open , and execrated his destiny . Doubtless , by grace of his free will , a man may wring every drop of sap out of his own soul and help his fellows likeminded with himself to do the same : but the everlasting spirit of truth renews the vitality of the world , and while Byron was growling and howling , and Shelley was denying and defying , Scott was telling , and Wordsworth sin* , ing things beautiful and good , and new and true . Certain it is , however , that the noble poet 's glorious chanting of much inglorious matter did me no good , and so I resolved to read that grand poetry no more . It was a severe struggle , but I persevered in it for more than two years , and had my reward ; I broke through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noble beauty of those poems remained to me thenceforth divested of the power of wild excitement they had exercised over me . A great many years after this girlish effort and sacrifice , Lady Byron , who was a highly esteemed friend of mine , spoke to me upon the subject of a new and cheap edition of her husband 's works about to be published , and likely to be widely disseminated among the young clerk and shopkeeper class of readers , for whom she deprecated extremely the pernicious influence it was calculated to produce . She consulted me on the expediency of appending to it some notice of Lord Byron written by herself , which she thought might modify or lessen the injurious effect of his poetry upon young minds . " Nobody , " she said , " knew him as I did " ( this certainly was not the general impression upon the subject ) ; " nobody knew as well as I the causes that had made him what he was ; nobody , I think , is so capable of doing justice to him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the injury he might do to others in some of his writings . " I was strongly impressed by the earnestness of her expression , which seemed to me one of affectionate compassion for Byron and profound solicitude lest even in his grave he should incur the responsibility of yet further evil influence , especially on the minds of the young . I could not help wondering also whether she did not shrink from being again , to a new generation and a wider class of readers , held up to cruel ridicule and condemnation as the cold-hearted , hard , pedantic prude , without sympathy for suffering or relenting towards repentance . I had always admired the reticent dignity of her silence with reference to her short and disastrous union with Lord Byron , and I felt sorry , therefore , that she contemplated departing from the course she had thus far steadfastly pursued , though I appreciated the motive by which she was actuated . I could not but think , however , that she overestimated the mischief Byron 's poetry was likely to do the young men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to those of his day , illustrated , so to speak , by the bad notoriety of his own character and career . But the generation of English youth who had grown up with Thackeray , Dickens , and Tennyson as their intellectual nourishment seemed to me little likely to be infected with Byronism , and might read his poetry with a degree of impunity which the young people of his own time did not enjoy . I urged this as my conviction upon her , as rendering less necessary than she imagined the antidote she was anxious to append to the poison of the new edition of her husband 's works . But to this she replied that she had derived her impression of the probable mischief to a class peculiarly interesting to him , from Frederick Robertson , *nd of course his opinion was more than an overweight for mine . 1876. 593 // Lady Byron did not , however , fulfill her purpose of prefacing the contemplated edition of Byron 's poems with a notice of him by herself , which I think very likely to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is matter of ( leep regret that the silence she so sacredly kept for so many years , upon the subject of her relations with her husband , should with or without her sanction have been broken by the revival of a hideous scandal dragged up from the oblivion into which it had sunk , to disgust and shock the moral sense of Europe and America . My happy year in Edinburgh ended , I returned to London , to our house in James Street , Buckingham Gate , where I found my parents much burdened with care and anxiety about the affairs of the theatre , which were rapidly falling into irretrievable embarrassment . My father toiled incessantly , but the tide of illsuccess and losing fortune had set steadily against him , and the attempt to stem it became daily harder and more hopeless . I used sometimes to hear some of the sorrowful details of this dreary struggle , and I well remember the indignation and terror I experienced when one day my father said at dinner , " I have had a new experience to-day : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . " I believe my father was never personally in debt during all his life ; he said he never had been up to that day , and I am very sure he never was afterwards . Through all the severe labor of his professional life , and his strenuous exertions to maintain his family and educate my brothers like gentlemen and my sister and myself with every advantage , he never incurred the misery of falling into debt , but paid his way as he went along , with difficulty , no doubt , but still steadily and successfully , " owing no man anything . " But the suit in question was brought against him as one of the proprietors of the theatre , for a debt which the theatre owed ; and , moreover , was that of a person whom he had befriended and helped forward , and who had always professed the most sincere gratitude and attachment to him . May , This was Mr. B- , then a poor and obscure young author , of whose very considerable abilities my father always spoke warmly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal vulgarity . I think my mother was too intolerant of what she considered vulgarity and under-breeding in people 's manners ; I have sometimes fancied that a vision like St. Peter 's ( " what God hath cleansed , " etc. ) might have been serviceable to her and some of her descendants . My poor mother had cer* tainly a bitter triumph she could well have dispensed with , when she heard that this distressing affront had been put upon my father by this - to her - distasteful friend of his . For my owi* part , great as was my horror then at Mr. B- 's proceeding , I now perfectly understand how a poor literary man ( as he then was ) , working for money and sorely needing the money he had earned* and which the theatre did not pay him , was induced to take the not ill-considered measure of arresting my father , the only one of the partners , or proprietors , whose personal freedom was indispensable to carrying on the concern , who had to act that very evening and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ B s claim against Covent Garden . The constantly darkening prospects of that unlucky theatre threw a gloom over us all ; sometimes my father used to speak of selling his share in it for anything he could get for it ( and Heaven knows it was not likely to be much ! ) , and going to live abroad ; or sending my mother , with us , to live cheaply in the south of France , while he continued to work in London . Neither alternative was cheerful for him or my poor mother , and I felt very sorrowful for them , though I thought I should like living in the south of France better than in London . I was working with a good deal of enthusiasm at a tragedy on the subject of Fiesco , the Genoese noble 's conspiracy against the Dorias , - a subject which had made a great impression upon me when I first read Schiller 's noble play upon it . My own former fancy about going on the stage , and passionate Old Woman 's G'ossip. // desire for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had died away with the sort of moral and mental effervescence which had subsided during my year 's residence in Edinbur , * , h . Although all my sympathy with the anxieties of my parents tended to make the theatre an object of painful interest to me , and though my own attempts at poetical composition were constantly cast in a dramatic form , in spite of my enthusiastic admiration of Goethe 's and Schiller 's plays - which , however , I could only read in French or English translations , for I then knew no German - and my earnest desire to write a good play myself , the idea of making the stage my profession had entirely passed from my mind , which was absorbed with the wish and endeavor to produce a good dramatic composition . The turn I had exhibited for acting at school appeared to have evaporated , and Covent Garden itself never occurred to me as a great institution for purposes of art or enlightened public recreation , but only as my father 's disastrous property , to which his life was being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more and more distasteful to me . It appears to me curious that up to this time I literally knew nothing of Shakespeare , beyond having secn one or two of his plays acted ; I had certainly never read one of them throu* , h , nor did I do so until some time later , when I began to have to learn parts in them by heart . Besides working at my version of Fiesco 's Conspiracy , I wrote great quantities of verses , some of which were rather pretty , but the *reater part mere school-girl unconscious imitations of Moore and Byron . I think the rather serious bias which my mind had developed while I was still in Scotland tended probably to my greater contentment in my home , and to the total disinclination which I should certainly now have felt for a life of public exhibition . My dramatic reading and writin0 was curiously blended with a very considerable interest in literature of a very different sort , and with the perusal of such works as Mason on SelfKnowledge , Newton 's Cardiphonia , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother , observing my tendency to reading on religious subjects , proposed to me to take my first communion . She was a member of the Swiss Protestant church , the excellent pastor of which , the Rev. Mr. 5- , was our near neighbor , and we were upon terms of the friendliest intimacy with him and his family . In his church I received the sacrament for the first tiuie , but I do not think with the most desirable effect . The only immediate result that I can remember of this increase of m* Christian profession and privileges was , I am sorry to say , a rigid , Pharisaical formalism , which I carried so far as to decline accompanying my father and mother to our worthy clergyman 's house , one Sunday , when we were invited to spend the evening with him and his family . This sort of acrid fruit is no uncommon first harvest of youthful religious zeal ; and I suppose my parents and my worthy pastor thought it a piece of unripe , childish , impertinent conscientiousness hardly deserving a serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the manner in which I passed the evening which I was too godly to spend with my family and Dr. S - . I was reading a book of devotion , when I was suddenly rushed in upon by the housemaid , desiring that I would come and see the cook , who , she said , had had a fit ; a doctor had been sent for , upon her and the footman 's responsibility , and when I went to the woman s room I found her about to be bled , and the housemaid steadily refusing to turn her eyes in the tlirection of the operation . Anxious to afford whatever assistance I could , I undcrtook to hold the basin under the arm during the process ; but it was the first time I had ever seen living blood flow , and , though I contrived to stand at my J ) ost , the dreadful faint sickness that almost overcame me made me remember long after that employment of my peculiarly religious Sunday evening . The eldest daughter of Dr. 5- , Mrs. G- , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I first knew 1876. 595 // her . She was one of the finest amateur musicians I have ever known ; her playing on the piano was admirable . She sang too , and , thou , h her voice was rather thin in quality , her musical knowledge made her a valuable member of our small singing- club ; her brother had a good bass voice and musical ear ; and with my mother , myself , and my sister , who was gradually developing her fine musical gifts , we and our friendly neighbors used to get up very agreeable f amily concerts . A pleasant result of which for all parties was the marriage of Mrs. G- to my cousin Horace Twiss , whose first wife had died some years before . My brother Henry was now a duly enrolled Westminster Blackguard . Of his attendance at that seminary of polite learning I have one droll recollection , which belongs to an " educational institution , " to speak the American English of the present day , not likely to survive very long the reprobation now generally expfessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our lessons one morning , when a modest tap at the door was followed by the entrance of an exceedin , , ly delicate , gentleman-like little lad , with my brother 's school-books in his hand , who said , " If you please , I am Fitz Maurice ; and Master Kemble bade me bring his books home and give them to you , if you are his sister . " " But , " said I to this young sprig of nobility , the son of my afterwards very kind friend , Lord Lansdowne , " how comes Master Kemble to send you home with his books , instead of carrying them himself ? " " Because , if you please , I am his facr " said the gentle little boy , making us a farewell bow , and vanishing . Henry was a kind-hearted , noodnatured fellow , and I hoped he did not treat his small slave very inhumanly . Another of my recollections which bebun to this time is seeing several times at our house that exceedingly coarse , disagreeable , clever , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dread of his loud voice , and blazing red face , and staring black eyes ; especially as on more than one occasion his after-dinner wit seemed to me fitter for the table he had left than the more refined atmosphere of the drawing-room . One day he dined with us to meet my cousin Horace Twiss and his handsome new wife . Horace had in a lesser degree some of Hook 's wonderful sense of humor and quickness of repartee , and the two men brought each other out with great effect . Of course I had heard of Mr. Hook 's famous reply when , after having returned from the colonies , where he was in an official position , under suspicion of peculation , a friend meeting him said , " Why , hallo , Hook ! I did not know you were in England ! What has brought you back again ? " " Something wrong about the chest , " replied the imperturbable wit . He was at this time the editor of the John Bull , a paper of considerable ability , and only less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chest difficulty he was much sought in society for his extraordinary quickness and happiness in conversation . His outrageous hoax of the poor London citizen from whom he extorted an agonized invitation to dinner by making him believe that he and Charles Mathews were public surveyors , sent to make observations for a new road , which was to go straight through the poor shopkeeper 's lawn , flower-garden , and bedroom , he has , I believe , introduced into his novel of Gilbert Gurney . But not , of course , with the audacious extemporaneous song with which he wound up the joke , when , having eaten and drank the poor citizen 's dinner , prepared for a small party of citizen friends ( all the time assuring him that he and his friend would use their very best endeavors to avert the threatened invasion of his property by the new line of road ) , he proposed singing a song , to the reat delight of the unsophisticated society , the concluding verse of which was , - " And now I am bound to declare That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this is Charles Mathews , the player , And I , sir , am Theodore hook . " He always demanded , when asked for a specimen of his extemporizing power , that a subject should be given to him . I do not remember , on one occasion , what was suggested in the first instance , but // after some discussion Horace Twiss cried out , " The Jews . " It was the time of the first mooting of the question of the Jews being admitted to stand for Parliament and having seats in the House , and party spirit ran extremely high upon the subject . Theodore Hook shrugged his shoulders and made a discontented grimace , as if baffled by his theme , the Jews . however , he went to the piano , threw back his head , and began strumming a galloping countrydance tune , to which he presently poured forth the most inconceivable string of witty , comical , humorous , absurd allusions to everybody present as well as to the subject imposed upon him . Horace Twiss was at that time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hook took occasion to say , or rather sing , that the foreign department could have little charms for a man who had so many more in the home , with an indication to Annie Twiss ; the final verse of this real firework of wit was this : - " I dare say yon think there s little wit In this , but you ye all forgot That instead of being a jeu desprit , T is only a jen de mot , " pronouncing the French words as broadly as possible , " a Jeu* d'espritt , and t is only a Jew de motte , " for the sake of the rhyme , and his subject , the Jews . It certainly was all through a capital specimen of ready humor . I remember on another occasion hearing him exercise his singular gift in a manner that seemed to me as unjustifiable as it was disagreeable . I met him at dinner at Sir John McDonald 's , then adjutant - general , a very kind and excellent friend of mine . Mrs. Norton and Lord C- , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after we had gone into the dining-room , where they were received with a discreet quantity of mild chaff , Mrs. Norton being much too formidable an adversary to be challenged lightly . After dinner , however , when the men came up into the drawing - room , Theodore Hook was requested to extemporize , and , having sung one song , was about to leave the piano in the midst of the general entreaty that he would not do so , when Mrs. Norton , seating herself close to the instrument so that he could not leave it , said in her most peculiar , deep , soft , contralto voice , which was like her beautiful , dark face set to music , " I am going to sit down here , and you shall not come away , for I will keep you in like an iron crow . " There was nothing about her manner or look that could suggest anything but a flattering desire to enjoy Hook 's remarkable talent in some further specimen of his power of extemporizing , and therefore I suppose there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his part towards her ; she was reckless enough in her use of her wonderful wit and power of saying the most intolerably stinging things , to have left a smart on some occasion in Hook 's memory , for which he certainly did his best to pay her then . Every verse of the song he now sang ended with his turning with a bow to her , and the words , " my charming iron crow ; * ' but it was from beginning to end a covert satire of her and her social triumphs ; even the late arrival at dinner and its supposed causes were duly brought in , still with the same mockrespectful inclination to his " charming iron crow . Everybody was glad when the song was over , and applauded it quite as much from a sense of relief as from admiration of its extraordinary cleverness ; and Mrs. Norton smilingly thanked Hook , and this time made way for him to leave the piano . We lived near each other at this time , we in James Street , Buckingham Gate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposite end of the Birdcage Walk . We both of us frequented the same place of worship , a tiny chapel wedged in among the buildings at the back of Downing Street , the entrance to which was from the park ; it has been improved away by the new government offlces* Our dinner at the McDonalds ' was on a Saturday , and the next day , as we were walking part of the way home together from church , Mrs. Norton broke out about Theodore Hook , and his odious ill - nature and abominable coarseness , saying that it was a disgrace and 1876. 597 // a shame that for the sake of his paper , The John Bull , and its influence , the tories should receive such a man in society . I , who but for her outburst upon the subject should have carefully avoided mentioning Hook 's name , presuming that after his previous evening 's performance it could not be very agreeable to Mrs. Norton , now , not knowing very well what to say , but thinking the Sheridan blood ( especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find some excuse for him , suggested the temptation that the possession of such wit must always be more or less to the abuse of it . " Witty ! " exclaimed the indignant beauty , with her lip and nostril quivering , " witty ! One may well be witty when one fears neither God nor devil ! " I was henrtily glad Hook was not there ; he was not particular about the truth , and would infallibly , in some shape or other , have translated for her benefit , " Je crams Dieu , cher Abner , et n'ai point d'autre crainte . " The Nortons ' house was close to the issue from St. James Park into Great George Street . I remember passing an evenin , , with them there , when a host of distinguished public and literary men were crowded into their small drawing-room , which was literally resplendent with the light of Sheridan beauty , male and female : Mrs. Sheridan ( Miss Callender , of whom , when she published a novel , the hero of which commits forgery , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a Callender , but did not know till then that she was a Newgate calendar ) , the mother of the graces , more beautiful than anybody but her daughters ; Lady Grahame , their beautiful aunt ; Mrs. Norton , Mrs. Blackwood ( Lady Dufferin ) , Georgiana Sheridan ( Duchess of Somerset and queen of beauty by universal consent ) , and Charles Sheridan , their younger brother , a sort of younger brother of the Apollo Belvedere . Certainly I never saw such a bunch of beautiful creatures all growing on one stem . I remarked it to Mrs. Norton , who looked complacently round her tiny drawingroom and said , " Yes , we are rather goodlooking people . " I remember this evening because of the impression made on me by the sight of these wonderfully " good-looking people " all together , and also because of my having had to sing with Moore , an honor and glory hardly compensating the distress of semi-strangulation , in order to avoid drowning his feeble thread of a voice with the heavy , robust contralto which I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singing second to him , in his own melodies , with the other half . My acquaintance with Mrs. Norton lasted through a period of many years , and , though never very intimate , was renewed with cordiality each time I returned to England . It began just after I came out on the stage , when I was about twenty , and she a few years older . My father and mother had known her parents and grandparents , Richard Brinsley Sheridan and Miss Lindley , from whom their descendants derived the remarkable beauty and brilliant wit which distinguished them . My mother was at Drury Lane when Mr. Sheridan was at the head of its administration , and has often described to me the extraordinary proceedings of that famous first night of Pizarro , when , at last keeping the faith he had so often broken with the public , Mr. Sheridan produced that most effective of melodramas , with my aunt 's and uncle 's parts still unfinished , and , depending upon their extraordinary rapidity of study , kept them learning the last scenes of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beginning of the piece was being performed . By.the bye , I do not know what became of the theories about the dramatic art , and the careful , and elaborate study necessary for its perfection . In this particular instance , John Kemble 's Rolla and Mrs. Siddons 's Elvira must have been what may be called extemporaneous acting . Not impossibly , however , these performances may have gained in vivid power and effect what they lost in smoothness and finish , from the very nervous strain and excitement of such a mental effort as the actors were thus called upon to make . My mother rcmembered well , too , the dismal Saturdays when , after prolonged pe // nods of non-payment of their salaries , the poorer members of the company , and all the unfortunate work-people , carpenters , painters , scene-shifters , understrappers of all sorts , and plebs in general of the great dramatic concern , thronging the passages and staircases , would assail Sheridan on his way to the treasury with pitiful invocations : " For God 's sake , Mr. Sheridan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's sake , Mr. Sheridan , let us have something this week ! " and his plausible reply of " Certainly , certainly , my good people , you shall be attended to directly . " Then he would go into the treasury , sweep it clean of the whole week 's receipts ( the salaries of the principal actors , whom he dared not offend and could not dispense with , being , if not wholly , partially paid ) , and , going out of the building another way , leave the poor people who had cried to him for their arrears of wages baffled and cheated of the price of their labor for another week . The picture was not a pleasant one . When I first knew Caroline Sheridan , she had not long been married to the Hon. George Norton . She was splendidly handsome , of an un-English character of beauty , her rather large and heavy head and features recalling the grandest Grecian and Italian models , to the latter of whom her rich coloring and blue - black braids of hair gave her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Duchess of Somerset nor as perfectly charming as Lady Dufferin , she produced a far more striking impression than either of them , by the combination of the poetical genius with which she alone , of the three , was gifted , with the brilliant wit and power of repartee which they ( especially Lady iDufferin ) possessed in common with her , united to the exceptional beauty with which they were all three endowed . Mrs. Norton was extremely epigrammatic in her talk , and comically dramatic in her manner of narrating things . I do not know whether she had any theatrical talent , thcugh she sang pathetic and humorous songs admirably , and I remember shaking in my shoes when , soon after I came out , she told me she envied me , and would give anything to try the stage herself . I thought , as I looked at her wonderful , beautiful face , " Oh , if you should , what would become of me ! " She was no musician , but had a deep , sweet contralto voice , precisely the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combined with her always lowered eyelids ( " downy eyelids " with sweeping silken fringes ) , gave such incomparably comic effect to her sharp retorts and ludicrous stories ; and she sang with great effect her own and Lady Dufferin 's social satires , Fanny Grey , and Miss Myrtle , etc. , and sentimental songs like Would I were with Thee , I dreamt t was but a Dream , etc. , of which the words were her own , and the music , which only amounted to a few chords with the simplest modulations , her own also . I remember she used occasionally to convulse her friends en petit comiti with a certain absurd song called The Widow , to all intents and purposes a piece of broad comedy , the whole story of which ( the wooing of a disconsolate widow by a rich lover , whom she first rejects and then accepts ) was comprised in a few words , rather spoken than sung , eked out by a ludicrous burthen of " **25;654;TOOLONG , " which , by dint of her countenance and voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despair , her lover 's fiery declaration , her virtuous indignation and wrathful rejection of him , his cool acquiescence and intimation that his full purse assured him an easy acceptance in various other quarters , her rage and disappointment at his departure , and final relenting and consent on his return ; all of which with her iddyiddy-ido she sang , or rather acted , with incomparable humor and effect . I admired her extremely . In 1841 I began a visit of two years and a half in England . During this time I constantly met Mrs. Norton in society . She was living with her uncle , Charles Sheridan , and still maintained her glorious supremacy of beauty and wit in the great London world . She came often to parties at our house , and I remember her asking us to dine at her 1876. 599 // uncle 's , when among the people we met were Lord Lansdowne and Lord Normanby , both then in the ministry , whose good will and influence she was exerting herself to captivate in behalf of a certain shy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ province of New Brunswick , Mr. Samuel Cunard , afterwards Sir Samuel Cunard of the great mail packet line of steamers between England and America . He had come to London an obscure and humble individual , endeavoring to procure from the government the sole privilege of carrying the transatlantic mails for his line of steamers . Fortunately for him he had some acquaintance with Mrs. Norton , and the powerful beauty , who was kindhearted and good-natured to all but her natural enemies , i. e. , the members of her own London society , exerted all her interest with her admirers in high place in favor of Cunard , and had made this very dinner for the express purpose of bringing her provincial prote'ge ' into pleasant personal relations with Lord Lansdowne and Lord Normanby , who were likely to be of great service to him in the special object which had brought him to England . The only other individual I remember at the dinner was that most beautiful person , Lady Harriet d ' Orsay . Years after , when the Halifax projector had become Sir Samuel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commerce and business of New York and London , a baronet of large fortune , and a sort of proprietor of the Atlantic Ocean between England and the United States , he reminded me of this charming dinner in which Mrs. Norton had so successfully found the means of forwarding his interests , and spoke with enthusiasm of her kind-heartedness as well as her beauty and talents ; he , of course , passed under the Caudine Forks , beneath which all men encountering her had to bow and throw down their arms . She was very fond of inventing devices for seals and other such ingenious exercises of her brains , and she gave - a star with the motto , " Procul sed non extincta , " which she civilly said bore reference to me in my transatlantic home . She also told me , when we were talking of mottoes for seals and rings , that she had had engraved on a ring she always wore the name of that miserable bayou of the Mississippi - Atchafalaya-where Gabriel passes near one side of an island , while Evangeline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asleep on the other ; and that to her surprise she found that the King of the Belgians wore a ring on which he had had the same word engraved , as an expression of the bitterest and most hopeless disappointment . In 1845 I passed through London , and spent a few days there with my father , on my way to Italy . Mrs. Norton , hearing of my being in town , came to see me and urged me extremely to go and dine with her before I left London , which I did . The event of the day in her society was the death of Lady Holland , about which there were a good many lamentations , of which Lady T- gave the real significance , with considerable natve'te : " Ah , poore deare Ladi Ollande ! It is a. grate pittie ; it was suche a pleasante ouse ! " As I had always avoided Lady Holland 's acquaintance , I could merely say that the regrets I heard expressed about her seemed to me only to prove a well-known fact - how soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the loss of her house , that pleasantest of all London rendezvous , and not for its mistress , though those whom I then heard speak were probably among the few who did regret her . Lady Holland had one good quality ( perhaps more than one , which I might have found out if I had known her ) : she was a constant and exceedingly warm friend , and extended her regard and remembrance to all whom Lord Holland or herself had ever received with kindness or on a cordial footing . My brother John had always been treated with great friendliness by Lord Holland , and in her will Lady Holland , who had not seen him for years , left him as a memento a copy , in thirty-two volumes , of the English essayists , which had belonged to her husband . Almost immediately after this transient renewal of my intercourse with Mrs. Norton , I left England for Italy , // and did not see her again for several years . The next time I did so was at an evening party at my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than it had ever done . Her dress had something to do with this effect , no doubt . She had a rich gold-colored silk on , shaded and softened all over with black lace draperies , and her splendid head , neck , and arms were adorned with magnificently simple Etruscan gold ornaments , which she had brought from Rome , whence she had just returned , and where the fashion of that famous antique jewelry had lately been revived . She was still " une beaut6 triomphante ? t faire voir aux ambassadeurs . " In 1852 I went to Italy . I spent a summer at Sorrento , and thence went to Capri for a week . Mrs. Norton had been there , but had left the island , her two sons remaining there , with a queer , clever slip of an old Yorkshire root , G- C- , who had a firm persuasion that he could construct a flying machine with which he should be able to guide himself through the air . His father and grandfather had had precisely the same aerial hobby , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divers experiments in flying machines . C-had had one constructed at Capri , and , having had it conveyed up to the top of the rocky precipice of the Salto di Tiberio , was with extreme difficulty dissuaded by the Nortons from casting himself into the air Ppon it ; at length , yielding to their persuasions , he sent his bird flying without himself on its back , when , after fluttering for a few seconds above the abyss , it turned over and went falling from point to point of the rocks , and finally was stopped by the arms of a tree that had anchored itself half-way between heaven and the Mediterranean , whence it was never recovered . During one of my last sojourns in London I met Mrs. Norton at Lansdowne House . There was a great assembly there , and she was wandering through the rooms leaning on the arm of her youngest son , her glorious head still crowned with its splendid braids of hair , and wreathed with grapes and ivy leaves , and this was my last vision of her ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of meeting her in London society , now indeed quite old , but indomitably handsome and witty . I think it only humane to state , for the benefit of all mothers anxious for their dau* , hters ' , and all daughters anxious for their own future welfare in this world , that in the matter of what the lady's-maid in the play calls " the first of earthly blessings - personal appearance , * ' Caroline Sheridan as a girl was so little distinguished by the exceptional beauty she subsequently developed , that her lovely mother , who had a right to be exacting in the matter , entertained occasionally desponding misgivings as to the future comeliness of.one of the most celebrated beauties of her day . At the time of my earliest acquaintance with the Nortons , our friends , the Basil Montagues , had left their house in Bedford Square , and were also living at Storey 's Gate . Among the remarkable people I met at their house was the Indian rajah , Ramohun Roy , philosopher , scholar , reformer , Quaker , theist , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introduced to me , and was kind enough to take some notice of me . He talked to me of the literature of his own country , especially its drama , and , finding that I was already acquainted with the Hindoo theatre through the medium of my friend Mr. Horace Wilson 's translation of its finest compositions , but that I had never read Sakuntali* , the most remarkable of them all , which Mr. Wilson had not included in his collection ( I suppose because of its translation by Sir William Jones ) , Ramohun Roy sent me a copy of it , which I value extremely as a memento of so remarkable a man , but in which I confess I am utterly unable to find the extraordinary beauty and sublimity which he attributed to it , and of which I remember Goethe also speaks enthusiastically ( if I am not mistaken , in his conversations with Eckermann ) , calling it the most wonderful production of human genius . Goethe had not , any more than myself , the advantage of reading Sa 1876. 601 // kuntal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a loss to account for the extreme and almost exaggerated admiration he expresses for it . JAMES STREET , BUCKIEGHAM GATE , August 23 ,  --  . M* DEAREST H- : I received your last on my return from the country , where I had been staying a fortnight , and I assure you that after an uncomfortable and rainy drive into town I found it of more service in warming me than even the blazing fire with which we are obliged to shame the month of August . I think it particularly kind of you to have written to me , for in the midst of your anxieties about her brother 's health7* I do not expect you to bestow either much thought or time upon me ; and though the sight of your handwriting is one of my chief pleasures , my own affection for you and my reliance on your interest in me do not depend on a regular exchange of letters . I often think of the time we spent together at Heath Farm , of our long , delightful walks and talks , and my mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happier and better . In one of your letters , which I was looking over the other day , you express an opinion of the uselessness of indiscriminate preservation of correspondence , and I remember thinking that you wished me to destroy yours ; but indeed I can not do this , nor do I think that what you said to me on the subject holds good with respect to your letters to me . For there is not one of them which does not contain expressions of affection which I value dearly , and advice likely perhaps to be appreciated even more as time goes on than when first I received them . I have a great deal to tell you about our affairs , and the effect that their unhappy posture seems likely to produce upon my future plans and prospects . iDo you remember a letter I wrote to you a long time ago about going on the stage ? and another , some time before that , about my becoming a governess ' ? The urgent necessity which I think now exists for exertion , in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again turned my thoughts to these two considerations . My father 's property , and all that we might ever have hoped to have derived from it , being utterly destroyed in the unfortunate issue of our affairs , his personal exertions are all that remain to him and us to look to . There are circumstances in which reflections that our minds would not admit at other times of necessity force themselves upon our consideration . Those talents and qualifications , both mental and physical , which have been so mercifully preserved to my dear father hitherto , can not , in the natural course of things , all remain unimpaired for many more years . It is right , then , that those of us who have the power to do so should at once lighten his arms of all unnecessary burthen , and acquire the habit of independent exertion before the moment comes when utter inexperience would add to the difficulty of adopting any settled mode of proceeding ; it is right and wise to prepare for the evil day before it is upon us . These reflections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupation or profession which may enable me to turn the advantages my father has so liberally bestowed upon me to some account , so as not to be a useless encumbrance to him at present , or a helpless one in future time . My brother John , you know , has now determined to go into the church . Henry we have good although remote hopes of providing well for , and , were I to make use of my own capabilities , dear little A- would be the only one about whom there need be any anxiety . I propose writing to my father before he returns home ( he is at present acting in the provinces ) on this subject . Some step I am determined to take ; the nature of it will of course remain with hisA and my mother . I trust that whatever course they resolve upon I shall be enabled to pursue steadily , and I am sure that , be it what it may , I shall find it comparatively easy , as the motive is neither my own profit nor reputation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // their ri , , ht use whatever talents I may possess , which have not been given for useless purposes . I hope and trust that I am better fitted for either of the occupations I have mentioned than I was when I before entertained an idea of them . You asked me what inclined John 's thou , , hts to the church . It would be hard to say ; or rather , I ou , , ht to say , that Providence which in its own good time makes choice of its instruments , and which I ever firmly trusted would not suffer my brother 's fine powers to be wasted on unworthy . aims . I am not able to say how the change which has taken place in his opinions and sentiments was effected ; but you know one has not done all one 's thinking at twoand - twenty . I have been by circumstances much separated from my brother , and when with him have had but little communication upon such subjects , as he was always , while at home , extremely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time when , I think , his religious principles were somewhat unsettled , that his mind was so passionately absorbed by politics . The nobler instincts of his nature , diverted for a while from due direct intercourse with their divine source , turned themselves with enthusiastic , earnest hope to the desire of benefiting his fellow-creatures ; and to these aims - the reformation of abuses , the establishment of a better system of government , the gradual elevation and improvement of the people , and the general pro , ress of the country towards enlightened liberty and consequent prosperity - he devoted all his tboughts . This was the period of his fanatical admiration for Jeremy Bentham and Mill , who , you know , are our near neighbors here , and whose houses we never pass without John being inclined to salute them , I think , as the shrines of some beneficent powers of renovation . And here comes the break in our intercourse and in my knowledge of his mental and moral progress . I went to Scotland , and was amazed , after I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that John had not got his scholarship , and had renounced his intention of going to the bar and determined to study for the church . I returned home , and found him much changed . His high sense of the duties attending it makes me rejoice most sincerely that he has chosen that career , which may not be the surest path to wordly advancement , but if conscientiously followed must lead , I should think , to the purest happiness this life can offer . I think much of this change may be attributed to the example and influence of some deservedly dear friends of his ; probably something to the soberin , , effect of the disappointment and mortification of his failure at college , where such sanguine hopes and expectations of his success had been entertained . Above all , I refer his present purpose to that higher influence which has followed him through all his mental wanderings , suggesting the ea , , er inquiries of his restless and dissatisfied spirit , and finally leading it to this , its appointed goal . He writes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are very delightful , full of detailed descriptions of the enchanting country - the Rbine land - he is traveling through , which , I confess , sometimes make me sin in envy of his good fortune ; when last I heard from him he was at Heidelberg , with which he seems delighted . Mrs. Siddons and Cecy are with Mrs. Kemble at Leamington . Mrs. Harry Siddons is , I fear , but little better ; she has had another attack of erysipelas , and I am very anxious to get to her , but the distance , and the dependence of all interesting young females in London on the legs and leisure of chaperous , prevents me from seeing her as often as I wish . German is an arduous undertaking , and I have once more abandoned it , not only on account of its difficulty , but because I do not at present wish to enter upon the study of a foreign language , when I am but just awakened to my radical ignorance of my own . God bless you , dear H- . Yours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home of my own , I resisted my friend 's half-expressed wish that I should destroy her letters ; 1876. 603 // but when I ceased to have any settled place of habitation , it became impossible to provide for the safe-keeping of a mass of papers the accumulation of which received additions every few days , and by degrees , for my courage failed me very often in the task , my friend 's letters were destroyed . Few things that I have had to relinquish have cost me a greater pang or sense of loss , and few of the conditions of my wandering life have seemed to me more grievous than the necessity it imposed upon me of destroying these letters . My friend did not act upon her own theory with regard to my correspondence , and indeed it seems to me that no general rule can be given with regard to the preservation or destruction of correspondence . What revelations of misery and guilt may lie in the forgotten folds of hoarded letters , that have been preserved only to blast the memory of the dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that might have lightened for a whole heavy life-time the doubt and anguish of the living ! In this , as in all we do , we grope about in darkness , and the one and the other course must often enou , , h have been bitterly lamented by those who " did for the best " in keeping or destroying these chronicles of human existence . The letters generally exchanged between intimate friends are certainly no more intended to be collected and kept than the words which friends utter in confidential conversation ; yet how often would one have preserved , if one could , the very words , tone , look , accent , and gesture of certain conversations , while at the same time , could the speaker anticipate such a stereotyping of his utterance , he would probably be struck dumb with the consciousness , and there would be nothing to retain . The most intimate revelations of greatly gifted minds are not unnaturally the most eagerly sought after by the world . The clay feet of these golden-headed images seem to attract rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be puerile , not to say irreverent . Is it for the sake of the comfortable sense of kindred to greatness - all our feet being clay , though all our heads are not gold - that we inquire into the numb*er of toes of our idols ? But while the public revels in the domestic details of this or that illustrious individual 's private life and manners , his family and kindred , those to whom such portions of his history peculiarly belong , may be pardoned if they feel that his fame has no right to desecrate instead of consecrating his home . They are justified in desiring that something special of his personal intercourse should be left to them , to whom he was father , husband , son , or dearest friend ; and if his boots are in a glass case in the museum , his slippers may remain by his bedside at home . His genius may shine like a great light at his gate , on the highway of life , but because it does so , and cheers and guides the wayfarers as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the key-hole , still less their pressing in to where he sits with his own , at his hearth or board . Very true , no doubt , they eagerly desire to know " all about him , ' * and would fain thrust themselves into the closet where he shuts himself to pray , to discover whether he kneels or stands , or moves his lips and utters an audible voice of supplication or prays in silence with his soul alone . Genius pays its penalty like royalty . Small privacy is allowed to either ; but it seems hard to grudge it to our benefactors in their graves , their share having been of the smallest till they came thither . Madame Pasta 's daughter once said to Charles Young , who enthusiastically admired her great genius , " Vous trouvez qu'elle chante et joue bien , n'est-ce pas ? " " J&amp;crois bien , " replied he , puzzled to understand her drift . " Well , " replied the daughter of the great lyrical artist , " to us , to whom she belongs and who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least admirable thing about her ; but no one but us knows that . " Doubtless if letters of Shakespeare 's could be found , letters devoloping the mystery of those sorrowful sonnets , or . even letters describing his daily dealings with his children , and Mistress Anne Hathaway , his wife ; nay , even 604 May , // the fashion , color , and texture of the hangings of the second best bed , her special inheritance , a frenzy of curiosity would be aroused by them . All his glorious plays would not be worth ( bookseller 's value ) some scraps of thought and feeling , or mere personal detail , or even commonplace ( he must have been sovereignly commonplace ) impartment of theatrical business news and gossip to his fellow-players , or Scotch Drummond , or my Lord Southampton , or the Dark Woman of the sonnets . But we know little about him , thank Heaven ! and I am glad that little is not more . I know he must have sinned and suffered , mortal man since he was , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plays , in spite of the necessarily impersonal character of dramatic composition , we gather a vivid and distinct impression of serene sweetness , wisdom , and power . In the fragment of personal history which he gives us in his sonnets , the reverse is the case ; we have a painful impression of mournful struggling with adverse circumstances and moral evil elements , and of the labor and the love of his life alike bestowed on objects deemed by himself unworthy ; and in spite of his triumphant promise of immortality to the false mistress or friend , or both , to whom ( as far as he has revealed them to us ) he has kept his promise , we fall to pityin0 Shakespeare , the bestower of immortality . In the great temple raised by his genius to his own undying glory , one narrow door opens into a secret , silent crypt , where his image , blurred and indistinct , is hardly discernible through the gloomy atmosphere , heavy and dim as if with sighs and tears . Here is no clew , no issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and life and warmth and melody ; with knowledge and love of man , and worship of God and nature . There is our benefactor and friend , simplest and most lovable , though most wonderful of his kind ; other image of him than that bright one may the world never know . The extraordinary development of the taste for petty details of personal gossip which our present literature bears witness to makes it almost a duty to destroy all letters not written for publication ; and yet there is no denying that life is essentially interesting - every life , any life , all lives , if their detailed history could be given with truth and simplicity . For my own part , I confess that the family correspondence , even of people utterly unknown to me , always seems to me full of interest . The vivid interest the writers took in themselves makes their letters better worth reading than many books we read ; they are life as compared with imitations of it - life , that mystery and beauty surpassing every other ; they are morsels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man of science , the metaphysician , artist , and poet . And yet it would be hard if A , B , and C 's letters should therefore be published , especially as , had they contemplated my reading them , they would doubtless never have written them or written them quite other than they did . To resume my chronicle . My brother John was at this time traveling in Germany ; the close of his career at Cambridge had proved a bitter disappointment to my father , and had certainly not fulfilled the expectations of any of his friends or the promise of his own very considerable abilities . He left the university without taking his degree , and went to Heidelberg , where he laid the foundation of his subsequent thorough knowledge of German , and developed the taste for the especial philological studies to which he eventually devoted himself , but his eminence in which brought him little emolument and but tardy fame , and never in the least consoled my father for the failure of all the brilliant hopes he had formed of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man has made up his mind that his son is to be Lord Chancellor of England , he finds it hardly an equivalent that he should be one of the first Anglo-Saxon scholars in Europe . In my last letter to Miss 5- I have referred to some of my brother 's friends and their possible influence in determining his choice of the clerical profession 18*T6. 605 // in preference to that of the law , which my father had wished him to adopt , and for which , indeed , he had so far shown his own inclination as to have himself entered at the Inner Temple . Perhaps the names of the young men who were his chief companions , and among my own friends at this time , will furnish some excuse for the rather fastidious tendency of my social taste in after life , and my very decided preference for a good deal of solitude to much society . Among my brother 's contemporaries , his school and college mates who frequented my father 's house at this time , were Arthur Hallam , Alfred Tennyson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Richard Trench , William Donne , the Romillys , the Malkins , Edward Fitzgerald , James Spedding , William Thackeray , and Richard Monckton Milnes . These names were those of " promising young men , " our friends and com panions , whose various remarkable abilities we learnt to estimate throu , , h my brother 's enthusiastic appreciation of them . How bright has been in many instances the full performance of that early promise , England has gratefully acknowledged ; they have been among the jewels of their time , and some of their names will be famous and blessed for generations to come . It is not for me to praise those whom all Englishspeaking folk delight to honor ; but in thinking of that bright band of very noble young spirits , of my brother 's love and admiration for them , of their affection for him , of our pleasant intercourse in those far-off early days , - in spite of the faithful , life- long regard which still subsists between myself and the few survivors of that goodly company , my heart sinks with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much light has departed seems dark and dismal enough .
