ARTICLE 11. - REVIEW OF PROF . PERRY 'S POLITICAL ECONOMY . Elements of Political Economy . By ARTHUR LATHAM PERRY , LL.D . Charles Scribner 's Sons . New York . IT is impossible to over estimate the importance of a thoroughly logical method in the exhibition of a science , to the ease , pleasure , and success of the student . The mind experiences a remarkable degree of pleasure and satisfaction in being conducted through the intricacies of a complicated and difficult subject , by a line of logic so clear , that one constantly perceives whither his progress is tending , and the precise relation of the topic at each moment in hand , to the fundamental principle from which be set out . On the other hand , if such logical method is wanting , the student is perplexed , bewildered , and discouraged ; no matter what acuteness of thought the writer may exhibit , or what attractions of style the treatise may possess . This consideration is preeminently important in a class text-book . In such a work , to present the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than entire accuracy in the opinions expressed . Erroneous opinions may be easily corrected by an intelligent teacher , but a defective method has little chance of being obviated by any efforts of the teacher , however earnest and skillful . It will weaken him , however intelligent he may be , and always render it difficult if not impossible to awaken the interest and fix the attention of the pupiL There is in Economic Science a fundamental law , which is perfectly adapted to furnish such a guiding clue through all its intricacies ; and it is of great importance , both to the teacher and the pupil , that in the construction of the treatise to be employed for the purpose of instruction , this law be made so prominent and commanding , that the student will perceive how every branch of the subject stands related to it . In a good treatise on Physical Astronomy , we never for a moment lose sight of the law of gravitation . No more should we in a trea // tise on economic science ever lose sight of the law of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or by the exertion of one 's own powers . It is the one fountain from which the science springs , and the one law which dominates every part of the economic system . There are few persons we suspect who have paid much attention to the subject , who would not admit , without any hesitation , that the progress of the science has been greatly hindered by the lack of such logical method , and that this has been greatly occasioned by the want of accurate definitions . Almost all recent writers on the subject have shown in one way or another , that they are aware that the prevailing modes of treating the subject are not satisfactory , and have sought in some way to remedy the evil . Some have been led by past failures to the conclusion , that a strictly scientific method is irnpracticable and undesirable ; that the region of thought which the subject covers is so pervaded by the contingencies which always attach to human volition , that it can not be reduced to a strictly scientific method . Perhaps it will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view of the subject results from a mistaken conception of the aim of the science . Other writers have sought to remedy the difficulty by limiting the field of the science , giving a narrower definition than has usually been given . Professor Perry , the title of whose able work is referred to at the head of this Article , is of this number . He limits the science by his definition . Following Archbishop Whately , he defines the science as " the Science of Exchanges , " or " the Science of Vakte . " His avowed reason for pursuing this course is , that all efforts hitherto made to define wealth and the science of wealth have failed , and left the science still indeterinmate . He even asserts that the word wealth can not be so defined as to render it fit for scientific use . The reason which he gives for this opinion is , that it is used by the people , and even by writers in many senses , and so has become unfit for scientific use . The assertion that any word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed it is a word expressing a simple idea , sounds strangely . Certainly the fact that people and even writers use it in many different senses is far enough from proving the assertion . In the English Ianguage , // nearly all the technical terms used in the social and moral sciences are words employed by the people in various senses , but subjected to precise definitions for the uses of science . Value , labor , production , are specimens of this very use of technical terms by Professor Perry himself . Many others might be adduced from his own work . We are constantly using in a strictly technical sense , words taken in this manner from popular speech . The fact therefore that the word wealth is popularly used in different senses , as indeed almost all words are , is no reason why it should be imnossible to define it for scientific purposes . We are far from agreeing with Professor Perry , that the " word wealth has been the bane of the science . " It is not that word that has been the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comprehensive concept , so defined as precisely to embrace all the entities with which the science has to do , accurately applied and tenaciously adhered to , throughout the treatise . Such a concept , so defined and adhered to , is an indispensable condition of logical method . The word wealth has been selected by many authors as the boundary of the science , and defined with sufficient accuracy . But they have failed to apply that definition to all the entities which its terms embrace . It is exceedingly obvious on the very surface of things , that those entities comprehend all existing power to labor for the supply of human want , and all unexpended products of such labor . All such powers are owned by the individuals who are endowed with them , to be used and disposed of at their option , and all the unexpended products of such labor belong , or originally did belong , to the individuals by whose efforts they were produced . This is the law of ownership , and it is the fountain from which the science springs . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very early childhood , which no man can either define or fail to understand . Precisely that and all that which is embraced in this intuition , is the proper sphere of economic science . We shall never succeed in logically exhibiting the subject , till we recognize this original intuition as its natural and unalterable boundary . Power to labor and the unexpended products of labor are the entities with which the economist has to do . The aim of the science is to expound // those conditions under which those powers will be most fully and successfully exerted , in producing those means of human happiness which are capable of being owned and exchanged , and the laws by which provision is made for distributing the results of human labor to all who in any way co√∂perate in producing them . H this is so , the definition of Professor Perry , viz : " The Science of Value " is inadequate . As the word value is purely abstract , the name of an attribute and not of any really existing thing , we can only treat of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and we can only treat of things which have value in so far as they are exchanged for other valuable things . The word value does not include in its meaning the relation of valuable things to the labor which produces them , or to the causes and forces which aid and facilitate their production , or to universal human well-being . Value only appears when one thing is exchanged for another . Yet the science has to do with innumerable cases and interests , in relation to which no exchange takes place . Indeed Professor Perry admits that the phrase " Science of Value " is precisely equivalent to the phrase " Science of Exchanges . " No one surely would contend that the Science of Exchanges can legitimately have anything to do with the forces which produce , or the causes which may facilitate or hinder the multiplication of those things which may be exchanged , or with the relation of such multiplication to human happiness . Such a definition , if adhered to , must narrow the field of the science , and diminish its dignity and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generally it will not be , it will be a fertile source of vagueness and confusion in the treatment of the subject , and will greatly impair that impression of unity which it is very important to make on the mind of the student . We affirm therefore , that the word value as defined by the author of this treatise , is not fit to express that comprehensive concept which is to form the boundary of the science , and that we must seek another . Wealth is the word which has usually been employed for this purpose . It must however be confessed , that it has been employed very infelicitously . Indeed it must be owned that it is not perfectly easy to invest the word , even // by a definition , with the precise meaning which it must bear in such a relation . The difficulty lies in the fact that we must include in the meaning of the word more than it ever expresses in popular speech . Labor , or man 's power to labor , is certainly one of the entities with which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never included as a part of the wealth either of the individual or the world . Yet no word can express with precision the boundary line of the science , which does not embrace in its meaning all existing power to labor . It is the one source from which , in the last analysis , man derives the supplies of his wants . By it the race continues and advances in prosperity and happiness . The real nature of the difficulty which has embarrassed the economist in the use of this word is the fact , that the subject matter of the science consists essentially of labor and the products of labor . To the latter of these only is the word wealth usually applied , either by the people or by writers . Yet whatever word is employed to express the comprehensive concept that marks the boundary of the science must embrace them both . While therefore writers persist in applying the word to the products of labor only , it matters little how they define it , the definition will be nugatory , and the science will remain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Henry Fawcett , for example , gives a definition of wealth which equally comprehends in its terms , labor and the products of labor . But in his whole treatise he never recognizes the fact that labor is embraced in his definition of wealth , and in his hands the science is without an exterior boundary . So far as respects scientific method , this is a fatal blunder . If we would treat the subject scientifically , we must either disregard the popular use of the word in our definition of it , as we have abundant authority for doing in the practice of writers on social science ; or we must reject the word altogether and substitute some other in its place . We apprehend it will be found quite as difficult to do the latter as it confessedly is to do the former . We gravely question whether there is another word in the English language , which can be as easily fitted by definition to perform this service as the word wealth . There is no natural impropriety in regarding labor as a compo // nent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steam engine or the power-loom , whose only utility lies in increasing the efficiency of labor , is regarded as an item of wealth , why should not labor itself be equally so regarded ? By the confession of all , labor and its products are entirely co*irdinate , and are constantly exchanged for each other , just as products are . To impair the labor power of a mau or a community is to impair wealth , and to increase labor power is to increase wealth . We must therefore maintain , with all due deference to recent authority , that it is wisest to retain the word , with a definition broad enough precisely to embrace the subject matter of the science . Professor Perry 's very able work *hows plainly enough the need of just such a word . He labors , and the student must follow him , through twenty pages , in defining the field of the science . A sharp definition of one word would have accomplished this much better in less than twenty lines . This would have been a great relief to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the practical work of teaching , we have found the ponderousness of certain recent works on the subject , foi which we have great respect and even admiration , very objectionable in the class.room . In the work to which we have more especially referred above , the student must labor through more than seventy pages , before he really enters on the development of the science . Much of the matter contained in those pages is interesting and important , but the student who is ignorant of the whole subject is unprepared to appreciate it , or be instructed by it . Even to the more advanced student it embarrasses the scientific development . When the subject of value is finally reached the view of it presented is sound and satisfactory . But we can not help thinking that he would have reached it by a much shorter and simpler process , if his mind had not been turned away from that great law of human nature from which the definition of this word should be directly derived . One force is controling in every transaction of exchange . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law of nature as gravitation or inertia . It is not , as many suppose , the hard insatiable greed of gain , by which the Shylocks of trade demand their pound of flesh ; // but that necessity of nature by which every one prefers the greater amount of good to the less of the same kind . In every case of exchange , two such desires are in antagonism . That antagonism of desire is competition , and it alone can determine the value of anything . Whenever an owner desiring to exchange has ascertained to his satisfaction what is the greatest amount of the product of another , that can be obtained for his own , he knows the value of his own . Value then is relative desirableness as ascertained by competition . We are thus brought face to face with a force , which not only enables us to define value , but which dominates over every transaction , in which any possession of one man is exchanged for a possession of another , and sustains a relation to the exchanges of the world very analogous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heavenly bodies . So far as the science has to do with transactions of exchange , competition is the one guiding clue , which will conduct us through all its intricacies and reveal the order of the entire system . We think that , in most existing works on the subject , it occupies a far less prominent place than it is entitled to , far less prominent than a regard to scientific unity imperatively requires . The word capital plays a conspicuous part in every treatise on economic science . Its definition therefore becomes a matter of great importance . We think writers have hardly been more felicitous in their definitions of capital than of wealth . Professor Perry 's definition is , " Any valuable thing , outside of man himself , from whose use springs a pecuniary increase or profit . " Instead of saying , " from whose use springs a pecuniary increase , " etc. , he should have said , from whose use a pecuniary increase is sought or expected . It is evident he does not mean to imply that when an investment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not capital unless it proves to be really profitable . With this change of phraseology , which only makes it express the author 's real meaning , the definition may be accepted as in terms embracing all capital . But it is very important to be observed , that it really embraces all valuable things outside of man himself . It is impossible to draw any definite line between what is used for the gratification of desire , and what is used in the hope of gain . // To illustrate this , let us suppose some one has accumulated the sum of ten thousand dollars , and that he wishes so to employ it as to increase it as rapidly as possible . He accordingly engages in a business in which he can employ both his labor and his past accumulations with the best prospect of profit . That ten thousand dollars is undoubtedly his capital . Yet out of it he must live till he can realize profit from his business . His own support and that of his family is as necessary to his anticipated profit as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much a part of the cost of production as the compensation which he gives his laborers . What then do we mean by support ? Is it just enough to sustain life ? or to provide him with conveniences and comforts ? Evidently the latter ; for if not , where shall we draw the line between necessaries and comforts , so as to determine how much of the cost of his living is to be set to the account of expenditure for the gratification of desire , and how much to capital ? No one will surely contend for a moment that this line can be definitely drawn . Yet we must equally admit that the support of the proprietor is a necessary incident of the investment . He must live . He must not only have the bare necessaries of life , but he may live more expensively than is strictly necessary . He may set a good table , wear fine broadcloth , and dress his wife in stuffs more costly than calico , and have some ornaments in his parlor . His hired laborers will do the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it is greatly to be desired that they may be . A human being requires for his support more than the bare necessaries of existence , while he drives his business for profit ; and in procuring it as he goes along , he does not divert any of his resources from the end at which he is aiming . He may even give something to objects of charity , and yet be only claiming for himself suitable compensation for his own services , just as he gives it to his employees . We say therefore that his whole $10,000 is his capital , without any deduction for what he expends in supporting himself and his family . He is a laborer as truly as those whom he hires . The only difference is that he hires himself and pays his own wages out of the investment from which all who are engaged in the business draw their // living . Further on we will show that his wife also and even his children are in the strictest sense laborers , and their support is an incident to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convinced that it is impossible to draw any line between that which is employed for profit , and that which is employed for the gratification of desire . We can not use any thing for profit without also using it in part for the gratification of desire . The true conception of the matter in the view of the economist is , that all human beings are to be regarded as laborers , and all the unexpended products of labor are to be treated as capitaL It will also follow as a part of the same system of ideas , that all which is expended in the supply of individual want , and the gratification of individual desire , is to be regarded as the compensation of labor . It is the design of nature that every human being should be a laborer , and receive his living as the reward of his labor . So has she adjusted her economies , and so it is our wisdom to construct ours . We shall thus eliminate all the endless confusions of thought which would result from attempting to maintain in words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind . Such is the distinction referred to . We therefore propose to set it aside as worse than useless to the science . There can hardly be a more fertile source of confusion of thought than the attempt to maintain a distinction which can not be distinctly traced . As the design of nature is that every man should be a laborer and enjoy the comforts of a civilized existence as the reward of his labor , so the whole function of the accumulated products of labor is to assist and reward labor . We have therefore the same difficulty with Professor Perry 's definition of labor as of capital . It is , says he , only exertion which demands for itself something in exchange , that is technically called laboi* Precisely here is he led into error by assuming that exchange is the whole of the science . All deliberate effort to supply human want does demand something in return . Yet there may be no transaction of exchange in the case . A man may fix and pay his own wages , and exchange with no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic machinery of the world can not move on . The Yanderbilts // and the Astors of the world are not only laborers , but laborers of gigantic strength , and they must have their reward as well as compensation for the use of their capital , or the world can not have their services . rfl*e mother that rears children is a laborer and must live by her labor , or the supply of labor will cease when the present generation of laborers passes away . There is no transaction of exchange in the case , yet she has a direct claim both upon the labor and capital of her husband , to be supported in the enjoyment of the comforts and conveniences of life . Her child in the cradle is a laborer as truly as a power loom in the process of construction is capitaL The laborer that builds that power loom receives his reward by a transaction of exchange . The mother must equally receive hers though without an exchange . The economic system of the universe is that all are laborers , and as such must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human want . With this conception of the subject we have no difficulty in determining the place in the system of the teacher , the professional man , the inventor , the poet , the artist . The science becomes , as its name imports , the law of the familythe great human family . Many writers have failed clearly to perceive the legitimate aim of the science . This of course is a very grave error . In one very important respect this science ranks with such sciences as astronomy and chemistry . Its aim is to apply a single . law to the explanation of the entire group of phenomena comprehended within its definition . The law of ownership , acquired either by the gift of God , or by the exertion of one 's own powers , is such a law , and is to be applied to the explanation of tue whole group of phenomena embraced in economic science . But in another respect this science differs widely from those just named . They have to apply their fundamental laws only to phenomena over which human wills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no contingencies . The field of thought which the economist has to explore is widely pervaded by human volition and the contingencies which result from it . This fact greatly modifies the aim of the science . The science of astronomy must harmonize in every part with facts as they actually occur . Observations on the real state of // the universe must confirm and verify the results of theory . The economist can construct no science which will harmonize with the economies of the world as they actually exist at any one time . He aims at nothing of the sort . You might just as well attempt to construct a system of moral science , which would harmonize with the moral actions of men as we meet them in actual life . The true aim of the economist is , to construct a system which would result from the application of his fundamental law to all the economic arrangements of the world ; and he will succeed in his work just in proportion as he is true to this aim . If to this it is objected , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one of mere theory , we answer : so it must be till time can be afforded for verification by experiment . The economist must sometimes propose and insist on important changes , on grounds purely theoretical ; and the verification of his theory can only be secured by a trial of the plan which he proposes . This is a disadvantage , under which the science necessarily labors , and it has not a little retarded its progress . It should be borne in mind , however , that the fundamental law of the science ,  --  the law of ownership ,  --  is intuitively discerned from our very infancy , and that all its applications are exceedingly direct , and to an honest and thoughtful mind obvious and inevitable . We think that even Professor Perry has , at least in one instance , fallen into error , notwithstanding the keen discernment which he usually exhibits , by failing to keep this aim sufficiently in view . He says : " The providential elements in economics , both physical and social , are relatively fixed ; so are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be said to be aniversal in their character , such , for instance , as the preference to receive a larger rather than a less return , and to render a smaller rather than a greater effort : but there are other principles of human nature more variable in their character , such , for instance , as a nation 's choice of the kind of money it will use , or the kind of taxation it will impose . " We are unable to see that there are any principles of human nature , which can decide with any degree of definiteness , what // kind of taxation a nation should impose ; and we can therefore hardly admit that the question belongs to the economist at all . But in nothing is the fundamental economic law more imperative than in determining what shall be used as money . We think Professor Perry is wrong in admitting that any substance becomes money by social agreement or legislative enactment . Governments may determine by legislative enactment what the creditor shall receive from the debtor in discharge of his debt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of injustice and tyranny . Any substance becomes money , not by any social agreement or legislative enactment , but only by the experience of exchangers ; just as a locomotive of particular construction may supersede all others , because experience has shown it to be the best . Such experience will always decide what commodity is more universally desired than any other . All persons will prefer to receive for what they have to sell , that commodity rather than anything else . This will soon render it an object of universal desire . It will thus become money , as the result of universal experience . Nothing can become money in any other way . It is the sole function of the government in relation to this matter , not to determine what shall be money , but to make and enforce laws to compel the fulfillment of contracts , in that money which experience has already established . Our government , for example , may enact that debts may be paid in silver dollars , each of which is worth only ninety cents ; and men may call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misnomer and a mischievous delusion . Such legislation may defraud the creditor of ten per cent . of his dues , but it can not make such dollars money . The experience of the civilized world will still make gold money , though our laws may drive it from circulation , and our exchanges with the human race must , in spite of our senseless and tyrannical legislation , be adjusted in the money of the rest of the world . It is much to be regretted , that so respectable a work as that of Professor Perry should lend any sanction to that mischievous heresy of the present time , that any substance can become money by legislative enactment . If the legislature can make one substance money , why not another ? If it can make depre. ciated silver coin money , why not depreciated paper ? Why // not paper rags ? The only antidote to this heresy is the sound and wholesome doctrine , that money is not the creature of legislation , but a natural and inevitable product of the economic machinery of society , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trading people will have money , whether they have any government or not . We can not suppose that the money which Abraham paid to the sons of Heth was made such by any legislation . It was not the money of any government , but " current money with the merchant . " The people of Virginia used tobacco for money , when they had nothing better . In the early part of this century . before the construction of the Erie Canal , the products of Northern Ohio would for the most part bear transportation to no cash market . The consequence was , that they ceased to have any supply of that which the exchangers of the world had established as money , though they had wheat and other agricultural products in abundance . For the time being their experience made the bushel of wheat the money unit . It was called a dollar , though perhaps it would not command ten cents in silver ; and this state of things continued till the opening of the canal furnished an outlet for their products , and placed them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world . Then the bushel of wheat ceased to be money , and no legislation of the State of Ohio or of the United States could have made it to be money any longer . When a community is isolated from the rest of the world , its own experiences in exchanges will determine what shall be money . So soon as its isolation ceases , its money will , by an irresistible law of nature , be the money of the rest of the world . There is no possibility of estimating the amount of mischief done by one act of our government in flagrant violation of this fundamental economic law , we mean of course by the enactment of the legal tender act of 1862 . By that act , persevered in for these sixteen years , the government has not only unsettled values , unjustly interfered with the relations of debtor and creditor , and deplorably embarrassed every department of trade ; but it has bewildered the minds of millions , and produced a crop of crude and destructive theories , from which we are reaping a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is not yet . We have " sown the wind , " and what wonder if we " reap the whirlwind ? " We can not then too deeply fix it in our minds , that this department of the science , as well as every other , is imperatively dominated by a natural law as irresistible as gravitation . Governments may think to make something money by legal enactment . But it is a sickly delusion , the result of which can be nothing but injustice and embarrassment . We may by a rather violent figure of speech call bank notes , or greenbacks , or national currency , or depreciated silver dollars , money ; but we can never return to a sound and healthy condition , till we learn that it is a figure of speech , and sharply to distinguish between the semblance and the reality . A failure to comprehend the true aim of the science is the reason of the distaste and dislike which some men express , of all attempts to treat the subject in the rigidly logical manner for which we contend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon such a treatment of the subject are committing the same mistake , which one would commit , who should attempt to determine the actual outline of the earth 's surface by demonstrating theoretically what is the form of equilibrium , and assuming that that outline must everywhere conform to it . Of course one who had constructed his views of the earth 's surface on this principle would be greatly astonished in actually exploring the surface of the earth , and becoming acquainted with its deep valleys and lofty mountains . We assure those persons , however , that we are committing no such folly . We arc pcrfectly aware that the whole region of thought with which the economist has to do , is pervaded by all the contingencies which arise from human legislation , and human ignorance and folly . We know well that men have tried through all the ages to determine the rate of interest by law , to establish rent by custom , to determine wages by combination , either of employers or employees , to regulate money by arbitrary standards , and to promote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discriminate in their favor . We know all this and much more of the same sort , and we are not likely soon to forget it . It is not we , but our critics , that have mistaken the aim of the science . We have // no thought of leaving out of the account any of these contingencies of human volition . The legitimate aim of the science is , not to construct a system which will harmonize with these innumerable lawless contingencies , these sad products of human ignorance and folly ; but to determine by an appeal to the laws of nature , what are the natural conditions of equilibrium in the economic universe , which must be fulfilled , in order that the human race may attain to that permanent prosperity and happiness for which it was destined by the Creator . As we have already intimated , we are not much moved by thc objection , that all this is mere theory . The natural law is too clearly and universally discerned to leave any doubt in the mind of its truth , and its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistake ; while the history of the ages is full of the disasters , and miseries , and confusions , which have resulted from its violation . Even in the material world , man has found in these later ages that it is the condition of human progress that the mountains should be levelled and the valleys exalted . In one sense the aim of the economist is far enough from being merely theoretical ; it is rather analogous to that of the civil engineer , to point out in the economic sphere what mountains are to be levelled , what valleys exalted , what rivers bridged , in order that the car of human progress may run its destined course ; and it determines these questions by methods which leave no ground for the suspicion of uncertainty .
