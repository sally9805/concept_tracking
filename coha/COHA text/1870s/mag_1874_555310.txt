FRENCH AND GERMAN.1 M. Flaubert is an author who has won considerable reputation in France by three novels which have , already called out a great deal of discussion , both in the country where they were written and elsewhere ; they are Madame Bovary , L'i*ducation Sentimentale , and Salammb6 . Itt all of them there was talent of a certain kind , enough to get itself very much talked about , but chiefly from the novelty of the author in maintaining the paradox that the treatment of any subject , if only clever , could outweigh the most natural objections to a distasteful topic . So much may be said of Madame Bovary and L'i*klucation Sentimeutale , at least ; Salammb6 was an attempt to breathe life into the few fragments we have left of Carthaginian history , and it labored under the misfortune of being , even when successfully done , hardly more than a tour de force . The greater the cleverness shown in patching together scrappy references from Livy and Polybius , the further removed we are from a hearty enjoyment of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our admiration by antiquarian investigations , and we are also pained whenever we let everything go 1 All books mentioned under this head are to be had at Schoenhof and Mueller 's , 40 Winter Street , Boston . 241 by as possible , and make no question about the accuracy of the author . At the best we have only a chastened melodrama . The Temptation of Saint Anthony , which we have before us to-day , is something like this last-named novel , not in construction , but in being a great store-house of facts that lie hidden in lexicons and recondite volumes . To state what it might be expected that such a book would be , might lead us very far ; most readers would fancy a novel of a sort that would be darkly explained by the adjective French , but in fact we have nothing of the sort . The form which M. Flanbert has chosen is that of a mystery , with the very smallest amount of dramatic action . At the beginning of the book we find Saint Anthony in his cell recalling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his youth , doubting the wisdom of his choice of a religious life , uncertain whether he might not have done better at soldiering , suffering too from hunger and thirst , and , as they attack him , seeing phantom luxuries appear before him ; there is money , too , tempting him to abandon this lonely life and live in comfort among his fellowmen  --  but they all vanish . Then he grows angry at recalling the way he was treated at the Council of Nice ; but more serious temptations await him : the Queen of Sheba appears , inviting him to join her , and narrating the pleasures that await him , after the manner of many painters of the present time , who try to make research usurp the place of pictorial power . It is the semi-antiquarian painters we mean , who are so much the fashion , nowadays , for their pictures of the historical school , which have not any of the enthusiasm of the last century , but a thousand times the accuracy . This quality shows itself throughout the book ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a long list of tempters : the King of Evil himself , a very shadowy creation , as if the popular skepticism about his existence had told upon him ; and there is also ililarion , who leads Anthony through an enormous series of visions . Under this guardianship we see representatives of various sects of the early Christians , who come forward and make brief speeches ; we , see the Roman circus ; we have hair-splitting discussions about theological matters ; Nebuchadnezzar and Buddha rub elbows ; La Tentation de Saint Antoine . Par GuerArs FLAUBZRT . Paris : 1874 . Recent Literature . // the varions Roman gods and goddesses in large numbers appear and then disappear in a vague way before the advance of Christianity , Minerva descrihes what used to he done at her feasts , Neptune , Mars , and all the others tell their little stories ; then the devil appears once more with characteristic speeches , and finally death and luxury appear , sorely tempting the dis-. tracted saint , and the end of it all is a most curious nightmare of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diamonds shining like eyes , and minerals palpitating . Insects without stomachs continue eating ; finally he sees " little globulous moving masses , the size of pins ' heads , and covered with small hairs . " In his madness he cries out , with the voice of one who has solved the problem of spontaneous generation : " Oh joy ! I have seen the origin of life , I have seen movement begin ! The blood in my veins boils as if it would burst them . I am seized with a yearning to fly , swim , hark , bellow , hQwl. 1 should like to have wings , a shell ; to breathe smoke ; to carry a trunk ; to twist my body ; to divide myself everywhere ; to be in everything ; to emanate with odors ; to grow up like plants ; to flow like water ; to vibrate like sound ; to shine like light ; to lie hid under all sorts of forms ; to penetrate every atom ; to go to the bottom of matter , - to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long and disturbed night ends , the day breaks , and Saint Anthony makes the sign of the cross and turns to praying again . To be sure this has a cruder sound in English than in the original French , but we can not help thinking that what is disappointing in the hook lies much deeper than that . If Flanbert meant to be realistic , he could not succeed without having very much more imagination . The liberties he takes are enough to convict him of error in the field of antiquity ; for instance , was rnlarion a Neoplatonist I Is it within the limits of possibility that such visions could appear I Has the book any dramatic interest , in other words I We think this can hardiy be claimed . What we have is , rather , an interesting exposition of certain archnological curiosities , put together evidently with considerable care , but also without any real human sympathy . For instance , there is the vanishing of the pagan deities , the account of which is wholly void of poetical interest . Then the vague @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I Here , too , the knowledge is not very profound . The art with which it is all elaborated is of course extremely remarkable . The descriptions are in many ways very complete ; they have an appearance of accuracy , but it is a sort of accuracy that exists for itself , to endure criticism , much more than to call up any feeling in the reader , except one of amazement at the author 's industry . In the whole book there is not a breath of poetry ; there is nothing more than this very gilded setting of a dramatic subject , which is very nearly lost under the weight of ornament . Is it an allegory ' ? Its complexity would seem to forbid this explanation . Does it teach us anything about any possible Saint Anthony ? Hardly . No , it would be hard to avoid calling this a very disappointing book . No accuracy in details , no exactness in arcineology can breathe life into these visions , which are narrated with more than Pre-Raphaelite distinctness . There is a certain feeling of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of information , but for all the rest he lacks complete enjoyment . The classical and oriental facts which M. Flaubert has collected and displayed , with the label of the Temptation of Saint Anthony , confuse the reader 's mind and make him forget , amid all the turmoil of these visions , what it might be supposed that the book would describe , and the omission of which is so disappointing : and that is the hermit himself . We have but very faint indications of the manner in which the gorgeous panorama affected him . The Sphinx and Chima*ra themselves can not make up to us for this omission . He appears to be seen as one of the dramatis personce , but he is vaguer than all the rest of the characters ; even the unnamable ones are more fully described . As a picture of a possible man the book is a lamentable failure , and as a picture of a certain , definite Saint Anthony it is still more of a failure . A more fervent imagination would have aided the dramatic part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of details which of necessity have only a secondary value ; they have the effect of bringing before our minds , not Saint Anthony , whose knowledge of Buddhism must have been extremely limited , but the author , who has exhausted his erudition to interest and amaze , but not to delight us . Such realism appears as but a 242 August , // barren method ; it is neither truth nor a probable representation of truth . It fails , as many of the modern pictures of antiquity fail , because while interesting and generally accurate in the curiosities represented , it sins against the spirit of antiquity in carrying back the modern analytic feeling to Mn . FEnGussoN 's recently issued volume , the History of the Modern Styles of Architecture , 1 is meant as the fourth volume ( the first published ) of a new and extended edition of his History of Architecture , a work which has been elaborated from his Handbook of Architecture , published in 1855 , and which first appeared under its present title in 1867 .

The excised chapters are to be expanded into a third volume , on Indian architecture alone , which will be published next year . Mr. Fergusson 's history , being the only extended general history of architecture in English , is probably known to most of our readers who have an interest in its subject . Its only English competitor , so fa.r as we know , is Mr. Freeman 's history , a more philosophical and in some respects more interesting work , but much less complete .

The arrangement and sequence are still a little too much like those of a hand-book to be quite satisfactory in what is called a history ; though the habit acquired in the earlier works , and the difficulty of tracing a continuous development in a phase of art so much the subject of individual caprice , were perhaps an irresistible temptation to this treatment . T9 a foreigner , in whose eyes English architecture from the days of Wren to those of Barry is utterly insignificant , England seems to occupy an undue share of Mr. Fergusson 's pages , being given the greatest prominence next to Italy ; but the book was written for Englishmen . France is but slightly treated , in spite of the author 's evidently greater respect for her art on the whole ; and Germany Renaissance is dismissed with but little examination , and the general remark that " during these three centuries not a single architect was produced of whom even his compatriots are proud , or whose name is remembered in other countries ; and not a single building erected , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor one that calls forth the admiration of even the most patriotic Germans themselves . " The works of Schinkel , however , and those of the reign of King Ludwig in Munich , receive their share of attention .

New York : ScrThner , Welford &amp; Co. 1873. // cesses in building in the United States entitle us to , though the examples are not on the whole very happily chosen . The preface says that the writer knows of no modern work of the same scope ; we know of none in French , and in German Liibke and Burckhardt 's continuation of Kugler 's history , a more extended though less elegant work than Fergusson 's , is not , or at least was not a few months ago , all published . Mr. Fergusson is among the most catholic of writers on art ; his judgments are always moderate and judicial , his wide range of study makes him freer from partiality and prejudice than many of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antipathies of his own . A drawback to his criticism is his lack , or at least the omission from his books , of a clear scheme or well-digested code of principles . This is characteristic of his countrymen , in whose architectural teaching there is no established system , and a marked distinction from the French architects , whose criticism is systematic , whatever its other merits may be ; and it is a great bar to unity in the book before us . His examples are taken up seriatim , in geographical or chronological order , each case considered pretty much alone , or grouped only with its immediate neighbors , and any rule or principle by which it is judged given only incidentally . Hence a student or general reader , who should come to the book in hope of learning how to judge for himself , would be likely to leave it with a confused notion of what characteristics he ought to approve or disapprove , unless he had the tenacity to remember and educe from a thousand disconnected examples the laws which lie at the bottom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what may be called technical and asthetic laws , as for instance in proportion , grouping , management of detail , and the like ; for on the general laws of honesty , perspicuity , independence , decorum , which rule in architecture as in all the concerns of life , Mr. Fergusson is explicit enough . In spite of all this his criticisms , the fruit of strong common-sense guided by long experience and abundant learning , seem to readers who know the examples to which they refer , almost always sound . He has , too , a rare impartiality in recognizing the merits and defects of buildings , apart from his own predilections in point of style . In fact , his studious care to do justice to both excellences and faults may often give his judgments an air of indecision , and even , to a hasty reader , of inconsistency . Perhaps the most characteristic and interesting part of the present volume , at least as a matter of discussion , is the introduction , in which the author considers with lively interest the present tendencies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole modern movement in architecture - he writes mainly of England - is wrong , being purely imitative and servile . Hence in the great contest between Gothicists and classicists , he espouses neither side ; but since his sympathies incline to classical rather than medheval art , and since the Gothicists are at present the aggressive party , he has naturally come to blows with them ; and everybody who has seen his career without prejudice must admire the fairness and courtesy , as well as the ability , with which he has fought on what seems to us the losing side . It is curious and instructive to watch the turn this contest has taken . A quarter of a century ago the Gothicists , led in literature by Ruskin and the second Pugin , - who quarreled bitterly enough between themselves , - were at the hottest of their fighting for new principles , and the style in which alone they saw them embodied . Their principles , indeed , - of honesty , candor , expressiveness of purpose and construction , - though long forgotten , were irresistible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and are insisted on at this day by all thoughtful and honest architects ; but the style which was supposed to be inseparable from them is far from having equally prevailed . At this day Sir Pighy Wyatt , lecturing at Cambridge on like subjects with Mr. Ruskin at Oxford , enforces like principles of design , and in practice holds imperturbably to classical and " Italian " forms . Gothicists and classicists now go to battle with the same cry . Mr. Fergusson takes , as we have indicated , strong ground against both modern Gothic and modern classic architecture . He urges justly the distinction between the Renaissance , in which the details of classic art were borrowed and used with freedom , and the recent revivals , in which both details and general forms were assumed as completely as possible ; but he fails to take account that the Renaissance was an attempted revival , though at first very imperfect ( as far as this its real purpose was concerned ) , and that the modern revival was only its legitimate consummation . He argues very // Art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a system of lifeless copying , and that on the one side and the other the only effort is to produce as perfect a counterfeit as possible . Jn such a condition , he msintains , both parties are under different names pursuing hopelessly the same wrong path . As a means of escaping this degradation of servility he advocates the adoption of what he calls the Italian style , which however , so far as it has any existence , is only an accumulation of classical and Renaissance forms , made more or less tractable to modern purposes by being broken away from their old matrices , as any other forms might be . It is true that till recently England has been divided between classical and medieval pedantry , but now the bonds of both are loosening , and the common-sense principles of architectural design are recognized by both parties . The struggle is virtually between predilections for one and another of two different series offorms . The French are too fertile of invention to be patient of mere copyism , and have never yielded to it except for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Germans too , less prescriptive than the English , have by virtue of their native ingenuity constrained their inaptitude for art into something better than servility . But with regard to the future of architecture , Mr. Fergusson speaks only as an Englishman to Englishmen . He does not even analyze the present condition and tendency of French architecture , which shows the nearest approach made in our day to the development of a style ; but contents himself with a mention and examination of a few buildings . No doubt he is right in condemning copyism in either style , but we think he does not do justice to the present tendency of modern Gothic . It seems to us to have already got beyond mere copyism , and to be tending away from it . Even in the new Law Courts , whose design Mr. Fergusson has opposed with all his might , Mr. Street , though he does apparently aim most closely at preserving the historical propriety of his style , introduces many forms for which Mr. Fergusson would be hard pushed to find prototypes in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to us decidedly toward great license - as great as we should be likely to use in a style of our own invention . As Mr. Fergusson admits , we must start from some style or styles . It is utterly impossible for any but savages to start , as some 245 people expect us to do in our time , with no accepted forms , and reinvent everything from the beginning . The device is between a loose eclecticism , which will leave us any year just where we were the last , and a steady development in some one direction . But if we ask which of the now conflicting styles best answers to the spirit and wants of the world of to-day , to its multiplied activity , its endless variety of invention , its informality , and its impatience of restraint , the decision is quick , we think , between the rigid , stately , and impassive classic , either in its original forms or its modern variations , and the pliant , inventive , ever-varying Gothic . If we wish our architecture to have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be independent of our own character and our habits ,  --  and this is a common and intelligible , though perhaps not a reasonable aspiration , - there is endless room for choice.4 If it is to be a reflex of our life and requirements , none of the styles now in use seems to us so fit a starting-point as the modern Gothic . It would be a singular phenomenon , by the way , if in an age as cosmopolitan as this , two styles should grow up and continue side by side , among two nations in daily and hourly communication with each other , as different in form as the present work of the French and English architects ; such different styles have not grown together in the civilized world since the days of the Greeks and Egyptians . Mr. Fergusson does not recede from his classification of arts into " technic** and " phonetic , " by which he so exasperated Mr. Rushin when he first brought it forward in his Principles of Beauty in Art . To us , he seems in this to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between arts of expression and arts of convenience , or in common words , fine arts and useful arts ; but , in his zeal for classification , to forget that architecture , which he classes as simply technic in opposition to painting and sculpture which are phonetic , is at once a fine art and a useful art , or if he will , technic and phonetic together . When , therefore , he complains that , being technic , it has been since the Renaissance practiced simply as if it were phonetic , we should translate him by saying that its decoration , instead of being developed from its uses , had been studied as if it were inde // pendent of them . But he touches here another point which is vital to us , when he says : " Perhaps the greatest inconvenience is the remarkably small amount of thought of any kind that a modern building ever displays . . . in one glance you see it all . With five minutes ' study you have mastered the whole design . In a work of true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is different . . . . You have the dream and aspiration of the bishop who designed it , of the master mason , who was skilled in construction , of the carver , the painter , the glazier , of the host of men who , each in his own craft , knew all that had been done before them . . . . There is not one shaft , one molding , one carving , not one chisel mark in such a building , that was not designed specially for the place where it is found .... You may wander in such a building for weeks or months together , and never know it all . " And later on more concisely : " They Renaissance designs are little more than one man 's contribution of thought - a real classical or mediuval design includes that of hundreds . " We may say , by the way , that though we have no accounts of the processes by which classical buildings were carried out , there is every indication in the nature of the work that both Greek and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using a fixed form of indefinitely repeated detail , as modern or Renaissance buildings ; and herein lies the broadest distinction in spirit between them and medieval work . The distinction is marked with equal clearness by Mr. Ruskin in the second volume of the Stones of Venice , in his chapter on the Nature of Gothic  --  and this is a point of the greatest importance to us now . It involves the question whether we shall have an architecture , and remotely other decorative arts , in which everything shall be rigidly fixed to the smallest details by the first designer , - in which case the only choice in any large work will be between utter baldness , and an endless and formal repetition of a limited number of details , - or one in which the subordinate parts shall be designed by men skilled in them , under the guidance only of one leading mind : an art , on the one hand , which may be elegant and stately , but must be limited in idea , formal and monotonous ; or on the other , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfect in its kind , very likely , but infinitely more highly organized . It is the vital distinction between classical and modern art and mediteval , between the spirits of a despotism and of a commonwealth . Whatever may be our preferences in the matter of form , there can be no doubt that the medieval method is the healthier and the more progressive . It is , as Mr. Fergusson points out , the way in which our mechanic arts advance so steadily and to such wonderful excellence ; and whatever may be the form in use , it will oniy be fully developed when we have a class of workmen who are skilled , like those in the Middle Ages , to design their parts of the work and execute them from sketches or slight indications only , without working drawings . There is a foundation for something of this sort in France , where the government has given much pains to the artistic education of workmen , though there the character of their work is too much the result of pr* scription , and too little of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aims of working-men is worth considering . At present the efforts of trades unions and strikers are to make mechanics ' work as perfunctory as possible , and to bring all down to the level of the poorest workmen . Such an interest and pride in their work as belonged to the medieval guilds would be the happiest possible corrective for this tendency . The more purely mechanical and unthinking a man 's work is , the more he will shirk it , or subordinate it to some other interest ; the more it engages his better powers and responsibility , the more pride he will take in it , and the more interest he will feel in the social order which encourages and protects it . It is impossible to imagine the order of free masons in the fourteenth century set to tearing down cathedrals ; but four years ago the workmen of Paris were mad for the destruction of her palaces . // IT is becoming more and more plainly evident that our best musical institutions are beginning fully to appreciate the principle of *usthetic education . The Harvard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fundamental principle of action . The Hiindel and Haydn Society have shown in their last triennial festival that they are more than ever persuaded of its importance . In glancing back upon this festival , the earnest music-lover must consider it an event wholly without paralltl in the history of music in this country . We can look through programme after programme of similar festivals in England without finding ourselves in so evenly pure an aesthetic atmosphere . In all the six days of the festival there were performed at the very most but two or three pieces unworthy of a place on such an occasion . With the exception of Cheruhini , all the really great names in modern music were represented . As usual the place of honor was given to Mendelssohn . Counting the extra performance of Elijah , Mendelssobn 's name appeared seven times on the programme . Next in order came Bach and Beethoven , who appeared four times each . The extraordinary popularity of Mendelssohn in England and America is by no means difficult to account for . Mendelssohn unites in himself almost all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A most clear , transparent style ; great melodic power ; a perfection of form that is unexcelled by any other composer ; rich and effective orchestration ; dramatic power , or at the least , great dramatic ingenuity , are all to be found in his music . He is , moreover , almost constantly artistically as well as morally refined . Mendelssohn is eminently the gentleman-composer ; he never struggles after an effect , he is never obtrusively self-conscious ; he sometimes rises to a great height of formal beauty , sometimes , though much more rarely , to great beauty of sentiment ; he never shocks you by inelegance or vulgarity ; he is always eminently respectable ; but the Staubbach is not further from Niagara than he is from genuine g-reataess . Of all the things of Mendelssohn that were given at the festival , the most thoroughly beautiful , to our thinking , is the soprano solo and chorus , " Oh for the wings of a dove , " in the motette , " Hear my prayer . " Here , if anywhere , Mendelssohn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A certain refined , poetic atmosphere pervades the whole , without in the least obscuring the purely devotional spirit , as is too often the case with Mendelssohn . The solo and chorus , " The enemy shouteth , " in the same work , is dramatically effective , at best . The few numbers from the posthumous oratorio , Christus , were certainly interesting , as what unfinished , posthumous work of a man of Mendelssohn 's prestige is not l In some of them great beauties lie even on the surface . The chorus , " There shall a star from Jacob come forth , " can be compared with anything the composer h ' written , as far as mere beauty of form goes . It is in the composer 's most lyricmelodious vein ; it were difficult to imagine anything more enchanting than the graceful rise and fall of the voices in the first twenty-eight bars ; had it been a Mahomet 's promise of eternal hasheesh and narghil6s , it could not have been more fascinating . Only at the words , " And dash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's hand become paralytic in its attempt at strength . From this point it gets weaker and weaker , until in the choral , " As bright the star of morning gleams , " it becomes little better than mere churchchoir psalmody . What this choral harmony might have seemed , h4d not Sebastian Bach done the same thing in so incomparably stronger a way , we can not tell ; but the comparison with Bach which it forces upon the mind maIns it appear almost unbearably feeble . In the short turbcr3 , or people 's choruses , the composer has evidently made every attempt at dramatic effect . These choruses are to a certain extent brilliant . The restless twelve-eighths measure of " He stirreth up the Jews " has at least a disquieting effect , rather of the nervous involuntary sort , and the " Crucify him " ( notwithstanding a bad false quantity , which exists in German as well as in English ) is in its opening phrase peculjarly effective . Here Mendelssohn , who never for a moment forgot that he was above all 247 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of drastic realism that has rather a tendency to disarm criticism , if only from the fact that it does not fly in the face of any principle of formal art ; " We have a sacred law " comes out in a bold , trumpet-like phrase , which rather disappoints one in not sounding as effectively as it looks on paper , with the traditional diminished seventh chord on " Let him suffer . " But after all , these choruses , in spite of their dramatic truthfulness , are somehow wanting in just that indescribable , intangible element which we call strength , power , or grandeur . Mendelssohn has put into all his people 's choruses a certain brassbound , heartless , pagan element that is unpleasant rather than impressive . We feel this in all the Christus turbw , in the Baal choruses in Elijah , even in the " Oh be gracious " in Saint Paul , which has one knows not what uncanny , barbaric tang of Mumbo Jumbo worship to it . Whether this character be the result of an instinctive tendency or of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justifiable on naturalistic dramatic grounds , but it is nevertheless repulsive rather than impressive , muscular rather than powerful . The exceedingly defective condition in which Bach , like Hhtudel , left his scores , acted for a long while as an insuperable obstacle to any satisfactory performance . Even as far back as Mozart 's time this difficulty was felt to be a serious one . Mozart rescored nearly the whole of Handel 's Messiah ( not always in the best style ) . Mendelssohn wrote out a complete organ part for Israel in Egypt , and wholly rescored Acis and Galatea in a manner which smacked much more of Mendelssohn than of Hijudel . It was long before anything of the kind was done with Bach . At last Robert Franz filled out the scores of the Saint Matthew Passion-music , the Magnificat in D , and some other of Bach 's works , as well as H*ndel 's L'Allegro , II Penseroso ed ii Moderato . The manner in which Franz has done his work is so superb as to leave all previous attempts far behind . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artistically justifiable or not , has been the subject of much discussion and counter-discussion of late , but it is one which we can not enter on bore . The rescoring of works like the Passion must be looked at from a distinct point of view . As far as the purely contrapuntal part of the work is concerned , there can hardly be two opinions about Franz 's score . It is simply above praise , from its musical perfection and its complete adherence to Bach 's style . This part of the work of completing the original score has nothing whatever in common with what is technically called rescoring , that is , changing or adding to the mere instrumentation . It has to do with the anatomical structure of the composition itself . As for Franz 's orchestration , it is really superb , as such . It is , moreover , perfectly in harmony with the spirit of the work as we now conceive it . Franz has indubitably given many portions of the work a modern richness of coloring which is different from any orchestral effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Whether this is excusable or not may be the subject of much discussion . To us it is not only excusable but admirable . The whole orchestra of Bach 's day was something wholly and vitally different from that of our own time . Since then some instruments have wholly fallen into disuse ; others have been introduced . The old orchestral coloring has been irreclaimably lost . It is no disrespect to old scores to substitute the modern richer hues for the old ones , whenever it can be done without running counter to the intrinsic spirit of the work . Wherever Bach has aimed at orchestral effects as such , Franz has left them as they stood . He has changed nothing in the score , but has only added what was wanting . The performance of the Passionmusic was in many respects a positive triumph . The great shortcoming was necessarily in the airs . We must be content to wait some years before our singers begin to feel themselves really at home in this music . It is by no means music that can be sung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the orchestral part makes a satisfying delivery of the airs often very difficult . But the choruses went well beyond all expectation ; even ( barring some few wavering bars ) the extremely difficult opening chorus . An interesting question arises in regard to the tempi of the various solos and choruses , as taken by Mr. Zerrahn . We give for comparison the tempi of a few choruses and solos as taken at the performance of the Passion in Berlin by the Singacademie tinder the leadership of Grell , in 1870 , at the St. Thomas church in Leipzig , on Good Friday , 1870 , at the recent performance by the Elindel and Haydn Society , and the metronome marks in Franz 's score . // BerlIn , April 1870 .

The marks in the first three columns were taken by competent musicians at the several performances , with the second hand of a watch . It will be seen at a glance that Franz 's tempi are wuch faster than the others . In the first chorus , indeed , he is more than twice as fast as Grell . Zerrahn is markedly faster than either Grell or Rietz , but by no n*ans so fttst as Franz . This enormous discrepancy may be accounted for in two ways . In the first place , Franz probably used a metronome . As metronomes are made , the chances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , that is , one which when set is 60 did not strike once per second . In the second place , Franz has been of late years seriously deaf , so that ho probably wrote down his metronome marks with the score in one hand and the metronome in the other , humming over the themes to himself . The great difficulty of judging of a tempo while not actually hearing a piece , may be appreciated by any one who will take the trouble to try it . We would not then set too high a value upon Franz 's metronome marks . Even Zerrahn 's tempi often sounded to us unreasonably fast , especially in the tenor air , No. 25 . Imagine the grand first chorus rushing along at the pace Franz has indicated ! The effect would , no doubt , be one of immense power , but would not the chorus express ungovernable tragic fury rather than sorrowing lamentation ? Would it not be more a passionate cry for vengeance than a tearful invitation to fellowship in grief and mourning ? This wonderful chorus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be regretted by all who are anxious to interest the musical public at large in the Passion-music and in Bach 's choral works generally , that the selections made by the Hiludel and Haydn Society were almost wholly in the same strain . There is no lack of variety and contrasts in the work , in spite of the vein of deep tragedy that necessarily runs through it . The only numbers that represented the more brilliant , dramatic side of the work were the duet , " Alas ! my Jesus now is taken , " with the double chorus , " Ye lightnings , ye thunders ! " in the first part , and the recitative about the rending of the veil in the temple , in the second part . We would have gladly heard more of these dramatic numbers , more of the stormy turban . The scene before Pontius Pilate and the whole scene of the crucifixion were unaccountably omitted . We think that for a first venture , it would have been more judicious to have given as much as possible of this highly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the simple chorals which are to be easily enjoyed by any audience , than to have given almost exclusively the merely contemplative part of the work , especially the long and taxing arias , for which neither our audience nor our singers are as yet quite ripe . It is unfortunate that Bach , of all composers , should have been first introdticed to our public by his least seductive side ; at all events , that phase of his genius has always been presented first which was the least calculated to enlist the sympathies of our musical public . In his instrumental music , we first became acquainted with his great organ fugues and toccatas , and the first things we heard of his // 1JLu*w. vocal compositions were the airs in the Passion . These airs are a running commentary upon the dramatic action in the work , for we must insist that the basis of the work is essentially dramatic . Divorced from their surroundings , these airs can only appeal to the public through their purely musical beauty , which is indeed of the very highest grade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to be generally felt , excepting after thorough acquaintance . We can not but think that these very airs , taken in connection with what logically precedes and follows them , would be much more quickly appreciated than is otherwise possible . To make this more plain , we will take an example . At the Hiindel and Haydn Society 's performance , the choral No. 53 , " Commit thy ways , 0 pilgrim , " was immediately followed by the long soprano recita*-tive and air , " He hath done only good to all , " and that by the choral , " 0 head all bruised and wounded . " The whole dramatic action which gives rise to and accounts for these numbers was omitted . This omission was furthermore unfortunate as it brought three slow , solemn movements into immediate contact with each other . In the original text the choral , " Commit thy ways " is followed by the alternately descriptive and dramatic recitative containing Pilate 's am peal to the people , which reaches its climax at the phrase , " Whether of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " upon which the chorus thunders out " Barabbas ! " in the most blood-curdling diminished seventh chord that we know of in all music . Then follows Pilate 's question , " What shall I do then with Jesus which is called Christ * " Upon which the chorus again answers with the prolonged shriek , growing in fearful inteasity as it goes on , of " Let him be crucified 1 " The dramatic interest has here been worked up to an almost unbearable pitch of intensity . Now Bach steps in with the commentary in the calm , grandly tragic choral , " How wonderful is this punishmeat ! " Then comes a short return to dramatic action in Pilate 's question , " Why , what evil hath he done i " when the soprano voice answers in sad recitative , half in reply , half in commentary : " He hath done only good to all . The blind have back their sight through him ; the lame again are walking  --  - - beside my Jesu nought hath done , " followed by the sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love , my Saviour dieth . " Then the dramatic thread is taken up again , and the chorus August , reiterates its clamorous demand , " Let him be crucified 1 " The choral , " 0 head all bruised and wounded , " comes in somewhat later , immediately after the sneering chorus , " Hail , King of the Jews ! " and the evangelist 's recitative , " And they spit upon him , and took the reed , and smote him on the head . " No doubt the intrinsic musical beauty of these long , sad airs is really a thousand times more important than their dramatic relation to the rest of the work . But what we insist upon is that nine persons out of ten will be first drawn towards them by their intimate connection with their dramatic surroundings , rather than by their musical merit p*ir Se ; and that if the public can by any means be brought to like them , we must not look too closely into the mental operation by which such liking is brought about . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want of apprecintion of the airs , the performance of the Passion w ' sso flattering a success that one can really find but little fault . The thunder and lightning chorus created as much enthusiasm as anything that has ever been sung in the music hall , and , although it was the closing chorus of a part , it had to be repeated . We hope that this great work , having nowbeen formally introduced to our public , will not be allowed to lie upon the shelf in future . Accounting the production of the Passion as the most important feature of the festival , the next most important was certainly the production of two choral works by American composers , namely , John K. Paine 's Saint Peter , and Dudley Buck 's Forty-sixth Psalm . In Mr. Buck 's composition we have a work that at once commands our respect from its excellence of form and purity of style . It begins with a short , sonorous orchestral introduction , which in the very opening bars betrays the composer 's fondness for those rich , sensuous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find so constantly in all his writings . This introduces a beautifully written and exceedingly melodious chorus in F to the first three verses of the psalm . If this chorus is in some places of not quite Titanic strength , it is certainly not wanting in great beauty of form , and in some places it is extremely brilliant . If it have a fault , it is that it is often rather too sweet ; the harmonies have at times a somewhat too caressing grace . The fourth and fifth verses of the psalm are set as a soprano solo and double quartette . The number is // **Eusic. melodious and well-written , and both voices and instruments are well and effectively used , but the style is rather light for the subject , and the music too often merely pleasing , at times almost trivial . The third number , a recitation for bass voices , is one of the strongest in the work . lit comprises the sixth verse of the psalm , and leads directly to number four , the theme of which is first given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chorus . This chorus , comprising the seventh verse , is the most brilliant piece of writing in the work . The theme , albeit somewhat common-place , has much dash and brilliancy in it , and is most effectively wt*rked up , with an occasional tendency , to be sure , as we have said of the opening chorus , to the redundantly sensuous ; for instance in the long pedal on the dominant beginning at the bottom of page 38 , and the ensuing modulation as far as the first bar on page 41 , the purely religious element runs great risk of being lulled to sleep , while the ear is pillowed on such downy harmonies . The next number , a tenor solo on the words of the eighth and ninth verses , is extremely beautiful : the lovely , finely articulated melody showing not only great sensibility to formal beauty ( of which there is no lack throughout the work ) , but even great refinement and some depth of feeling . The middle allegro in A minor is full of strength and dramatic fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about . The return to the first andante in A major is well managed . The last two bars of the air , however , do not satisfy us , neither can we quite understand them . There seems to be a bar wanting . Number six , comprising the tenth verse , is a well-written quartette . The final chorus , after a few full chords , strikes in with the theme of number four , which is briefly worked up in fugue form , soon followed by a more elaborate fugue on a new subject , but the original theme returns again with a long pedal on the dominant , and is worked up to the end with a constant acceleration of tempo . The end is not quite worthy of the rest of the work , being rather wanting in dignity , and not particularly effective . The work , as a whole , has many great beauties to offset its not unfrequent weaknesses , and is certainly a composition that Americans have every reason to be proud of . It moreover , by its very merits , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with gloved hands , would be to at once place it in that dubious class of first attempts , to which it in no way belongs . Mr. Buck has earned the right to be treated fairly and on a level , without being shielded behind considerations of nationality or inexperience . He has well won his  |p0-sition  as a composer , and now and henceforth his works , and his works alone , must be his weapons of defense in it It would be difficult to find in the whole range of sacred choral music two works more totally dissimilar at every point than Dudley Buck 's Yorty-sixth Psalm and John K. Paine 's Saint Peter . Such being the case , we shall make no comparison whatever between the two works . If Mr. Paine have a distinguishing quality as a composer it is that of strength . When his Mass in D , a work of considerable power and great formal beauty , was published in 1866 , his command over musical form was at once evideilt . But his studies of other composers were then too recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very original track . Since then , what might be called the intellectual side of his genius has developed itself with astounding rapidity . One can not look through his compositions that are spread over the last five or six years , without being struck by the ever increasing , at times really startling , originality of his insthetic conceptions . As originality of matter and conception must sooner or later necessitate originality of form , we find that that mastery over musical form which Mr. Paine bad so perfectly acquired , did not stand him in so good stead , as his original conceptions began to develop themselves , as it had while his a3sthetie conceptions were more or less the reflex of other minds . Indeed , the old finished perfection of form began gradually to disappear from his compositions as the matter grew in strength and vitality . His power of completely realizing his conceptions has decreased . In fact , we may say that his ideal has slipped the leash , and that his life-work is henceforth to be a lifechase after it . And is this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the man of mere talent I The man of talent always has his ideal where he can drop his pinch of salt upon it , take it in his hand and tangibly present it to the world ; the man of genius follows his high ideal through life , ever drawing nearer to it , without winning it . Saint Peter is awork which // A1u8w. it is almost impossible , for us at least , to criticise . Well acquainted as we had thought ourselves with Mr. Paine 's later style , there are many places in the oratorio in which , even after careful study , we can not as yet find ourselves at home . But even those passages which are puzzling in their unintelligibility , never give the impression that the composer has nothing to say . We feel that they are rather struggles after expression , than after an idea . In some places , - as , for example , in the final chorus , - it seems as if the composer hardly gave himself time to fix , much less to realize his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to something new ; so overcharged is the chorus with ideas , so full of but partially assimilated matter . On the other hand he has in some places given the most vivid expression to conceptions of overpowering grandeur , as in the chorus , " The Son of man was delivered into the hands of sinful men . " Throughout the work Mr. Paine shows a horror of the trivial and commonplace that seems to be genuine and spontaneous . This is by no means rare with composers of the present day , the passion for originality being quite a prevailing one . But in many composers ( Goldmark , Svendsen , for instance , et hoc genus omne ) this striving after originality seems to be something wholly self-conscious , tempting them on to hideous excesses , while they can only charm us when , forgetful of their self-imposed dignity of original genius , they now and then talk quite pleasantly and even gracefully in their natural , commonplace vein . Mr. Paine , on the contrary , we feel to be most at home when he is most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in him . In Saint Peter the instrumental and vocal parts are the exact complements of each other , the orchestration being an integral feature of the work , not something August , superimposed upon it . Thus some passages that were perfectly baffling at the rehearsals , with piano-forte , became plain enough when heard with the orchestra . To take one instance among many , the disagreeable effect of the seventh between the soprano and alto in the seventh bar of the chorus , " If ye then be risen with Christ , " which everybody who sang in the chorus must remember as intolerably grating entirely disappeared when the orchestra stepped in . We do not purpose to give a detailed analysis of the work . For this we refer the reader to a previous number . ' We would only say in conclusion that we know very few works of so great promise as Saint Peter . Faults it undoubtedly has , but in some passages it rises to a pitch of grandeur and power that we look for in vain in many works of world-wide reputation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is unnecessary to speak , as they have by this time become familiar as household words to most of our public . Of the manner in which the various works were performed we have little but praise to say . The Society 's chorus has never been in such good singing condition , and the orchestra , of which Theodore Thomas 's orchestra formed the nucleus , was by far the best we have yet heard in Boston . The Society undertook to do an immense amount of work , and some of the newly performed compositions suffered from want of sufficient rehearsing with the orchestra ; but taken as a whole , the performances were a positive triumph . One little point we would , however , express our astonishment at ; namely , that ever since the Thomas orchestra first bit our public with the Triiumerei-pianissimo mania , Mr. Zerrahn should have persistently left out the wind instruments in the second half of the Pastoral Symphony in the Messiah . It is an inexcusable bit of sentimentalism. 1 Atlantic for August , 1873. // @ //    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
