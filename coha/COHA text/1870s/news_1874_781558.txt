txt Although the French can hardly be said to have attached much political significance to the recent visit of the Empress of Russia and the Grand Dukes , her sons , to Paris , they were nevertheless gratified by it . Sonic of the Parisian journalists wrote mysterious paragraphs , intimating that the Emperor of all the Russias was inclined to bestow much ' sympathy on the French Republic ; and that the visit of his Queen was chosen as the occasion for demonstrating that , whatever Germany might wish to do to embarrass the growth of the young Republic , Russia would not assist by word or deed . But this idle gossip was wasted on the ears of the great majority of Frenchmen , who saw iu the visit of the royal lady and her sons only a chance to make a good impression , and . who improved it . Had . it been a visit from the Emperor ALEXANDER himself they might have been more cautious , and probably would have felt bound to invite the occupants of the German Legation Hotel to assist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guest was a lady , they allowed their gallantry to get the better of their desire to prevent any gossip , and Paris ' blossomed into such fetes and splendors as , in later years , it has rarely seen . There was not much of republican simplicity or austerity in the reception which France , through the means of its MarshalPresident , offered the Russian Empress and Grand Dukes . There was , on the contrary , a touch of the old lavish splendor of Louis XIV . ' s time in all the feastings and . merrymakings . As the Empress is passionately fond of . flowers , wagons filled with rarest and costliest blooms were daily sent to the Embassy of Russia during her stay In Paris ; all the great notables went daily to do her homage ; the new Opera-house , as yet unconsecrated to the gods of song , was illuminated , and the Grand Dukes , attended at a respectful distance by the Marshal , were shown the decorations of the finest musical temple ' in the world , and admired the paintings of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , geldings , and mirrors . During their stay the republican President also entertained the imperial party at a banquet in the Palace of the Elys6e , after which a reception was given , and clever comedians , on an extemporized stage , beguiled the time with sprightly pieces from the repertoire of the Parisian theatres . The Empress , meantime , wandered incognita in a private carriage along the boulevards , or at her hotel received every one of note , save the German Ambassador and the selfstyled " Ring of Spain " ? the former of whom had the good sense not to call . And when the Empress was ready to depart for San Remo , where she hopes to recover her ' shattered health during the Winter , she was ushered into a superb imperial railway carriage , as large as seven ordinary ones , and forming " a sumptuous apartment , " and all Paris rushed to the station to see the party off . These various attentions , quite equal in grandeur to any offered by NAPOLEON to crowned heads in the famous Exposition year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , did not escape the notice of the curious and vigilant Germans , who were possibly a little nettled at the gratified and gracious manner iu which the Empress and the Grand Dukes received them , but who , on the whole , maintained their dignity.very well . Anything tending to mark an open alliance between France and Russia would certainly cause much commotion in - Germany , and possibly some efforts to nip it in the bud would be made ; but the indications are not yet definite enough to justify any such endeavors . That there is warm friendship and sympathy between the two peoples , there is no doubt ; but it is not , therefore , certain that in the next great European war they might not be antagonists . For the present , it swims as if they were disposed to be friends and allies ; and it ) s beyond peradventure that if the French were sure of a Russian alliance , . they would hasten the beginning of that war of vengeance which they . now prudently postpone while they consolidate their resources , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
