ARTICLE YL-REVIEW OF DR . WOOLSEY 'S NEW WORK , " POLITICAL SCIENCE . " Political Science , or the State Theoretically and Practically considered . By THEODORE P. WOOLSEY , lately President of Yale College . Two vols . Svo , pp. 585 , 626 . New York : Scribner , Armstrong , and Company . 1878. iT was the singular fortune of the United States of America that they came into existence as a distinct political system , not only as a direct result of political controversy , but during a period of unexampled discussion of political theories . Only at such a juncture , and as a result of such prolonged agitation , could a system so highly artificial in its character , and so complex in its arrangements , have been created . The century whose close witnessed the beginning of the contest between the colonies and the mother country was the century which began with ilobbes and ended with Rousseau , and it is safe to say that during no other hundred years of the world 's history had so much acute and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nature , and ends of political society . In no former age had the ultimate principles of political science been so profoundly explored , and so earnestly and enthusiastically debated . The first permanent settlements of the English in the new world coincided with the beginning of these discussions , and the settlements largely owed their success to a class of men to whom such discussions were especially congenial . The theological system so curiously interwoven with primitive New England institutions developed a marked aptitude for the handling of abstract principles , and during the entire colonial period speculative politics were regarded with marked favor . Hence the habit of going back to first principles came , in time , to modify very sensibly the English habit of deciding questions mainly in the light of usage and tradition . The passion for abstract speculation thus imparted to the most intelligent and best educated portion of colonial society by one great French thinker , no doubt did a great deal to prepare // the way for a more ready reception of the theories of another , strangely unlike the first in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the daring with which he pushed his premises to their logical results . it would be , perhaps , too much to assert that the writings of Rousseau exerted any direct influence on the development of American political opinion , but the fact is incontestible that the tendencies of thought which gave birth to the Contrat Socia4 and gained for it such enormous currency , existed to a considerable extent on this side the water , and that the maxim which Mr. Jefferson incorporated into the opening sentence of the Declaration of Independence was not a mere rhetorical flourish , but the sincer* expression of a principle which , in the rapid growth of public opinion , had been clothcd with the force of a political dogma . It illustrates , in a most striking manner , the extent to which abstract political theory had entered into the controversy with the mother country , and sets in unmistakable contrast the English Revolution of 1688 and the American Revolution of 1776 . It has been the fashion to praise the founders of the republic as practical men who postponed political theories to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose fervid imagination played such astonishing tricks with the concrete facts for which he always professed the most profound respect , declared of the colonists that they were not only devoted to liberty , but to liberty according to English ideas and on English principles . The praise was equally sincere and deserved , yet it only expressed half the truth . The American Revolution meant redress of actual grievances , but it meant , too , something more . No one can understand it , in all its bearings , who persists in regarding it as simply the result of the Navigation Acts . The most cursory examination of the documents which illustrate it will suffice to show that public opinion in the colonies had , in some most important respects , departed from English traditions , and that to the more thoughtful and far-seeing leaders it was early made manifest that more was involved in the contest than a mere question of parliamentary jurisdiction . The claim of representation even , in the form asserted by the colonies , rested on // a maxim unknown to English law , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussion which the controversy elicited , the speech of Lord Mansfield , was declared to be a claim which , if allowed , went to the whole constitution of the British empire . English precedents , he maintained , would be searched in vain in its support . The primary postulate on which the Declaration of Ir*dependence rested , a postulate implied if not asserted in the Constitution , was a political maxim which the colonists not only did not bring with them from the mother country , but one that stood in flat contradiction with the theory to which the English constitution conformed . The English system aimed at the balance of three original estates ; the American implied the undivided sovereignty of one homogeneous people . It is undoubtedly true that the men who framed our federal constitution were not democrats , and it was very far from their purpose to found a democratic republic . The familiar anecdote which Mr. Jefferson has preserved of the discussion between Mr. Adams and General Hamilton , at the dinner table of President Washington , proves what was the feeling among those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Purge the English constitution , " said Mr. Adams , " of its corruption , and give to its popular branch equality of representation , and it would become the most perfect constitution ever devised by the wit of man . " " Purge it of its corruptions , and give to its popular branch equality of representation , " was General Hamilton 's reply , " and it would become an impracticable government ; as it stands at present , with all its supposed defects , it is the most perfect that ever existed . " But nothing connected with our early history is now better understood than the fact that the able and patriotic men who devised our federal system , and who did most to secure its adoption by the several States , did not themselves indulge in any flattering anticipations of its success . With the most influential among them it was at best accepted as a mere make-shift , and was advocated as a temporary refuge from a worse evil . Yet while sincere in their professions of admiration for the English system , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principles which the English system radically opposed , // and were initiating a movement in the logical results of which were involved consequences which they neither anticipated nor desired . This logical inconsistency explains the failure of the great political party which controlled the federal government during the first two administrations , a party conspicuous for ability and character , and embracing by far the larger proportion of the intelligence , the wealth , the social importance of the country , but which inevitably went to the wall because it did not represent the logical working out of the maxims on which the fabric of American liberty was really rested . lilt has been said , and the remark is true , that the framers of our federal constitution were seeking to establish a system of government , and not a political theory , but it is equally true , and it is a fact that should never be lost sight of in order to interpret aright the system which they did establish , that it was , to a wholly unexampled degree , the expression of a theory , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its clauses , it is shaped throughout with reference to one . The mistake has been in regarding it simply as a federal compact , while it is , at the same time , the charter of a democratic republic . And the federal element is subordinate to the democratic , since it is not only ordained in the name of the people , but the several States which are recognized as having a distinct existence under it , are themselves but embodiments of popular sovereignty . No one can understand it who does not read between the lines , who does not constantly keep his eye on the underlying postulates imbedded in its specific provisions . It is not simply a document in the constitutional annals of a single State , but a landmark in the progress of political thought , and can only be comprehended aright when studied in its connection with the whole course of modern public opinion . No one can make this study without becoming satisfied that abstract and speculative elements entered into the American Revolution to a much greater extent than has been commonly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Declaration of Independence for its " glittering generalities . " It did not stand alone . At the close of the struggle the Continental Congress solemnly declared : " Let it be remembered , that it has been the pride and boast of America , that the rights for which she contended were the rights of human nature . " // 408 Review of Dr. Woolsey 's N*'w Work . Coming into existence under these conditions , nothing , at the outset , would seem more likely than that the American people would show a marked aptitude for political discussion , and that their literature , however deficient in other departments , would show some real progress in this direction . The fact has been precisely the reverse . While in historical investigation we can boast of several writers who have gained a European reputation , and in jurisprudence and public law more than one who is reckoned a master , to political science we made , during the first century of the republic , not one important contribution . The striking poverty of our literature in this direction certainly goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that while Americans , on an average , are better judges of concrete political questions than any people on the continent of Europe , their energy of mind is not great enough to give much depth to their thoughts on political problems of a general nature . The most famous work in American political literature , the Federalist , was written with the direct purpose of influencing public opinion with regard to an urgent practical issue , and did not include in its purpose any discussion of first principles . However masterly its handling of the topics which it undertook to discuss , it does not rise to the level of a treatise on political science- It was meant rather to explain the provisions of the Constitution than to explore its premises . To Paine 's Rights of Mart we cheerfully relinquish all claim . It was the work of an Englishman , and was written in France . Whatever credit belongs to it these two countries may be safely left to divide between them . During the quarter of a century that followed the Revolution , the fundamental principles of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and periodicals , but the discussions usually followed a highly abstract and a priori method , and did little to determine any important point . The effects of undue disposition to generalization were now clearly manifested . Half truths were raised to the dignity of first principles , and came to be regarded as beyond dispute because they were so constantly affirmed . No attempt was made to reduce to any scientific analysis what was so generally accepted . The first formal treatise on political science , produced in Amer // ica , was the work of a foreigner , the Political Ethics of Professor Francis Lieber , published in 18*38 ; as the first attempt at a philosophical criticism of our institutions , was also the work of a foreigner , the Democracy in America of Dc Tocqueville . Twenty years later Dr. Lieber published his ( Jivil Libert*q and Self- Government , a discursive essay having especial reference to the state of things then existing in Europe ; and in the same year the historian Huldreth discussed in a small volume the Theory of Politics , with the seeming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it contained no philosophy . To explain a result so unlike what might have seemed the natural consequence of the original conditions of American society we need not , however , resort to an explanation so little flattering to our national pride as that suggested by Von Hoist . We see no reason to suppose that our countrymen are so much absorbed in questions involving material interests that they have not enough energy of mind to give depth to their speculations on general political problems . The true explanation is rather to be sought in the extraordinai-y unanimity of American political sentiment . Vigorous discussion is usually the child of controversy , and men for the most part are first led to explore thoroughly the grounds of their speculative opinions , when those opinions are called in question . Al the most famous political inquiries of modern times had their origin in epochs when great political issues were at stake . They were not the speculations of mere scholars , but aimed at the practical solution of real problems . They were produced when some great issues were at stake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welfare of society , had been denied . In achieving their independence the American people settled down to the recognition of certain fundamental principles , and the generation that followed no more thought of questioning these principles than of questioning the Copernican theory or the law of gravitation . If there existed a few dissenters from the established faith , they never ventured to give any open expression to their heresy . This national creed was simple , and definite , and easily comprehended . It was summed up in the dogma of Popular Sovereignty , a dogma very easily translated into the V*L . I. 27 // popular maxim of the right of the majority to rule . This was assumed as an axiom admitting of no dispute , and standing in need of no vindication . As all legitimate power thus proceeded from the people , all power not exercised by their authority and in accordance witb their will , was a usurpation . Government was strictly limited in its aims , the test of a good government being the scope allowed for individual action . Hence , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which governed least . It was also purely secular in character , exercising its chief function in the protection of property and persons . The lingering attachment in the two oldest New England States to some recognition o* the relation of the State to spiritual interests was forced at length to yield to the advancing tide of secularism . These were the political dogmas accepted by the great majority of the American people during the first half century of their existence as an independent nation . They were devoutly believed , and on each recurring anniversary of the natal day of the republic , it was the fond prediction of American patriotism that they would spread over the whole earth . However warmly men might dispute respecting the interpretation of the Constitution , there was no dispute 1-espeeting its fundamental postulates . No two men could be more directly opposed with regard to some questions than Mr. Webster and Mr. Calhoun ; but they were perfectly agreed with regard to the basis of this political theory . " No man makes a question . " said Mr. Webster , " that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He who would argue against this must argue without an adversary . The aggregate community , the collected will of the people is sovereign . " " The whole system , " Mr. Calhoun remarks , in the same strain , " has for its fundamental principle the great cardinal maxim , that the people are the source of all power . " And with regard to other premises which the Constitution involved , the argument was equally conclusive . Never in the palmiest days of ecclesiastical supremacy were the dogmas of Latin Christianity received with such complete , universal , unquestioning acceptance , as were these political dogmas by the overwhelming majority of the American people . These opinions derived a powerful moral support // from the ecclesiastical theory held by what were the most numerous and influential religious denominations at the time of the adoption of the Constitution . The theory that the State had its origin in voluntary compact lay at the root of all political speculation during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries , and through the powerful support given it by Locke , had been made familiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with such enormous practical force was the fact that it had been actually incorporated into the system of the Congregational and Baptist churches . In the early part of the present century the most conspicuous exponent of Congregational Church polity was no doubt the late Dr. Emmons , and Dr. Emmons writes : " What is it that constitutes a number of visible saints a proper Church ? I aflswer : a mutual covenant . It is by confederation that a number of individual Christians become a visible Church of Christ . Civil government is founded in compact . And it is only by confederation that individual Christians can form themselves into a Church , and bind them . selves to walk together according to the rules of the Gospel . " When a speculative political dogma was thus equally inwrought into the civil and ecclesiastical constitution , and endorsed alike by politicians and divines it is not surprising that any inquiry into the grounds on which it rested should have been deemed surperfluous. it is unnecessary to seek in the characteristics of American intellect for the explanation of such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reposed on a body of political maxims which they did not seek to defend for the reason that they did not dream that these maxims would ever again be called in question . The same law so distinctly exhibited in former periods has asserted itself with us , and public exigency has again proved itself the fruitful parent of political discussion . By the slavery ao'itatio , i the public mind was first turned to problems of civil and political philosophy , and amid much that was crude , and violent , and unreasonable , the need of some deeper justification of political theory became gradually apparent . The meinorable discussion of what was termed the Higher Law gave a powerful impulse to reflection . But it was the breaking out // of the Civil War , and the sudden shipwreck of so many theories which the appeal to arms involved , that rendered some revision of accepted dogmas an imperious necessity . The late Mr. Brownson led the way in a volume marked by all his characteristic vigor , in which he frankly repudiated a thesis which he had valiantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and breadth of treatment , up to that time unexampled in American literature , he discussed the nature of necessity , extent , authority , origin , ground , and constitution of government . It was the great merit of Mr. Brownson that he recognized what was distinctive in the American theory , but for what was the most valuable portion of his works , the clear discrimination between the unwritten and written constitution , he was indebted to the remarkable essay of Mr. Hurd , on The Law of Freedom and Bondage . Following the treatise of Mr. Brownson was the work of Mr. Mulford , a work equally the fruit of the new and difficult political problems which the Civil War had forced upon the public mind , and showing on every page the keen sympathy of a cultivated mind with the deeper currents of the national life . The marked feature of Mr. Mulford 's book was its strenuous assertion of the moral unity and continuity of the State . Whatever the drawbacks in the manner of treatment , it furnished most significant proof of the impulse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two volumes of President Woolsey , which we have placed at the head of this article , are evidently the product of this deeper stirring of American life . They are not only the result of years of thought and study , but they contain the carefully considered judgment of one writing in living sympathy with the actual course of events . They are pervaded with a gravity of tone which shows that they are not simply the speculations of a thinker calmly following his premises to their remote conclusions , but of a man eai-nestly alive to the problems of the day , and deeply solicitous for the highest welfare of the land in which he lives . While they grew out of his labors as an academical instructor , they are singularly free from the ordinary limitations of academical treatment . Dr. Woolsey has solved , as it seems to us , more successfully than any one else the much debated problem of the function of the // scholar in politics . He has solved it not by securing for himself a seat in Congress , where the abilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wasted in the mere details of practical legislation , nor by seeking to represent his country at some foreign court , where he might have enjoyed the dignified ease to which his long and severe labors so justly entitle him , but in undertaking the more useful task of influencing public opinion , and guiding his fellow countrymen to a higher and more worthy conception of their duties - as citizens . We can conceive of no more honorable task , 1 ) 0 undertaking which , if successfully performed , ought to yield a larger measure of contentment to a generous mind . There is no single problem , at the present day , which surpasses in its absorbing interest , the problem which the forty millions of people who inhabit these United States are engaged in solving . What is to be the ultimate results of this experiment , is a question that no thoughtful mind can keep from asking . Nor can any one discharge a more serious and responsible duty than in seeking to re-inforce those moral and spiritual elements in which this experiment must find the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deeply feels , and he has earned the lasting gratitude of his fellow countrymen by what he has done to redeem political questions from the contempt into which the mere professional politician has brought them . He has held up the great and wholesome truth that these questions are allied to man 's highest concerns , and that they concern every class ; that no one , however refined in culture , or fastidious in taste , or elevated in his intellectual range , can claim that he is aloof from them , and that he has no interest in them . He has furnished a striking example , in his own case , that exact and laborious scholarship need not dull the mind 's sympathy with the problems of real life , and that the best and more beneficent result of learning is to make a man a power for good with his fellow men . The appearance , at the beginning of the second century of the republic , of a treatise on political science from the pen of so eminent a scholar and teacher , is a most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minds among us are beginning to turn to stu ( lies which , in a country like our own governed by public // opinion , can never be safely neglected , and while it would be perhaps going too far to accept such a work as indicating the drift of popular sentiment , it doubtless affords some evidence of the opinions of the educated class . In this aspect the work possesses a peculiar interest as throwing light on the question as to the extent to which the practical working of our institutions has reacted upon our political theories . The plan of the work is very comprehensive . Beginning in the first part with a discussion of the doctrine of rights as the foundation for a just State , he proceeds in part second with a consideration of the theory of the State , while the third and concluding portion , making considerably more than one half the entire work , is devoted to practical politics , or the consideration how the practical ends contemplated in the existence of the State may be best attained . iDr . Woolsey prefers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason that it is more comprehensive ; the corresponding terms republic and commonwealth being restricted by common usage to organizations of a popular type , while nation properly applies to communities of common descent . But since the State is the realization of rights , in treating of it we must either assume a certain theory of rights , or discuss the doctrine of rights as the starting point for the investigation of organized society . This latter the author prefers to do , and hence the order which he has adopted . The discussion of rights in connection with the State leads us into a field so distinct from general ethics that he prefers the phrase doctrine of rights to tbe term natural law , so long in use among writers on political science . Rights are defined as powers of free action lodged in the individual . The evidence of their existence is deduced from the general agreements of mankind . If we seek further for the rational ground of their existence the explanation must be found in the nature of the individual , especially his moral nature , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free action . While the moral sphere includes both acts and dispositions , the jural relates only to external actions , hence jural relations are capable of more precise definition , and as such can be made the subject matter of law . // Thus it becomes apparent that the recoo'nition of the rights of the individuals , as they are indicated by a right view of human nature , is necessary iu order that upon them may be founded a body of laws ; without which the perfection of the individuals , the progress of society , and the highest forms of virtue can not exist . The doctrine of rights , as thus explained , contemplates the co-existence of beings , equally partakers , through a common human nature , of jural relations . Such a state of society is a state or nation , and the only true one . Hence we accept the term natural rights if by it we mean such rights as grow out of our nature , and may be inferred from the distinction to which it points us . So that by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but rights deduced from man 's nature , and which he ougta to have realized in a jural society in order to fulfill the ends to which his nature calls him . The author assumes , at the outset , a moral order of the world , not founded on utilities that are in every sense discernible by man , and explicitly discards the greatest happiness theory as of no use , nay , as harmful in the department of politics , believing that in human relations a distinction must be drawui between benevolence and justice . The position of the author is still more distinctly brought out when he comes , in the second part , to discuss the nature of the State . After discarding as destitute either of an historical or a theoretical basis that theory of compact which played such an important part in our early political and ecclesiastical life , he proceeds to argue that the right which belongs to the State arises from the fact that the State is , in the natural order of things , God 's method of helping men towards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grounds on which alone we can justify the existence of organized society , lie in the nature and distinction of man , in his being so made as to seek society , and in the impossibility that society should exist without law and organization . In discussing the sphere and ends of the State , Dr. Woolsey maintains that its office is far wider than simply to afford protection to individuals . The State is , in truth , a large association , stretching over a vast territory , and providing for numerous wants . These wants can not be met , in detail , by individuals or by limited associa // tions of individuals . Still further , if men are associated in a State , and form a community , they will carry their natural feelings with them , so far as these can be subject to common rules and common actions for the community . This common movement may be a supplement to individual movements , but the fact that in a highly cultivated Christian community it has always expressed itself in usage and law shows one or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newer and stronger promptings towards such works of humanity that it did at an earlier stage , or that it has learned , by experience , that the whole by its superior organization can do some things to which individuals are unequal . The State , aso , as a natural community , called into being by natural law , has a destination and must therefore have powers to fulfill its destiny . Thus it follows that the sphere of the State may reach as far as the nature and needs of man . In accordance with this view Dr. Woolsey holds that the State may , without going out of its permitted path , not only protect religion , but support an established church . With regard to the important question of the limit of state power , Dr. Woolsey maintains , in opposition to William Von Humboldt and Mill , that the largest individual development is not the highest object aimed at by political science , nor is it a result of necessity reached through a high degree of political liberty . The destination of man as connected with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moral nature by means of justice , seem much higher ends than the mere diversifvin g of individual life . As a rule , whatever the individual can do without the State , he should be left to do alone , but what private persons can not accomplish the State should undertake . In the great departments of repressive legislation the State alone has any control . With regard to the punitive power of the State the author holds that the only explanation of punishment is , that thereby the evil doer receives his deserts , the State standing in the place of God , and dealing with transgression as the upholder of moral order . In part third of his work Dr. Woolsey proceeds to the discussion of a wholly distinct branch of his subject , to which he gives the designation of Practical Politics . The relation of the // second and third parts is thus explained . A leading thought of the second lies in the distinction between that which the State must do if it would fulfill its essential offices , and that which it may or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same things . It remains for the third part to consider what these things are . The aim of practical politics , therefore , is the optimus reipublica ? status , an aim which must always be limited by the nature of existing material , and by the laws of national growth . The principal inquiries included within this branch of the subject are : the nature of primordial governments , and the progress of political societies ; the various forms of governments ; their especial characteristics , whether pure or mixed ; the departments of governments and their limitations with respect to one another ; the practical relations of a government or constitution to municipal institutions and other self-governing bodies under it , to religion , education , art , and science ; the checks on government power ; the gradnal changes of states ; their violent changes or revolutions ; their decline and decay . In order to answer some of these questions the author enters , at times , upon elaborate historical inquiries , following the example of Aristotle and Montesquien . It will be seen from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigations cover . In these inquiries iDr . Woolsey shows , as would naturally be expected , wide and accurate learning , and familiar acquninance with all the best literature of the subject . In this respect as presenting an encyclopa*dic summary of political inquiries , his work not only far surpasses anything before produced in our own country , but has nothing like it in English literature . We might instance the analysis of early forms of monarchy , the full accounts of the constitutions of Venice and Florence , and the discussion of the working of democracy at Athens . The various forms of confederate governments naturally receives , from an American writer , especial attention . These historical inquiries are a feature of great value in the work . This portion concludes with some chapters , enriched with many valuable and thoughtful suggestions , upon political parties and political changes . No state can escape change , but in the opinion of the author the form of government least exposed to // revolution is a representative democracy , yet history does not authorize the opinion that any great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another . In these closing chapters the personal characteristics of the writer are clearly revealed . Some books have no flavor of personality . We seek in vain to guess what manner of man is masked behind the sentences . But no reader can lay down these volumes without being impressed with the weight , the sincerity , and the earnestness of the author 's character . In reading them we have been more than once reminded of a great master of political science , some of whose distinctive theories Dr. Woolsey very strongly controverts , but with whose masculine and straightforward temper he has very much in common . Nothing was so characteristic of Locke as his love of truth , and his resolution to arrive at it by the most directand simple methods . So far was this carried that even a logical contradiction gave him little concern , provided the principle he was advocating worked well in practice . It has been acutely remarked , by one of his recent critics , that the success of his writings " was partly due to the fact that , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between inconsistent theories . " Hence we accept his conclusions while we question the accuracy of his reasoning . Wher he insists on tracing government back to an original compact , and yet makes the sole end of government the good of the people , he is more intent on establishing a sound principle than on preserving any logical connection . He owes his great place in literature rather to the broad and just views that he maintained than to the intellectual acumen with which they demonstrated . We are not inclined to quarrel with a man of such admirable spirit because he seems at times to confound the metaphysical and the empirical methods . Some of these same characteristics appear in Dr. Woolsey , who is as sincere and resolute a seeker after truth , arid who like the great English philosopher seems to care more for results than for the methods by which they are reached . There is the same qualification of the philosophical spirit by rugged practical sense . The resemblance may be traced also in style . Both are careless of mere literary effect , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precise definition . The impulse to enforce a principle in the plainest possible language , renders both not unfrequently negligent in the construction of sentences , so that the expression is often clumsy even when the meaning is not indistinct . These are characteristics of men more intent upon matter than manner , yet they must be undoubtedly reckoned drawbacks to the value of a scientific treatise . Much as we may respect Locke , we can not help missing , as we read his chapters , the masterly precision of Hobbes and the lucid simplicity of ilume , and we can not help thinking that the scientific value of Dr. Woolsey 's volumes would have been considerably enhanced by a more condensed and exact statement of some of the propositions which he defends . A neat enunciation of a general principle , such as readily fixes itself in the memory , is hardly to he found in the entire work . To get the author 's meaning we have not unfrequently to pursue the thought through a series of paragraphs where one statement qualifies another until the attention is wearied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctrine of rights the starting point for the consideration of organized society , he next forewarns us that in thus starting from the point of individual rights he would by no means be understood as believing the protection of rights to be the only one for which the State exists . The State has other most important objects placed before it . Farther on in the work we find these more important objects explained , and have the State defined as an expression of the whole life of humanity . But it is not easy to see how these broad functions are grounded in personal rights , which are deflued as " powers of free action lodged in the individual by nations , " and we are further told that society was never meant to be the principal means by which the perfection of the individual is to be secured . Yet in another connection we find the strongly emphasized assertion that the State derives its rights " from being , in the natural order of things , God 's method of helping men towards a perfect life . " Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as having its foundation in the divine will ; conceptions which at once carry us far outside of any theory of personal rights . It is not quite evident why the author should have deemed it necessary to start with a discussion which after all // does not include so much that he subsequently introduces into his treatise . The foundation seems too narrow for the structure built upon it . Dr. Woolsey himself seems to have been in some doubt with regard to the method to be pursued . The plan of looking at the theoretical and practical sides of the same subject in different places , he confesses to be not without its evils . And , notwithstanding the example of eminent German writers , we can not persuade ourselves that these evils are counterbalanced by any advantages secured . The greatest objection presented to Dr. Woolsey 's mind was the risk of repetition , but this is by no means the most serious danger . In a scientific treatise the several parts should be logically related , and should exhibit the subject in its organic development . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the work does not furnish the foundation for the second , while between the second and the third there is no connection , save in so far as they are wholly different methods of considering the same class of subjects . Again , rn a scientific treatise , it would seem that theory and illustration should go together , and that facts , however interesting , which have no bearing on the theories advanced , should be rejected as out of place . The method adopted by the author violates this rule , and hence , while we have in the third part a large amount of most interesting matter , there is also a great deal that does not stand in any evident connection with the previous theoretical discussion . The very phrase , " Practical Politics , " is misleading . It would seem to mean maxims or principles derived from experience , for the practical administration of affairs , such for example as are embodied in the Prgnce of Machiavelli , but as used by Dr. Woolsey , it is made to include a very wide range of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instructive , and indicate the very broad scope of the author 's studies . Yet they do not seem to form a proper part of an investigation of the principles of political science . They remind us of a treatise to which this of Dr. Woolsey is in many respects greatly superior , the Political Philosophy of the late Lord Brougham . But there is another and still more serious objection to the author 's method . In considering his subject under the two dis // tinct heads of theoretical and practical politics , he not only separates his facts from the tbeories which they ought to illustrate , but , if we are not mistaken , he allows himself to be betrayed into two wholly distinct methods of treatment . In the first portion of his work be explicitly renounces the utilitarian theory , not only as of no use , but as positively harmful in the department of politics . He holds to a system of final causes moving as clearly through the moral and social , as through the physical system of the world , yet in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions from the standpoint of the system which he so strongly rejects . Let us glance , for example , at his treatment of a subject , the great importance of which he fully realizes , the relations of the State to religion . In the first part of his work he has defined natural rights as " those which by fair deductions from the present physical , moral , social , and religious characteristics of man , he must be invested with , and which he ought to have realized for him in a jural society , in order to fulfill the ends to which his nature calls him . " It would certainly seem a fair deduction from the religious characteristics of man that , to fulfill the end of his creation , his religious nature ought to receive the highest development , and that hence this must be regarded , not as a function with which the State may be invested , but as one of its primary and most important functions , and that any State must be regarded as incomplete , and as failing to fulfill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which from any circumstances was prevented from assuming this function . According to the author , it lies legitimately within the province of the State , considered as a divine method for bringing about the most perfect development of the individual , to provide , not only for the intellectual and aesthetic wants , but for the cultivation of the moral and religious nature of its citizens . He terms the State " in some sense a supernatural community , " having a distinction of its own , and powers to fulfill its destiny . We seem to pass to a wholly different atmosphere when we turn to the very exhaustive and practical discussion , in the third part , of the State 's relations to religion . Here we have no allusion to final ends , no appeal to the destination of the State as a supernatural society . The whole question is argued // in the light of experience , and on the ground of utility . The author seeks simply to ascertain " the safest way . " After reviewing , at some length , the historical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in modern times , and the more important theories that have been advanced by writers respecting this relation , from Plato to Dr. Arnold , he sums up the evils which have resulted from a union of Church and State . He next proceeds to show that religious establishments have not produced unanimity of sentiment , or prevented dissent . They have not provided for the religious wants of the poor , and have not secured purity of life among their own members . All this may be very sound , but it certainly looks very much like determining the problem simply iu the light of expediency . And it is not very easy to see how the author 's practical solution of the question , which so far as we can see , might be arrived at without the aid of metaphysical conceptions , is at all helped by his discussion , in the former part of his work , of the sphere and ends of the State . After giving the State such a lofty definition as a divine plan for the promotion of man 's highest spiritual welfare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the author acquiesces so contentedly in a result , the logical consequence of which will be to reduce the State to a mere secular organization . And if , after all , the most important problems of politics are to be thus decided in the light simply of their practical results , what is the necessity for seeking such an elaborate theoretical basis for political science ? Why begin with the exalted conception of the State as involving a final cause , and as moving securely towards the realization of a divine purpose if at last , man must find his surest guide in his own halting experiments ? Iii his discussion of the punitive power of the State the author , after discarding the theory that the main end of punishment is correction , or that it can be justified on the ground of protection to the State or the individual , or that it is expiation or satisfaction , arrives at the conclusion that in Inn ishment the State renders to evil-doers their deserts . this , be says , is the only theory that has a. solid foundation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social morality and justice . They are an education . The State deals with crime as the upholder // of moral order . But in considering the question of capital punishment he discusses its expediency with reference to difficulty of conviction , and greater frequency of pardon , and allows that if public opinion is against it , its usefulness in part comes to an end . If it be said that granting that it is the right of the State to inflict the punishment of death it still does not of necessity follow that this right should in every case be exercised , still ought not the question to be decided with reference to its bearing on the final end for which the State exists , and not with reference to its utility in a certain state of society , or with reference to an existing state of opinion ? Deducing the State from principles of natural law , viewing it as the working out of a divine purpose , and defining that purpose as the highest possible development of man , as Dr. Woolsey does , it would seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to consider what forms of government are best adapted to reach this end for which society exists . For it seems unlikely that all forms are equally adapted to the attainment of such a result , and hence there must be an ideally best polity . Even Mr. Mill , whose system did not impose upon him such a task , undertakes to solve this problem . By the ideally best form is not meant one that should be adopted , or that is practicable under all circumstances , but the one attended with the greatest immediate and prospective benefits . This Mr. Mill decides , without hesitation , to be a popular government , as promoting a higher and better form of national polity than any other . And this popular government must be under ordinary circumstances , of the representative type . We find in these volumes no discussion of a question which must ccrtainly be regarded as of great importance if we look at the State as the essential condition of man 's highest development . The author contrasts at length the different forms of political society , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it can not be said that he expresses a very enthusiastic preference for either , nor ( does he undertake to ( lecide which more nearly approaches his conception of the State as the expression of the life of humanity . In an American writer one would naturally look for a somewhat fuller presentation of the theory of popular sovereignty as implied in our institutions . // Tn venturing to make these criticisms upon a work which for the ability and position of the author is entitled to profound respect we by no means forget that the task which IDr . Woolsey has undertaken is one that presents great , and perhaps insuperable difficulties . We are living in a period of transition between two distinct methods of political reasoning , and whether what is solid and well grounded in both can be combined is a problem that remains to be determined . On the part of many a grave doubt exists whether in the present condition of knowledge we have any firm basis for a coherent body of doctrines relating to political science . We feel obliged to say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these volumes .
