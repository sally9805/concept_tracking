FRENCH AND GERMAN. * IN the last number we had room for but a most disproportionately meagre reference to a new novel of Tourgu*nief 's , to which we would like to devote more space to-day , and with an especial reference to those whose only practice in reading German is in the tragedies of Schiller or the ordinary German novel . One may confess to growing weary of Schiller without finding any fault with dramatic art , and even the fondest friend of fiction may fall asleep over such volum6s as Germany produces ; but the Germans themselves take their pleasure in translating from other people all the best works in their language , so that the soul of Bastiat would be rejoiced within him if he could see the free-trade in fiction that the Germans enjoy . That sharp-eyed people scour the surface of the earth for novels , which some all-knowing scholar translates , and the novels written in German have to fare as best they can . They certainly do not lack admirers in this country . This novel of Tourgu6nief , Friiklingsflu/hen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ translated novels . It tells the following story : Dimitri Sanin is a young Russian who finds himself in the city of Frankfort , on his way back to Russia , after a year or two of travel . He happens to make the acquaintance of an Italian family , long resident in Frankfort , which consists of an amiable , gossiping mother , the keeper of a little cafi , a daughter , Gemma , and a son , - a boy of about fourteen . In the household there is , besides , an old man , Pantaleone , who is friend and servant at once . Sanin gets to know them and wins their gratitude by the aid he gives the boy , who had fallen into a protracted fainting fit just as the Russian had entered the cafS . They all invite him to spend the evening , and he , although he was to leave that very night for Berlin , accepts . He stays so late that he loses the diligence , but consoles himself for that by the thought that he can easily amuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for Gemma is wonderfully beautiful and very charming .

In the furtherance of this object he goes with Gemma and her betrothed to pass the day in the country . While they are dining a drunken officer insults Gemma . Sanin takes the matter up , while the betrothed , who , moreover , from his position , could not challenge the officer , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the officer , thereby - for of course it leaks out - winning much more gratitude and admiration from the family . In a word , the engagement that formerly held Gemma she breaks ; Dimitri proposes and is accepted . Every reader of Tourgu*nief knows with what marvellous power he tells a love-story , and nowhere has he done better than in this novel . There are so many heroes and heroines in fiction who are labelled lovers and who are as certainly running to their fate as if they were helmeted firemen running to a fire , that we feel that in fiction as in every other art it is only the . nasters who can be lifelike , because they alone see life as it really is , or , having seen it , can represent it as it is with its infinite complexities and mysterious combinations . Sanin falls in love as men do in real life unconsciously , even unwillingly , not with an avowed determination as people do in novels . To quote any scene of the more romantic part of the novel would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ setting of the context ,  --  but it may not be amiss to give the reader an example of some of the other qualities of this remarkable writer . There is , for instance , this account of the preparations for the duel . Sanin , having no other acquah*ttance in Frankfort , has to take for his second Pantaleone , who by the way was formerly an opera-singer . At first the peaceful Italian objects , but he soon accepts :  --  " I must thank you at any rate , ' he said with an uncertain voice , for the fact that you saw even in my present inferior position that I was a gentleman , un galantuomo . Thereby you have shown yourself to he a galantuomo . But I must consider your proposition . ' " He went to the door , then turned suddenly , ran to Sanin , seized his hand , pressed it to his breast , raised his eyes to heaven and said , Noble youth , great heart , ( Nobil giovanetto ! gran cuore . f ) allow an old Recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to press your manly right hand , la vostra valorosa des/ra ! " ' As they are going to the ground the old man is stricken with remorse and wonder . " Is he really a second , did he provide the horses , make everything ready beforehand , and leave his peaceful chamber at six o'clock in the morning ? Besides his feet began to hurt him and were in a terrible way . " Sanin found it necessary to arouse him , and found the right note by touching his most sensitive point . " Where is your former courage gone , dear Mr. Cippatola ? Where is -1 ' antico valor ? ' " L ' an/ico valor ? ' he cried in a deep base voice ; " non ? ancora sftnto 1 ' antico 72alor ! I ' " After the duel " Pantaleone really triumphed . Pride took full possession of him . A conquering general returning from a victorious fight could not have looked about him with more self-satisfaction . Sanin 's conduct during the duel filled him with enthusiasm . He called him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and entreaties . He compared him to a monument of marble and bronze , to the statue of the commander in Don Giovanni . He confessed that for his own part he had felt some slight anxiety . But I am an artist , ' he said , my nature is nervous ; but you are the child of the snow and the granite rocks . ' " To go on with the story . Sanin in his anxiety for a speedy marriage finds it necessary to sell his estate in Russia . To his joy he meets a former schoolmate , who suggests that his wife , who is at Hamburg , might perhaps be willing to take it . For this purpose Sanin leaves Gemma to stay three days and arrange about the sale . She sees him go with half-hidden fears , while he departs only sure of his speedy 63i return . This wife of his friend is a woman who has no love for her husband , nor indeed for any one except herself , and in Sanin she sees a fresher nature than belongs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piqued by his natural indifference , so unlike the never-ending and so wearying attentions of those about her , she proceeds deliberately to flirt with him . He is young , human , unconscious of his danger , and unable to flee when he detects it . He becomes her slave , Gemma is abandoned , he shipwrecks his whole life . Many will find this an unpleasant tale , but their objections would be palliated if they would read the novel and see the grimness of the morality that fills it . It is no tricked-up account of the fascinations of a life of wrong-doing , but a wonderful study of the way in which faults may be committed , and of their natural punishment . As a work of art , for the observation of human life , for its wonderful knowledge of the human heart , we have no words of praise that are too strong . Tourgrn4nief , in this novel has produced a rival to his best previous work . We hope that many will read and reread it . Of other books we have but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heine , in which he tells us but little that is new , but what he says is readable , and he is more likely to find readers than is Strodtmann with his ponderous tomes , which , however , are extremely interesting , and ought to be read by one who can skip judiciously . In regard to this work we may say that many will agree with him in denouncing Heine 's surviving brother for the way in which the poet 's memoirs are kept hidden from the public . Perhaps , however , if we belonged to the number whom Heine probably abused , we should be less austerely just in our view of the matter . ART . SO much of the new city is visible - . writes a correspondent from Chicago - that its character , at least in construction , may be readily determined . The bulk of the building is probably much more substantial than that which was destroyed . There appears to be no evasion of the laws prescribing the thickness of walls and prohibiting the use of combustible materi als . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ashes were hot are open to the suspicion of insecurity ; but this , in the alleged ten miles of new frontage , is very little : the construction generally is quite as thorough as any to which we are accustomed in this country . Its aesthetic value is not so easy of estimation . The rebuilding energy having been expended , // Art . so far , on warehouses , the grander combinations of the architect are hardly called for ; his skill must be shown on so many square feet of street-front , and the only notable improvement in general design is the increased use of the arch , which , either round or flat , has become almost universal , adding wonderfully to the grace and cheerfulness of the new exteriors . There is scarcely a straight lintel of stone to be seen in the whole rebuilding ; and although the best stone and brick fronts are generally carried on flat iron supports , looking wretchedly weak , there are many fine exceptions where the arch even in cast-iron gives stability and beauty . Beyond this tendency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary to notice only the character of ornament employed . Even in narrow street-fronts there is abundance of room for decoration , and the merchants have shown an abundant desire to decorate . Many of the new shop-fronts are quite elaborately wrought , and few are barren or even simple in character . This varied mass of carved , stamped , and moulded forms is quite bewildering , and much of it is placed so high that it is likely to break the beholder 's neck as a first effect , if he wishes to discover its material and character . Having ascertained the material , the task is much abridged . There is no wood and no stucco , no new forms in terra-cotta , very little artificial " stone , " and but two or three brick fronts which can be called decorative . Unfortunately there is a great deal of iron . ( In the use of cast-iron an important and satisfactory change is noted ; it rarely goes beyond the first story . ) Sheet-iron " ornament " is here in its glory . It is paraded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , vast projecting cornices , parapets and pinnacles . For decorative value , both kinds of iron , as used here , may be dismissed with a word ; all that is seen is gross and worse than nothing . The character of design for ironwork in building must be radically changed to bring it into the sphere of art . Sheetiron can be beautiful only in refined and delicate forms of hand-work suited to its thinness , and cast-iron can not be beautiful at all . It may serve as a surface for paint , and where the cast-iron supports are painted with a color differing from that of the stone , thus recognizing the difference of material , the effect is comparatively good . But no kind of painting can make tolerable the monstrous timber-work crowning most November of these buildings . One is tempted to wish that the wind would blow it all away . All that can be said in its favor is that it breaks up the sky-lines and renders a distant street-view picturesque . In stone , the decorative tendencies shown are of quite an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with ornamentation ; and most of the material employed being a soft sandstone , the carvers have been enabled to produce a great deal in a short time . Unfortunately the Cleveland stone , and its like , which is largely used , is at first too soft to carry a sharp edge , and from this cause and from haste some of the design in relief is poor in execution . But wherever delicate forms have been cut in intaglio , on facades of flat , temperate design , the effect is uniformly good . The sandstone will bear little under-cutting , but it holds the edge of intaglio firmly enough , and it is pleasant to see this style of ornament so extensively used , replacing the coarse projections which make our streets so flaunting and tedious . Perhaps one building in every five , certainly one in every ten , shows reaction from the common intent to overload exteriors with gross forms ; and in many there is to be observed a true appreciation of refinement and delicacy of design . Though this does not go so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea of conventionalizing the best forms for stone , it seems to be the next step to it . Sufficient outlay has been made here to give us representations of fitting organic forms , good suggestions of beauty from fields and woods ; but Chicago is not Venice , nor are these the " dark " ages of cathedrals and missals , and it was not foreseen that we should get in return much more than the old tedious columns and mouldings and brackets of the Renaissance . Yet when we come to look closely , there is much more . The fancies of different architects have had fair plaj There was no time for them to copy each other . The result is that the street-fronts show an unexpected individuality , making the new Chicago architecturally our most interesting city . Beyond this , there is a much greater tendency to variety in individual work than has been hitherto shown . There are many buildings where each bit of ornament , every keystone and capital , is of an original design . It would seem that this work , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help to abolish the weary repetitions // Art . which have held sway so long . It is true that even in the best instances the forms are too near the architect 's patterns and too far from nature . Nevertheless , the better interest is evident and a beginning is made . Some of this original ornament is wrought in a hard limestone , and time to cut it properly has not been allowed ; yet the suggestions are good , and the whole effect , even with its roughness , is charming . The same praise can not be given to the sculptured heads and faces with which some buildings are adorned . They are as ugly as the Norman gargoyles , and probably equally indicative of the spirit of the age , whatever that may be . But if they must be made thus hideous and feeble to represent us , might we not forbear the representation for a time ? Perhaps the coming age will not be so dreadfully out of drawing . It seems better to use the simpler forms of nature while the union of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the newly built Chicago , there are indications that the desired alliance is progressing : the partial rejection of cast-iron and the growing refinement of forms in stone show at least its possibility . It is to be regretted that there are so few instances of the employment of color in decoration ; but these , whether produced by the painting and gilding of iron , or the use of different tints in stone , are satisfactory , so far as they go . It is not pleasant to record the fact that the largest and most costly buildings show the least improvement and originality in design , but it is quite true . The more money and space , the more Renaissance and monotony . The backward state of the industrial and fine arts in this country has not been altogether owing to public apathy . For some years there has been a wide-spread consciousness of the imperfection in our civilization arising from our neglect of the arts ; and the painful spectacle has been exhibited of a nation aware of its deficiency , yet not knowing how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impotent appears less surprising , when we reflect that even in Europe scientific art-education is a thing almost wholly of this century , and that the most of the progress effected there has been made within about twenty-five years . Massachusetts has at last done what a community of sharp-sighted manufacturers deserve perhaps little 63* praise for not having done before , in the establishment of a thorough means of artinstruction . Though the system set in operation by act of Legislature in 1870 be yet only in germ , that germ is of the right species ; and we are now furthermore provided with an inv4uable book * discussing the best methods to be employed in its development and future cultivation . Mr. Walter Smith , State Director of the art education of Massachusetts , is a graduate of the South Kensington Training-School , where he took high honors in the three branches of painting , sculpture , and archi-. tecture , before entering his profession of art master , in which capacity he has gained great reputation in England . In 1863 he was commissioned by the British government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Continent , and made a report of great thoroughness and value . In 1867 he won , over twenty-seven artists and art masters , the prize offered by his government for the best analysis of the Art Educational Section of the Paris International Exhibition of that year . On the application of the State of Massachusetts and city of Boston to the English Society of Arts and Sciences for a competent person to direct the proposed art education of the State , Mr. Smith was at once chosen for the place , a selection which his vigorous administration since being installed here has fully justified . The special reason which he himself assigns for this choice is , that , though acquainted with the art-educational systems of his own and other European countries , he is not committed to any one of them , but believes that " in the construction of a system in a country where the subject is new , we can adapt the good parts of all the old methods to the requirements of this country , and omit all the bad parts . " In addition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not omit mentioning the enthusiasm and hopefulness which pervade the volume under review , and on which we feel disposed to rely for effecting those advances in art which he encourages us to expect . The scheme of art education described by Mr. Smith , being , with the slight exception that it includes modelling , the same which the act referred to already make* provision for , is a very comprehensive one . It rests on the accepted principle , that th' means of refining the industrial and revivi. * Art Education , by WALTER SMITH . BostooL J. R. Osgood &amp; Co. 1872. // fying the fine arts is the at least approximate identification of the artist with the artisan . To this end artisans are to receive an enlightened art education , the whole bent of the schools being in their favor , and those who study in them to become professional artists being left to assert themselves by the force of peculiar genius . Thus those who devote themselves to paint . ing will hardly be tempted to do so unless their genius is irrepressible , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employment , be fitted to become excellent designers , modellers , etc . The leading thought expressed by Mr. Smith is , " that all kinds of drawing shall be taught as a language , not as an art , and be used as an instrument , not as a plaything . " He advocates that drawing precede writing , in the education of the child , as being a more natural and thus a more easily acquired mode of expression . To give briefly a clear conception of the work which it is proposed to accomplish in the public schools , we extract Mr. Smith 's schedule of studies appointed for these - " Zn Primary Schools . - Free-hand , model , and memory drawing , from the blackboard and from copies in books , the objects to be geometrically drawn , i. e. having no perspective effects in them . " In Grammar Schools . - Model drawing from the blackboard , and from copies showing the principles of perspective , and from real objects ; memory drawing ; geometrical drawing of plane geometrical problems with instruments ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other ornament , in outline , to teach styles of art . " Zn Th*h and Normal Schools . - Memory , model , and perspective drawing ; shading , coloring ; drawing from casts , from natural plants and elementary designs . " This , then , is the solid instruction which it is hoped will , in time , be dispensed to the people of every State , as it is now being dispensed to those of Massachusetts , - the foundation of universal good taste and appreciation of art , on which alone it is safe to build hopes of a great future in art for this country . The art school proper begins its work where that of the common high school ceases ; and its object , to which the industrial drawing-classes already organized of course tend also , is described as " the cultivation of the understanding , and increase - if knowledge , of the students in the field of Art . November , art generally , supplemented by the acquisition of manipulative and technical skill in some branch of art practice . " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a common course , branching off from this into either , ( i. ) scientific instrumental drawing ; ( 2. ) artistic work in light and shade , color and design ; or ( 3. ) modelling . So that , while all would be united in learning to draw well , without which there can be no good industrial or fine art , the different inclinations of individuals would cause them to become carpenters and architects , machinists and engineers , draughtsmen , lithographers , painters , and sculptors . The danger of this whole system is one to which all such systems are liable , and that is , that while they provide in perfection the necessary discipline and instruction for producing " original and learned and tasteful work , scholarlike and artistic , " the elaborate means provided for this end may be found rather to thwart than to assist the advancement of peculiar and exceptional genius ( genius made idle and wayward by the temperament with which it is combined , or from other causes , is not here meant ) , which is nevertheless capable of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based on the needs of exceptional persons , and their inutility to these must be compensated by the spirit in which they are directed . Mr. Smith is an enthusiastic disciple of Ruskin , and we can not think that any one who carries so much of Ruskin 's noble purpose into this practical work of art education , can be insensible to the claims of such persons as those we allude to . Indeed , he express . ly affirms at one point that " in the adaptation of any scheme of instruction to the development of skill in individual cases , it ought to be possible , and may sometimes be necessary , to turn the whole scheme upside down , beginning at the end , or ending at the beginning , if needs be , any laws or formuhe to the contrary notwithstanding . " It is a matter of moment that this necessity should be thoroughly understood by every one who engages in the work which Mr. Smith has begun ; and we sincerely hope that his feeiing in this regard may be imparted to all present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in genius which it is criminal to ignore . The second half of the book appears designed to forward art education in a more indirect way by easy and instructive discus- // Music . sions of ornamental design , surface decoration , modelling , carving , and casting , and symbolism in art and architecture , with many striking suggestions for the coming architecture of this country . It is interesting to observe that Mr. Smith advocates a very general use of terra-cotta in 635 building . The plates scattered through the volume form an excellent illustration to this as well as the preceding part of the work , and the appendices contain a great store of such information as is now being sought in many parts of the United States . MUSIC . AMONG other questions of more or less vital importance to the musical cultivation of our people , there is one which forces itself irresistibly upon our notice , namely , the musical performances at our theatres . There is probably not a theatre in the country that does not boast something in the shape of an orchestra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be required in the course of the drama itself , regales the audience with " choice and varied selections of new and popular music " between the acts . As a subject for aesthetic contemplatlon , the theatre " orchestra " is at best a dispiriting one ; but in spite of the fact that it is , as at present conducted and constituted , in nine cases out of ten an almost unmitigated evil , we are not inclined to look upon it as a wholly hopeless case . The question whether music ought or ought not to be introduced between the acts of plays is an interesting one for abstract aesthetic discussion , but is unfortunately of no practical value . Whatever may be our opinion as to what ought or ought not to be is little to the purpose in this case , as playwrights , managers , and orchestral players have long since settled what shall be . Dramatic authors from Shakespeare down to the sensationalists of our own day have introduced music into their dramas ; musicians can not be hired for less than a whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an orchestra without " getting their full money 's worth , " or , in other words , making them play as much as possible . The theatre orchestra may then be regarded as an unavoidable fact . But it is the vile quality of the thing that we must principally protest against , rather than its possible inappropriateness . With lamentably few exceptions the musical interludes at our theatres are very poor , both as to the music performed and the manner of performance . To be sure the management of the theatre have , at the outset , little reason to suppose that the audience is of a particularly musical cast . They have not come together with any distinctly musical intent , and whatever of music is introduced during the evening will no doubt be regarded by most listeners as merely a conventional makeweight in the entertainment . But yet it may be fairly supposed that a certain proportion of the audience are in some measure musically cultivated , or , at the very least , musically disposed , and we can not see how the theatre management @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the more cultivated portion of the public , instead of more than boring them by such musical trash as is merely tolerated by the unmusical portion to whom good and bad music are equally indifferent . Of all perverted developments in the fine arts , bad music is the most insufferable . We can shut our eyes against bad drawing or false combinations of colors , and can turn away from bad sculpture and architecture with contemptuous indifference ; but when bad music comes upon the field , there is nothing for it but patient suffering or ignominious flight . The " music " that the audience is doomed to listen to at many of our best theatres is beyond all doubt a serious drawback to the enjoyment of quite a considerable portion of our theatre-going public . The musical part of the audience constitute indeed a minority , but a cultivated minority have rights that are to be respected , especially where the uncultivated majority are manifestly indifferent . To look at once at the darkest side of the picture , there is one point in our theatre orchestras about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Music ' * is the cornet * pistons . It would be difficult to estimate the harm that has been done the popular musical taste and to musical performances in general by this , we had almost said diabolical , little instrument . Through its great popularity with the masses it has gradually crept from the lowest place in the orchestra up to the first and highest . It dominates the whole orchestra , and everything has to give way before it . A good cornet soloist draws a higher salary at some of our theatres than any but the leading violinist . As a solo instrument , the cornet has the smallest pretensions to anything beyond a certain penetrating brilliancy of tone , fascinating at first , but inexpressive and , after a while , most tediously monotonous . By means of modern mechanism the flexibility and power of rapid execution of the instrument have been greatly increased , but only just enough to tempt the skilful performer to try to push his instrument out of its proper sphere and to do things with it which no composer in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rev. H. R. Haweis says of the amateur flute and cornet may be applied with equal force and justice to the professional cornet player - " There is a composure about the flute and cornet , an unruffled temperament , a philosophical calm , and absolute satisfaction in their respective efforts , which other musicians may envy but can not hope to rival . Other musicians feel annoyed at not accomplishing what they attempt ; the cornet and the flute tell you at once they attempt what can not be done . " * In listening to some of the difficult variations , full of rapid running passages , fioriture and prolonged double - tonguing , that are attempted by cornet players , even such masters of the instrument as Levi , Sylvestre , or our own admirable Arbuckle , we can not help a sympathetic recall of Dr. Johnson 's , " Difficult , madam ! Would that it were impossible ! " Hector Berlioz , in his work on instrumentation , speaks thus of the cornet : " The cornet * pistons is very much the fashion in France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purity of style are not considered as very essential qualities ; it has thus become the indispensable solo instrument for contra-dances , galops , airs with variations , and other second-rate compositions . Continually hearing it , as we now do in ball-rooms , orchestras , executing * Music and Morals , p. 441 , New York edition . November , melodies more or less wanting in originality and refinement of style , combined with the character of its timbre , which has neither the nobility of the tones of the horn nor the haughty brilliancy of those of the trumpet , renders the introduction of the cornet l* pistons into the high , melodic style of considerable difficulty . It can figure there , however , with advantage , but only rarely and on the condition of having only to sing phrases in a broad , slow movement and of an incontestible dignity Joyous melodies on this instrument will always risk the loss of much of their nobility , if they possess any , and if they are wanting in it , a redoubling of their triviality . A phrase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wooden wind-instruments , would become odiously insipid and vulgar when thrown out into relief by the pungent , flaunting , unabashed tones of the cornet it pistons . " If this were the only evil , it might be perhaps bearable ; but the cornet having , as we have said , gained almost undivided supremacy over all other instruments in the orchestra , has , very like a prime minister in office , given prominent positions to some of its less lucky relations . When any instrument plays a solo , the rest of the orchestra naturally expects to be thrown into the shade ; but human lips are not made of cast-iron , neither are human lungs made of leather , and there is a limit to even a cornet player 's powers of endurance , and he can not play solos all the time . If when not dazzling the public by his lovelorn screaming and pyrotechnic flourishes in a solo , the cornet could only be allowed to repose on his hard-earned laurels , and give the rest of the orchestra a chance ! But no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who , " when not required by tke business of his part , will please help in the chorus , " the cornet , when not playing solos , must take its natural place in the body of instruments and do duty with the rest . But one cornet in an orchestra of the size we usually find in our theatres , is like Walter Brown pulling a fourteenfoot oar on one side of the boat and half a dozen children paddling with shingles on the other . The equilibrium of forces is destroyed . Thus we find that one cornet can not exist without a second , and last , but by no means least , a trombone . We might fill a volume in detailing the various abuses that this latter instrument has been put to , but will content ourselves // ATusw. with again quoting from Berlioz : " Gluck , Beethoven , Mozart , Weber , Spontini , and some others have understood the whole importance of the role of the trombone ; they have applied with perfect intelligence the various characters of this noble instrument to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have consequently preserved its power , its dignity , and its poetry . But to constrain it , as a crowd of composers do to-day , to howl out in a credo brutal phrases , less worthy of the sacred temple than of a tavern , to sound as for the entry of Alexander into Babylon , when there is only question of a dancer 's j5irouette , to strum chords of the tonic and dominant for a little song which a guitar would suffice to accompany , to mingle its Olympian voice in the povertystricken melody of a vaudeville duet , or the frivolous noise of a contra-dance , to prepare in the tutti of a concerto for the triumphal advent of an oboe or a flute , is to impoverish and degrade a magnificent individuality , to make a slave and buffoon of a hero , to discolorize the orchestra , to render impotent and useless all rational progression of instrumental forces , to undo the past , present , and future of art , to commit a voluntary act of vandalism , or show a want of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has more direct reference to the abuse of the trombone in writing for full orchestra , but applies with double force to our small theatre orchestras , where the ridiculously small proportion of strings and reeds gives additional prominence to the brass . But bad as this arrangement of orchestral forces is , many not altogether bad effects might be drawn from it , were the music performed only well arranged for the number and quality of the instruments employed . This , however , is rarely the case . The music performed is generally written for full orchestra , which means an orchestra capable of filling at least eighteen and often twenty-four instrumental l5arts . When such music is played by only twelve or fourteen instruments , it may well be asked , What becomes of the remaining parts ? The answer is simple They must shift for themselves , and the piece do without them as best it can . In some cases music composed for full orchestra , such as light overtures , potpourris , dance music , etc. , is published with a view to being performed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written for , and some arrangement 637 has been made by which one instrument can take the place of another when absolutely necessary . But these " arrangements for a small orchestra " are very rarely well done ; the only object seeming to be to prevent an awkward silence in the middle of a piece where the absence of some solo instrument would leave a disconcerting gap , little or no attention being paid to restoring the dynamic balance of the harmony which the absence of so many instruments from the orchestra must unavoidably destroy . Exceptional combinations of instruments , which our theatre orchestras most certainly are in the history of orchestration , require exceptional treatment , and where instruments have double duty to do , they can not be treated as if they were only filling their normal place in the orchestra . But we have dwelt long enough upon this side of the question , and are in truth rather sick of fault-finding . In spite of the many and great imperfections of our theatre orchestras , we can see even now indications of how great improvements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and how the musical part of theatrical entertainments might be made no despicable agent in improving the popular taste in music , instead of being as they now are a mere drag on popular musical education . And here let no enthusiast for " popular music " imagine for a moment that we would preach the playing of Beethoven symphonies , Bach fugues , or Haydn quartettes between the acts at our theatres . We are always glad to hear Strauss waltzes and some of the better class of polkas and mazurkas , many of which can be easily brought within the executive scope of a few instruments . Operatic potpourris we would heartily protest against , as being in the first place an insult to the composer of the opera , and secondly as being perhaps the lowest conceivable form of music , if that can be called a form which has no form or logical development whatever . We have called the operatic potpourri the lowest musical form , but we had almost forgotten those most hideous agglomerations of tunes known as the " medley of popular airs " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of composition are really one and the same , differing only in name , and are in fact nothing more than the vulgarest popular airs , such as we hear whisfled in our streets by bootblacks and newspaper boys , thrown together without rhyme // Politics . or reason , and most villanously put upon the orchestra . Far better than these are the German " bouquets of melodies , " Conradi 's " Melodienstrfiusse , " for instance , which are keenly enjoyable even by cultivated musicians . These " bouquets " consist of bits of different melodies , often not more than four or five bars of each one , thrown together pellmell , and following upon each other 's heels in such quick succession that it often requires the closest attention on the part of the listener to detect where one air changes to another . Thus little bits from operas , symphonies , oratorios , national airs , waltzes , sentimental ballads , and Scotch hornpipes are reeled off before the audience in most bewildering confusion and often with irresistibly comic effect . The " bouquet " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ridiculous contrasts in these sudden changes of theme , and the way in which one air merges into another is at times quite startling . We have heard Handel 's Lascia ch'io *ianga followed so closely by Arditi 's 17 Baclo that it was impossible to tell where the one stopped and the other began . Of course these things have no more form than the potpourri , but they are written with manifestly comic intent , and we would no more quarrel with their formlessness than with Artemas Ward 's spelling or Hans Breitmann 's grammar . That musical wit and humor should be so well appreciated as it actually is by the mass of our audiences is in itself a hopeful sign for the future . Comic variations on any well-known theme are always keenly enjoyed whenever heard . Those astounding bits of musical November , humor where the piccolo , flute , and trombone play a theme in alternate bars , where an air is tossed about all over the orchestra from the first violin to the kettle-drums , where the man with the clarinet " quacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in most sea-sick *ortamento , and the double-bass squeaks in high harmonics , to be answered by an angry growl from the depths of the bassoon , - are cheap means , perhaps , from any high artistic point of view , for raising a laugh , but more grateful to our ears than cornet cavatinas , badly arranged overtures , or vulgar dance-hall music . When the play performed is of such a nature as to make things of this sort out of place between the acts , the question what to play becomes one of very serious difficulty . Light music of any kind is out of place between the acts of Shakespeare tragedies or in fact of any serious plays , and we shudder at the thought of confiding any really fine music to many of our theatre orchestras . Some of them , to be sure , are capable of producing fine compositions of the simpler sort in quite a passable manner , and they have this advantage over most of the orchestras at our classical concerts , that they are accustomed to play together seven or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a deficiency in numbers that prevents them from being quite good and effective orchestras . The only way that we can see out of the difficulty is , that whatever good music they are called upon to play should be arranged by a competent musician especial . ly for the instruments at his command , with a vi to combining those instruments to the best advantage . POLITICS . SINCE last month the present shabby Presidential contest can hardly be said to have developed anything novel , so far as ideas or principles are concerned , unless it be the nominations of the Straight-out Democratic Convention at Louisville . These Democrats enter the field under the leadership of the much-refusing Mr. O'Conor , and are understood by disinterested Republicans to exhibit uncommon virtue , as if to the Democrat unchanged by the events of the last ten years any vir tue save han-han were possible . As for other parties , many of us who will vote for General Grant are still not sensible of being animated by any higher motive than the desire of self-preservation ; which may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not produce that lift and glow in the chooser which the more exacting might demand . They who are going to vote for Mr. Greeley are as noisily inspired as ever with their grand purpose of reconciliation , and are still busily clasping // Politics . hands with a benign figment of their fancy which wears , according to the former relations of each reconciler , now the griefworn face of what Mr. Greeley poetically calls a broken-hearted people , now the contrite sweetness of a converted Democracy , and now the severely classic yet alluring aspect of office . These stage-embraces , which may be very real to the actors in them , do not persuade the beholder to any vivid faith in their sincerity . We see them ; we must allow that they are very energetic ; but we think with misgiving that these loving brothers may be still rivals and enemies behind the scenes , as they always have been . Doubtless the millennium will come with a rush when it does come ; but is this the millennium ? The average voter shakes his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before to make the best of General Grant , feeling that in him is not immediate chaos . This at least seems to have been the effect upon the average voter in Maine and Vermont , where the work of reconciliation has only gone so far as to reconcile the Republicans to their triumph , without bringing a corresponding sense of resignation to the coalitionsists . These console themselves as they can with the reflection that Maine is chiefly formed of unintelligent rural communities , and that from Vermont they could not reasonably have expected anything . If it should fall out that Pennsylvania , Ohio , and Indiana follow the New England States , we suppose that the disappointed party will not want reasons besides the majorities against it to account for the result ; and if in November it should be totally defeated , we may still expect something ingenious from a party led to ruin by a philosopher . But in the mean time its candidate has not been idle . It is a few weeks since one of General Grant 's numerous deplorable relations attempted to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ editor ; and in the latter part of September Mr. Greeley regularly took the stump for General Grant . We know that this was not his avowed purpose in thus mingling with the people , but we believe that this will be found to have been the effect all the same , at the October elections ; and Grant men can have no dispute with him for his action . As for the affair in the abstract , it is a matter of taste whether a Presidential candidate should or should 639. not ask the voices of the people . There is nothing criminal in it , a there is not in several other unusual things . A lady may ask a gentleman to marry her without violating any command of the decalogue , and in an extreme , case it would be cruel to forbid her . So , too , a candidate for the Presidency may propose himself to the nation before popular assemblages , and in an extreme case it would be cruel to forbid him . But , on the whole , usage and prejudice are both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is thought a dignified part in a lady or a candidate in so serious an affair as marriage or the Presidency , to wait till they are asked , and it is believed that they would only hurt their cause by making advances . We think that General Scott is the only modern instance of a candidate soliciting the favor of the people , and his success was really so small that it did not establish a precedent . None of our great men from Washington to Lincoln has done anything to sanction such a course ; they have all apparently disapproved it , and " Assumed a virtue if they had it not , " modestly remaining in the background . But it may he retorted by his friends that Mr. Greeley is not at all a Washington or a Lincoln , and that he is of too open a nature to assume the virtue of modesty if he has it not . They may add that as to dignity , he is the only man who could do what he has done without loss of dignity , - for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force in this , and the moderate Grant man , the voter of the minor-evil type , may well leave the point in abeyance . But as to the material of Mr. Greeley 's speeches , we do not see how there can be any question . He tells how he means to distribute the offices , denying this and affirming that ; he scolds the veteran soldiers who assemble in convention against him ; he declares that he will not pay rebel pensions , as if he were master of the party that makes him ; he soundly rates the Grant office-holders who go about speech-making ; he explains in Ohio what he said in Pennsylvania ; he boasts the strength of his party , and brags in one place of the crowd that heard him in another ; he disputes what the local newspapers say of him ; he pretends that the United States treasury is used to buy votes against him ; wherever he has ten minutes , he reconstructs his platform ; when he gets home to New York he re // POti/iCS. plies to the insinuation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect that his escapade was sanctioned by the best authorities in his motley party , - that he did not run off at all , and has not been brought back . His electioneering makes us forget the vulgarity of Johnson ; and destroys all lingering hope that if the worst comes to the worst and he is chosen President , the cares of office , will bring gravity and decorum with them . The responsibilities of leadership have brought him nothing of the kind ; and there is no reason to suppose that halting wisdom would overtake him by the 4th of March . As we have intimated , we believe that all this will help to elect General Grant . him At any rate it makes appear in contrast a figure of lofty and dignified excellence . It exaggerates his good points and casts a flattering light upon his bad ones . The chooser of the minor evil may almost exult in the man who is to save us from such a Presiden*t as we are threatened with in Mr. Greeley . For these reasons we ought perhaps to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefited his enemies , but has helped to enliven one of the dullest canvasses ever known . But for his peculiar gifts , we should have suffered with ennui . He is not only amusing in himself , but is the cause of making others amuse us . What leader but he could have brought out Mr. Sumner as a humorist ? Or General Banks ? Or placed General Butler in* the attitude of a friend of civilization ? Or won over Mr. Phillips from the advocacy of his favorite political theory of anything for the pulling down of'government ? Then think of the vast numbers of editor-people and orator-people whom he has set to beating straw throughout the country , - old straw , musty straw , straw that has scarcely so much as a husk of chaff in it , - at which they thresh away day after day , week after week , with all the zeal of men garner ing a harvest ! Imagine his so inspiring his sti*ange forces that Liberal Republicans can pretend to believe in th. honesty of ZT . November . Tammany Democrats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without so much as winking an eye or thrusting the tongue into the cheek , - that the red-handed Ku-Klux can speak of reconciliation without laughing ! It is a great deal to do , and Mr. Greeley is a great actor *nd a most efficient stage manager to boot . These qualities ought not to be passed without some recognition ; but after all , we do not covet them in a President . There are some things which his election would effect , possibly very pleasant to see . It would be amusing to behold the rush of the Democratic hordes upon Washington to share in that impartial distribution of places which has been promised them , - the Democrats from Massachusetts and the Democrats from Arkansas , alike lank and fierce with their long fast from office . It would be delightful to contemplate the Liberal Republican civil-service reformers reducing these cormorants to order . It would be inspiring to see the famous placard for resuming specie payment pinned on the Treasury door . It would be charming to receive again as rulers the unrepentant but reconciled rebel leaders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a people . But would it be worth the price that we must pay to have all these entertaining novelties ? We should not begrudge any ordinary outlay , but we think that Mr. Greeley asks too much for his proposed exhibition , and the people should really deny themselves the indulgence . He can not complain of unfairness . He has had quite sufficient scope for his talents during the campaign , and he has not neglected his opportunities . He promises he will not seek to repeat his entertainment ; but even in so short a time as four years it might pall upon us . Those who think differently may comfort themselves with the fact that Mr. Greeley , even if not elected , is not lost to us . We can still have him as an editor , - perhaps even as a supporter of Grant 's second administration . /
