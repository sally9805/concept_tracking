ARTICLE 1. - BUSINESS ETHICS , PAST AND PRESENT . A POOR man , who is well versed in Political Economy , lately told me that the reading of iRicardo had convinced him that there is no hope for the laboring class under the existing system of industry . Competition , as he was compelled to think , must sooner or later reduce working men to the starva* tion limit , and keep them there . In times of exceptional distress it must drive them below that limit , and only restore them . to it through the lessening of their number by actual death . His hopes for the future of laborers were founded on a change of the industrial system , which should substitute cooperation for competition . This man is representative ; his premises are those of IRicardo and his school , and his conclusions are those to which many , readers are forced . The future of the laboring class is not attractive , as these writers picture it ; and this fact shows the reason why some intelligent men , besides many ignorant ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a former ArtP cle , to show the power of moral influences to revolutionize systems of industry , and propose now to indicate their power , . without overthrowing an established industrial system , to re // move much of the evil that exists within it . The future of the laboring class , even under the present system , is not so dark as it must appear when these forces are not recognized . The reasoning of Ricardo is based on the existence of unrestricted competition . Such competition is impossible in any collection of men that can be termed a society ; it has never existed , in fact , since the time of Adam . Competition , pure and simple , implies the exclusive action of selfish motives , and would be a savage and ignoble strife , in which every man 's band would be for himself and against his neighbor . Fowls in a barnyard running together for a handful of corn , apes in a cage greedily snatching pieces of bread from each other , present but an imperfect picture of what would result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Competition unrestricted is a monster as completely antiquated as the saurians , of which the geologists tell us . To find anything approaching unrestricted competition in actual life we must go farther back than history reaches , beyond the lake dwellers of Switzerland , and the cliff villagers of neo* lithic times , quite to the isolated troglodyte , the companion of the cave bear . Even here the illustration will he incomplete ; for the troglodyte had a family , and within the sacred precinct of the home higher motives l ) redominated . The intercourse of this rudest of men with others of his kind may however be conceded , safely enough , in the absence of evidence to the contrary , to have been dictated by the lowest of motives , and to have tolerably well illustrated the operation of pure competition . The supposition may be a slander on the troglodyte ; but , as he is now past hearing of it , and is not present with his club to avenge it , we may admit the supposition that the intercourse of the isolated cave-dwellers with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forces . Two wild huntsmen , pursuing the same animal , or clubbing and tearing each other for the possession of its body , when slain , present a sufficiently accurate picture of the nature of the process . Though such were , in fact , the conduct of cave dwellers toward each other , outside of the family circle , it is certain that , within that circle , the wild passions elsewhere predominant were restrained by sentiments of personal affection ; // and in this we have the germ of a series of phenomena of the highest importance . In this case love toward relatives and enmity toward neighbors are the ruling motives . The differing motives dictate opposite lines of conduct . Reflection serves to define and formulate the two opposite modes of action ; that which is customary in the treatment of relatives , and that which is characteristic in the treatment of enemies , come to be understood and recognized , and a rude code of rules is formed for the guidance of members of the favored circle in their treatment of each other . Gradually , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a deeper intuition than any yet experienced comes to lay its sanction on the code which family affection and custom have established . In the vivid picture-language of Genesis , the fruit of " the tree of knowledge of good and evil " is plucked . A rude perception of right and wrong is attained ; the glimmering light of a moral principle that is to direct the development of the race makes itself for the first time perceptible , and the troglodyte is no longer as an animal , innocent because ignorant , but " as a god , knowing good and evil . " Such is the teaching of Genesis and of science concerning the origin of moral influences in human society . The code of right and wrong is at first confined to the family ; but in time sufficiently close intercourse is established between neighboring families to develop common ideas of right and wrong in matters pertaining to a larger circle , and the moral code extends itself to the neighborhood . Neighborhoods unite into tribes , and the process repeats itself . In time the final @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a legal enactment , with penalties for violation , and is thus enabled to exert its greatest influence . Competition has now received definite limitations within the circle where the ethical influences are exerted . The growth of these influences , both extensively and intensively , is a matter of history . They have grown extensively as tribes have united into nations , and as nations , by the development of international law , have taken on the rudimentary form of what promises to be a world state , an organic unity bounded by no narrower limits than those of the globe we // inhabit . There is no quarter of the world , at present , unreached by ethical influences , and none , consequently , where competition is not subject to some limitations . Intensively , these moral forces have grown with general civilization , acquiring , within a given local circle , a constantly increasing power , and limiting competition more and more . The method of competition which spared neither life nor limb gave place to a method which respected the lives of the contestants ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bodies were first excluded from the list of articles to be competed for . It was a sort of legal exemption , the first and most beneficent of homestead laws . The dwelling which the soul of man inhabits might not be seized by his creditors , and the occupant ejected . A farther development of moral force suppressed open robbery ; and it now remains for a still higher development of the same influence to suppress certain forms of robbery which are , as yet , unreached by law . Sir Henry Maine has shown that the family system , which excluded competition entirely , extended itself to the village community , which was the germ of the modern state . Within the village all relations were fraternal , and property was held largely in common ; while on the mark , or boundary , the germ of the modern market , the relations were somewhat hostile . It was on the mark that members of different communities met to buy and sell . Here they were free from the moral influences which existed among members of the same community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The highly developed family code acquired its greatest extent in the medimeval village , and has diminished since that time . The modern market is a fusion of village and mark ; the circle within which competition is excluded has been reduced to a zero ; but , in compensation , much of the humanity which characterized the dealings of villagers with each other has extended itself to the entire operations of trade . Though the village community is extinct in western countries , its influence survives in the mitigating influences which make themselves felt in the formerly harsh and hostile dealings of the market ; and though the mark , as such , is extinct , its influence also survives in the latent brutality that characterizes much of customary business intercourse. // It is a common remark that business practices are not what they ought to be , and that consciences otherwise sensitive are apt to become callous when pecuniary interests are concerned . The forms of business depravity which attract our attention are too apt to be deprecated in a helpless manner ; we regret them , but do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself quite too much aloof from this particular contest ; and so effectual has been , at times , the separation of religious life from business life , that seeming piety and business meanness have not been mutually exclusive characteristics , but have , in too many cases , been markedly and offensively existent in the same persons . Instances enough of this kind will occur to every one . It is not realized that moral influences have for their particular and legitimate function to suppress this remnant of natural ferocity , which continues to do by legal methods what used to be done by processes more open and violent ; neither is it realized how radical would be the effect of a comparatively slight reformation in this direction . Very much of the evil that oppresses the laboring class is due to a current violation of right in one specific direction . The theory of the modern bargain appears to be that of the medkeval judicial combat ; let each do his worst , and God will protect the right . As in medi√¶val times , it has too frequently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a standard that determines the justice or injustice of bargains , and the so-called " higgling of the market** is utterly inadequate to secure conformity to that standard . How soon will the moral forces of society take in hand the higgling process ? Precedents teach that they will do it at some time , but it would be better not to have to wait a geological era for the effect to be realized . May we not reasonably ask the preachers and teachers of society to add this question at once to the list of those used for the examination of candidates for their professions : " Do you believe , and will you teach , with all the power that God shall give you , that bargains must be mutually advantageous to be morally justifiable ? " Wealth is legitimately acquired by the process of production , not by the process of exchange ; and one of the imperative duties of the new Political Economy is to draw the line // where production terminates . Money-making by exchange is virtual robbery , and is only prevented from being legal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which separates production from illegitimate exchange is not always an easy one to draw in practice , and has probably never yet been clearly stated in theory ; and intelligent persons do not need to be told that dealing in commodities , as the merchant deals in them , is an operation which falls , economically , under the head of production . The merchant creates " form utility , " " plate utility , " and " time utility , " and his reward is as legitimate as that of any other producer . It is the shrewd trading men who create no wealth , but deal in stocks and real estate , horses and general merchandise , in a manner that benefits no one but themselves , who furnish the best illustrations of moneymaking by the operation of exchange . Market prices are nothing to such men ; it is their aim to get more value than they give , both in buying and in selling . As this operation is not an easy one when the parties with whom they deal are aware of the value of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lying is a frequent part of the process . Indeed , lies have come to be the modern cudgel , with which men brain each other for money . The lies had better not be , in most cases , of a bald and apparent character ; that would be using an ill-constructed club . What is ordinarily termed a good bargain is , morally , a bad bargain ; it is unequal , and good for one party only . Whenever such a transaction takes place some one is plundered . It is the sufferer , in such cases , who usually regrets the occurrence ; in an ideal society it would be the gainer who would mourn , however little probability there may be of such a thing in actual society . Sack-cloth and ashes are the proper covering of the man who has made a " good bargain . " What is the fact in the case ? Do persons who have made such bargains , even by questionable means , don the garments of humiliation , or do they show something of complacency ? Are they disposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Are they , in fact , treated with less honor by other men , or with more ? The whole process is bad ; it is odious , and the worst feature of it is that it is characteristically American . The sharp bargaining // spirit , which seeks , not to create wealth , but to get it away from other persons by all methods tolerated by law , may exist , in individual cases , in other civilized countries besides our own ; but it does not , in most countries , so pervade the entire community as to make it respectable . The man in Germany or England who should even go from one shop to another to find whose prices were the lowest , would be , if not turned out of the doors , at least treated in such a manner that he would go , and not return . To seek to buy for less than the market price is considered mean , in those countries ; and to seek to sell for more than the market price is considered knavish . Mr. Mill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but they have ascribed it merely to custom . Closer analysis must show that it is not due to custom alone , but to the custom founded on a sense of right . Moral influence is the ultimate force , and it is no credit to us that that influence is less powerful and less pervasive in America . Trade is held in more honor here than elsewhere , and it deserves to be held in less ; a part of our respect for it is due to our peculiar blindness to its defects . Let us withhold our respect until it is deserved ; and , that we may justly honor trade , let us make it honorable . A perfect ideal of character and conduct always serves the purpose rather of a beacon than of a goal ; like the star toward which the sailor steers by night , it is a thing never to be reached , but only distantly approached . It is not , for that reason , the less important . The clouds that hid the ancient pilot 's guiding star stopped his progress , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cloud every baffled a sailor more completely than a perverted conscience , a grasping spirit , and false economic teachings have baffled and blinded the people of this country . The true ideal of business dealing has been hid ; it needs to be brought to the light , and placed where all may see it . It may never be reached ; but it will make all the difference between success and failure if it can only be approached , if our course can only be turned toward it , instead of from it . One form of business immorality is very radical in its effects , and the removal of it would be more than a pallative for existing // social evils ; it would be , to a great extent , curative . The evil is the hardest and most savage form of competition which existing laws tolerate . Much of our bargaining resembles robbery ; this resembles the robbing of defenseless persons . Indeed , this form of competition is the systematic seeking out of such persons , for the purpose of taking advantage of their condition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of literal violence ; in savage strife equal arms and equal weapons are the rule ; the civilized code is less exacting , and permits any amount of inequality in outfit . We need a revival of the old German sense of honor ; and especially and particularly do we need a little of that chivalrous spirit which protected women and children in medi√¶val times . ft is one of the enigmas of modern life that the literal striking of a woman , however lightly , should brand the offender as a social outcast , while , in an economic way , the deadliest blows may be struck at her with impunity ; and that society even honors men who get rich by such unknightly attacks on the weak and defenseless . Special exigencies often render particular persons unable to bargain on equal terms with those with whom they are dealing ; they are compelled to sell something immediately , and the urgency of the case may allow no time to seek more than one purchaser . They are , for the time being , excluded from any general market . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unqualified by law is not freedom , but license , which permits the severest oppression in individual cases . The existence of too unrestricted competition in the general market has prevented the beneficial effects of competition from being realized in cases where such effects are most necessary . Because , in the general market , every man is seeking to get what he can , therefore , in special cases , the unfoi-tunate are driven to the wall and remorselessly plundered . There is this self-contradiction in the competitive process , when restrained no more than is done by the business code of this country . A borrower , in special exigencies , is often at the mercy of a single lender . A merchant who is in any danger of failing in business , is often compelled to accept the offer of a single customer . A land owner who can not pay his mortgages is often // compelled to accept what a single purchaser may choose to offer ; and men are numerous enough whose business it is to create and to utilize such exigencies . The creation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the stock exchange , or the grain exchange ; but the utilizing of them is illustrated frequently enough in every department of business . It is the baldest of robbery , and is all the worse because the law can not reach it effectively . Public sentiment , though less rigid than law ; is more pervasive ; and to this influence we must look for the correction of the evil . In other than financial exigencies the true principle is clearly enough recognized . A boatman does not stop to make terms with a man in the water , before taking him on board . A ship 's captain does not settle the question of salvage before taking the crew from a wreck . They render the service without question , and collect the equitable reward afterwards . Society demands the prompt rendering of the service ; the refusal to render it is a crime , and the making of conditions is a temporary refusal . The boatman who bargains with a sinking man virtually says to him : " I now decline to rescue you , but will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sum . My refusal to save you is equivalent to drowning you , and I shall drown you unless you give me something to which I have no equitable claim . " It is the position of the highwayman , and the same is true of those who utilize financial exigencies in the same way . Financial drowning brings ruin to families , and is often as much worse , in its effects , than literal drowning , as the slow starvation of many persons , or their intellectual and moral ruin , is worse than the quick death of one person . The moral and legal principle is the same in both cases , and should be equally recognized and obeyed . This principle has a bearing on the labor questions of the day . Laborers are niost frequently subjected to this wrong . Large numbers of them are regularly confined to one employer as a customer for that which they have to sell ; their exigency is frequently extreme , and they are organized in a class in such a manner that , when such cases of extreme need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not only the few individuals whose necessities compel them to accept whatever // may be offered , but the entire class which they represent , are liable , at such times , to have their wages lowered . It is by means of a few exceptional cases that the extreme results of competition are suffered by the laboring class ; and it takes place by a process of rotation , in which , at each step , advantage is taken by some one of isolated cases of distress . A few persons are at first cro*wded out from employment ; a brief period suffices to reduce these few to a condition where they must accept anything which may be offered for their labor . If some one who is on the watch for such opportunities now offers them half the prevailing rate , and they accept it , the effect may be to displace others , and to reduce them also by the hunger argument , to a willingness to accept a similar reduction . The process may be repeated indefinitely , until general wages are correspondingly reduced . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reluctance would be driven to it by the competition of others . A few men without employment , and a few employers without souls , are the conditions of a general reduction of wages below the point to which legitimate causes would reduce them . Unemployed men and soulless employers always exist somewhere . It was stated in the interest of railroad managers at the time of the late general strike , that the places of the strikers could all have been filled at the reduced rate which was then offered ; and it was on this supposition that much denunciation was expended on the originators of the movement . On general principles the statement is very improbable . The vacancies could have been filled , a few at a time , by the process of rotation which I have described ; but after the changes had taken place , it would have been to a great extent , the same men who would have been found in the positions . A few at a time they would have left their employment , suffered for a while , and returned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are reduced to a rate of wages lower than that at which they can permanently live , lower than any to which legitimate causes would need to reduce them , is the only means whereby , in a country with as mach vacant land as ours contains , the extreme results of Ricardo 's principle can be realized . It is a mistake to suppose // that these results are now realized from any general and permanent cause , and that the laboring class are already entering on the long and hopeless period which such reasoning holds out before them . Our exigency is temporary , and the suffering which we have witnessed is , to a considerable extent , due to the too sharp competitive spirit which we deprecate . We have seen wave after wave of competition sharper than that which exists in other countries-sharper than any which could exist in our own , if the true principles of competition were generally taught-sweep over the industrial classes , beginning with retail dealers , and extending itself to wholesale dealers and manufacturers , until it has reached the laboring class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be due to legitimate causes ; but the fierceness of this competition , and its peculiarly disastrous consequences are largely due to the commercial animus of our people . Such a spirit needs to be restrained , not by law as yet , but by an enlightened public sentiment , which should always precede law and render it effective . Some laws we have had for the regulating of interest , of wages , and of the price of food ; and while it is anintelligent to denounce such legislation as utterly wrong in principle , it is to be conceded that it has not been as effective as it may at some time be , in practice . Such laws have originated in the interests of a class , not in a general sense of right in the entire community . What is to be desired is not the abandonment of attempts in this direction , but the securing of conditions in which the attempts may be made successfully . Given , a general belief that a thing is right , and laws to define and enforce the belief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Economy is not unrestricted competition , but competition that is truly free , because controlled by justice and by law . The distinction between freedom and license needs to be preserved in this department of political philosophy . With that distinction clearly main taine ( l , we may still retain , in economics as in politics , our beautiful watchword , liberty . lit is the function of moral influence to separate true liberty from false , by imposing restraints on competition . These restraints are not fixed , but indefinitely progressive , and at present are far from having reached their maximum limit . // The progressive character of these restraints affords the needed key for the solution of the difficult economic problems of the present ; though they were weak as yet , which they are not , the fact that they are growing relatively to the forces that oppose them would prove them capable of accomplishing indefinitely large results . A sufficient advance in this direction would revolutionize the industrial system ; a comparatively small advance would improve the system , by removing the worst evils that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of competition would not at once stop the downward tendency of wages , which Ricardo has shown must exist under certain conditions ; but it would check its rapidity , and substitute a different minimum . The bottom line would not be a death line . Wages would fall , not until they could go no lower , because the laborers would otherwise perish , but t*ntil they would be allowed to go no lower , because farther reduction would be a wrong . Present dangers would be largely averted , and the gloomy future prospect would be brightened by an element of hope .
