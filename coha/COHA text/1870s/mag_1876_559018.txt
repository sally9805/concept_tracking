ART . 1. -i . Speech of the lion . L. Q. C. Lamar of Mi88i8-8ppi . Congressional Record , August , 1876. 2 . Speech of the Hon. J. A. Garfield of Ohio . Congressional Record , August , 1876 . THE Southern Question , as it is somewhat vaguely called , - for it is much larger than a mere sectional question , has been the shame and perplexity of our politics for the last ten years . Difficult enough in itself , it has become so entangled with party purposes , that its discussion is a snare to the feet of honest men ; and yet it must be discussed . Its solution is imperatively demanded in the interest of the whole country , for as it stands today it is becoming an absolute danger to all healthy habit of political thought and all proper and constitutional method of administration . It is therefore with pleasure that we find the dreary waste of the Congressional Record abruptly broken by two speeches of more than ordinary elevation . The effort of these speeches was to raise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mere partisan argument , and it has been successful . Of course a certain party character must attach to Congressional speeches on the eve of a Presidential election , but in this case not more than sufficient to relieve and ill*ustrate the discussion . The speakers were both men of recognized ability , genuine representatives of widely variant constituencies , and exceptionably thorough exponents of the confficting interests // and sentiments which provoked the debate . The issue was made clearly , strongly , and fairly , and the contention was sustained with earnestness and eloquence . We propose to review these speeches , to appreciate justly the character of the question raised , and the methods of solution advocated on the one side and the other . It will , however , be necessary to say a few words in explanation of the point at which we propose to take up the argument of Messrs . Lamar and Garfield . That the issue which was made by the late civil war had to be met sooner or later in the life of the United States , no one familiar with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Constitution were only landmarks on a road , the direction of which we all know , but the terminus of which is as much beyond our ken as it was beyond the vision of the men who framed them . That a government completely and admirably suited to thirteen sparsely settled and just emancipated colonies , with no prescience of the future and a good many lingering prejudices of the past , would or could exist without great modifications , was simply impossible . You might as well expect the great Cumberland road and the old mail-coach to do the work of our railroads and telegraphs . And this is just what the Federalists , a party certainly led by statesmen of larger ability than this country has ever since possessed , understood thoroughly . They intended the Constitution to be expansive . They expected by Presidential influence and judicial legislation to extend and consolidate the power of the government . But there were three difficulties in their way which no political ability could overcome . First , the country had no centre of social influence corresponding to the political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great civil change can be effected without such a combination . Second , the comparative weakness of the Federal government , consequent upon this condition of things , and the powerful traditions of colonial consequence , gave time and opportunity for the development of strong State feeling ; while the dependence of the senatorial elections upon the State legislatures gave a pre-eminence to the interests of State politics fatal to any such consolidation . And , lastly , the influence of the French Revolution colored the // sentiment and excited the sympathies of the people so strongly as to give an irresistible democratic bias both to our local and national politics . The Federal party , therefore , although it had Washington 's sympathy , Hamilton 's brain , and the strong will of the elder Adams , failed utterly , - so completely , indeed , that even to this day no one has ventured to do it historical justice . Mr. Jefferson 's election having worked a complete revolution , the State-rights theory became the authorized and authoritative construction of the Constitution ; and from his term down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virtue . There was no undue development of contending sectional interests , the power of the Federal government was not huge enough to overshadow State pride or too greatly to diminish State power , and the personal tone and temper of our leading statesmen still fairly represented the traditions of culture , wealth , and character which attached to the great personages of our early history . But the close of General Jackson 's administration clearly showed what had become of the theory of State rights . Almost all the questions which made the politics of his day divided all the States alike , - the United States Bank , internal improvements , the tariff , the currency . On all these questions there was an administration as well as an opposition party in every Southern as well as in every Northern State . Even in South Carolina , Mr. Calhoun 's own State , there was a large and powerful Union party in opposition to the nullification movement . But this could not conceal the fact that the principle of Jackson 's administration was the rule of the numerical majority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principle not inconsistent in practice with State rights so long as the States were politically divided in themselves , but utterly opposed both to the practice and to the theory of State rights whenever it should happen that the States themselves became the parties of a minority and a majority . So true was this , that Mr. Calhoun , the chiefest of its champions , who had taken up the theory where Jefferson left it , who perfected and adapted it to the wants of his section , but who found it break to pieces in his hands as a weapon of defence , was driven to the further step of minority representa ' // Oct. tion , and bequeathed , as the dying legacy of his long , practical experience , the doctrine that the only safety of the South was a dual executive , - the abstract idea which in its concrete form was surrendered forever with General Lee 's sword at Appomattox . For while the extreme democratic doctrine of the absolute right of the numerical majority had become the principle of the government , the majority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assuming to each other a position of implacable hostility . When , therefore , in his last diplomatic circular to the foreign ministers of the United States , Mr. Buchanan said , " You are of course aware that the election of last November ( 1860 ) resulted in the choice of Mr. Abraham Lincoln ; that he was the candidate of the Republican or Antislavery party ; that the preceding discussion had been confined almost entirely to topics connected directly or indirectly with the subject of negro slavery ; that every Northern State cast its whole electoral vote ( except three in New Jersey ) for Mr. Lincoln , while in the whole South the popular sentiment against him was absolutely universal , " it was evident that the time had come for a new departure in American politics . Whether that departure could have been in a peaceable direction , it would be very idle now to inquire . The war came . The war ended in the complete and irremediable defeat of one of the parties to the conflict . Whether or not slavery was indirectly but absolutely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that at its inception the question was as to the constitutional relation of the States to the Federal government . But in its progress the North did what every people at war have done , and will ever do . They struck where they could strike hardest . They abolished slavery , and any discussion now of the motive or technical legality of this action is simply absurd . The fact is undisputed and undisputable , and it is with its consequences alone that statesmen have to deal . Upon the surrender of General Lee , then , there were two questions at once presented to the statesmanship of the country , the one very much complicating the other . The first was , What is the relation of the seceding States to the Union as interpreted by the war ? the second , What is the relation // of the newly emancipated slave to the society in which he found himself free ? both to be solved , not in the interest of the North or the South , of the master or the slave , but in the interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war had assured ; and both questions needing immediate solution to enable the country to resume and develop its natural and healthy life . No language can exaggerate the importance of these questions to us and their consequence to the future , not only of this country but of civilization . Let us begin by admitting frankly and stating fairly the great difficulties of the questions with which the Republican party had to deal in 1865 . For it must be remembered that at the time of the surrender the Republican party was in broad general sentiment and policy the United States . That section of the Democratic party - if it had extent and coherence enough to be called a party - which was opposed to the war could scarcely venture to hold , much less to express , an opinion , and the South was simply a vanquished territory . The North looked upon the war of secession as a wicked and unnatural rebellion ; the national feeling which lay , as it were , latent in its people , had been excited into heated and patriotic enthusiasm by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ household were the memory of bitter sacrifice and the pride of overwhelming success ; and now , after long years of wearying hope and fear , after the lavish expenditure of untold wealth and uncounted lives , the great triumph was won . The Union had been preserved ; and what more natural than that first resolution , that it should never be so perilled again ? But how ? Who had been conquered and what was to be punished ? The extreme theory which even Mr. Stevens never ventured to develop to its full logical consequence would have met one side of the difficulty . The leaders of the rebellion would have been decimated , the estates of Southern landowners confiscated , and the subjugated white man and the emancipated negro would have been governed by one great imperial despotism . But where was the despotism ? It had to be created . Certainly such was not the United States , even excluding the Southern States which had seceded . The Union which had been thus preserved was a Union of States ; and the United // States as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was even after it was widened and strengthened by war interpretation , could not have endured with such a burden as a subject South . The whole machinery of government would have given way under the pressure . Besides which , the American mind could not as yet conceive the idea of the Union without the States . The States had attempted to break up the Union and had failed . The Union had not attempted to destroy the States , and there they were , their arms surrendered , their armies disbanded , and no further hindrance to the execution everywhere of the laws of the United States . But , on the other hand , if these impalpable but indestructible States were back again in the Union with all their rights unimpaired , simply because they were beaten , where was the security for the future ? Who made these States ? The very men who had defied the Union and striven to destroy it at Manassas , at Fredericksburg , at the Wilderness . If these States were to be represented , who was to represent them ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mason from Virginia , Mr. Slidell from Louisiana ? Was the Confederate Congress only to adjourn from Richmond to the opposition seats in the Capitol at Washington ? Such , indeed , might be the logic of the Constitution ; but was such a thing natural or possible ? Would the North , would any people who had gone through such a war , permit such a conclusion ? Fairly considering the obstacles and the temper of public opinion at the North , every reasonable Southern man must admit the immense and intrinsic difficulties of the position . On the other hand , what was the condition of the South ? From the outset of its colonial settlement the civilization of the South was forced by the social and political elements that composed it to take a development , not only different from , but in some respects antagonistic to , the popular spirit and habit of the North . Slavery , which soon after the formation of the Union became the controlling influence of its fortune and creed , necessarily created a land and slaveholding oligarchy , whose interests and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ North was increasing its free population by an almost incredible rate of immigration , was building great // 1876 . The &amp;uthern Question . cities , straining every nerve to extend and perfect its means of internal communication , diffusing popular education , and thus becoming a powerful and active democracy . The political alliance between slavery and the Democratic party at the North to some extent and for some time concealed and delayed this antagonism . But the alliance was unnatural . Its consequence was to undemocratize the Democratic party and secure its final defeat , while its services to the South were only temporary , and , worse than that , delusive , by the false security it engendered . As General Garfield said , if not with entire accuracy , yet with force - " The Democratic party has been the evil genius of the South in all these years . They yielded their own consciences to you on the slavery question , and led you to believe the North would always yield . They made you believe that we would not fight to save the Union . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cross the Potomac or the Ohio to put down your rebellion , we could only do so across the dead bodies of many hundred thousands of Northern Democrats And later , when you would have accepted the Constitutional amendment and restoration without universal suffrage , the same evil geniua held you back . In 1868 it still deceived you . In 1872 it led you into A gulf profound as that Serbonian bog Between Damietta and Mount Casius old Where armies old have sunk . " ' As the progress of the disintegration of the Northern Democracy developed itself , the South was forced to concentrate its defence upon the constitutional theory of State rights . And it so happened that just at the point in our political history where the natural divergence of the two sections was becoming evident to even careless observers , a statesman was born to the South , the splendor of whose intellect , the purity and elevation of whose character , and the national breadth of whose fame , made him at once the idol and leader of his people . Driven by a series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , perhaps , politicians of less ability and more selfish purpose could have better controlled , Mr. Calhoun had reached that point , and had carried the South with him , where their belief and his was that their very existence Was // in imminent peril , and where their only salvation lay in the exercise of the reserved rights of the States . Soon after , he died , leaving them the terrible responsibility of testing the practical value of this protection . Now , whatever may have been the truth or error of these convictions , this is certain , that at the date of secession the whole South , with no appreciable dissent , were earnestly persuaded that the contest was for their lives , their fortunes , and their sacred honor , and that they had , under a proper interpretation of the fundamental law of their political existence , the right to protect themselves by withdrawing from the Union . They applied the test . Their defence crumbled like the walls of a shattered fortress , and their flag of defiance sank into the dust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Confederate government vanished ; " the earth hath bubbles as the water hath , and this was of them . " In sixty days , armies which had made the world ring with their heroic achievements , were dissolved , leaving , from the borders of Virginia to the boundaries of Texas , not even the nucleus of a guerilla resistance ; and the people of the South , appalled , bewildered , stunned , gathered hopeless and helpless under the ruined shelter of their State governments . No man knew whether he was the citizen of a free State or the conquered subject of a foreign power . No governor knew whether he could execute a law , no judge whether he could pass a sentence . The industry of the country was paralyzed . Four . millions of slaves were suddenly freed , and no one knew how far he was privileged to order , no one knew how far he was bound to obey . The whole currency , upon the circulation of which depended the daily life of millions of people , became in a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there existed what has never before existed in civilized history , an utter dissolution of government , and society was held together only by common instincts and common necessities . As if further to complicate and aggravate all that was perplexing and mischievous , Mr. Lincoln , of whom the South knew little , but of whom they did know that he was the representative man , in fact and in place , of the victors , was assassinated within a few days of General Lee 's surrender , and Andrew Johnson undertook the solution of these problems . // The peculiarity of Mr. Johnson 's position did not diminish his embarrassments . A Vice-President succeeding a President for the unexpired term of office has always in our history occupied a position of traditional trouble . He is not in sympathy with the opposition , and yet he is an interference with the party policy of which the President was the representative . All the personal interests of the old administration have been altered and confused by the change ; and the larger the independence and integrity of the new Executive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his individuality . Mr. Johnson 's position was exceptionally difficult . He was a Southern man by birth , and a Democrat by profession . He was both of the things that at the moment were most odious to the Northern people . Nor did Mr. Johnson , in compensation for this weakness , possess the strength which would have come from the full confidence of the South . He was exceedingly unpopular at the South . He had represented for years , and prided himself on representing , the democratic element of Southern society . The great slaveholding oligarchy which governed the South was not his friend , nor he theirs ; and the scorn and dislike with which the leaders of Southern opinion regarded him had more than once found bitter expression on the floor of the Senate . He could not act as a mediator between the victors and the vanquished . He could not speak for the North and say , This must be done . He could not speak for the South and say , This will be done . The South ought not to forget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s course , by the delay which it caused , afforded time for popular passion to cool , and for the intrinsic difficulties of the question to force themselves upon the consideration of thinking men ; and that in all probability it saved the South from that severity of punishment which threatened its leaders , if not its people . But how utter was the failure of his plan of reconstruction the South knows only too well . We do not propose now to discuss it . All with which we are now concerned is , that after his defeat the Republican party set aside the Executive as a component part of the government , and proceeded to the administration of national affairs very much after the fashion of a committee of safety of // a French convention . Of their action it is only necessary to say here , that they framed and put into operation that system of reconstruction under which the governments of the Southern States have been created , and for the last seven years have been maintained ; for at this point we propose to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now we wish to state with all possible precision and clearness what we understand to be the issue of this controversy . As far as it is a mere political discussion as to the merits of Democrats and Republicans , clever and effective though it be , we are not interested in it . What the country wants is , that this Southern question be eliminated a.s a disturbing element from our national politics . The thinking men and the business men do not much care which party settles it , so that it is settled ; what they wish is that whether the next administration is controlled by Mr. Tilden or directed by Mr. Hayes , the policy of this country shall be allowed to run its natural course , free from the disturbing influence of this bitter discord . The issue , as we understand it , involves no change in the reconstruction acts . What is past is past . The State governments created by that policy have become the regular machinery of government ; universal suffrage has been adopted . Nor is it necessary to appreciate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unavoidable result of the intrinsic difficulties of the situation , it may have been the reckless work of political passion ; that makes no difference now . The undisputed fact is , that seven years of this rule have produced a condition of things which , making all allowance for exaggeration and misrepresentation on either side , is a disgrace and a danger to the country . Is there a remedy , and , if so , what is it ? This is the question Mr. Lamar attempts to answer . In his answer he takes four positions as premises . 1 . That the present condition of the South is the unfortunate but natural result of a sudden and unparalleled social and political revolution , which would have confused by its shock the peace and order of any society in the civilized world . In his own language , which for compact force and point can not be improved , - " To illustrate the disturbing force of this measure , let us suppose that in the six New England States and the States of New York and // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our Southern States , in one night four million of unaccustomed , incongruous population , such as Mexicans and Chinese , should be incorporated into the political system of those Commonwealths , and by some paramount power outside of those States should be so compacted together as to gain control of all the departments of their government , of all the offices , all the institutions , State and municipal , - in a word , invested with the entire sovereignty of their body politic , I ask you would not the repose of society be disturbed ; would not all assurance of law , of healthful industry , of business arrangements and investments , - would not all confidence give way to dismay and perplexity , to restless fears , wild passions , and bloody scenes ? Why , sir , the more splendid their political civilization , the more complex their system of laws , and the more perfectly adjusted their social and economic forces , and the higher the moral tone of their society , the more hideous would be the ruin and the more refined the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But the case as supposed is not as strong as the case which actually occurred in the Southern States . The four million of people who by a scratch of the pen were made citizens and crushed into our political system , the eight hundred thousand voters and office-holders and legislators and magistrates , had just emerged from the immemorial condition of slaves . " 2 . That the necessary consequences of such a revolution were recognized by the leaders of the Republican party in the protest of Mr. Hoar of Massachusetts , against the admission of New Mexico as a State , and the protest of Mr. Sargent of California , against the further immigration of the Chinese on the Pacific coast , upon the express ground that the Mexican and Chinese population were , from race , characteristics , and inferior intelligence , incapable of healthy assimilation into the body of American citizens . And still more emphatically by the earnest , profound , and eloquent denunciation of African suffrage by such eminent men as Governor Morton of Indiana , and Governor Andrew of Massachusetts , which we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argument and to the subject . Extracts from the Speech of Hon. 0 . P. Morton , at Richmond , Indiana , September 29 , 1865 . " I believe that in the case of four million slaves just freed from bondage there should be a period of probation and preparation before // they are brought to the exercise of political power What is their condition I Perhaps not one in five hundred- I might say one in a thousand - can read , and perhaps not one in five hundred is worth five dollars in property of any kind Can you conceive that a body of men , white or black , who have been in this condition , and their ancestors before them , are qualified to be immediately lifted from their present state into the full exercise of political power , not only to govern themselves and their neighbors , but to take part in the government of the United States ? Can they be regarded as intelligent and independent voters ? The mere state of fhcts furnishes the answer to the question To say that such men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is simply a misfortune and a crime of this nation , - to say that such men , just emerged from slavery , are qualified for the exercise of political power , is to make the strongest proslavery argument I ever heard . It is to pay the highest compliment to the institution of slavery . " The right to vote carries with it the right to hold office . You can not say that the negro has a natural right to vote , but that he must vote only for white men for office . The right to vote carries with it the right to l ) e voted for . When that right is conferred , you can make no discrimination , no distinction against the right to hold office ; and the right to vote in a State carries with it the right to vote for President and members of Congress and for all Federal officers . The right of suffrage being conferred in South Carolina for State purposes , under our Constitution , as I have before pointed out , carries with it the right to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If you enfranchise all the negroes in these States you will have at least twenty negro votes to one white vote ; and in the work of reconstructing the States of South Carolina , Alabama , and Florida , you will have a larger proportion , - perhaps thirty colored votes to one white . Now , I ask you , what is to be the effect of that ? The first effect will be , you will have colored State governments . Under such a condition of things the negro would no more vote for a white man than you np here would vote for a black man . They would no more elect a white man than you would elect a black man . Human nature is the same , whether in a white or colored skin . There could be nothing that would confer more pleasure upon a man of that race , of course , than the elevation to political power of a man of his own race and color . Having secured power , they would retort upon us that which we have so steadily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they will elect men of theW own color , and we would // have no right to blame them . We would rather think badly of them if they did not . I would ask you if the negroes of Hayti , or any other place where they are in a majority , have ever elected a white man to office . Under Mr. Sumner 's plan you will give them an overwhelming majority in every one of these States , and you will give them the political power of the South . " That they will exercise this power by electing men of their own color is absolutely cert.ain . Believing that human nature is the same under different complexions , that the negroes are not differently constituted from ourselves , and that they have like passions with us , we can not doubt how this power will be exercised . Some will say that it is all right ; if they can find colored men qualified , all right . There are enough colored men of education in the North to go to the South , and fill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand ready to do it . Here we deny to them almost every right except that of mere personal liberty ; and it is so in Illinois and many other Northern States ; and when you present to them the prospect of holding the highest offices in the gift of the people of the Southern States , rest assured they will embrace it . They will have colored governors , and colored members of Congress , and senators , and judges of the Supreme Court , etc . Very well ; and suppose they do send colored senators and representatives to Congress , I have no doubt you will find men in the North who will be willing to sit beside them and will not think themselves degraded by doing so . I have nothing to say to this . I am simply discussing the political effect of it . In every State where there is a colored State government , a negro for governor , and a negro for supreme judge , white emigration will cease ; there will be no more white emigration to any such State . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ County who will go and locate in a State that has a colored State government . You will absolutely shut off at once and effectually all emigration from the Northern States , and from Europe , too , whenever that event shall happen . Thus they will remain permanently colored States in the South . The white men who are now there would remove from them ; they would not remain under such dominion . " Very well , say some ; that is all very well , if we can get the negroes to go there . But let me say that the colored States would be a balance of power in this country . I ask , Is it desirable to have a colored State government*l I say it is not ; it is not , for many reasons . One reason is that such States would perpetually constitute a balance of power . They would be held bound by that most stringent tie that ever held men together , - the tie of color and race , the tie of // a down-trodden and despised race . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to govern this nation for a long time , so four million people , bound together by a much stronger tie , despised by the whole world as they have been , would constantly vote and act together ; and their united vote would constitute a balance of power that might control the government of this nation . " I submit , then , however clearly and strongly we may admit the natural right of the negro , - J submit it to the intelligence of the people that colored State governments are not desirable ; that they will bring about results that are not to be hoped for ; that finally they would threaten to bring about and , I believe , would result in a war of races . " Now the question turns up , how can this be avoided ? If I had the power I would arrange it in this way : I would give these men a period of probation and preparation ; I would give them time to acquire a little property and get a little education ; time to learn something about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of political power . At the end of ten , fifteen , or twenty years , let them come into the enjoyment of their political rights . By that time these States will have been so completely filled up by emigration from the North and from Europe that the negroes will be in a permanent minority . Why ? Because the negroes have no emigration , nothing but the natural increase , while we have emigration from all the world and natural increase besides . Thus , by postponing the thing only to such times as the negroes are qualified to enjoy political rights , the dangers I have been considering would have fully passed away , their influence would no longer be dangerous in the manner I have indicated , and a conflict of races would not be more likely to happen than it now is in Massachusetts . In Massachusetts the negroes have exercised political rights for twenty-five years , and yet there has been no disturbance there , no conflict of races . Why ? Because the negroes have been in the minority . " Extract from Governor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It may be asked , Why not demand the suffrage for colored men , in season for their vote in the business of reorganization ? My answer is , I assume that the colored *jnen are in favor of those measures which the Union needs to have adopted . But it would be idle to reorganize those States by the colored vote . If the popular vote of the white race is not to be had in favor of the guaranties justly required , then I am in favor of holding on just where we now are . I am not // in favor of a surrender of the present rights of the Union to a struggle between a white minority , aided by the freedmen on the one hand , against a majority of the white race on the other . I would not consent , having rescued those States by arms from secession and rebellion , to turn them over to anarchy and chaos .

They have the brain and the experience and the education to enable them to understand the exigencies of the present situation . They have the courage , as well as the skill , to lead the people in the direction their judgments point , in spite of their own and the popular prej udice . Weaker men , those of less experience , who have less hold on the public confidence , are comparatively powerless . Is it consistent with reason and our knowledge of human nature to believe the masses of Southern men able to face about , to turn their backs on those they have trusted and followed , and to adopt the lead of those who have no magnetic hold on their hearts or minds l Reorganization in the South demands the aid of men of great moral courage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boldly ; who can comprehend what the work is and what are the logical consequences of the new situation ; men who have interests urging them to rise to the height of the occasion .

" 3 . That these inevitable difficulties were aggravated by the fact that the essential principle of the reconstruction policy was the creation of that very color line which is now represented as the work of Southern malignity - " The result of that conflict was , that the Federal government assumed , as a political necessity , the exclusive prerogative of reconstructing government in the South . The policy of reconstruction excluded the white race ( on account of its suspected disloyalty ) as the basis of the new order .

" - MILL 'S Representative Government . Mortifying as is the hope , we can not but hope that this scheme has not even the sincerity of fanaticism ; that proposed just at the close of the session , when any practical legislation is impossible , it is only another miserable illustration of that system of party tactics which disfigures our public character , degrades those who devise , demoralizes those who execute , and renders almost impossible any well-founded confidence in representative government . But foolish and wicked as it is , there it stands as the solution of the Southern question , proposed , we will not say , by the Republican party , but certainly by those who , like Mr. Boutwell , claim and aspire to lead it . We now turn to the other solution . It certainly possesses the advantage of being simple , constitutional , and representing the unanimous conviction of that portion of the South of which Mr. Lamar is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it do what Mr. Lamar predicts ; will it restore peace and order ; will it administer equal justice to all men ; will it restore confidence to industry and capital ; will it give just and wholesome influence to property , intelligence , and character , and at the same time preserve in spirit and truth to the recently enfranchised race those rights and privileges which have been secured to them by the Constitution , and which are in themselves guaranties and opportunity for // that slow but steady improvement which the interests both of the race and country require ? The difficulty in such a discussion is that men approach it not only with strong , preconceived theories , and excited by party passion , but that the fairest and honestest representatives of either race state the same facts so as to give them the most contrary significance . But we think there are some facts which afford the means of at least moving in a direction which will lead to a safe and . steady judgment .

" Now we think the South has the right to insist that its history of the last ten years proves that Southern discontent and disorder , whatever be their degree , are not threats against the Union nor defiance of the Constitution . For it seems to be indisputable that during the three years of the development of the reconstruction policy , although it worked the completest social revolution known to history , although there was not a feature that was not harsh and repulsive , although the newly reorganized State governments were put aside , and the States remanded to the condition of conquered territories , yet while the United States authority governed the South , in all that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that authority . The people of the South recognized the power of the Union . When it ordered , they obeyed . They devoted themselves assiduously and hopefully to their private affairs , and strove quietly , and not without fair success , to renew the relation between capital and labor which emancipation had placed upon such altered foundations , and upon the restoration of which the prosperity of all classes of citizens depended . It can then be justly claimed that this case , to borrow a phrase familiar to lawyers , does not involve a federal question , and that if this continuous and chronic disturbance is the result solely of ldcal // misgovernment , then South Carolina and Mississippi have the same *right which would be allowed Massachusetts or Minnesota to exercise jurisdiction . Thus stated , the question is this : Are the Southern troubles the consequence of local misgovernment , and would the white element at the South , if left to its natural influence and power , correct and remedy that misgovernment effectually and justly ? To examine these questions properly would require a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and character . This article has already extended to such length that we can only indicate our opinions , postponing to another opportunity the detailed proof in their support . In the period between the emancipation and the enfranchisement , we think we can say with truth that the relation between the white man and the negro had not become imbittered . Here and there occurred cases in which the master could not forget his old authority , and the slave made insolent and offensive use of his new freedom . But these were rare , resulting almost always rather from peculiarities of individual temperament than from any fixed principle of conduct . As a general rule the condition of feeling was this . The white man felt that all that was left him was his land ; that climate and soil made negro labor necessary ; that the docile character of such labor , its comparative cheapness , its long special training , the still existing community of feeling bred by old association , which no one not Southern born will ever truly appreciate , - that all these made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest as well as his duty . More than this , the conduct of the slaves during the war , when in many sections of the South there were not white men enough at home to form a respectable patrol , and when the comfort and safety of women and children were so entirely dependent upon their conduct , had made a deep and grateful impression upon the minds of the Southern people . Every one familiar with the planting sentiment of the South knows how popular at this time , especially among the younger and more energetic men , was the theory that free labor was better than slave , and how readily lands were heavily mortgaged to enable the owners to commence the experiment . // On the other hand , the negro was shy and cautious in his new condition of life . The removal of personal restraint , the exemption from corporal punishment , the right to use his own time , to make and receive his own money , were the privileges in which he exulted . The ownership of the land by his former master @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the elements of his character ; the personal relations between the races had in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred been so kindly that there was no malignity to be developed ; and , putting aside the political aspect of the question , there was on both sides a good-humored acquiescence in the emancipation , that is not the least remarkable fact in the marvellous history of the last ten years . The only ambition then manifested by the negro was for churches and schools ; and so fully was this recognized as natural and proper , that in many cases the planter , upon reorganizing his old estate , was willing to make the charge for both one of his obligations in the contract . But this promising condition of feeling was changed by the establishment of negro suffrage . The political power of the South was at once placed in the hands of a majority utterly ignorant of the duties of citizenship , and to whom the very words used in political discussion were as unmeaning as Greek and Hebrew . In the mean while scattered over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there had drifted innumerable agents from the Freedmen 's Bureau , subalterns from the military commands , retired soldiers from negro regiments , small and rapacious traders in the supplies that negro taste and negro extravagance demanded . Unknown and almost unnoticed , but under the guidance of abler and more considerable men , these people had organized " The Union League , " and by it banded the negroes together into a solid phalanx . Then was the time of the famous party cry , " Forty acres and a mule . " Then from church pulpits and political platforms , in secret associations and by private instruction , was the negro taught to hate and defy his former master , to deny the rights of property and intelligence , and to combine to give the lion 's share of power and plunder to the few white men who controlled this perfect but pernicious machinery . When the State elec // tions came on in 1868 there was no room for compromise , no opportunity for concession . We do not propose at present either to describe in detail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is too well known of all men . Impartial men , without a touch of sympathy for the Southern cause , have seen with their own eyes , spoken with their own lips , and have told what they saw . The points we wish to indicate are - 1 . That the whole capital of the South was placed absolutely at the mercy of the labor of the South . The landowner , upon whose lands and by the expenditure of whose capital the whole labor of the country had to be subsisted , was deprived of any voice in the adjustment of taxation or the regulation of expenditure . 2 . That the great mass of voters , ignorant , passionate , and misled , were controlled by men who were strangers to the interests and aliens to the sympathies of those they governed ; and they were , without using slang phrases of abuse , adventurers to whom the States were simply fields for the gathering of unexpected fortunes and hitherto unattainable honors. 8 . These lines of division were deepened and aggravated by party policy for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interfered with all its power and patronage upon the side of its friends and supporters . Let us illustrate what we nean . Let us suppose a county in some Southern State with a population of fifteen thousand , - say five thousand whites and ten thousand negroes . All the land is owned by the whites . To bring that land into cultivation they have had to mortgage their estates heavily , at enormous interest . Fences have to be put up , buildings erected , mules bought , and full supplies of corn , bacon , and molasses to be provided . The ten thousand negroes have no means of support , of daily bread , except as laborers on these lands . Their wages are good , their work light . The law secures them a lien on the crop to enforce the payment of their dues . They are as free in every respect as their employer . But they are ignorant ; they can neither read nor write ; they were slaves only yesterday , and the idea of citizenship is simply beyond their comprehension . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commissioners are to be elected . The negroes , under the lead of men who , to say the least , are not identified either in interest , habit , or sympathy with the community , insist upon the representation . The property which is to bear the burden of taxation has no voice . Taxes are levied ruinously , money is appropriated lavishly , the member of the legislature sells his vote in open market for judge and senator , the county commissioner embezzles the funds of the county . Colored trial justices and magistrates are appointed who can not write a warrant or construe a statute . Colored preachers , whose scripture and grammar are alike erratic , are made school-teachers . The sheriff summons a colored jury , who , rich in the prospect of a dollar a day for attendance , register with stupid impartiality verdicts which they do not understand . The Federal government throws the weight of its patronage on the same side , and every postmaster , every revenue officer , every deputy of its courts , must be either the tool or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minority ? If they use the power which belongs to them as employers , it is intimidation ; if they release rents or increase wages , it is bribery ; and Federal courts and Federal troops are at hand to administer civil or martial law , as party interest may require . What becomes of the white man ? Of the white population , a large proportion , who are engaged in mechanical pursuits , as carpenters , masons , blacksmiths , etc. , etc. , are straitened by the competition of free negro labor , which , be it remarked in passing , has everywhere in the Northern States , except in the case of menial employment , been a source of discord and disturbance wherever that element has been large enough to be appreciable , while the landholder is simply ruined . For it must be recollected that the cotton product of this county which made it a large consumer of luxuries imported from the North was in former times a surplus product . Capital wealth was in slaves , supplies were of home production . In the place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in the present condition of Southern agriculture the purchase of corn , bacon , and artificial manures bears a fearful ratio to net proceeds of crops . Statistics would show that an almost incredible portion of the // profits of cotton ( at present prices there are no profits ) is consumed in its production . Not only then is this county suffering itself , but it is disabled from its former contribution to the commerce and wealth of the whole country . Now can any man doubt that if the five thousand white men were allowed their natural and proper influence in its government , the county would be better governed ? If they governed , would the negro be oppressed ? Two considerations are conclusive on these questions . 1 . The great want at the South is labor . The statistics with regard to negro labor , its efficiency , its relative increase or decrease in the last ten years , its transfer from one section of the South to another , are very interesting ; but we must assume now , for the purposes of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that the South wants more labor and that there is no reasonable prospect of its being supplied by immigration . Besides which , what is wanted is negro labor . The white population , therefore , of the county will never consent to have their ten thousand laborers driven away by oppressive legislation . Homes and employment are waiting for them everywhere . And the proof of this is found in the fact that in all the bloody troubles of which we are told at the South , none , absolutely none , have taken their rise from differences between the laborer and his employer ; or if some slight difference has occurred , it has been easily and promptly settled , - as witness the late strikes in a small rice section of South Carolina . All these serious and violent difficulties have been political . No ; as long as negro labor is the necessity at the South which it is to-day , so long the negro laborer is armed with weapons of perfect defence . Nowhere will he be in danger until the white employer , maddened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desperation throws to the winds all consideration for his fortunes . 2 . We assume that negro suffrage will never be abolished . The negro is a full , free citizen of this Union , and he will remain so . Let us suppose then that , in our county , the abolition of the color line , the restoration of good feeling , and the natural influence of their wealth and intelligence , give the government of the county to the five thousand white men . // Where is the danger to suffrage ? Suppose , further , that the first tendency of the change is towards a reactionary policy . It must be admitted that there is a large margin for healthy and wholesome reaction . But how long would it last ? As soon as the black votes were freely given to the white minority , how long would that minority hold together in the defiant union into which they have been driven by the banded opposition on the other side ? How many candidates for the legislature and county offices would spring up , and what earthly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vote which is now their danger ? Has political selfishness ever hesitated before any combination that promised succ*ss , and how many campaigns would it take to melt Democratic exclusiveness ? The abolition of the color line would be the surest protection of negro suffrage . Extend this picture of the county to the whole South , and you have the condition of the South , and in these considerations the argument for Mr. Lamar 's solution . It is not without its difficulties ; but they are difficulties which honest and wise effort on the part of the South can remove . There are some things which the Southern people must learn . They must learn that a great failure has some bitter consequences , which time only can cure . They must learn that , in this stage of the world 's history , there is a great and conscientious public opinion , which can sympathize with heroic defeat , but will only do so when that defeat brings its proper lesson of chastened wisdom . They must learn that the honest millions of this Union , who have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe that they have very solemn duties as citizens of a free commonwealth , are determined , not that the white man shall be subordinated and subjected to his former slave , but that the negro shall have a fair field and ample encouragement to develop whatever is best in the nature God has given him . They must learn that the American people will not permit their civilization to be disfigured by bloody riots and high-handed violation of the law , however hard be the evils which they have to bear . And they must learn a truth which runs in the undercurrent of all Mr. Lamar 's speech , that their safety lies in no servile adhesion to any party , be it Democratic // or Republican , but in their own wisdom , resolution , and patience . Mr. Lamar has become their pioneer on the right road ; and if there are men enough at the South , especially among the younger generation , who will follow him with equal ability and patriotism , it will not take very long to cut a broad way through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the whole country , this question must be settled . It has become an issue of national life or death . Either this Union must be preserved as the North fought to maintain it , with its unequalled balance of national power and local self-government , with its widely separated interests blended into one national policy , its widely variant sentiment fused by the heat of a common patriotism into an enduring and advancing national civilization , or it must be separated by something worse even than violent secession . One half of the nation must be converted into an imperial despotism , corrupted and corrupting by its patronage and power , trampling , with superb and cruel selfishness , upon the rights and liberties of States and individuals ; while the other half is transformed into an abject and servile territory , its resources dried up and perished , its history obliterated , and its free people , of all races and colors , bound in a common " drooping and disconsolate household captivity , without refuge and without redemption .
