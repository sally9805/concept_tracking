txt Yesterday the Tribune for the first time denied that JAY GOULD has any share in the proprietorship of that paper . Let it have the benefit of that denial . Most people will conclude that had the Tribune made this explanation in the first instance , it would have been a more business-like proceeding than asking other papers to deny a charge which it carefully refrained from denying itself . The Tribune used a bullying tone toward its contemporaries , but was very careful not to say what it thought proper to publish yesterday . During our fight with Tammany , many of our contemporaries ( including the Tribune ) said or insinuated that we had " sold out " to TWEED and . SWEENY . We took the trouble to deny that statement , although the course of the paper might have been deemed a sufficient answer to it . That a journal which has so recently whitewashed JAY GOULD , and which has declared that the public can now " afford to dismiss his case , " should consider it a libel to have JAY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instance of moral 0011116140D . JAY Gouray 's character is bad enough , but no one but the " Professor of Journalism " has supposed that it would be a libel in law to allege that he owned stock in a newspaper . The second . libel complained of by the Tribune is the statement that its circulation had sunk to 20,000 on the daily , and 90,000 on the Weekly . What authority the Brooklyn Union had for making this statement we do not know ; but when the Tribune says that the " circulation of the Tribune is nearly or quite double what they assert " ? that is , 40,000 on the daily , and 180,000 on the Weekly ? we have good reasons for believing that it asserts that which it can not support in Court , and we are prepared to show our grounds for that belief . We do not know what are the actual figures , but we do know that we have received thousands of letters from former subscribers to the Tribune , declaring that they have abandoned that journal , and turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the slightest doubt that the circulation of the Tribune must have fallen off immensely since Jan. 1 . 1871 . We shall see whether its hooka ? if it keeps any  --  will disprove that statement . We will produce the letters from . its subscribers proving that we have reasonable grounds for expressing the opinion for which we hold ourselves responsible . For the rest , let it be observed that the first alleged " libel " appeared in the Brooklyn Union on the 27th December , and . was not republished by us till the 30th ? thus allowing ample time for the Tribune to have made any explanation it thought proper . It is now trying to get itself " talked about , " and gain notoriety , which may in part compensate it for the losses it has sustained . through its base treachery to the Republican Party last Summer . It slandered every Republican who refused to support HORACE GREELEY , and discredited every principle for which HORACE Gi=LErliad previously contended . For this shameless treachery it has not been forgiven , and never will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention by actions for libel . We shall not carry on any controversy with it on the subject , but merely inform it that our lawyers will at once accept service of papers on our behalf .
