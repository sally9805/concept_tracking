txt The suggestion made by Miss FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE in her letter to Dr. WINES , which we published the other day , on the subject of prison discipline , seems ' well worthy of attention . Miss NIGHTINGALE proposes that in all crimes involving the unlawful conversion of alien property , punishment should be made to include restitution , or , as she puts it , the " thief should be obliged to work out and repay the price of his theft . " Stealing , she thinks , would in that case cease to be lucrative , and prisons would speedily lose the attractions which , supplying as they do good food and shelter at least , they undoubtedly often present to the idle , unskillful , or inveterate thief . At present Miss NIGHTINGALE is of opinion " a good prison is actually a reward , not a deterrent , " and to the criminals of the worst , because the most irreclaimable , type , presents itself rather as the incentive than the penalty of crime . Miss NIGHTINGALE 'S opinions on any subject of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in the present instance much is to be said in favor of her argument . It has , at least , plausible analogies to back it . Restitution , where possible , is held to be an essential condition precedent to absolution from the moral guilt of crime , and it seems but fair to demand it in - treating the penal offense as well . Besides , there is in such a project a captivating simplicity and logical precision which please the nattrral sense of justice . If A robs 13,4ay of five hundred dollars , and is sent to prison for it , ho thereby liquidates this debt to society , whose rules he has violated , but not- his indebtedness - to the individual he has despoiled . That exists intact after his imprisonment has ended , and . until the five hundred dollars are repaid ; and nothing seems more reasonable than that the thief should . be compelled to make such repayment , either out of his own pocket or the proceeds of his labor . As the law stands , the person robbed appears to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , indeed , be gratified by the punishment of his despoiler , but his property , where , as not seldom happens , the thief has had time to put it out of reach , remains equally lost to him , and the law makes no provision for its restitution . Theoretically , then , Miss NIGHTINGALE 'S Plan appears to be logical and . consistent . In practice , however , we may doubt if it would work as successfully or as beneficially as she anticipates . That is to say , though restitution of stolen property is always desirable , it would be practically very difficult , if not impossible , always to enforce it under prevailing social conditions . In cases of small theft it might be a feasible and salutary regulation . But in a forgery or a defalcation amounting to millions , how would it be possible for the thief to work out the sum of his robberies under ordinary circumstances and within the limits of an ordinary life-time ? Inside the prison it would be clearly impossible . Outside of it , how is the-obligation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard labor is , with one exception , the severest punishment known to our law , and reserved . for the worst crimes , among which stealing is not reckoned . Yet , to make the thief liable to be held , after the expiration of his adjudged sentence until he had worked out the amount of his theft , would often be tantamount to imprisonment for life . besides being equivalent to a renewal of the old and cruel principle of imprisonment for debt , which it is the tendency of advancing civilization to abolish . The strongest reason , however , for doubting the wisdom of the rule in actual working , is the effect it would be likely to have on the disposition and character of the convict himself . We have always maintained that punishment is not a more important element of prison discipline than reform , if , indeed , all things considered , it be of so great importance . To make good citizens out of bad is more essential than to chastise the bad . How best to direct prison discipline to the attainment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the convict with - the disposition , the encouragement , and the means to reform , is a difficult and delicate problem not rashly to be complicated with . greater embarrassments than now surround it . Working for his own advancement and regeneration , on such a plan as we have before suggested , knowing that his prison labors were helping his progress.to a better future , the honest criminal-may be softened to repentance and amendment . But if every stroke of his hands only rivets him to and reminds him of his criminal past ; if he knows that he must work through long years , not for his own benefit , but for that of another , and that his release will find . him with no provision for his future but a return to crime , is it likely he will long hesitate In all schemes of this kind , Nunn nature , and especially criminal human nature , must be taken into account . For this reason , not always what is best , but what is practicable must be adopted . Nevertheless , though we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its practical working , Miss NIGHTECGALE 's suggestion is fertile in useful possibilities , and should not fail to be considered by any International Prison Congress which may hereafter meet .
