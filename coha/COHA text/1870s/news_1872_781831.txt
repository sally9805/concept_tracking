txt We asked the Cincinnati Commercial the other day whether it really entertained any doubt about GREELEY being the favorite candidate of Tammany . It admits that it does not , and confesses that some of the worst men in the country are working for GREELEY . At first it attacked us for saying this . But , unlike some Greeley organs , it has the honesty to admit the weight of facts . Now , however , it falls back on another line , namely " You 're another . " If bad men support GREELEY , there are bad men supporting GRANT . We do not think much of this argument , even if the Commercial could produce evidence in its support . In the first place , the special instances it cites do not prove its case , as we have shown more than . once , and . can show again if necessary ; and in the next place , even if all it says were true , it would . tell nothing in favor of its candidate . Two blacks do not make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to be struck , the sum- total will show a damning record against GREELEY . There is not a rascal in this City who does not propose to vote for GREELEY . TWEED , SWEENY , HALL , ? the entire Tam-. many gang are for him . Every Tammany organization in - the City ' is being revived for his benefit . The Tammany Republicans ? the meanest politicians in the world  --  are using all their efforts in his favor . - Under this stimulus , the " Americus Club " was revived last week , " Boss " TWEED in the chair  --  the first time he has dared to show himself in public for months past . Let the people read the following report of this significant event , from a Paver which TWEED is known to have bribed more than once : " There was an old-time gathering of the Americus Club in Room No. 117 of the Metropolitan Hotel last evening . - About fifty-four members were present , including William M. Tweed , Richard Tweed , Owen W. Brennan . James D. Macgregor , Judges Shandley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schirmer , William Dewey , Charles Hall , Charley Sayles , Joseph Harrison , Thomas Donoghue , Harry Felter and George Butt . WILLIAM M. TWEED called the meeting to order , and said that a large number of members had signified to him their desire that he should reorganize the Club . The object of bringing them together was to have a mutual expression of feeling on the subject of reorganization , and to collect dues and subscriptions . Mr. TWEED then extended a hearty invitation to all to help themselves to the champagne and other refreshments plentifully provided . The general expression of feeling was strongly in favor of reviving the Club , and $8,600 was promptly contributed by members present , besides $3,400 sent in by absentees . It was resolved to reopen on Saturday of next week , when tt is expected that about 137 members of the Americus will take part in the festivities . Mr. Joni : Voonms , who purchased the lease of the Club-house , the furniture , tite. , at Sheriff 's sale , has given up everything to the Club , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Club-house and fixings have cost over $275,000 , the house is complete , and the furniture , which is valued at $150,000 , all in the best of order . The Club has four yachts , besides a fine new one now being built , which will be finished in the course of three weeks . Two of the yachts , the Mary Tune Tweed and the Wm . M. Tweed , are entered for races during the season . The debt of the Club has been reduced . to about $30,000 , and not a creditor will lose a cent . There will be a magnificent spread on the opening day . about $3,000 having been already expended in preparations . Not a dollar will have to be expended on the Club-house , furniture or grounds . " The Americus Club is Tammany 's pet child . Its members wore diamond badges , and gave what the reporter above quoted calls " magnificent spreads " ? all at the expense of the tax-payers . A few weeks ago , nothing seemed . more improbable than the resuscitation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Club-house was in the hands of the Sheriff . Bat the bargain between the Fenton men and the Ring Democrats  --  of which bargain ample proof ' stabs found in the proceedings of the last Legislature  --  has suddenly put fresh life and hope into the heart of every Tammany rough and thief . We are told . by the Cincinnati Commercial and other papers that the nomination of GREELEY " strikes a chord " all over the country . Here , the only chord struck is the Tammany chord , and . that reverberates loudly . You may see GREELEY 's portraits in all the /ow corner . groceries and . aroggenies , where , in old times , the portrait of the Boss used to hang . Do n't say it is n't so ? go , and look for yourselves . TWEED and all his gang will be fully restored to power if GREELEY should be elected . What could hinder it ? The Commercial says that " Mr. GREELEY is not the Democratic candidate , but the Liberal Republican candidate . for the Presidency . " Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can deceive any one/ Are not the Democrats going to nominate GREELEY at Baltimore as the Democratic candidate , and is not GREELEY pledged to support their measures if elected  --  even going to the extent of promising that he will not use his veto if measures are passed which he believes to be objectionable ? The Democrat are going to nominate GREELEY , because they feel sure they can twist him to any shape they want  --  for that reason and nc other . The Cincinnati Commeroia/ says be will outreach them after all  --  taking their support and repudiating them afterward , Is not this a pretty little game of diamonei cut diamond ? The public can scarcely be expected to have much sympathy with it .
