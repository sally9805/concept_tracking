' " Slow . Tom Slowboy ( Shakes his fist . ) " ' Try not the pass , ' the old man said ; ' Dark lowers the tempest overhead . ' " Sly . Sam Sly ( Interrupting . ) " Up spoke the charcoal man with a groan , ' If I do get euchred , I 'll play it alone . ' " Slow . Tom Slowboy ( Seizes Sly , and puts his hand over his mouth ; Sly twisting and wriggling to get away . ) I 'll have one verse to myself any way ! " Oh , stay ! ' the maiden said , ' and rest Thy weary head upon this breast , ' A tear stood in his bright blue eye ; But still he answered with a sigh , " Sly . Sam Sly ( Breaking away . ) " Charcoal ! " Slow . Tom Slowboy Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me alone . Sly . Sam Sly That 's just what Jeff Davis said . Slow . Tom Slowboy You 're sure of the next chance ; so do run away . Sly .

( Jumps at Slowboy , who gives a yell . ) Beware the dog , look out for the cow , Whip up your nag , and give a yell now , Charcoal ! " Slow . Tom Slowboy ( Fiercely . ) Now , Sly , there is a point where patience ceases to be a virtue : I have reached that point . I 'll give you three minutes to leave the stage . Sly . Sam Sly You 're in earnest , are you ? Slow . Tom Slowboy Look in my face . Sly . Sam Sly Mean it , do you ? Slow . Tom Slowboy Look at my fist . Sly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you see how I am situated ; unless this child stops , I can not go on . You will lose a treat in not hearing my original poem ; but I intend to have it published , and you must content yourselves with reading what you can not hear . Slowboy , blate away . ( Exit , L. ) Slow . Tom Slowboy ( To audience . ) Ladies and gentlemen , it was my intention to have added a few original stanzas to the beautiful poem of " Excelsior ; " but , by the interruptions of that small boy , too much time has already been taken : I can only give you the concluding stanza ,  --  " Who 'd win a place among the great , Who 'd seat himself in chair of state , " ( Enter , Sly , l. , suddenly . ) Sly . Sam Sly ( Interrupting . ) " Must black his face , perch on a cart , And bellow forth with all his heart , ' Charcoal ! ' " Exit Sly , l. , pursued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
