txt The sudden changes of temperature to which we , in this part of the world , are liable , have seldom been more forcibly brought to our notice than during the few weeks that have elapsed since the 28th or 29th of November . This characteristic of our climate is generally considered very unfavorable to health . That there is , directly and indirectly , much sickness produced by it is a fact of which there can be no doubt . But there are two points to be hero considered that help at least to materially modify the ? inference which would naturally be drawn from this statement . In the first place , very much of the injury to health thus occasioned is in reality the result of an absence of proper care and prudence . In the next place , a sudden change which impairs the health of one person often decidedly improves that of another . It is remarkable how . much heedlessness and want of forethought is manifested , even by people of mature years , in regard to changes in the weather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had always lived in. this neighborhood would have found out that , for instance , the fact of the mercury standing at between 50 ? and 60 ? on a January or February morning , is no evidence that it will not fall three-quarters of the distance to zero before evening . And yet we continually hear of serious- colds or bad attacks of rheumatism , caught through the sufferer taking it for granted that the temperature must necessarily continue stationary for at least several hours . Indeed , this assumption is often acted upon in regard not only to a succession of hours but of days . Who has . not seen , in Autumn , a whole family shivering because , on account of the previous mild weather , there were mystoves up , or the furnace had not been put iu order ? Or , who has not known of persons starting off from home to be gone a week or two , unprovided for a fall in the temperature which anybody of common observation ought  --  to have boon aware was imminently liable to occur . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clangorous , is by no means surprising . The wonder is not that it is so often , but that it is not much oftener , prejudicial to health . We have referred . to the circumstance that variations of temperature which are injurious to some persons ? are beneficial to others . It is very common to speak of change of air as one of the advantages to health afforded by traveling . We are in , . dined to think that the benefits thus obtainable are frequently exaggerated ; but , however this may be , it is certain that wo got a great deal of change of air without traveling , and that such variations are sometimes productive of ? highly . favorable results . It is , for example , not at all an unusual occurrence for a rapid fall in the temperature to be accompanied by a marked increase in a sick person 's streagth . So , a sudden transition from cold to mild weather is , in cases of illness , sometimes accompanied by a decided improvement in the condition of the patient . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experienced from these ' changes even by people who are in reasonably good . health . For certain constitutions , an equable climate would undoubtedly be better than the one we live in ; but there is a class of individuals of whom the reverse of this is true , and we do not feel quite sure that it bears anything like so small a proportion to the other as would commonly be supposed . There is one effect produced indirectly upon health by our changeable weather which ought to receive especial attention from the people of New-York . We refer to the accumulation in the streets daring frosty weather of substances from which a hot sun may suddenly evolve a dangerous quantity of noxious vapors . How much of the sickness that is attributed to changeable weather is in reality due to dirty streets , is an inquiry the answer to which can not at present be definitely ascertained . But if , at some time in the far distant future , the experiment shall be tried of keeping for a while our City highways reasonably clean , there unquestionably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mortaLty assigned to the variable nature of our climate .
