VOL . XX. - DECEMBEII , 1875. - No. 6 . REUBEN DALE . By ANNIE T. HOWELLS . PART I. CHAPTER I. TF the rain had only dashed , it would 1 . have been more endurable . As it was , it fell silently and soakingly upon the brown , decaying leaves , which had long since lost their harsh dryness , and were fast assuming that state of pulpiness which offers no resistance and makes no responsive sound to the raindrops . The girl who sat idly looking through the blurred window , which she had closed to shut out the bleak November wind , felt but did not think of the utter desolation of nature around her . She moved from time to time listlessly to trace with her slender white finger the course , of a raindrop as it slid down the window-pane , or to draw her shawl more closely about her as she leaned back in her chair . Half unfolded at her feet lay a letter . It had fallen there when she finished reading it , and had been forgotten in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wondered how she could view the ruin so calmly ; then she ceased to wonder at or analyze her feelings . The present was forgotten , and she only looked back into her paradisc , the gates of which had opened wide in the sweet May days , and were closing for ever this dreary November afternoon . 46 It seemed so short a time since she stood beside her lover , listening to the story he told so well , under the cloudy cherry tree , whose snowy blossoms drifted down upon them through the soft night air . She could still hear to his voice the magical accompaniment of the full-toned spring , ringing with the thousand indescribable sounds which only the fairies can account for . She lived over again the sadness of parting and the gladness his letters had brought her . They were lying tenderly folded away , and no eye but hers had ever read the words which had carried her joyously through the long summer he had been away , or noted how as the summer wore on the interval between each date lengthened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she went over them all again ; then stooped and picked up the one at her feet . It was in answer to a letter she had written him when her heart was sad and full of doubts of his love , and it began in that tone of injury so easily assumed by one who is hurried to a conclusion he has been waiting to have circumstances bring about . " Your letter pained me inexpressibly , " he wrote , " and I feel your doubts to be most ungenerous ; but since you have put them into words-words coldly Entered , according to Act of Congress , in the year 1875 , by SHELDON &amp; CO. , in the office of the Librarian of Congress , ' at Washington . // written , not hotly spokcn-they can never be recalled , even if you desired to recall them , which I can not think you ever will , as I plainly see that your brief love for me has vanished . Well , it is better so . A love that could not live through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I am willing to own , it has been subjected to , could never have stood the storms we must have encountered on our way through life . If it had been otherwise , you might have made me happy-I can not tell ; but as it is , it is far better that we should forget each other . This has been a blow to me , but I will rise superior to it , and forget the one who dealt it . I can begin life anew , with no feeling of remorse , since this is your work . " Farewell . I trust I need not tell you that I , whom you have chosen to doubt , will always feel kindly toward you in spite of the sorrow you have brought upon me . " This was the picture that Agnes Morgan looked back to through the dimness of eight years . She had looked at it often , almost daily , during that time , and the girl who sat its chief feature in the gathering gloom of the short November day , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could analyze , pity , and wonder at . In truth the girl of twenty , bowed down and calling upon her heart to know what she should do with the love so suddenly flung back to her , grieving that in the desperation of her love she had shattered her idol , and telling herself that the future was a path of shadows , that life held nothing more for her , did seem very different from the calm , self-reliant woman she felt herself now to be . Looking back along that then-considered line of sunless years , she saw many a bright spot , many a full joy . She saw dark shadows there too , for death had come again and again , and made her first sorrow seem less by comparison . At first she had found the days long without him . But in time the keen pain of her disappointed love passed away , leaving in its place a bitterness against its object , then a contempt for him , which in its turn faded . And at last every trace of her idol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was forgotten . Her life was a busy one , filled with the duties which come daily in the way of every woman , no matter what her station in life may be . Still , there were many lonely , idle hours which she could not escape , when her life seemed unnatural and incomplete , when she would feel a strange , unreasonable jealousy of the calm which had succeeded the tempest , and of the half-forgotten dream which she knew she could never dream again . When another lover came-if ever one should - she must listen to him doubtingly and love him distrustfully , until she had convinced herself that she was building upon a rock . There could never again be the airy castles lightly and childishly thrown up on the glittering sands , for the winds and waves to beat to fragments and wash out to sea unsuspected by her ; this knowledge tinged her life and deepened the sensitive pride and reserve of her character . And at the end of eight years her friends , such as she met in society , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman , ready enough to enter into their pleasures , yet somehow keeping herself very much aloof from them after all , and with now and then a " mood " not altogether agreeable . Of the host of friends she had known in her school days , only one had stood the test of years-Janette Bell , or La Belle Janette , as her boyish lovers had been wont to apostrophize her-one o* those brilliant girls who , unaccountably to their friends and themselves , seem destined to settle down into maidenhood perpetual . They had not met for years , though frequent letters had kept alive their friendship , and the following one was to bring them together once more : // " BELLEVUE , January 10 . " DEAR AGNES : Your letter came with such a freshness and relish that I devoured it with the utmost greediness-very much as we used to our meagre supply of early radishes , when madame was not at the table to cry out , Mes ch*res , less avidit6 ! ' " You can not conceive the joy your promise to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see how I live . Auntie and I have been together so long and uninterruptedly thatthough we started with a fair amount of affection-I wonder we do n't hate each other outright . I can only compare ourselves as I look out upon these awful snbw-drifts to two shipwrecked mariners surrounded by Arctic snowfields and icebergs . And I follow out the fantastic idea , as she sits knitting and I sewing , by wondering when we shall draw cuts-as shipwrecked mariners always do , you know  --  to see which shall eat the other . I always make myself draw the eating slip , because she is better prepared to die ; and then too there is so much more of her than of me , that it would be a pity to have it otherwise . Then after I 've eaten her I build a raft and steer out into the world in search of him . After I have found and chided him sufficiently for his laziness in his search for me , I step gracefully from my raft , and am about to sweep impressively up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my revery-astonishing me terribly , as I 've thought her eaten all this time-by saying that it is time to have tea ; that late teas do not agree with her ( a fact I have heard a great many times ) ; and I go to the kitchen and issue my orders . " So do come . Do n't disappoiat me . You 'll not know me , I 'm sure . You remember how fastidious I used to be at school about my gloves and shoes ? Well , you 'll hardly believe I scuff about the house in boots with half the buttons gone , and as for gloves ! simply this , I yet expect to sink to that state where I shall wear lisle thread several sizes too large , and stuff the finger-ends with cotton to make them fit-as Madge used to when she was in love with the Rev. Mr. Brown , and affected to despise dress . You know her fingers looked for all the world like a row of piano hammers . " There ! You see , like all persons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that depresses me . " Good-by , my dear old standby . It is such a comfort that you are not married . " Come soon . " Lovingly , " JANETTE . " " P. 8. -I forgot to say that some time this winter my uncle Sam is to be with us . If you and he shall happen here together , I* dare not think how gay we will be . Uncle ( I call him so only by courtesy ) is auntie 's brother , and besides being that , he is a widower and a member of Congress elect . He has a devoted interest in railroads , and is really a good man , though fearfully pompous . But I 'll not say anything mean of him , for he has handled my shabby little fortune until it is attaining magnificent proportions . If it gets much larger , I 'm not sure but I can afford to snub you , I 'll be so rich . " To this Agnes replied : " DEAR JENNY : Your letter has come just at the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change , and want to see you more than I can tell . I will be with you within a fortnight . " AGNES . " True to her promise , before two weeks had elapsed , she found herself seated beside her friend , flying over the snowy road toward the little farmhouse which stood a few miles back from the station . The clear air , musical bells , and swift motion , joined to the warm welcome she had received from Janette , and the pleasure of seeing her once more , brought up a glow of youthful gayety , which she would not have believed herself capable of feeling the day before . // " You put me to shame , Jenny ; indeed you do . How have you managed to retain your spirits , to keep so jolly and young ? But oh , what a desperate ariver you are 1 " she exclaimed as the sleigh rounded a great drift . " I 'm afraid you 'll slay me before we get to your home . " I 'll be tempted to if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be afraid . I should certainly have done something desperate long ago if I had not had these horses to work off my surplus energy upon . I intend to be very careful of you , however , for I have planned a better fate for you than an early and a snowy grave . " " Oh , do n't plan for me . I have done it for mys , elf until I loathe the thought of arranging the future . " " Well , look into the future far enough to anticipate supper anyhow , and after that pleasant prospect , perhaps you can bring your wearied mind to contemplate a brilliant marriage I have in view ; for I honestly tell you that I intend to marry you to my uncle Sam before the year is out . " " Turn your horses at once and take me back . I refuse to be flung at any man in that way . " " Oh , I 'll fling you so skilfully he will never know I did it-will think you married him because he made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you could do nothing but accept him. ** " Well , I tell you honestly that I disapprove of it entirely , and I can answer for it that he will hate me heartily after I have dealt with him as I mean to . " And so they chatted on , forgetting that they were no longer school-girls , and throwing all reserve to the winds , until a turn in the road brought them in sight of the farm , and they were soon standing before the flashing , glowit*g fire . " I do not know howl shall entertain you while you are here , Aggie , " said Janette when they were in their room " I shall be well enough entertained with you alone ; so give yourself no trouble on that score . It will be delightful to have our time to ourselves , with no demands of society to listen to . Besides , think of the years we have to account for since we left school . I want to know what you have done with the last ten , and what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do n't mean to have me travel over twenty years in one night . We have weeks and weeks for that . See I How do you like that prospect ? " opening her desk and displaying a heap of closely written paper . " Manuscript ? An authoress ! " " Yes , an authoress . These are words that burn-at least I always do burn them every spring when I overhaul my room . " " But why do you burn them ? I am sure you could not write trash if you tried . " " Blissful delusion ! You shall never read a word , that I may keep one believer in my genius . But seriously , Aggie , if I could keep my heroines from becoming contemptible little prigs , or my heroes from believing in them just as if they were sensible girls , I might feel encouraged to go on ; but I can not . " " Read me some extracts . " " No , no ; you can not persuade me . I tried it on upcle Sam the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep in the midst of a thunder-storm , and I had felt great tend*erness for that storm too ; indeed , I prided myself upon it ; and I felt so indignant at the old wretch that for a moment I felt like rolling it up and hurling it at him , thunderbolts and all . " " And you want me to marry a man so lost to everything beautiful and grand ! " And now they were fairly launched into a " good talk , " which lasted far into the night . CHAPTER II . that iiight . Tim days sped pleasantly and idly // away to the end of delusive February , when winter seems to have relinquished its hold upon the world , when the snow sinks from sight into the chilled earth , the fogs roll up from the river , and hawks fly screaming across sodden fields . There is a relapse into winter after this , but while the warm southern winds blow we believe that it is spring . Amateur gardeners order seeds at such a time , and receive them in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one day , and the next stand upon a single blue leg on a snowy branch . Farmers talk of an early spring , and remember with surprising accuracy that we had just such an one in the year so-and-so . But then we all enjoy delusions , and what a wretchedly practical world it would be if we neither loved them nor were deceived by them . It was one day in this pause of the winter that Agnes sat at her open window . From it she had watched Jenny* s anxious search for crocuses in the muddy garden below , and had seen that enthusiastic florist return disappointed to the house , and cross the porch on tiptoe and disappear . Then she had turned her attention to the stage as it came toiling toward her down the heavy road . To her surprise it drew up before the gate , and the long looked-for and often discussed visitor jumped out . She drew back within the shelter of the curtains with feelings of dismay and chagrin . She had determined that when the day should be fixed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend with all her plans upon her hands . But now he had come unexpectedly , and she must at least meet him , and make the best of the situation . And she leaned forward again to see what manner of man had been chosen for her . He was giving directions about his luggage , and his face was turned from her , but his voice she heard distinctly ; not an unpleasant voice really ; still , resolved to see nothing good in him , " Rather a commonplace , uncultivated voice , " she thought , " and very determined and self-satisfied . " And as soon as she heard it she remembered something Janette had laughingly said to her : " It is not worth while for you to make up your mind whether you will marry him or not ; he will decide and save you all the trouble . " She wondered now if it would be possible for her ever to find one whose will would carry hers entirely before his . She thought not , and recalling the days so long past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she half regretted that she had grown so strong , and almost wished she might find such an one . He was coming up the path now , and she could see his face . Quite the face for the voice : a strong , rosy , healthful one , lit by right gray eyes and softened by a short , full , brown beard . He was rather tall and well built , and even Agnes , with all her prejudices , had to acknowledge him a handsome man for his age . Half an hour later Jenny burst into the room with , " Well , he has come . " " Yes , and I am gone , or going in the morning . " " You are going in perhaps six weeks from now ; no sooner . I have told the grand mogul that you are here , and he has signified his pleasure thereat ; so array yourself gorgeously and come down . " " Jenny , you can not have been so mean as to tell him any of your absurd plans ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not know me , child . I am trying my hand at diplomacy , and I am convinced that in that important service secrecy is everything . I see I have made a mistake in taking you into my confidence . It would have been better if I had depended entircly upon myself ; but you see I had counted upon some help from you- " " Jenny , you know I do not intend to marry at all-that is , I do not intend to . If I ever meet any one whom I love very much , I may change my mind ; but this thing of hunting a husband I will have nothing to do with . // I think it 's well for you to know what I think . " " But you are not hunting one ; I am the hunter bold ; I am willing to do it all for you out of the love I bear . ' Just think , Aggie dear , how proud you would be to hear him making speeches about revenue reforms , and Indian policies , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it " ; and Janette 's voice took on a pathetic tone of appeal . " Now , Jenny , " said Agnes , seizing her hands , " you shall promise me one thing before we go down stairs . Promise that you will never speak of this again ; will not even look your plans at me when I am talking to your unclemaking me despise myself and feel like boxing your ears . If you do not promise , I shall certainly go home tomorrow . " " I never saw such ingratitude ; but I promise . The introduction over , Agnes seated herself in a distant part of the room , and Jenny sped away intent on household cares . After the few words of greeting , Mr. Stone resumed his conversation with his sister , and Agnes was left free to watch and listen . She found that her previously formed idea of him was hardly just . He was to have been pompous , loud-voiced , and dictatorial ; given over to political anecdotes ; patronizing and with an everpresent sense of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulders . Yet while there was the shadow of all these traits in him , the good ones-which she had forgotten to supply-made themselves also discernible . Indeed , there was so much that was pleasant and attractive about him , that she soon found she was judging him most leniently . He listened to his sister 's accumulation of woes , from the dishonesty of the tenant down to the shocking mortality among the fall chickens , with a readiness and an affectionate interest which amazed his judge . And he did not hesitate to think of a way out of these difficulties , which Agnes thought most praiseworthy in one whose mind was accustomed to so much greater troubles . He told her his plans and successes , went over his experiences in conventions , and related the circumstances of his triumphant election with an almost boyish enthusiasm . This last he gloried in , as the achievement of the aim of his life . And after he had finished he lapsed into a cheery silence from which his sister aroused him , after setting the heel to one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her needles . " Poor Martha ! it 's a pity she is n't alive to go to Washington with you . I do n't like to think of you living there alone . " He looked up from his revery , catching the last word . " Alone ? I do not intend to go alone , Laura . " It was very coarse , Agnes thought , for him to pass over his wife 's death without comment , and make no attempt to conceal his intentions in that fashion . She was sure now what the man really was ; so she maintained an unsympathetic silence and demeanor , as she carried her work to the furthest window , and gave her undivided attention to it . But she could still hear the conversation , and her disgust deepened as the brother and sister fell to discussing his prospects with the businesslike promptness with which some families are wont to turn off matrimonial problems . " I do not think , Samuel , there would be anything amiss in your marrying again if you felt any inclination to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year now , and a man in your position needs a wife . But I do think it would be very wrong and foolish for you to replace her by a young and frivolous woman . I used often to see where she might have done better ; still she had her good qualities , and , as far as she knew how , was a help to you . And if you intend to marry again , I hope you will not be rash or hasty in selecting a new partner . " // Agnes did not think he looked like a man who would be rash or hasty about anything , as she took him in with a quick sidelong glance . He smoothed down his well-rounded knee with his white hand as ho replied , " Plenty of time , sister-plenty of time ; I shall have until next winter to think about it , " and he closed the sentence and conversation with a nod of his head and a tap of his foot . " It will leave plenty of time ' for the lady to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take her to Washington with him , before next Christmas . But that is doubtless a very small matter with him , " thought Agnes vindictively , as she resented the offence offered her sex at large , in nowise appropriating it to herself , for she had within the last five minutes more haughtily than ever disdained the proposed alliance . Having nothing more to say on the subject , Mr. Stone drew out his watch and looked at the time , then looked at Agnes , and then went across and sat down beside her . She laid aside her work , and began to talk with a faint show of civility , but not entirely hiding her haughty mood . And she placed his replies and questions under a severe analysis the moment they were uttered . It was not long before they had made a mutual estimate of each other . He , confused and rendered awkward by her manner , decided that she , for some reason which he could not understand , was not so pleasant as she looked . And she , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conclusion that while he might be a very strong man with men , he was a shorn Samson with women , whom he could only reflect . With his sister he had been commonplace to a degree . With her he followed meekly in the higher paths she opened for him , and seemed surprised and pleased at the newness of her world and ideas . Her discovery flattered him , and the t*te-2-t*te , which had opened so dully , closed , as Jenny summoned them to dinner , in a lively debate . At dinner the political anecdotes which she had dreaded discovered themselves . They were told with tolerable success , though no great evidence of original taste in that line , and rather a melancholy sameness in imitation . Evening when it came was whiled away with music and song by the girls ; and although their guest could only assist as a listener , he did so with such undisguised enjoyment , that when he bid them good night , and acknowledged in his honest , hearty fashion how pleasant this first idle or social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him , Agnes found herself replying with a kindlier and friendlier feeling than she had ever meant to entertain for him . CHAPTER m . Tim next morning when the girls awoke their first thoughts and almost their first words were of their visitor . " This is going to be a busy day , " said Jenny ; " I have a dozen things to see to this morning , so it 's very fortunate that you and uncle can entertain each other . How do you like him anyway ? " " I hardly know ; he 's a good deal as I expected him to be . " " Well , that 's non-committal ; most probably your expectations were not great . " " What kind of a woman was his wife ? " " His wife-let me see if I can describe her-she was not often here , as she and auntie had that meagre allowance of affection which I have often noticed sisters-in-law cherish for each other ; still she came occasionally , and I knew her pretty well . She and uncle were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was a great manager , as far as her house went , a splendid housekeeper , and really had a talent for being a poor man 's wife . But after her husband became rich she could n't get out of her old broove. // Her fine home was a trial to her ; company she did not like , and politics she regarded as the bane of their lives , as it took uncle from home and used up his money . Still I fancy they were happy enough in a quiet way . He was content to take her home elegant dress patterns , and she was content to put them away unmade in a cedar chest where the moths could not get at them . " " I understand . " As Janette had hinted , Agnes and Mr. Stone were left to entertain each other most of the day , whether by accident or contrivance no one but that young lady could tell . It wore away after a fashion ; Agnes hardly knew how , and could give but an unsatisfactory account of it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Something must be done , Jenny insisted , to keep them from all growing dull ; if only there was sleighing , they could be out and get through with the time ; but the roads were in such a dreadful condition she could not think of taking her horses out . Something must be done to-morrow , however . But to-morrow , when it came , was ushered in with an uncompromising rain , which at various times during the day furnished the theme of lively discussion whether it would or would not turn into a snow by nightfall . In the afternoon Janette excused herself to write letters , Mrs. Bell was dozing before the fire , and Agnes and Mr. Stone were once more left to each other . At first she worked away silently among the brilliant wools which lay before her , feeling angry at her friend for deserting her . Then , as she heard her companion plod wearily from one window to another , with nothing to do but look out at the rain , her better nature triumphed ; she separated him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to look up and say with a bright smile , " It 's very dull . " " I 'm afraid I am dull company , Miss Morgan ; but the fact is , I- " " Oh , you misunderstand me . I mean the weather is dull . I 'm sure it makes me very stupid . " And she hastened to efface the impression of his mistake by making him feel that he could be very entertaining if he chose . She wanted to hear him talk of himself-which was not a hard thing to bring about ; and after a few compliments from him for her pretty work and her skill at it , he fetched a chair near to hers , and was soon telling her his life . He had never cared for or had much opportunity to go to school , and had started out while yet a boy , as a sailor , but after a few years had come back to land , resolved there to make his fortune . He began it at twenty-one , he said , by marrying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a graphic description of his courtship and his bride ; after that came a struggle for a home and business , both of which he established , and when there came in his way a chance to hurry on his fortunes by a little judicious speculation , he seized upon it , and by the time he was thirty-five he counted his wealth by tens of thousands . His wife he spoke of kindly , but without sentiment , and as belonging wholly to the past . Their lives he described minutely , giving the date of their wedding day , and even taking his new friend into his confidence sufficiently to tell her that his mother did not like his wife . He had got to this interesting point when Janette made her appearance , to ask them if they did not know it was getting dark . Both in a measure regretted her coming , for the interview was pleasant to him , because he felt that he had been making himself entertaining to this young lady , whom he had found rather hard to entertain , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel that she is being made a confidante of , is finding out much that has been hidden from others . This day was but an index to those that followed . It had established a certain feeling of intimacy between // them which gave them just the slightest interest in each other . The first week was soon a part of the past , and still the guest remained . A visit of this length was an unknown event in his life , but he had found that his sister 's house was unusually pleasant , and that he needed a rest from care , politics , and business ; and so he stayed on for a month , much to the delight of Janette , the melancholy pleasure of his sister , and the surprise but indifference of Agnes . Many times during the month he had shocked her almost beyond forgiveness by his crudeness , his lack of sentiment , and his practical manner of treating subjects which she had always thought of with reverence and utmost delicacy . But she had forgiven him many times , always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even pardoned him in her mind ( for he never dreamed he stood in need of mercy ) after he had spent a whole afternoon entertaining her with a minute description of the last illness and death of his wife . From the recital he seemed to derive a certain pleasure , which she could not understand , unless it was that the remembrance of his unceasing kindness to her and the profusion with which he had spi*nt his money upon doctors filled him with self-commendation . " I should like to have you see the monument I have erected to her memory , " he had said in conclusion ; and encouraged by her expression of the pleasure which the sight would give her , he described it at length , not , it is true , with the technicalities of an architect or sculptor , but quite vividly enough to give her an idea of its proportions and grandeur , as he did , not omitting to name the sum he had paid for it . She had found it in her heart to forgive him even after he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and after Jenny had made her realize it with double force by saying a day or two later , " What statue were you and uncle talking about so earnestly the other day as I came into the parlor ? " " Shame on you , Jenny , for being so deceitful . You know it was not a statue . You heard every word . " " I confess I heard him say something about the cost of marble . I was surprised that he knew , for I thought he had no taste for art . But then men know everything . " " Jenny , you know he was describing his wife 's monument to me , so you need not be so industrious in arranging that table . I know by your back that you are laughing . " And Jenny , thus cornered , turned around and sank into a chair in a limp state of laughter . Agnes viewed her for a moment with a mortified air , though laughing herself , then said , " You need not make me responsible for it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Oh , Aggie , Aggie , it 's too much I What will his honeymoon talk be if he chooses tombstones as a wooing topic ? " " Jenny , remember your promise . He did not select it as a wooing topic . ' He told me just as if I 'd been his daughter . " " Did he ? That makes a difference then . " When she was alone Agnes condemned him severely at first ; then gradually transferred the censure to herself , and ended by thinking she had allowed herself to become a victim to morbid sentimentality , and that it was good for her after all to come in contact with people who felt none of it . Janette had been true to her promise , and had refrained from urging her cherished plans . But Agnes could see they were not abandoned ; neither was she long in learning that the uncle , should he discover them , would not be averse to their success . Consequently she was not altogether surprised when one day , after she had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgetting his presence , he startled her by asking " How old are you , Miss Agnes ? " " I am twenty-eight , " she replied laughing . // " Twenty-eight , and Tam forty-eight - twenty years older , " he mused aloud , and then went on in his straightforward way to ask her to marry him . She listened to him silently until he waited for her to speak , and even then she could not reply . She wondered why she did not refuse him at once , and was angry with herself for not doing so , and yet somehow she could not . She was only sure of two things : one was that she did not love him , the other that she would regret it should she tell him so ; and at last she found herself begging him to give her time to answer him , and hurrying away . Once in her room , she locked the door and sat down to think . She reviewed the month just past day by day . From the first she had watched him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is impossible to resist in one with whom we are constantly associating . But now she must decide at once what her real feelings toward him were : could she make him happy , and be happy with him ? Were the traits and faults she had found in him worse than those of habit and association ? Every day he made her respect him by some unexpected sign of real nobility and goodness , and lately she had a dozen times felt a sense of pity for him as she noticed his clumsy efforts at adaptability . Then too there was a certain strength of character and resolution about him very delightful to her , and which she never failed to feel when she was with him ; and his ideas of right and wrong were steadfast and pure . But withal she did not love him . Then she asked herself if her creed of love might not be at faultmight not be beyond realization . She remembered how , one after another , she had seen with amazement some refined woman marry , as she could easily see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and how her influence had gradually called out hidden qualities and her companionship had made him companionable . Might not such be the true marriage after all ? Was she holding to an ideal ? was the perfect man for whom she waited ever to be found ? She had long ago outgrown the love of her early youth : would she ever again find one whom she could love as devotedly and blindly ? and without feeling such a love , would it be right or safe for her to marry ? As if to solve her perplexity , she took from the table near which she was sitting a book . Opening it idly , her eyes rested upon a passage which impressed her as the answer to her doubts , and she read : Girls of romantic tendencies think they ought not to marry unless with the most passionate furors of love . They do not know that respect and compatibility of temper are better sureties for a happy life than a passion which in time mast wear itself out , however strong it may be now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become friendship . Good plain common-sense men , who would make excellent husbands , but are nothing to look at , are refused by certain of the featherheaded , in favor of a dream that will never be realized , a fancy that has no more substance than a soap-bubble . She closed the book . Here was a reply from one who felt himself competent to speak . If she respected Mr. Stone now , might it not be the commencement of a sentiment that in time would be love ? She walked restlessly to the window and looked out , half glad and half sorry that he had asked her to marry him , but wholly undecided how she should answer him . He was standing at the gate , just where she had seen him a month before , watching the sun as it sank behind a bank of gray clouds . When it was fairly down , he turned as if to enter the house , but looking up , saw her , and tossing away the cigar he had been smoking , called her to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She threw a shawl around her and went down . When she stood beside him , he looked at her anxiously and said , " Have you thought of what we were speaking of this morning , Miss Agnes ? " " I have thought of nothing else . " " And what are you going to say to me ? " // " I do not know . " " Is it so hard to decide between two short words ? " " Yes . " Then there was a long pause . A few flakes of snow came sailing down and rested upon her uncovered hair . He noticed them and said , " We had better go in . " " No , no ; Mr. Stone , please wait . I want to tell you something . I loved some one years ago " " Well , so did I ; but that does not prevent me from loving you . " " But I think it does prevent me from loving again ; at least I leaow I never could love you as I did him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not like you at all when you came , but since I have known you better I do like you very much ; but still I do not know whether it would be fair to give you only friendship when you offer me love . Sometimes I am very lonely , and I think may be I would be happier with you than alone ; but that is selfish , and I do not want to think any more of myself than of you . There , " with a sigh of relief , " I 've told you all , and now I am willing to say whatever you tell me to . " It was a very unflattering statement , and his face reddened as he listened . But he was very much in love with her , and besides he valued her truthfulness and had enough confidence in himself to believe he could make her love him ; so after a moment of doubt , he drew her hand through his arm , and turning toward the house , said , " Then I 'll tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tea he announced to his sister and niece his intention of leaving the next day . " I have been playing too long already , " he said , in reply to their protestations , " though I can not feel that my time has been wasted , " with a look at Agnes which she neither saw nor responded to . Her thoughts were far away ; not in the past , but rushing tumultuously into the future , trying to fathom the years to come , and see whether they would bring her weal or woe . She made no effort to join in the conversation , and when they arose from the table she followed them abstractedly . Her uncle 's look and her friend 's manner had not been lost upon Janette , and she was not slow to . decide what they meant ; and although she felt that her plans had been realized , she was full of misgivings as to the result . The evening was a dull one , as last evenings are apt to be . The wild March wind , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formed but a discordant accompaniment to the music which Mr. Stone had asked for ; the piano was soon closed , and they gathered around the hearth . " How quiet we all are . Why do n't you say something , Aggie I " said the restless Jenny , quite unable longer to endure the silence which she somehow blamed herself for . " I ? Oh yes . We are dull . A storm always make me quiet . It frightens me , I fancy . It subdues me anyway . " " Are you afraid of storms ? " asked her lover , glad for an opportunity to speak to her . " Just a little afraid , perhaps not at all . I never can quite tell whether it is fear I feel , or only a sense of my helplessness . What is it Southey says of it ? - To hear The roaring of the raging elements , To know all human skill , all human strength , Avail not . After all , though , I like a storm . Nature is so much stronger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her might she completely overpowers us- " " But I do n't like to be overpowered , " interrupted Jenny . " It always aggravates me ; I am always so conscious of my worth that I dislike not to have it recognized by everything and everybody . " " Then you 've not outgrown that sublime faith in yourself . I remember // very well one day at school how you set us all into convulsions by stopping in the midst of a composition you were trying to read during a thunder-storm and saying , Either the thunder or I will have to stop , ' and looking all the time as if you thought it the least interesting of the two . " " Janette , I 'm surprised that you should make such a remark at such a time . I once heard of a man who was struck dead by a flash of lightning just as he was making a profane speech . " " Oh , auntie ! that was n't profane . I never swore in my life . " " I did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of such levity ; I think , as Agnes says , that we should be serious-minded and solemn at such times . I remember storms always used to give your poor uncle George a headache ; and I think you ought to respect my feelings enough to refrain from a giddy and unseemly display of mirth at such a time . " Agnes looked mystified over Janette 's reproof . She was somewhat at a loss to know when she had advocated solemnity during a storm , as well as to discover what display of mirth the culprit had made . Jenny remained silent , as the quickest way out of her difficulty . Mr. Stone was thinking how pretty Agnes looked as she sat looking into the fire , and wishing he did not have to take his leave so soon , and so the conversation lagged again . As the clock struck nine , Mrs. Bell bade them good night and vanished silently and tearfully to her room . A few minutes later Janette bethought her of sundry preparations which must be made for her uncle 's departure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so , saying she would see him in the morning early , and held out her hand . But he kept it in his , detaining her . " You must not run away from me so . Come sit down and talk to me for a little while . It will be a long time before we are together again . " Silently she sat down beside him . " Why have you been so quiet all the evening , Agnes ? Do you regret what you said to me ? " " No , I do not regret it ; I have only been thinking . " " Of me ? " " Yes . " " Not of that some one ' you loved years ago ? " " No , no . I never think of him now . You need not fear him as a rival , even in my thoughts . " " Some time you will tell me of him perhaps . " " Yes , if you wish to hear . " Then for a while they did not speak . He held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his lips and kissed it . " You must write me a great many letters when I am gone . I am but a poor correspondent , and you will tire of mine . " " I shall always be glad to get them , I am sure . We shall come to know each other better in that way than in any other , " she replied ; and so they talked on of their new common interest , until the fire sank low , and the last fragment fell , scattering the glowing coals upon the hearth . " I must go now . Good night , " and she held out her hands . " Good night , " as he pressed them in his . Then she bowed her head upon them , and said : " It is very pleasant to know you love me so , and I 'm sure that some time I shall love you as well . " Janette was waiting for her when she entered her room . " Oh , Aggie dear , is it my fault ? " throwing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most wretched girl in the world . " " Wretched ! I thought you would be glad . " " But you are going to marry him , and you do n't love him . " " I 'm not sure but I do love him . I am not unhappy at the prospect of marrying him , which is a pretty good test . So do n't shed any more tears over me , dear , but we 'll go to bed and I 'll tell you all our plans . "
