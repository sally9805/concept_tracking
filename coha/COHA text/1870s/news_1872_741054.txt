txt Among the candidates for the Assembly on the Democratic and Liberal ticket , is Wir. - LARD JOHNSON , of Fulton , in the County of Oswego . Mr. JOHNSON has , for many years . been a Canal Contractor , and has grown rich in his calling . He is a member of the Canal Ring  --  a thoroughly-organized body of plunderers composed of members of both political parties , and . second only to the late Tammany Ring in power . These men exert great influence through the counties lying upon the canals , and every year , through the ignorance or corruption of the Legislature , procure legislation under which large sums of money are extracted from the State Treasury . Their influence over the different canal officials is unbounded . Between this time and . the meeting of the Legislature , we propose to give some account of the methods used by these men to defraud the State and some instances of their corrupting influences upon the officials whose duty it is to protect the canal revenues . We will begin with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is connected , and we submit to the people of Oswego County whether be is a fit man so represent them in the Assembler : In September , 1869 , the State entered into a contract with CHARLES J. Di . GRAW for the building of a lock on the canal at West Troy . Some dozen proposals were made for the work , and it was awarded to DE GRAW as the lowest bidder . These canal contractors work largely through dummies. in order that their names shall be kept out of sight . DE GRAW is a townsman of JOHNSON , and is well-known as one of his dummies . JOHNSON was his surety upon the several bonds given for entering into the contract . and after the contract was made it was assigned to JOHNSON , who has done the work , and received the compensation under it . These lock contracts are made upon two sheets which are connected at the top like a sheet of lawyer 's foolscap paper . The first sheet contains the prices , and . the second sheet the signatures of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this contract was filled up by a clerk in the office of the late Division Engineer upon that part of the canals . The contract was originally filled in at the prices at which DE Glum bid . After its execution , the first sheet was cut off , and a new sheet attached , containing increased prices . This new sheet was in the handwriting of the same clerk . The prices of the principal items of the work were increased so as to increase the cost of construction of the work between four thousand and five thousand dollars . JOHNSON went on with the work , and was paid down to a date at these fraudulent prices . The substitution is not only plainly apparent on the face of the contract itself , but the original proposal or bid of DE GRAW shows that the prices at which he bid were less than those which now appear on the contract . At the prices in the altered contract . he would not have been the lowest bidder . This alteration is nothing more or less than forgery .
