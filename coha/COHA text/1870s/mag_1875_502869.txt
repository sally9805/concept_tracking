T lIE word " culture " has fallen into some discredit among us recently , perhaps because it is heard too often in the mouths of uncultured people ; it lias come to need caution in the using , if not a downright apology . This is unfortunate , for the word has a special service ; it represents a very definite thing , a thing that we shall all continue to discuss , I dare say , for some centuries yet , and to seek or to shun according to our bent ; and as we have no other way to express its idea except by paraphrases , I think we shall have to talk about " culture ' * until some one gives us a better word in its place . The discredit of the term arises in part from the antagonism which , as some of our friends will have it , exists between culture and conduct . It is an old doctrine , and in a sense a very true one , that conduct-that is to say , wise action-is more important than culture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declare that before everything else we ought to behave justly , and that any culture which makes against conduct , which does not look toward the improvement of our thoughts , and so of affairs in general , is either unimportant or hurtful . Mr. Matthew Arnold , to whom , for defending the serener interests of intelligence , we owe at least as large a debt as to any living English writer-Mr . Arnold declares expressly that " conduct is three-fourths of life ' ; and the doctrine has new significance in his hands , because he is not a professed teacher of action , but rather , as I say , treats in his writings , by preference , of the affairs of the serener intelligence . But any question between culture and the men of action is not to be settled by such broad principles as this . Nothing is more apt to mislead us than generalizing ; and if we generalize , and say that action is more im*port*nt than culture , we are taking for granted that wise action is generally possible without culture , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this error , which indeed it is one of his main objects to expose ; but it is precisely this error which ' our friends commit who decry culture and call it by grievous names . Zeal is with them the great thing ; stirring men , generous hearts , a brisk attack , say they ; let us have no more dilettanti . But suppose it should be shown that these brisk people often accomplish nothing , and sometimes worse than nothing ? When Sir James Mackintosh visited the temple of Witoba in 1808 , he saw , as he tells us " many Brahmins rushing in and out ; and one particularly struck me . . . . He ran out , chanting Ram Kristna , Kristna Ram , ' without seeming to observe or to know that there was any other person or thing in the world . " This Brahmin is a curious figure , and interesting in this connection ; here , evidently , was a man who believed in action . I make no doubt that running in and out seemed far more important to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to me a little like a good many of our stirring menlike some of the reformers , for instance , who are so positive that society is to be renewed by their activities , by organized charity , or schools , or preaching , or an improved dietary , or by some other external application . I am not of those who doubt the value of enthusiasm . Jelaleddin said , " Si- , lence is imposed on the reasoning intellect " ; but we shall never , I think , become followers of the Sufi poet ; what I wish to show is , on the contrary , that the " generous action " which is enjoined upon us is often heated action , blind action ; that it silences the reasoning intellect ; and that what we rather need , in this day and country of / // reforms , is somewhat less of heated action , somewhat more of the reasoning intellect . It seems to me that for the lack of this our reforms are for the most part inellective . They are not based on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to be either fruitful or rootfast . Look , for instance , at the popular teachers , so called  --  the Varleys , the Talmages of the time , or the " heated barbarian " whom Mr. Arnold noted for us ten years ago . I mention examples that are favorable to the advocates of action . Here are the men after their own heart , men overflowing with zeal and energy , abundant in success after their kind ; the men who are said to be doing an infinite amount of good . But is it so certain that they are doing good ? Do we observe that their followers go forth to be honester lawyers , editors , witnesses , or chaster husbands , by virtue of their following ? Or is it , on the contrary , among these people that home life becomes a scandal , and business fraud , and religion a comic en-tertainment ? People will answer these questions according to their breeding ; but I for one am not at all sure that these men of action are doing great good , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrary , that they are not doing great harm . It is quite time to challenge these people . Will they give us some proof of the good that they are said to be working ? A weak excuse is made for them , and too often repeated by intelligent persons . " Yes , *'it is said ; " no doubt these  |p3o|ple  are very ignorant and sentimental ; but we must remember that they reach a vast number of people that can not be reached in any other way . " Yes ; but how , in their phrase , do they " reach " them ? Are ignorance and sentimentality , and vulgar declamation , go6d things to " reach " anybody with ? We can hardly suppose that these apostles are sent to their audiences by divine commission ; we must think , on the contrary , that they are developed by their community . They represent certain tendencies of it which in highly cultivated communities find expression rather in comedy , or perhaps in the criminal courts , than in the church . These people represent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearers ; if they do not express their tendency , weak and feeble as it may be , toward the higher intelLigence , then for what shall we praise them ? For little enough , if we are to look at the communities in which they thrive , the qualities on which their popularity depends . As long as these teachers continue to do what they are certainly doing in our time , as long as their works and ways are the inescapable scandal of the world , intelligent people should stop talking about the good that comes of exercising their peculiar influence upon the community . The hardness of business men , the " enterprise " of publishers , the laxness of social ties , the *renality of the " religious " press-these things are not less remarked in the communities which have produced the popular teachers , so called , the stirring and significant men of our day , than in those which are marked by " effemb. nate " culture . Are there any fewer scandals , for instance , in Brooklyn city than in Cambridge , Massachusetts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ culture to task ; to demand of them the practical results which they assured us were to flow from ' their energetic doings . Do their works and ways , then , set a good example to the rest of us ? Let us press them upon this point . Is it the most cultivated people , or the least cultivated , that make in general the better neighbors and citizens , and that can be the more safely depended upon to keep their promise and their temper ? It seems to me mere weakness and concession to say of the red-faced teachers , Well , well , they are " reaching " a great many hearers who can not be " reached " otherwise ; they are doing good in their way . On the contrary , are not these people doing harm in their way ? They are calling together an idle crowd , under false pre // tences , a crowd of persons who wish before everything else to be amused , and who do not wish to be reformed ; they are skilfully flattering these people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are satisfying not their religious feelings but their love of burlesque ; they are dealing out that curious mixture of bigotry and irreverence which their people like ; they are not trying to elevate them , but to startle them . Now if it appeared that honesty , reverence , chastity were nurtured by such ministrations as these , if these flocks were eminent for intelligence and purity , we certainly should not complain of the popular teachers . But the reverse appears to be the case ; purity and intelligence are not the eminent traits of these people and their followers . No ; their efforts fail to " reach , " as they call it , the old sinners for whom we are all solicitous , and they do not merely fail in their object ; they work positive injury upon f us who do not believe in some o them ; they corrupt the mental atmosphere which all of us have to inhale . We breathe it under protest , it is true , but still we breathe it ; that is to say , we open our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the newspaper ?  --  and there are our Varley , our Sankey , our Talmage , and the rest , inescapable , perennial . From these unsavory influences there is , as I say , really no escape ; they ascend into the nostrils of the just and the unjust alike . What I complain of is the thoughtless tolerance which many of us are granting to these offenders . If our stirring friends care or know little about what reflecting persons care for , that is their misfortune , for which we will not blame them too sharply . But why need they assume the limitations of other people 's intelligences to be the same as their own ? They forget that men of culture , too , have heard of the sterner virtues , and have even gone so far as to practise them ; that in all communities they have not been the last ones to pay their debts , to keep their tempers , and to tell the truth . Men of culture take these things for granted , as I have said , as the alphabet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they do not think continual discussion of them any more necessary to their decent behavior than spelling matches to their criticism . These considerations explain , in part , the old familiar charge against educated men , that they are selfish , that they abandon the interests of progress . Their hand is not on the wheel , it is said ; they are coldly isolated ; they stay indoors when they should be turning with the turning world ; metaphors couched in more or less grievous terms are freely used in describing them ; and the vulgar mind glows with wrath at the mention of the baneful name of " culture . " Active people seem to imply , in saying these things , that the scholars might regenerate the world if they could only be persuaded to quit their books and become " workers , " and consequently that the devotees of culture are culpably if not malignantly leaving society to destruction , when they might serve if they would , if they had a little more active good will toward their fellows . While the student should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will hardly bring him out to follow the drum and banner . Students know that society is not to be benefited by heading processions , nor is original sin to be got rid of by beating a drum . They , and they only , know that if human suffering is ever to be relieved materially , it must be by more serious methods than any of those which have yet been in vogue . They see clearly that these do not constitute progress ; that they do not even tend toward progress in any desirable direction ; that they do not make men wiser , healthier , or happier than of old . What is the good of preaching to men , or even of teaching them , when you permit them to be born to poverty and disease ? It is because men of culture see , I will not say the mere fu / // tility , but the absolute injuriousness of what most of the reformers are doing , that they will not join their company ; it is not because they are selfish or indolent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far as I know them , precisely the least selfish and the least indolent of mortals . But they think it better to take their own lives in hand , to succeed in reforming themselves , than to try reforming a thousand of their neighbors , and to fall . The facts of hunger , disease , crime , ignorance , are never going to be greatly altered by the popular devices . The panaceas that various enthusiasts offer us-liberty , universal suffrage , free schools , free churches , the rights of labor , the religion of humanity-these things can not vanquish hunger and disease , nor the vice and ignorance that must always accompany them . How blankly the men of action overlook their main cause , namely , the overcrowding of almost all communities , whether densely or thinly peopled , the presence of too many mouths for the food . The pressure of population upon the means of subsistence is also its pressure upon the means of health , intelligence , and decency ; and yet the last word of most of our social reformers is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a passage much more to the purpose  --  a passage which might have given us abetter world than the present , had it held its place as Scripture : " Though they multiply , rejoice not in them ; . . . trust not them in their life , neither respect their multitude , for on&amp; that is just is better than a thousand . . . . By one that hath understanding shall the city be replenished . " It is curious to sp*culate what an effect on Christendom this passage might have produced had it been retained by the Protestant committee who made up the Old Testament canon . Is not this the key of the whole question of reform-how to improve the quality and how to limit the number of the human beings that are born into each civilized community ? But the reformers of the day give no attention to this question  --  the one radical reform ; and all their means of improvement come one generation too late . The long procession of visionaries still files past us , confident in the ratio of their ignorance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the procession . The reformers may be sincere enough , but their plans are laid in ignorant good faith , and pushed in ignorant zeal . How confident all of them are from those who think that schools and churches are going to reform society to those who think that wearing long hair or eating bran bread are the sufficient regenerators of the world I But all of them lie under one reproach , lie under the blame of ignorance ; they can not be made to see that the happiness , the virtue , the development of a nation depend upon far more serious things than sermons , or bran bread , or steam engines , or free schools . It depends primarily upon the constitution of the individual , and that depends upon his ancestors for generations past . If it be true that we are , as Mr. Fitzjames Stephen says , " a commonplace , self-satisfied , and essentially slight people , " neither education nor churches are going to remake us in a day or in a generation . The people who want reform brought about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inactivity , seem never to have heard that such a person as Malthus once lived , and that he wrote an important book about the conditions of human welfare . Coming nearer home , they are generally ignorant of the very facts with which they profess to deal . Take the case of illiteracy : how many of the " reformers " know , for instance , that of all the people in the United States who were ten years old and upward in 1870 more than one-fifth can not write , and very nearly one-fifth can neithcr read nor write ? How many know that less than half of this illiteracy is found among the colored population , and // more than half of it among the white ? and how many know that of this vast and growing illiteracy more than sixsevenths is found among native-born citizens ? These are facts of which our zealots will not take the trouble to learn ; and yet it is they who tell us that they are presently going to reform the world . But information must precede reformation ; and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based upon admiration of what they think ought to be , rather than upon what is and what might be , and the luminously unsuccessful plans of the reformers , seem futile to some who have inquired into the real causes of natural movements . The people who propose to abolish poverty , to regenerate society by dress , or by dieting , or by schools , have never taken the trouble , and have not , indeed* had the opportunity or the faculty for informing themselves upon the subjects with which they are so confident in dealing . The mania for founding " colleges* ' and " conservatories " is one of the forms of misapplied philanthropy that are now popular ; but the wisest act of Mr. James Lick 's career has doubtless been the revocation of his recent endowments . If the best and strongest of the German universities could be transplanted to our soil , they would go without students in the higher departments . Is it necessary for me to say that I would not have schools stopped , or colleges closed , or churches pulled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good , but what I say is that taken alone they are not enough ; taken alone they can never bring us to a higher civilization than what we have attained . Doubtless they keep us back from barbarism , or tend to do so ; I will not say more than this , in view of the increasing illiteracy of the country at large . The chief result of reforms and inventions thus far is to make men more numerous ; they have failed to make men either happier or better . The student of reform pcrceives this failure : is it wonderful that he should keep aloof from them and their instigators-from Messrs . Yarley and Sankey and the rest ? Pascal says that most of the evils of life arise from " man 's being unable to sit still in a room ; " and Mr. Bagehot in a late book calls it " the most melancholy of human reflections , that , on the whole , it is a question whether the benevolence of mankind does most good o&gt;r harm . " The trouble is that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose . People will not sit still and think about them ; they insist on getting up and rushing in and out , like Sir James Mackintosh 's Brahmin ; and their zeal is about equally valuable as affecting the valid improvement of society , in all times and places . Poverty is not to be relieved by systematic charity ; the physical constitution is not to be regenerated by eating vegetables , nor the political by general voting , nor the moral by sermons , nor the intellectual by founding more colleges . After so much blank failure , I do not say in working individual or temporary benefits , but in bringing about the large and permanent benefits of communities , it is time , I think , to demand some results of these people who are constantly running in and out and decrying culture ; it is time to ask them what they have done , and what they are going to do , and what they can show , meanwhile , that is better than culture . It seems to same of us that their sonorous formulin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemy , and putting off the day of practicable reforms , which are finally to come through the thoughts and the works of students , as the great inventions of the age have been given us by " quiet people who sat still and studied . " Is it for grieving sentimentalists to meddle with such serious things as the forces of modern life ? Their schemes are the toys of children who have yet to go to school ; who have to find out what the real world is , I // with its grave interests , its stern laws , the evolution of its long cycles . It is not surprising that the student , who sees more clearly than any other the magnitude and the seriousness of the changes that are proposed , should decline utterly to join hands with the reformer , to dance around his crackling bonfire . The very seriousness of his philanthropy will prevent his doing anything so futile and obstructive . When he is reproached with inefficiency , with selfishness , with coldness to the interests of progress , his answer is simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps the means through which some good is effected but when you follow your own devices you do evil , you put back the reform for which you work ; when you follow the thoughts of educated men , your natural leaders , your blind energies may be enlightened , you may do your share of good . Your ancestors were the persecutors of scholars . It is high time for scholars to apply to bigots the torture of the syllogism . Culture has to meet another old charge-that of effeminacy ; and this is sometimes a true charge , while that of indifference , as I have tried to show , is seldom true . Is not this because there is now a greater demand than ever for men of affairs , and that in consequence the able men who , living before the age of steam , would have engaged in art and study , are now engaged in business ? The arts , too , have become democratized , and must appeal to the average taste rather than to the higher ; and consequently it is not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offence to the many excellent artists among us who form the exceptions t * the rule - it is not generally the higher intellect that is attracted , for instance , to the practice of painting . It may be better on the whole that everybody should have a voice in matters of taste , whether he has taste or not : what I say is that the old artists had at least the support of a picked body in criticism , of men like Lorenzo , Poliziano , Federigo of Urbino , Leo X. But the artist to-day has to please the ignorant ; and the critics who press forward now to instruct us , to guide the public taste , and who do actually guide the public taste to a considerable degree , are men from whom in those earlier times we should not have heard . Not that we have no good critics ; we have such , and perhaps too many of them for the good of art . But we have also too many critics without knowledge or qualification for criticism . Ignorant people concern themselves with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who order a library by shelves full of assorted bindings . Th6ophile Gautier says , rather bitterly , of the daily critics : " Their constant bayings silence the imaginations of men , filling their minds and hearts with such distrust that no one dares to put faith in either a poet or a sovereign . Hence it happens that poetry and royalty , the two greatest things in the world , have become impossible , to the profound misfortune of nations . We sa6rifice our welfare to the poor pleasure of reading , every morning , certain leaves of poor paper , blotted with bad ink in a worse style . Under Julius II . art criticism did not exist ; I am acquainted with nofeuilleton about Daniel of Volterra , Sebastian dcl Piombo , Michelangelo , Raffaelle , Ghiberti , or Benvenuto Cellini . And yet I think they did pretty well for people who had no journals . - . . Reading the papers prevents us from having real scholars and artists . " I will not go as far as this ; yet , as I tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have to make some important deductions in casting up the account of the services of criticism . Among them , as it seems to me , is this diversion of superior men from the finer to the coarser arts ; a necessity certainly , a good thing if you please , but surely an injury , though I hope a temporary one , to the interests of the higher intelligence . Our foremost minds are not now , as they were in the best time , for instance , of Louis XIY. , // employed in the arts ; they are now employed in business enterprises . Business activity , growing from the opportunity which the great inventions have given us , is the destiny of the more energetic natures of the day . The sculptors that we should have had are predestined railroad men or western pioneers ; our poets have been diverted to the stock exchange ; our missing painters are manufacturing instead of laying colors . We have , as I have said , many good artists ; and yet it must be said again that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our culture ; and that law is , that men of the first abilities do not now give themselves , so frequently as formerly , to the practice of the arts ; they give themselves to politics , to business , to the professions . Not only are they discouraged by the lowered standard in the arts , but they are more impressed than the earlier men were by the accumulation of art products in the world . Riches , offices , position , pass away with the holder , and leave an equal field for each new generation ; the immortal thing is art , and what is once well done fills a permanent place , cldsing that particular line of achievement , and deterring the timid artist from attempting a similar line . While this great bequest of art-products is thus a check to modern creation , it does not prevent also , on the contrary , a stimulus , and each age from creating the pictures , poems , buildings , music that it wishes . Yet it may well happen that modest aspirants should be awed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those of art . And the consequence will not be denied me , I think , even by artists themselves : that there is an averaging , a feminizing of the character of the artist ; that fewer men of the first natural ability choose the profession of artist in these days than formerly ; and if the arts are served by an increasing proportion of weaklings , we can readily understand why culture should come to be charged with effeminacy . We do not find that the old artists and scholars were blamed for this ; and indeed , they were men of action above many others . Michelangelo fortified Florence , and Benvenuto Cellini , in one of the most interesting chapters of autobiography , tells how cleverly he handled a battery of artillery at Rome . Henri Regnault , indeed , and Courbet , are fresh instances of artist soldiers ; but if there were no other reason , the principle of the division of labor , or rather , let us say , the differentiation of modern activities , will show that we can not look for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as formerly . I have touched upon a point that deserves a fuller treatment but which I can only outline here  --  the checks which modern inventions are putting upon the higher intelligence . Not upon scientific research , which was never so active as now ; not , indeed , upon very many of the things of the mind , but upon the wider and higher interests which appeal to all cultivated people , the finer traits of character , life , and beauty , which are the field of the fine arts . For we have lately released from the ground certain gigantic forces which are in a certain sense overpowering the intelligence of his century . We can not study them too carefully , we can not praise too highly the efficiency with which steam and electricity serve us ; but after all our praises of their use , it remains none the less true thatthey have a counter tendency to evil ; they are producing certain depressing results upon us which I have not seen clearly pointed out , though some of our most effective writers feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like Carlyle and Ruskin , against what they see and feel rather than what they understand . Of course I do not claim to analyze these evils ; it will be enough Lo point out what seems to me their chief cause , in closing . Steam and electricity , then , are the tools by which the people of our century have commenced the second subju // gation of the world . The splendor of the results already reached has overpowered our imaginations ; we can not reason coolly about what we are doing . The railways , steamboats , telegraph lines , and submarine cables of our time are achievements that , measured by the mere amount of mechanical force employed in building them , surpass any previous achievement of man ; and the force which they disengage and employ surpasses the whole previous working power of the world . We of the nineteenth century are busy with a very definite task , one which is like that of the first movement toward civilization ; namely , the subduing of nature , the adapting of our lives to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loose such an astonishing tempest of force for the doing of it that we are confused and awed by the results , and can not see them in their relation to other interests , which one day we shall begin to think about again . It is not surprising that we are blinded by what we have brought about . Men that are not yet old had in their youth no better means of locomotion than Jehu the son of Nimshi employed , or the first contriver of wheeled carriages , and hardly any speedier way of sending a message than Adam had ; and now there is little object in going further than we have gone in the matter of quick communications . These surprising applications of steam and electricity , antiquating our old familiar relations with the material worid , and imposing new tasks and new standards upon us , new conditions to be realized , have in a very real sense made us pioneers again , and imposed upon us the limitations of pioneering . Steam and electricity have put our civilization before us a second time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are colonists who have nature before us to conquer again , a. vastly greater task if a briefer one than the first ; it is no longer a mere question of tilling the forests and cultivating a virgin 12 soil , as with the earlier colonizers ; it is a question of applying unheard-of forces upon a scale that C*nsar or Napoleon hardly dreamed of , and for results that make their way of life seem primitive . Steam and the telegraph have given us back the old world made new again in our hands ; and they require us to adapt it a second time to our uses , to carve and channel it with deeper traces than the globe has seen , furrows to which all the vestiges of the earlier civilization seem but as the light markings of a needle . It is a significant thing that we already speak of a country town that chances to lie a few miles from the railway , even though it be in the heart of New England or of Europe , as " out of the world . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much cut off from civilization as our fathers considered the centre of Australasia to be , or the remotest hamlets in the empire of Odoacer . All this has been changed within a few years : the dreams of our grandfathers were turned into realities in the day of our fathers , and generally became their necessities of life . The business of our century , in a word , is to reinstitute the material life of civilized peoples : is it strange that there should be , meanwhile , a tendency to check the finer activities ? We are repeating the primitive activities upon a larger , a more engrossing scale ; we are again doing rough work for the benefit of the future ; and all this remaking , splendid and necessary as its phenomena are , is none the less injurious in certain respects to us who are engaged in it . We are brushing up the planet for the benefit of our descendants ; but meanwhile we are . suffering ourselves , and in a way from which we may at least partly protect ourselves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to suspect the Pharisee ; , but it is not enough on its guard as yet against the newer danger of modern inventions , and the zealots of the steam engine . // We have been , indeed , too much occupied with their good to be on the guard against their evil . Friend and enemy in one , the modern demon of power has enchanted us by his doings ; the people of this century have been unable to conceive the role of their great inventions . The vast efficiency of steam and electricity has misled our judgments , has blinded our sense of just proportion among the forces which make up our lives . Adorctmus quen* crectmw9 , say the cardinals when they choose a pope ; and we too adore the powers that we have instituted , and with more than religious superstition . It is a new form of the old embarrassment with the genii that will not down at one 's bidding ; we are as much in awe of the mechanical spirits that we have raised as Benvenuto Ccllini was after performing his incantations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devils " capering around the walls of the Coliseum in answer to them . Steam is properly our slave ; let us keep him strictly to his servitude . When our mechanical era shall have done its task , when all the railroads shall be builded and all the prairies settled , then it is conceivable that people will adore steam no longer ; that , as men did better things before steam power was set to work , so they will again do better things after that work is done . Tool or weapon , these are all that steam and the telegraph should be ; and when our hundred years of adoration are finished , it is possible that the world will come to think so , and regard them and their achievements as of less real dignity than what they now contemn as culture . But now we adore our slave be cause he is so mighty ; we forget that he is properly no more than a slave ; and the sooner we make up our minds that he shall not be the master of our minds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence of modern inventions . Steam does not produce happiness ; it would be truer to say that it produces misery . The multiplication of the poor goes on actually by steam power , for steam power gives them their pittance of work and bread , and so makes their multiplication possible . As long as there is any room for moro population , emigrants and laborers will be produced to order . Steam picks them up from the clod and sets them down upon the remotest prairies of America , Australia , and Asia , and bids them increase after their kind at will . Steam creates millions of Irishmen every year ; it is the real parent of countless people who would never have had being without its permission . A projector shall mark out a town upon the map of his prairie , and in a few years he will people it by means of a little capital and the railroads . One would say that such a community was begotten of steam , the chief generative force of all civilization ; it can not be long before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with its children . All this is inevitable ; but does it make the glory of our age ? I suppose that if we could get at the full record of the Assyrian consciousness in the times of the greatest material splendor of the nation , we should find that they were quite confident that they were the greatest people in the world by virtue of their riches , their luxury , their numbers ; yet how easily were they destroyed by a people of higher intelligence Now when it is held that railroads , telegraphs , and weather reports constitute a beatific state , it seems to me that we are quite as much mistaken as the Assyrians were . What connection exists between railways and good conduct ? or between telegraphs and national probity ? I hope I do not seem to undervalue great inventions ; but I would suggest that honesty is in no sense superseded by inventions , nor intelligence by the weather reports . The inventors have not shown us yet how to elevate character by means of a steam lift ; nor are any of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telegraph . Yet people rely upon these I I // qwq
