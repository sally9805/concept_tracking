ARTICLE VIII . - SOME SUGGESTIONS ON POINTS OF CONTACT BETWEEN SCIENCE AND ART . A FEW years ago Cardinal Wiseman delivered an address at the Royal Institution , London , on " Points of Contact between Science and Art , " and in the course of his remarks furnished a number of illustrations which very definitely set forth the relations between Science and the Fine Arts . It has occurred to us , however , on again reading over the address , that thc Cardinal did not seem to appreciate the fact that the methods of investigation pursued in art are almost identical with those of science . The main distinction lies in their aim ; the one inquires for the sake of knowledge ; the other , for the sake of production . Not only does art perpetually avail itself of the results of science , but it frequently anticipates science . Not only does it employ science in its methods and forms , but its aim and expression are often involved in considerations which demand the highest exercise of precise knowledge respecting both the sciences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfects genius , ' said IDryden , and no doubt he himself knew how much of that which is termed genius , on closer inspection turns out to be precise knowledge , knowingly applied . The subject , however , which engaged the Cardinal 's attention , seems to be much more fruitful of suggestion and illustration to-day , though but a single decade has passed since the address was delivered . Science has made great advances , and many of her results have found application in connection with art . The principles of art are , perhaps , being more definitely formulated , and the tendency of criticism is to show the scientific character of its products in relation to history , literature , and philosophy . Contact alone with works of art , without any acquaintance with the life and character of their authors , the methods of study they pursued , their indefatigable research in preparation , the difficulties encountered and overcome , not only with respect to methods of art , but concerning that of which art is merely an expression-we repeat , through mere contact with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art is indeed nothing more nor less than " an inspiration for the gratification of a divine instinct . " But following the artist closely in his methods nd manipulations ; his choice of subject with respect to the capacities of art for its proper expression ; the selection and arrangement of material contributing to this ; we find him involved in considerations thoroughly scientific in all respects save as to their special aim and bearing . rri*e Cardinal , in his address , cited Leonardo da Vinci as " the representative man to illustrate this contact of science with art ; and there could be no better selection Leonardo , in his investigations and discoveries , both in pure and applied science , is ranked high , and " has his place in the history and in the philosophy of the inductive sciences . " Whewell ranks him among " the practical reformers of science . " He left " thirteen volumes of scientific sketches , of diagrams and mechanism , chiefly connected with hydraulics . " But this fact in itself serves as no illustration of the contact of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purely in the interest of science . The points of real contact-if we can so term them-are where science prepares the ground for the action of art , and in connection with its objects . But a slight analysis of any work of art will exhibit these points of contact very definitely . Consider , for instance , what rcqnisites were in demand for the production of llaphael 's " School of Athens . " Au analysis of this work naturally divides under two heads  --  the philosophy of ideas connected with the subject , and the science of their embodiment by means of art . The former involves a relative estimate of the philosophies and the sciences illustrated by their most prominent teachers . A central interest is accorded Plato and Aristotle , the one pointing to the heavens , the other , with outstretched palm spread toward the earth ; each regards the other with an expression of intense conviction , while their arguments , together with their philosophies , are summed up in this significant and concentrated action . Nothing can exceed the accuracy of artistic statement in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their respective disciples , who , with no less significance , exhibit like distinctions in their sympathies of thought . Below // this central group the subordinate sciences find illustration , and with no less intellectual appreciation of their character and aim . The group which surrounds Archimides , who constructs a geometrical figure upon a tablet lying on the ground , evinces the nicest distinctions with respect to the opening of the minds of the spectators to the reception of the thought . On the steps , apart from all , reclines Diogenes the Cynic , atteutively scanning a tablet ; a youth , directed by an old man , turns from him to the teachers of a higher philosophy . Above , among others , we ohserve Socrates , addressing a group of listeners who have collected about him , to whom he explains in order ( counting on his fingers ) his principles and their conclusions . This is but a glance , sufficient , however , to show the nature of the thought pervading this work . Each individual thinking head in this remarkable picture has characteristic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result of scwntfc insight , which alone enables the artist to use the human form to give accurate expression to ideas or emotions : to determine among the many muscular movements of the features the exact anatomical play that suits the character of thought moving in the mind . Here is a science of the fitness of the means to the end which admits of no deviation . Right expression depends strictly upon the accuracy of the artist 's knowledge . Leonardo , having in mind his conception of the Christ for his picture of The Last Supper , searched for months to find a type that would give him a proper basis upon which to realize this idea in sensible form . In these higher walks of art the judgment is involved with questions quite distinct from the more marked effect passion produces upon the human countenance . A close sympathy with those placid , yet profounder movements of the mind , is in demand , and a knowledge of their corresponding physical expressions . This finds noble illustration in the repose of antique statuary . Thus anatomical science must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expression to actions wholly imaginary , and for which it would be impossible to find a living model capable of a*surning the exact situation , morally or physically ; the Laocodn is a remarkable instance of this . As we descend in our dissection of this picture , numerous // 176 Points of Contact between Science and Art . points present themselves as having this connection with science ; but , fearing to be too tedious , we will merely make reference to the architectural accessories which involve an elaborate perspective , a strictly mathematical science . Indeed , when the Cardinal cited his few points of contact between science and art . a closer inspection might perhaps have revealed the fact that there could be no art save as a superstructure based upon science- The arts have notoriously flourished best when science was making most rapid advances and achieving her highest triumphs . If the subject selected for illustration be taken from ancient history , ethrtolog*cai as well as archa3ological points arise which require accurate knowledge on the part of the artist . The character , manners , customs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit of the epoch , gathered from literary and other sources- No art , of any time or people , can be properly interpreted but in connection with its literature . The Cardinal quoted Ruskin 's observation , that " a painter should be a man of universal learning . " This is what Cicero has said of the finished orator ; and the most distinguished masters in art have , to some extent , evinced this breadth of cultivation . The higher and more varied the education the artist receives , the more extensive the learning which he acquires , the more it will assist him in his artistic pursuits . " I see not what , without true genius , study , Nor genius without study , can effect ; Each needs each ; both , when hand in hand , will thrive . " - Horace . Holman Hunt passed several years in the Holy Land searching out those hereditary types by means of which he realized that remarkable embodiment of his subject , " Christ in the Temple " - one of the most remarkable works of modem art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , comparing these , was gradually enabled to determine the peculiarity of feature common to the old race of Jews which dwelt at Jerusalem . In respect to the habits , dress , ceremonies , and symbols of the synagogue worship , he applied himself no less diligently . But a slight acquaintance with the requisite preparation such works demand will enable us to estimate the requirements of art , and // reveal those points of contact wherein the studies of the artist meet with those of the historian , the arch*eologist , the scientist , and the philosopher . We find Leonardo and Michael Angelo on the one side expressing their most subjective thought in the sonnet or in the picture , and on the other devising and executing stupendous works of architecture and mechanical engineering . The methods of study pursued in art are eminently fitted for a union of the theoretical with the practical , for while they are directed to the object , they aim to draw from it that which renders it subservient to artistic expression . Thus the object is studied not forits own sake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas , sentiments , and the like . Art is no less practical than it is fanciful . The very essence of art is rnvention . The lists of inventors contain many names that have been associated with the fine arts . In this country , Morse and Fulton are noted examples . Albert Diirer was a skilled mathematician and the inventor of several mathematical instruments and machines . Camerarius assures us that he wrote no less than one hundred and fifty hooks and pamphlets ( probably an exaggerated statement ) ; among which were treatises on civil Architectare , on Fortifications , on the Anatomy a*td Proporlions of the Horse , and on the A rt of Fencing . Pirkheirner also informs us that he wrote several works on Painting . In 1525 he brought out his " Instruction in the Art of Mensuration , " consisting of four books treating of the " Construction and divisions of lines , of the measurements of plane surfaces and solid bodies , with practical hints in Optics and Perspective , " based chiefly on Euclid . lie also published a treatise on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scientific works of Leonardo da Vinci . There are now in Paris twelve large volumes of his essays in Science ; the balance of his works are in the Ambrosian Library at Milan . They consist of treatises on Mathematics , Ghernistry , flydraulics , and Anatomy . Gustave Uzielli claims for Leonardo " the credit of having first laid down the fundamental laws regulating the distribution of the leaves of plants , " thus forestalling the English botanist Brown by more than two centuries . Leonardo also informs us at this early date " that the circles of wood in the section of a branch de vor1. xxxni. 12 // note the age of the limb , . . . their density depends on the dryness of their natal seasons : " also " the heart of a tree will be found nearer to its southern bark than to its northern . " Fossil shells and fish likewise engaged his attention , and indeed , so numerous were his studies in Natural *Science , that it would be tedious to make mention of them further than as an illustration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Planisphere is also claimed for him , drawings of which are among his MSS. at Windsor . That Leonardo anticipated Cordan in believing that the phenomena of the camera tended to explain the laws of vision , is obvious from his own words- " This spiradc made in a window . . . conveys within all similitudes of the bodies opposed to it . Thus may we see that the eye likewise acts . " His remarks on Optics are full of suggestive insight , coupled with skillful investigations . He constructed an eye of glass by which to illustrate his conclusions ; and then gave himself up to considerations and inventions " concerning the means for making the moon appear larger by the use of lenses . " * He also wrote a treatise on " Force as a cause of Fire . " We may gather from these suggestive items some idea of the character of his studies , carried on in the intervals of his artistic pursuits . In being brought face to face with nature and with science in those methods of study which form the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind should not feel some stimulus towards strictly scientific investigation . It must be a dull mind which excludes inquiry into subjects bordering upon its special pursuits ; experience teaches that these very pursuits are the better mastered through this breadth of cultivation which we find illustrated in the best masters in science or art . But to continue our subject . it was not until long after Perspective had been discovered and applied in art , by Paolo Uccello , and the brothers Van Eyck , that science formulated it . Science was forestalled by art in two distant countries at the * It must be remembered that this anticipates Galileo by nearly a century . Vasari records of Leonardo that in his youth he first suggested the formation of a canal from Pisa to Florence , by means of certain changes to be effected in the river Arno . Bottari says in a note : " This magnificent work was executed about 200 years after , by Vincenzio Viviani , a disciple of Galileo. " // 179 same time , in Italy and in Belgium . Before the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it had remained unknown . But in Giotto and his followers we find evidence that not mere " personal observation and artistic cleverness enable them to seize this necessary ingredient of pictorial art , " but that it was reduced to principles , formed into precepts , and taught to scholars . Pietro della Francesca deserves especial notice in this connection ; he died in 1482 . There is evidence in his works that he not only understood and practiced Perspective with great accuracy , as Vasari records of him , but he reduced its principles to writing in three books , which are still in existence . Before the literature of perspective commences , Raphael , in his " School of Athens , " and Michael Angelo , in the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel , had shown themselves consummate in the application of Perspective to art . Then " the anticipations of art were verified by science and reduced to unvarying rule . " It was not till 1608 that the first satisfactory treatise on this subject was published by Guido Ubaldo . In 1642 the Prospectiva Practica @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generally in use among artists until quite recently . Finally the correct mathematical theory of perspective was propounded by Brook Taylor in 1731 . Copies of these works are before us . A mathematical basis , consisting of proportion , relation , and quantity , underlies all art , in line , color , form , and pictorial composition , no less than in musical harmonies . Michael Angelo claimed that the human figure is perfect in its proportions and these proportions have a definite law . The thought was not original with him , but was derived from the ancients . " The human form is bounded by lines , the angles of which are all harmonic , and the curves which circumscribe the subdivis - ions possess this quality in no less degree . " Before considering Architecture in relation to points of con* tact between science and art , a meiie glance at the Sculptor 's work will show us the scientific requirements of his art . The character and function of every muscle of the human form is to be mastered ; of every bone which affects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is to possess accurate knowledge of every action of which this form is capa // ble , of the scope and function of every bone and muscle , and under all imaginable action , such as can not be studied from the living subject ; iflstance of which we have cited in the Laoco*in . But all this , in the most accurate form of scie*itific knowledge , will not effect for art those still higher requirements which are as yet beyond the reach of science , and in respect of which knowledge is extremely limited . The gulf between the genius of our being and what we know of its nature and scope is still vast and unfathomed by science . In respect to these " points of contact , " Architecture presents numerous illustrations ; for Architecture naturally divides into two branches  --  the artistic and the constructive , or scientific . " On the one side it seems to descend toward the class of mechanical pursuits ; on the other , it has in the past laid contribution on its two sister arts , and commanded their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is subservient to the expression of certain effects , line , form , space , and color are the elements with which these effects in Architecture are produced . It is perfectly tonic , in respect to its lines , angles , and curves . The Parthenon has been reduced to a strict mathematical proportion in its construction , and the harmony of the parts have been found to fulfill a certain mathematical ratio . Said Penrose , " Its calculated and measured dimensions do not vary , even within the fraction of an inch . " The same treatment has been applied to Lincoln , and later to Salisbury Cathedral , and it has been ascertained that their proportions have this same character and are reducible to similar principles . Though the men who built those great edifices " may have had no idea of the science which they obeyed , they had it in the education of their feeling and judgment ; when science came in and tested their work she merely verified and found it strictly according to its rules . " But in its constructive branch , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature and selection of materials ; in all its constructive forms in carrying out the conception or design . " The early builders could not calculate the proportion requisite between superincumbent weight and its just support ; and they erred on the right side , by providing superabundant strength to carry their intended burden . " We // observe how , " by degrees , every architecture becomes slimmer and lighter , as experience has brought these proportions to test ; " hence , after the iDoric comes the Ionic , then we get the Corinthian , and at last the Composite . In like manner we pass from the Norman , through intermediate stages of pointed architecture , to the Flamboyant or Decorated . Remarkable evidence remains , that the heavier construction of remoter periods " was not based upon any accurate calculation of ratio between support and weight . " The first went beyond the demands of the second . We find the architects of the sixteenth century , " fearlessly altering the old Norman arches into the pointed , and round massive piers into slender clustered columns ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insecurity . " As in the departments of science there are multiplied subdivisions , and human labor in these fields is now directed into specialities , so are like subdivisions the characteristic of modern art , which is divided and subdivided , the artist applying himself exclusively to some one art , and again to some one branch of this , to portraiture , to landscape , to history , to genre . Architecture is subdivided into church architecture , public buildings , domestic architecture , exclusively of shops and dwellings . Bridge-building has been wholly turned over to the engineers . The architect , so-called , does little more now than get out the plans and elevations . But it is characteristic of a thorough mastery of any art not to submit to this narrowing specialism , not to neglect the science for the superficial attractions , but to treat the whole with that sympathy and thoughtful insight which a knowledge of the structure and functions of the human form demands , from the most evanescent expression that lingers upon the features , down to the very bones of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let us glance at a few of the later results of applied science mechanically contributing to the interests of art . Stone columns , once laboriously shaped and polished by hand , are now turned and glossed by machinery , at much less cost . Stone is dressed by the same means . Stone itself is manufactured and molded into various forms and ornaments . The tendency of this is un // artistic in its eff'ect , because what is done by machinery lacks that expression which manual labor , directed by individual mind and feeling , gives to the material it shapes . This could be remedied ig after the forms were shaped by mechanical means , the final execution were reserved for direct human contact , giving character and expression to the forms ; very slight superficial labor would serve to give this final finish . The sculptor gives his clay model to his workman , who delivers to him the marble reproduction drawn from the block by pointing measurements ; but the sculptor goes over it with the instinct associated with its earliest conception , giving the subtleties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ execution which , with very little additional labor , gives value and interest to the work . Why could not we , in the place of insipid , machine-made columns and ornaments now generally in use , have exact repetitions of such charming examples as may be found abroad in old buildings , churches , cloisters , etc. , copied mechanically by means of plaster cast taken from the originals , and finished by hand , making the laborer 's work more free , thoughtful , and stimulating to his own fancy . Iron , in the uses to which it is applied in the architecture of the day , is altogether a recent result of applied science , but as now used it is an abomination so far as artistic expression is concerned . Plaster casts taken from Gothic or IRennaissance ornament might be sent to the foundries to be used as patterns . Much wood-carving is now done by machinery . We have seen the head of a dog carved in wood by this means , which had the character of band-work . Such carving as may be found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ad infinitum . Science , in its applications , has brought that chief of musical instruments , the Piano , within the reach of every household . Every separate feature of its construction , from its general form to the material which enters into the manufacture of its finest wires , has been subjected to scientific tests and investigations . The interpretation of the masters of musical composition may now be heard on the extreme borders of civilization in the log-cabin as well as in the households of the wealthy . But Musical-boxes , such as are now imported from Switzerland , have // reached that perfection which may fairly claim for them the merit of affording pleasure even to the critical . Through Chromo-lithography , effort was made to reproduce and multiply the works of the painter . Though it certainly has never reached any very refined expression , it has undoubtedly contributed somewhat in the interest of art , and met a want which eventually comes to be regarded as the steppingstone to something better . The principles of photo sculpture have , as we have seen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various methods and forms which have sprung from it , will assuredly , if it has not already , effect a revolution in certain ideas pertaining to art . Cardinal Wiseman , in opening his remarks , made use of these words : A am venturing to address , on the subject of science , an assembly of men whose reputation for its advancement , or for its cultivation , may be said to pervade the whole civilized world . And I have had the hardihood to announce that I would speak upon art , in the presence of those who , if their fame has not extended so far-because their works are not so portable or communicable as books ,  --  stand at the very summit of this most honorable profession ; ** and , speaking of the old masters , at the close of his remarks he said , " Nor are we ever likely to see their marvelous and multiplied works within the easy access of the people . " Ten years later we find a French Jew traveling from city to city , throughout the length and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the old masters , termed " Autotypes . " Thousands of these autotypes find their way into public institutions and private families , familiarizing us with the most famous works of the great masters of art . In like manner the " Heliotype " reproduces for us those etchings and engravings which have become so very costly and precious on account of their great scarcity . The works of the sculptor likewise , with the precious fruits of antiquity , are now , by means of photography , brought within the reach of every one . In all respects save color , we find the artist 's productions multiplying and spreading , almost to the extent of the author 's thought , through printing . Who can foretell the effort this is likely to produce upon generations to come , when art , through // such channels , seeks the audience , or rather the eye of the world , without waitin* for the world to come to it . In a very subordinate field , that of caricature , we have seen what an effective engine of reform , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thomas Nast have proved . It was their wide-spread reproduction through the medium of a circulation that averaged , weekly , above one hundred and fifty thousand , which gave to them the character of a language , coarse and crude indeed , but which all who run might read . In closing our remarks , an extract from a letter addressed by Col. Gray to the Committee of Architects who had in charge the Houses of Parliment , may not be out of place . He says , * " It is constantly to be regretted , that much of the good attending many of the institutions founded for the advancement of science and art is lost by their isolation and want of connection with each other . " This is but too true , and the remedy seems likely to be applied through those tendencies which are now directed towards the establishment of these schools in connection with the universities . By this means enlarged and comprehensive facilities are afforded the student of any branch of science or of art , and by the close proximity of institutions having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must follow which may be considered mutually beneficial . Literature can no longer afford to exclude those arts , the relations of which are so closely interwoven with her own ; the aim and character of which , if not strictly identical , certainly assist in affording us a better acquaintance with her own classic forms and spirit . It is a matter of some surprise that the arts have been so much neglected iu this connection , when photography and the plaster cast have long furnished a cheap form of illustration .
