Miller , Joaquin , 1837-1913 : CALIFORNIAN . from Songs of the Sierras ( 1871 ) Poem section Glintings of day in the darkness , Flashings of flint and of steel , Blended in gossamer texture The ideal and the real , Limn 'd like the phantom-ship shadow , Crowding up under the keel . I. I stand beside the mobile sea ; And sails are spread , and sails are furl 'd From farthest corners of the world , And fold like white wings wearily . Steamships go up , and some go down In haste , like traders in a town , And seem to see and beckon all . Afar at sea some white shapes flee , With arms stretch 'd like a ghost 's to me , And cloud-like sails far blown and curl 'd , Then glide down to the under-world . As if blown bare in winter blasts Of leaf and limb , tall naked masts Are rising from the restless sea , So still and desolate and tall , I seem to see them gleam and shine With clinging drops of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , Thin sea-blue wings wheel everywhere , And white wings whistle through the air : I hear a thousand sea-gulls call . Behold the ocean on the beach Kneel lowly down as if in prayer . I hear a moan as of despair , While far at sea do toss and reach Some things so like white pleading hands . The ocean 's thin and hoary hair Is trail 'd along the silver 'd sands , At every sigh and sounding moan . ' T is not a place of mirthfulness , But meditation deep , and prayer , And kneelings on the salted sod , Where man must own his littleness And know the mightiness of God . The very birds shriek in distress And sound the ocean 's monotone . Dared I but say a prophecy , As sang the holy men of old , Of rock-built cities yet to be Along these shining shores of gold , Crowding athirst into the sea , What wondrous marvels might be told ! Enough , to know that empire here Shall burn her loftiest , brightest star ; Here art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realm of old ; Here learn 'd and famous from afar , To pay their noble court , shall come , And shall not seek or see in vain , But look on all with wonder dumb . Afar the bright Sierras lie A swaying line of snowy white , A fringe of heaven hung in sight Against the blue base of the sky . I look along each gaping gorge , I hear a thousand sounding strokes Like giants rending giant oaks , Or brawny vulcan at his forge ; I see pick-axes flash and shine And great wheels whirling in a mine . Here winds a thick and yellow thread , A moss 'd and silver stream instead ; And trout that leap 'd its rippled tide Have turn 'd upon their sides and died . Lo ! when the last pick in the mine Is rusting red with idlenesss , And rot yon cabins in the mould , And wheels no more croak in distress , And tall pines reassert command , Sweet bards along this sunset shore Their mellow melodies will pour ; Will charm as charmers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Will sound unto the vaulted skies The valor of these men of old  --  The mighty men of ' Forty-nine ; Will sweetly sing and proudly say , Long , long agone there was a day When there were giants in the land . II . Curambo ! what a cloud of dust Comes dashing down like driven gust ! And who rides rushing on the sight Adown yon rocky long defile , Swift as an eagle in his flight , Fierce as a winter 's storm at night Blown from the bleak Sierra 's height , Careering down some yawning gorge ? His face is flush 'd , his eye is wild , And ' neath his courser 's sounding feet ( A glance could barely be more fleet ) The rocks are flashing like a forge . Such reckless rider !  --  I do ween No mortal man his like has seen . And yet , but for his long serape All flowing loose , and black as crape , And long silk locks of blackest hair All streaming wildly in the breeze , You might believe him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With friend or senorita rare , He rides so grandly at his ease . But now he grasps a tighter rein , A red rein wrought in golden chain , And in his tapidaros stands , Half turns and shakes two bloody hands , And shouts defiance at his foe ; Now lifts his broad hat from his brow As if to challenge fate , and now His hand drops to his saddle-bow And clutches something gleaming there As if to something more than dare , While halts the foe that follow 'd fast As rushing wave or raving blast , More sudden-swift than though were prest All bridle-bands at one behest . The stray winds lift the raven curls , Soft as a fair Castilian girl 's , And press a brow so full and high Its every feature does belie The thought he is compell 'd to fly ; A brow as open as the sky On which you gaze and gaze again As on a picture you have seen And often sought to see in vain , That seems to hold a tale of woe Or wonder , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as with a knife , With many a dubious deed in life ; A brow of blended pride and pain , And yearnings for what should have been . He grasps his gilded gory rein , And wheeling like a hurricane , Defying wood , or stone , or flood , Is dashing down the gorge again . Oh never yet has prouder steed Borne master nobler in his need ! There is a glory in his eye That seems to dare and to defy Pursuit , or time , or space , or race . His body is the type of speed , While from his nostril to his heel Are muscles as if made of steel . He is not black , nor gray , nor white , But ' neath that broad serape of night And locks of darkness streaming o'er , His sleek sides seem a fiery red  --  They may be red with gushing gore . What crimes have made that red hand red ? What wrongs have written that young face With lines of thought so out of place ? Where flies he ? And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race ? What glitters in his heavy belt , And from his furr 'd catenas gleam ? What on his bosom that doth seem A diamond bright or dagger 's hilt ? The iron hoofs that still resound Like thunder from the yielding ground Alone reply ; and now the plain , Quick as you breathe and gaze again , Is won , and all pursuit is vain . III . I stand upon a stony rim , Stone-paved and pattern 'd as a street ; A rock-lipp 'd canon plunging south , As if it were earth 's open 'd mouth , Yawns deep and darkling at my feet ; So deep , so distant , and so dim Its waters wind , a yellow thread , And call so faintly and so far , I turn aside my swooning head . I feel a fierce impulse to leap Adown the beetling precipice , Like some lone , lost , uncertain star ; To plunge into a place unknown , And win a world all , all my own ; Or if I might not meet that bliss , At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A gleaming star Shines back as from some mossy well Reflected from blue fields afar . Brown hawks are wheeling here and there , And up and down the broken wall Cling clumps of dark green chaparral , While from the rent rocks , gray and bare , Blue junipers hang in the air . Here , cedars sweep the stream , and here , Among the boulders moss 'd and brown That time and storms have toppled down From towers undefiled by man , Low cabins nestle as in fear , And look no taller than a span . From low and shapeless chimneys rise Some tall straight columns of blue smoke , And weld them to the bluer skies ; While sounding down the sombre gorge I hear the steady pick-axe stroke , As if upon a flashing forge . Another scene , another sound !  --  Sharp shots are fretting through the air , Red knives are flashing everywhere , And here and there the yellow flood Is purpled with warm smoking blood . The brown hawk swoops low to the ground , And nimble chip-monks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That lordly feet shall press no more . The flume lies warping in the sun , The pan sits empty by the door , The pick-axe on its bed-rock floor Lies rusting in the silent mine . There comes no single sound nor sign Of life , beside yon monks in brown That dart their dim shapes up and down The rocks that swelter in the sun ; But dashing round yon rocky spur Where scarce a hawk would dare to whirr , Fly horsemen reckless in their flight . One wears a flowing black capote , While down the cape doth flow and float Long locks of hair as dark as night , And hands are red that erst were white . All up and down the land to-day Black desolation and despair It seems have sat and settled there , With none to frighten them away . Like sentries watching by the way Black chimneys topple in the air , And seem to say , Go back , beware ! While up around the mountain 's rim Are clouds of smoke , so still and grim They look as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so like death . So touches , terrifies all things , That even rooks that fry o'erhead Are hush 'd , and seem to hold their breath , To fly with muffled wings , And heavy as if made of lead . Some skulls that crumble to the touch , Some joints of thin and chalk-like bone , A tall black chimney , all alone , That leans as if upon a crutch , Alone are left to mark or tell , Instead of cross or cryptic stone , Where fair maids loved or brave men fell . I look along the valley 's edge , Where swings the white road like a swell Of surf , along a sea of hedge And black and brittle chaparral , And enters like an iron wedge Drove in the mountain dun and brown , As if to split the hills in twain . Two clouds of dust roll o'er the plain , And men ride up and men ride down , And hot men halt , and curse and shout , And coming coursers plunge and neigh . The clouds of dust are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where are they ? Lo ! through a rift of dust and dun , Of desolation and of rout , I see some long white daggers flash , I hear the sharp hot pistols crash , And curses loud in mad despair Are blended with a plaintive prayer That struggles through the dust and air . The cloud is lifting like a veil : The frantic curse , the plaintive wail Have died away ; nor sound nor word Along the dusty plain is heard Save sounding of yon courser 's feet , Who flies so fearfully and fleet , With gory girth and broken rein , Across the hot and trackless plain . Behold him , as he trembling flies , Look back with red and bursting eyes To where his gory master lies . The cloud is lifting like a veil , But underneath its drifting sail I see a loose and black capote In careless heed far fly and float , So vulture-like above a steed Of perfect mould and passing speed . Here lies a man of giant mould , His mighty right arm , perfect bare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its iron clasp A clump of sage , as if to hold The earth from slipping from his grasp ; While , stealing from his brow , a stain Of purple blood and gory brain Yields to the parch 'd lips of the plain , Swift to resolve to dust again . Lo ! friend and foe blend here and there With dusty lips and trailing hair : Some with a cold and sullen stare , Some with their red hands clasp 'd in prayer . Here lies a youth , whose fair face is Still holy from a mother 's kiss , With brow as white as alabaster , Save a tell-tale powder-stain Of a deed and a disaster That will never come again , With their perils and their pain . The tinkle of bells on the bended hills , The hum of bees in the orange trees , And the lowly call of the beaded rills Are heard in the land as I look again Over the peaceful battle-plain . Murderous man from the field has fled , Fled in fear from the face of his dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day  --  And peaceful nature resumes her sway . And the sward where yonder corses lie , When the verdant season shall come again , Shall greener grow than it grew before ; Shall again in sun-clime glory vie With the gayest green in the tropic scene , Taking its freshness back once more From them that despoil 'd it yesterday . IV . The sun is red and flush 'd and dry , And fretted from his weary beat Across the hot and desert sky , And swollen as from overheat , And failing too ; for see he sinks Swift as a ball of burnish 'd ore : It may be fancy , but methinks He never fell so fast before . I hear the neighing of hot steeds , I see the marshalling of men That silent move among the trees As busily as swarming bees With step and stealthiness profound , On carpetings of spindled weeds , Without a syllable or sound Save clashing of their burnish 'd arms , Clinking dull death-like alarms  --  Grim bearded men and brawny men That grope among the ghostly trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sombre forest deep And dark as this ? Here one might sleep While all the weary years went round , Nor wake nor weep for sun or sound . A stone 's throw to the right , a rock Has rear 'd his head among the stars  --  An island in the upper deep  --  And on his front a thousand scars Of thunder 's crash and earthquake 's shock Are seam 'd as if by sabre 's sweep Of gods , enraged that he should rear His front amid their realms of air . What moves along his beetling brow , So small , so indistinct and far , This side yon blazing evening star , Seen through that redwood 's shifting bough ? A lookout on the world below ? A watcher for the friend  --  or foe ? This still troop 's sentry it must be , Yet seems no taller than my knee . But for the grandeur of this gloom , And for the chafing steeds ' alarms , And brown men 's sullen clash of arms , This were but as a living tomb . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if nor sunshine , life nor light Had ever reach 'd this forest 's heart . Above , the redwood boughs entwine As dense as copse of tangled vine  --  Above , so fearfully afar , It seems as ' t were a lesser sky , A sky without a moon or star , The moss 'd boughs are so thick and high . At every lisp of leaf I start ! Would I could hear a cricket trill , Or that yon sentry from his hill Might shout or show some sign of life , The place does seem so deathly still . " Mount ye , and forward for the strife ! " Who by yon dark trunk sullen stands , With black serape and bloody hands , And coldly gives his brief commands ? They mount  --  away ! Quick on his heel He turns , and grasps his gleaming steel  --  Then sadly smiles , and stoops to kiss An upturn 'd face so sweetly fair , So rich of blessedness and bliss ! I know she is not flesh and blood , But some sweet spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hair , And step on the unyielding air ; Her seamless robe of shining white , Her soul-deep eyes of darkest night : But over all and more than all That could be said or can befall , That tongue can tell or pen can trace , That wondrous witchery of face . Between the trees I see him stride To where a red steed fretting stands Impatient for his lord 's commands : And she glides noiseless at his side . Lo ! not a bud , or leaf , or stem , Beneath her feet is bowed or bent ; They only nod , as if in sleep , And all their grace and freshness keep ; And now will in their beauty bloom , In pink and pearl habiliment , As though fresh risen from a tomb , For fairest sun has shone on them . " The world is mantling black again ! Beneath us , o'er the sleeping plain , Dull steel-gray clouds slide up and down As if the still earth wore a frown . The west is red with sunlight slain ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifting from her shoulders bare ; The other holds the loosen 'd rein , And rests upon the swelling mane That curls the curved neck o'er and o'er , Like waves that swirl along the shore . He hears the last retreating sound Of iron on volcanic stone , That echoes far from peak to plain , And ' neath the dense wood 's sable zone He peers the dark Sierras down . ) " But darker yet shall be the frown , And redder yet shall be the flame . And yet I would that this were not  --  That all , forgiven or forgot Of curses deep and awful crimes , Of blood and terror , could but seem Some troubled and unholy dream ; That even now I could awake , And waking find me once again With hand and heart without a stain , Swift gliding o'er that sunny lake , Begirt with town and castle-wall , Where first I saw the silver light  --  Begirt with blossoms , and the bloom Of orange , sweet with the perfume Of cactus , pomegranate and all The thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mellow moon Pour 'd out in gorgeous pleniluue On silver ripples of that tide ; And , waking , hear soft music pour Along that flora-formd shore And , waking , find you at my side , My father 's moss 'd and massive halls , My brothers in their strength and pride . " ( His hand forsakes her raven hair , His eyes have an unearthly glare : She shrinks and shudders at his side , Then lifts to his her moisten 'd eye , And only looks her sad reply . A sullenness his soul enthrals , A silence born of hate and pride ; His fierce volcanic heart so deep Is stirr 'd , his teeth , despite his will , Do chatter as if in a chill ; His very dagger at his side Does shake and rattle in its sheath , As blades of brown grass in a gale Do rustle on the frosted heath : And yet he does not bend or weep . ) I did not vow a girlish vow , Nor idle imprecation now Will I bestow by boasting word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wailing in the land is heard For those that will not come again ; And weeping for the rashly brave , Who sleep in many a gulch and glen , Has wet a hundred hearths with tears , And darken 'd them for years and years . Would I could turn their tears to gore , Make every hearth as cold as one Is now upon that sweet lake shore , Where my dear kindred dwelt of yore ; Where now is but an ashen heap , And mass of mossy earth and stone ; Where round an altar black wolves keep Their carnival and doleful moan ; Where hornd lizards dart and climb , And mollusks slide and leave their slime . " But tremble not . This night , my own , Shall see my fierce foe overthrown ; And ere the day-star gleams again My horse 's hoofs shall spurn the dead  --  The still warm reeking dead of those Who brought us all our bitter woes ; While all my glad returning way Shall be as light as living day , From ranchos , campos , burning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  --  ( As if to charm her from her fears And drive away the starting tears , Again his small hand seeks a curl , And voice forgets its sullen ire , And eye forsakes its flashing fire )  --  " Away to where the orange tree Is white through all the cycled years , And love lives an eternity ; Where birds are never out of tune And life knows no decline of noon ; Where winds are sweet as woman 's breath , And purpled , dreamy , mellow skies Are lovely as a woman 's eyes ,  --  There , we in calm and perfect bliss Of boundless faith and sweet delight Shall realize the world above , Forgetting all the wrongs of this , Forgetting all of blood and death , And all your terrors of to-night , In pure devotion and deep love . " As gently as a mother bows Her first-born sleeping babe above , The cherish 'd cherub lips to kiss In her full blessedness and bliss , He bends to her with stately air , His proud head in its cloud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kiss ; I do not hear the hurried vows Of passion , faith , unfailing love ; I do not mark the prison 'd sigh , I do not meet the moisten 'd eye : A low sweet melody is heard Like cooing of some Balize bird , So fine it does not touch the air , So faint it stirs not anywhere ; Faint as the falling of the dew , Low as a pure unutter 'd prayer , The meeting , mingling , as it were , Of souls in paradisal bliss . Erect again , he grasps the rein So tight , as to the seat he springs , I see his red steed plunge and poise And beat the air with iron feet , And curve his noble glossy neck , And toss on high his swelling mane , And leap  --  away ! he spurns the rein , And flies so fearfully and fleet , But for the hot hoofs ' ringing noise ' T would seem as if he were on wings . And she is gone ! Gone like a breath , Gone like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then lost to sight ; Gone like a star you look upon , That glimmers to a bead , a speck , Then softly melts into the dawn , And all is still and dark as death . V. I look far down a dewy vale , Where cool palms lean across a brook As crooked as a shepherd 's crook . Red parrots call from orange trees , Where white lips kiss the idle breeze , And murmur with the hum of bees : The gray dove coos his low love-tale . With cross outstretch 'd like pleading hands That mutely plead the faith of Christ , Amid the palms a low church stands : I would that man might learn from these The priceless victories of Peace , And woo her ' mid these olive trees , And win an earthly paradise . I see black clouds of troops afar Sweep like a surge that sweeps the shore , And check'ring all the green hills o'er Are battlements and signs of war . I hear the hoarse-voiced cannon roar : The red-mouthed orators of war Plead as they never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leans in wonderment afar . A fragment from the struggle rent Forsakes the rugged battlement , And winds it painfully and slow Across the rent and riven lands To where a gray church open stands , As if it bore a load of woe . Curambo ! ' t is a chief they bear ! And by his black and flowing hair Methinks I have seen him before . A gray priest guides them through the door , They lay him bleeding on the floor . He moves , he lifts his feeble hand , And points with tried and trenchd brand , And bids them to the battle-plain . They turn  --  they pause : he bids again ; They turn a last time to their chief , And gaze in silence and deep pain , For silence speaks the deepest grief . They clutch their blades ; they turn  --  are gone : And priest and chief are left alone . " So here my last day has its close , And here it ends . Here all is not . I am content . ' T is what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Oh for the rest  --  for the rest eternal ! Oh for the deep and the dreamless sleep ! Where never a hope lures to deceive ; Where never a heart beats but to grieve ; Nor thoughts of heaven or hells infernal Shall ever wake or dare to break The rest of an everlasting sleep ! " Is there truth in the life eternal ? Will our memories never die ? Shall we relive in realms supernal Life 's resplendent and glorious lie ? Death has not one shape so frightful But defiantly I would brave it ; Earth has nothing so delightful But my soul would scorn to crave it , Could I know for sure , for certain , That the falling of the curtain And the folding of the hands Is the full and the final casting Of accounts for the everlasting ! Everlasting , and everlasting ! " Well , I have known , I know not why , Through all my dubious days of strife , That when we live our deeds we die ; That man may in one hour live All that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done , and do not grieve , For I am older by a score Than many born long , long before , If sorrows be the sum of life . " Ay , I am old  --  old as the years Could brand me with their blood and tears ; For with my fingers I can trace Grief 's trenches on my hollow face , And through my thin frame I can feel The pulses of my frozen heart Beat with a dull uncertain start : And , mirror 'd in my sword , to-day , Before its edge of gleaming steel Had lost its lustre in the fray , I saw around my temples stray Thin straggling locks of steely gray . " Fly , fly you , to yon snowy height , And tell to her I fail , I die ! Fly swiftly , priest , I bid you !  --  fly Before the falling of the night ! What ! know her not ? O priest , beware ! I warn you answer thus no more , But bend your dull ear to the floor , And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She is the last , last of a line , With blood as rich and warm as wine , And blended blood of god and king ; Last of the Montezumas ' line Who dwelt up in the yellow sun , And , sorrowing for man 's despair , Slid by his trailing yellow hair To earth , to rule with love and bring The blessedness of peace to us . She is the last , last earthly one Of all the children of the sun ; A sweet perfume still lingering In essence pure , and living thus In blessedness about the spot , When rose , and bush , and bloom are not . " Beside Tezcuco 's flowery shore , Where waves were washing evermore The massive columns of its wall , Stood Montezuma 's mighty hall . And here the Montezumas reign 'd In perfect peace and love unfeign 'd , Until from underneath the sea Where all sin is , or ought to be , Came men of death and strange device , Who taught a mad and mystic faith Of crucifixion and of Christ , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do not swing your cross o'er me ; You cross 'd you once , but do not twice , Nor dare repeat the name of Christ ; Nor start , nor think to fly , nor frown , While you the stole and surplice wear ; For I do clutch your sable gown , And you shall hear my curse , or prayer , And be my priest in my despair ; Since neither priest , nor sign , nor shrine Is left in all the land of mine . " Enough ! We know , alas ! too well , How red Christ ruled  --  Tonatiu fell . The black wolf in our ancient halls Unfrighten 'd sleeps the live-long day . The stout roots burst the mossy walls , And in the moonlight wild dogs play Around the plazas overgrown , Where rude boars hold their carnivals . The moss is on our altar-stone , The mould on Montezuma 's throne , And symbols in the desert strown . " And when your persecutions ceased From troop , and king , and cowld priest , That we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ priest , that cross of thine Is but death 's symbol , and the sign Of blood and butchery and tears ? )  --  And when return 'd the faithful few , Beside Tezcuco 's sacred shore , To build their broken shrines anew , They number 'd scarce a broken score . Here dwelt my father  --  here she dwelt Here kept one altar burning bright , Last of the thousands that had shone Along the mountain 's brows of stone , Last of a thousand stars of night . To Tonatiu Ytzaqual we bow 'd  --  Nay , do not start , nor shape the sign Of horror at this creed of mine , Nor call again the name of Christ : You cross you once , you cross you twice  --  I warn you do not cross you thrice ; Nor will I brook a sign or look Of anger at her faith avow 'd . I am no creedist . Faith to me Is but a name for mystery . I only know this faith is her 's : I care to know no more , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came across the plain With gory blade and brand of flame : I know not that they knew or cared What was our race , or creed , or name ; I only know the Northmen dared Assault and sack , for sake of gain Of sacred vessels wrought in gold , The temple where gods dwelt of old ; And that my father , brothers , dared Defend their shrines  --  and all were slain . " ' Fly with the maid , ' my father cried , When first the fierce assault was made  --  ' A boat chafes at the causeway side , ' And in the instant was obey 'd . We gain 'd the boat , sprang in , away We dash 'd along the dimpled tide . " It must have been they thought we bore The treasure in our flight and haste , For in an instant from the shore An hundred crafts were making chase , And as their sharp prows drew apace I caught a carbine to my face . She , rising , dash 'd it quick aside ; And , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's prow in their eager grasp , She turn 'd to me and sudden cried , ' Come , come ! ' and plunged into the tide . I plunged into the dimpled wave : I had no thought but ' t was my grave ; But faith had never follower More true than I to follow her . " On , on through purple wave she cleaves , As shoots a sunbeam through the leaves . At last  --  what miracle was there !  --  Again we breathed the welcome air ; And , resting by the rising tide , The secret outlet of the lake , Safe hid by trackless fern and brake , With yellow lilies at her side , She told me how in ages gone Her Fathers built with sacred stone This secret way beneath the tide , That now was known to her alone . " When night came on and all was still , And stole the white moon down the hill As soft , as if she too fear 'd ill , Again I sought the sacred halls And on the curving causeway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd walls And charr 'd bones of my kindred blood Was left beside the dimpled flood . align=top " Enough ! Mine was no temper 'd steel To-day upon the stormy field , As many trench 'd heads yonder feel , And many felt , that feel no more , That fought beneath your cross and shield , And , falling , called in vain to Christ . You curs 'd monk ! dare you cross you thrice , When I have warn 'd you twice before ? To you and your damn 'd faith I owe My heritage of crime and woe ; You shall not live to mock me more If there be temper in this brand , Or nerve left in this bloody hand . I start , I leave the stony ground , Despite of blood or mortal wound , Or darkness that has dimn 'd the eye , Or senses that do dance and reel  --  I clutch a throat  --  I clench a steel  --  I thrust  --  I fail  --  I fall  --  I die ... " VI . She stands upon the wild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The beacon-light to guide again His coming from the battle-plain . ' T is wearing past the midnight hour , The latest that he ever came , Yet silence reigns around the tower . ' T is hours past the midnight hour : She calls , she looks , she lists in vain For sight or sound from peak or plain . She moves along the beetling tower , She leans , she lists forlorn and lone , She stoops her ear low to the ground , In hope to catch the welcome sound Of iron on the rugged stone . In vain she peers down in the night But for one feeble flash of light From flinty stone and feet of steel . She stands upon the fearful rim , Where even coolest head would reel , And fearless leans her form far o'er Its edge , and lifts her hands to him , And calls in words as sweetly wild As bleeding saint or sorrowing child . She looks , she lists , she leans in vain , In vain his dalliance does deplore ; She turns her to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plain , Defying night or dubious way , To guide the flight or join the fray . The day-star dances on the snow That gleams along Sierra 's crown In gorgeous everlasting glow And frozen glory and renown . Yet still she feeds the beacon flame , And lists , and looks , and leans in vain . The day has dawn 'd . She still is there ! Yet in her sad and silent air I read the stillness of despair . Why burns the red light on the tower So brightly at this useless hour ? But see ! The day-king hurls a dart At darkness , and his cold black heart Is pierced ; and now , compell 'd to flee , Flies bleeding to the farther sea . And now , behold , she radiant stands , And lifts her thin white jewelled hands Unto the broad , unfolding sun , And hails him Tonatiu and King With hallow 'd mien and holy prayer . Her fingers o'er some symbols run , Her knees are bowed in worshipping Her God , beheld when thine is not , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Again she lifts her brown arms bare , Far flashing in their bands of gold And precious stones , rare , rich , and old . Was ever mortal half so fair ? Was ever such a wealth of hair ? Was ever such a plaintive air ? Was ever such a sweet despair ? Still humbler now her form she bends ; Still higher now the flame ascends : She bares her bosom to the sun . Again her jewell 'd fingers sun In signs and sacred form and prayer . She bows with awe and holy air In lowly worship to the sun ; Then rising calls her lover 's name , And leaps into the leaping flame . I do not hear the faintest moan , Or sound , or syllable , or tone . The red flames stoop a moment down , As if to raise her from the ground ; They whirl , they swirl , they sweep around With light'ning feet and fiery crown ; Then stand up , tall , tip-toed , as one Would hand a soul up to the sun .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
