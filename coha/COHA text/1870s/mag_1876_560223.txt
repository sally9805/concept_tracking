FRENcH AND GERMAN.1 M. Tame has for some time been turning his attention to the study of the recent history of his own country , following therein the tendency on the part of the French , which has been especially marked since the late war , of overhauling the various causes which led them to such swift and startling , though possibly temporary , decadence . This Tame is doing , not in order to make a display of captious fault - finding , but that it may be possible for his fellow-countrymen , taking warning from the past , to be wiser in the future when they undertake to put the political machine into good running order . As he says in his preface , thirteen times in the last eighty years the French have remodeled their form of government , and they have not yet hit upon any scheme which gives them general satisfaction . He considers , and with reason , that consulhtion of the popular voice is a very inadequate way of securing the wisest constitution ; that the people can say what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; that in order to do so it is important to know what the needs of the country are . The title of the whole book , which is to consist of three parts , is Les Origines de la France Contemporaine ; 2 the first volume , the only one that has appeared , is entitled 1 All books mentioned under this head are to be had at Sehoenhof and Moeller 's , 40 Winter St. , Boston , Mass . L'Ancien Edgime . It is to be followed by studies of the Revolution and of the new regime . In the volume before us Tame endeavors to make out the causes of the Revolution as they existed in the last century in the politics , in the social life , in the prevailing ideas and modes of thought of the time . For this purpose lie divides his subject into five books , and in this order discusses the structure of society , the manners and characteristics , the spirit and doctrine , the propagation of the doctrine , and the people . Each one of these subdivisions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full investigation he made careful researches , often in unpublished documents , and the results of his industry are stated by him with all the vigor of his brilliant though at times somewhat wearisome style . By this time Tame 's method of work is well known to us all . lie does not deal with general principles and vague statements on the contrary , he accumulates details and statistics , and lets them explain whatever he has to say . In this book , certainly , lie can not be accused of attaching too much weight to isolated instances of what he is anxious to prove was the rule . He has amassed too many examples , and , moreover , he has had a very uncomplex task in showing the great variety of causes that produced the French Revolution . It was nothing obscure or hidden that started that great convulsion . A slight glance beneath the surface - or , for the matter of that , at the surface - of the civilization of the last century shows this . The closer the examination , the clearer does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long time had been , suffering almost incredibly . Exactly of what this suffering consisted , this book shows . The higher clergy and the nobles bad all sorts of privileges . Their taxation was light , the clergy having succeeded in establishing their right to make a gratuitous gift at discretion to the treasury , instead ( l of paying onerous taxes ; moreover , they were even ingenious enough to manage that money should be paid them from the treasury , instead of their paying money in ; and this besides the enormous revenues they received from their vast properties . The nobles had very much the same experience . The princes of the blood had possession of one seventh of the whole country , and , inLes Origines de la France Contemporaine . ( Volnine L ) L'Ancien R*gime . Par II . TAnea . Paria : Itachette. 1875. 1876j 627 // stead of paying 2,400,000 livres in taxes , paid oniy 188,000 , with a revenue of from twenty-four to twenty-five millions . Other nobles , too , possessed colossal fortunes , which were equally spared by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their estates , although lacking in public spirit , and ignorant in many respects about agricultural matters , were generally kind to their peasants and did what they could to free them from their sufferings . Those , on the other hand , - and they formed the vast majority , - who passed their time in Paris or Versailles , lived so extravagantly that they felt unable to forego any of the income they received from their estates , which they left in charge of stewards , forgetting the sufferings of the poverty-stricken , overworked peasants . At court , luxury ruled everywhere . There was no position that was not extravagantly paid . The treasury seemed to be regarded as an unfailing spring , and the illustrations of this that Tame cites are most curious reading ; they show how recklessly the money was spent ; with what cruelty it was accumulated is shown in another book , which exposes at great length the dreadful misery of the people . It is indeed a terrible indictment that is brought against the frivolous , thoughtless , amiable , cultivated French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the provocation to revolt that Tame concerns himself ; he goes on , in some most interesting chapters , to state what doctrines were at work dissolving those ties and sentiments which tended to keep society united , even if it were in every way miserable . Conservatism was attacked by three things . In the first place , the new activity in the physical sciences , and the explanation of much that had formerly been obscure by the discoveries of Newton , Leibnitz , Laplace , Lavoisier , etc. , which showed how universal was the rule of law in the positive sciences , seemed to establish as a natural corollary that the same exactness applies to the moral sciences , and that these could be determined , understood , and controlled to the same extent as the natural sciences . It was considered that a principle of reason worked in the heart of man with the same uniformity that the laws of gravitation show in their work outside of him . This notion of reason , however , undermined the reverence which had been of so great service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tame calls the classical spirit , which , 1although it played an impor tant part in improving literature , exceeded its powers when it forgot to take account of the difference between different ages and races of men , and led people to think that what was true of one man was true of all . Reason seemed to be the only power that existed , and respect for the processes of logic the only method of respecting it . Theories ran wild , and what these theories were are shown by frequent references to the writings of Diderot , Voltaire , and Montesquieu , - more especially Voltaire . The whole battalion of the encyclopndists cried for a return to nature , for the abolition of society ; this too was the cry of Rousseau . Civilization was condemned on all sides . The fashionable philosophy had destroyed the authority of both church and state , and shown that their creed is harmful ; and now was the time for laying out the plans of the new and improved society which should be free of all the errors of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mathematical system . Man , they said , was a reasonable being , who disliked pain and was fond of pleasure , capable of reasoning and of acquiring moral ideas ; all should be equal before the law , for equality may certainly be predicated of these shadowy creatures of the brain ; all , too , will be led by natural instincts to respect the laws they have themselves made , and to obey the magistrates they have themselves chosen . We all know these theories and the reasoning which seems to hold them together ; even the French Revolution , which , to state it mildly , showed that man is not all reason , has left a good deal of life in these notions vet . In France this philosophy gained great success ; in England , as is well known , its march was less triumphant . Tame finds that this difference is due to the brilliant social life of France , which made of philosophy a means of enjoyment , a fashionable amusement , while across the Channel the philosopher was buried in books and took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in him . In drawing the picture of the way it spread in France , Tame has added to the interest of his book , but it may be doubted whether he has fully expressed one of the niarked peculiarities of his fellow - countrymen which most strongly strikes a foreigner . The French in the last century , as well as some of their descendants in the present , built the world over again on paper , and were perfectly satisfied with their work . T*se English had practi 628 May , // cal experience of the difficulty of getting stubborn material to assent to everything that was said to them ; they knew how hard it was to persuade ignorant or prejudiced men to agree with them ; but their French contemporaries were without knowledge of their fellow - creatures except as they met them in a salon , where wit was occupied in detecting inconsistency in the theory when wisdom would have distrusted the theory in proportion to its smoothness . In fact , even now France is the country where theories not only are made but where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so interesting a country to watch and study , and so important in our civilization . Then , too , atheism was rife there early in the last century , and became as much a matter of fashion as any affectation in dress ; that was one of the earliest signs of what was to come . After this came the spirit of questioning the wisdom of the government ; the gentler reforms had their day ; it became a mark of distinction to be interested in political , financial , agricultural matters : these were the first tokens of what was later to appear as a remodeling of society . Just before the Revolution everything seemed to promise for the best . As Tame says , " The aristocracy was never so deserving of power as when it was just on the point of losing it ; the privileged classes were just becoming public men , and were returning to their duty ; " and he gives many instances of this . " The nobility of Clermont in Beauvoisis orders its deputies to ask first of all an explicit declaration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nobility of Mantes and Meulan affirms that the principles of politics are as absolute as those of morals , since both are based on reason . ' That of Rheims asks that the king be entreated to order the destruction of the Bastile . " ' Such sentiments were often applauded by delegates of the clergy and nobility , and were greeted with tears . " They take it for granted that man , especially the man of the people , is good ; how could they suppose that he could wish ill to those who wish him well l " And they not only wished him well , they often did deeds of kindness ; but it was too late . Long years of ill - treatment had filled the souls of the people with hatred ; philosophy , which had gradually filtered down to them , had loosened the restraining bands of reverence and respect , and had taught them for what they had to strike ; and the blow was struck . What the horrors of the Revolution were , Tame will probably show in his next volume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feelings in his portrayal of its excesses , but there can be no doubt he will make a useful book . Tame 's style is brilliant and picturesque ; he sets everything before us in vivid colors , which in time lose their effect because there is no relief ; everything is made of equal importance , and it is hard to preserve a due sense of the relative worth of the different parts . It is only fair to say , in addition , that the present book reads like the brief of an advocate of the Revolution ; with nil its richness and ability , it does not present a full picture of French life in the last century , and Tame 's example would be a dangerous one for all historians to follow , hut once in a while such an impassioned book performs a duty ART . THE collection of Mr. William M. Hunt 's paintings , recently placed on exhibition at the gallery of Williams and Everett , has afforded a rare opportunity for the study of this artist in a variety of moods . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to call attention most effectively to their peculiar individual qualities , and they certainly testify most eloquently to the great talents of the author of them . The pictures have a force , a virility , a physique , - if the term may be used , - that speaks at once to every spectator . They are direct and impulsive transcriptions of nature from . In other words , they are all rendered with equal enthusiasm . The paintings are not highly finished ; several of them are little more than rough sketches and quick impressions made at once , in hot blood . Every artist knows the value of studies made with absorbing ener // Art . gy . The more complete and well-reasoned picture fails to convey the same strong sentiment of nature that is found in the impulsive preliminary sketches . Two or three of Mr. Hunt 's studies demand consideration from the very fact of their being made with a vigorous swing that preserves its vitality only as its course is uninterrupted . Some of their qualities are not possible in more finished works , except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What Mr. Hunt has lost by ignoring finish he has much more than made up by vigor and simplicity . He has made his choice of the manner most congenial to his artistic temperament ; the public may accept or reject the results . The landscapes , with the exception of a bright little view on a river hank , are all mournful in feeling . In the sad tones of the skies , in the mellow richness of the ground , in the sober hues of the foliage and in the simplicity of the lines of composition , there is a sentiment of solemn quiet , which even occasional masses of warm rich color do not dispel , but rather heighten by contrast . The most important of them is a large picture of a team of horses and cattIe plowing on a hill-side . The slope rises gently , and meets the gray sky in a simply curved line broken only at one end by the small masses of distant tree-tops . The light in the sky is concentrated on a great cloud in the centre , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Across the broad mass of the slope covered with a warm-hued turf is the dark line of freshly turned earth , and the forms of the horses and oxen tugging at the plow come up strongly against the yellow of the dry grass . The action of the animals is admirably given ; they feel their weight and the resistance of the plowshare . They are planted firmly on their feet , and their movements are carefully studied . The figures of the driver and of the man holdin the plow are 1 ) 0th well understood and broadly put in . Evidently the motive of the picture is not the landscape , with the solid , rich tones , the strong sky effect , and the grandly simple lines ; it is the vigorous action of the cattle and horses as they move along with strained muscles and knotted veins , turning the heavy furrow . The general tone of the picture is low and strong , and , with th' exception of the concentrated light on the cloud , which does not altogether keep its place , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in character and painted directly from the shoulder . Two other landscapes of medium size are quite as strong in tone as the large one , while naturally enough less simple in composition , since they depend for their interest on the natural features of the scene , rather than on any accessories of animals or the like . One of them is a study of trees in autumn foliage , with a bit of river and wooded hank in the distance . The juicy tones of the autumn leaves and withered grass , the fine gray of the sky , and the strong distance are the chief charms of the picture , although the composition may be commended for its natural arrangement . The second landscape is from a motive simple in itself , hut interesting from the effect of light and beauty of the tone . In the foreground is a massive group of trees with a stone wall pounding a broad field that rises in an unbroken mass to the summit of a low hill in the distance . Under the trees and in the immediate foreground is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeding . The sky is covered with fully modeled gray clouds , and contrasts strongly with the warm tones of the hill-side and the dark mass of the foliage of the trees . The outof - door feeling is unmistakable , and to achieve this result was doubtless the artist 's aim . The smaller studies comprise a sketch of a pond and overhanging trees , with what appears to he a part of a factory building ; a domestic landscape with a clump of trees in the foreground , a low house in the distance , and a sky with light clouds ruddy and golden at the horizon ; the bright little river bank alluded to above , and a pastel drawing of an autumn landscape , with broad , warm masses of color on the ground and the delicate lines of birch-trees with scattered leaves twinkling in the strong light . Perhaps the last - mentioned study gives the best linpression of the season it represents . Among the studies of the figure , the portrait of Professor Agassiz in full profile is the most prominent for vigor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is a strong likeness and an agreeahle portrait , without being altogether realistic in color or in texture of flesh . The study of a lady with her back to the spectator , and head turned so as to look over her shoulder , is in quite another mood . The pose is graceful and feminine , the color warm and delicate . In the portrait of Agassiz we feel the presence of the man ; in the study of the lady there is less // Art . personality but more evident preoccupation of the artist with the natural grace of the pose and the delicacy of color . Both are equally effective in entirely different directions . The head of a Spanish boy , slightly foreshortened from below , is rich and daring in general tone , and carries well as a spot of fresh , brilliant color . rho type of the face is admirable , and the picturesque shock of hair and coarse garments are quite in keeping with the character of the model . The bead of a little Italian girl is bewitching in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forms about the mouth and the constantly changing planes of the plump cheeks of the little model were full of difficulties , and the artist has made the representation of them appear the simplest matter in the world . A study in profile of a shy little girl dressed in pink is not without a great charm in the natural simplicity of the pose , but the color is less agreeable than in the other heads . There is no better example of Mr. Hunt 's method of seizing at once those characteristic features of his subject which impress him the most deeply , than the preliminary study for a full length portrait of a boy in dark red velvet , holding a sword . There is the perfect action of the body and the limbs , the easy pose of the head with its mass of light hair , and the unmistakable character of the whole figure . It may be a good portrait without necessarily being a perfect likeness , for one may recognize the boy by his own peculiar action . A study of a girl playing on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in treatment . It is purely decorative , full of musical grace and dignity . Mr. Hunt 's pictures seen together gain decidedly by contrast . They bear witness to his preoccupation with the strength and variety of general tone , with the salient points of character of landscape or figure . Whoever analyzes them must confess that they represent the artist 's impression of nattire , even if the loose way in which many of them are treated may not be altogether agreeable to the eye accustomed to porcelain finish and carefully blended contours . In the effective way in which Mr. Hunt communicates his impressions , in his earnest and frank manner of painting , and in the highly artistic quality of his productions , he stands alone among American painters . - The greater part of the art produced at the present time may be said to be self-con-631 scious art . Those artists who are the most successful in their profession , if popular approbation and pecuniary gains may be termed success , are the ones who constantly come before the public with works that demand attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the strangeness of their execution . Tours-deforce in paintin* have the success of the salons abroad and of our galleries at home , and plain , honest endeavors are often turned to the wall for years , until from their persistency they receive recognition . And this is natural enou , h , too ; the same rule works in every profession and in every occupation . When success comes to the artist who has spent the greater part of his life in telling his simple stories in his own way and without an audience , it is none the less unqualified because it comes late , and oftentimes the reward long delayed is sweeter and more welcome in declining years . The histories of Corot and Millet should encourage every honest worker in the profession . A number of pictures by George Fuller , lately hung in the gallery of Doll and Hichards , have the element of unconsciousness that is the more choice for its extreme rarity in works of art . Mr. Fuller 's artistic career has been a strange otto . A score of years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and failed to make his way in New York , whither he went in the hope of secnring patronage . Since that time he has been living on a farm of his own in Deerfield , Massachusetts , and has , until lately , we believe , almost entirely given up painting . The old love is now upon him again , it is said , and he paints with all his accustomed feeling . In the collection of his works exhibited there are six heads of remarkable beauty , painted , with one or two exceptions , twenty years ago . They are noble in character , distinguished in color , vigorous in execution ; they are unpretending , earnest studies of one who in his seclusion painted only as he was able , without a thought or a care of how others worked , and yet evidently directed in his labor by his previous experience and training . It may be that the artist , if he had painted the heads for exhibition , would have been tempted to indulge in the endeavor to conform his manner to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressure from the consideration of what the world is going to say about it . As it is , he is utterly unconscious . One of the heads he calls Fifteen , and quotes , - // Art . Standing with reluctant feet Where the hrook and river meet , Womanhood and childhood fleet . " It is a girl 's head in three-quarters view , with brown hair , dark dress , and a bit of lace at the throat . The face is pure and sweet in expression , the tones of the flesh are pearly and fresh , and the forms full and child-like . It is charming in its innocence and purity , and lovelier eyes rarely look out from canvas . Two other studies of the heads and shoulders of young girls are both full of grace . One of theta is looking over her shoulder with a frank , school-girl expression , her ruddy cheeks and bright eyes full of youth and health . A study in profile of a child 's head against a sombre background is a bright bit of sunny flesh-color . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the features are in a cool , well-modeled shadow . The texture of the cheek and tempie is open and loose , giving mystery and freshness to the tone . The manner in which the color is caressed on the cheek and modeled toward the shadow quite recalls some master . A study of a boy readiac , is one of the later works . It is so thoroughly earnest , so serious , as to be almost solemn . It is a country boy , but dignified and exalted almost to nobility by the honesty of the purpose with which it is painted . There is a certain dryness in the color of this head not noticeable in the others , but found again in both landscapes . In neither case does this quality detract from the interest of the picture , and in one of the landscapes , the autunrn study , it is even commendable , it harmonizes so well with the sentiment of the scene . This landscape is peculiar in tone , full of grays and russets and brown reds . Gently sloping hill-sides covered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ croWned with tall trees in the distance , is a simple enough motive . The great interest lies in the wonderfully sympathetic manner in which it is treated . The drapery of the figure in the foreground , the falling leaves that fill the air , and the motion of the branches show that a fresh autumn breeze is blowing ; everywhere are the rustle of the withered foliage and the twinkle of the bright colors of autumn , and yet the unity of the whole is unbrokt*n . As in the heads , the simplicity is the most prominent quality , and the feeling of nature the strongest element . The second landscape is quite as good ; indeed , one forgets one in the presence of the other . It is a path across the fields by the edge of a wood . A dense May , row of trees comes strongly against the sky , and through the opening where the road passes is seen in the distance the roofs of a village . In the foreground are a flock of sheep and a woman 's figure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to pre serve the breadth and the quiet of the land scape ; the bit of distance is charming , and the sheep are carefully studied and well understood . The general tone is gray , and a gray peculiar to Mr. Fuller . While it is not a tone that combines , perhaps , the most of the charms found in the rich landscape , it suggests the poverty of the soil , the harshness of the climate , and the dryness of the atmosphere . The landscape is characteristic and natural , and has many points of delicate and refined color . The most important condition of good art is also satisfied , - it is full of sentiment . There is nothing in the display that more positively asserts the strong feeling of the artist than a small , half-finished study of two children in a doorway , eating lunch . It is conceived in the spirit of a Millet , and has much of the seriousness and nobility of his work . Nevertheless it is expressed with difficulty ; it is not attractive nor skillful in execution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the story is told with all the love and strength of the artist 's nature . Despite its incompleteness it is a heroic genre . - The portrait of a lady in antique costume , by Mr. F. D. Millet , which has recently been on exhibition in Boston and is to go to the Centennial , seems deserving of notice as an important figure-piece executed with a skill and knowledge not often seen among young American painters , and showing some tendencies that are new here . This is the first sizable result that we have seen from an American student who has chiefly formed himself , as Mr. Millet has done , in the Antwerp Academy ; and the first thing in it which strikes us is the masterly molding of the figure , in powerful lines that are felt through the garment , united with a fresh and vigorous way of reproducing the superficial aspect of the stuffs in which the lady is clothed . It would be unjust to say that the picture is solely a study of costume , because of this excellent trait ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vigor and niceness : the rich plaster-hued silk , veined with tendrils and adorned with flat leaves and flowers , the sparkle of the quilted skirt which fills the front , tM elaborate bodice and old lace and turquoise jewelry , - all // this is charmingly rendered . Considered as a picture , in general terms , however , the work has a certain oddity not wholly to its advantage . Mr. Millet has tried the experiment of placing a light figure against a dark ground , and a curious effect of lifelessness in the face has resulted ; but if he has lost in this direction , he has gained in another , for the total effect is one of the most brilliantly decorative description . It is a singular coincidence that this wedding-dress was painted , when worn by the bride for whom it was made , by Copley . Mr. Millet 's treatment is very different from Copley 's usual style , yet there is something in the dignity , polish , and sincerity of his work that reminds us not a little of that famous portrait-maker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if compared with our Bostonian " old master ; " but there is a robust energy and a world of minute skill in this painting of Mr. Millet 's which leads us to hope for the most admirable results from him in future . MUSIC . OF the many important musical events of the past winter in Boston , Mr. John K. Paine 's symphony claims our attention first . We heartily wish that we could put the extreme pleasure that two hearings of this work have given us into a more systematic form than it is actually possible to do . Had it been a sensational work ( and there are sensational works in a high as well as in a low sense ) , an analysis of its effect upon us might have been comparatively easy , even after only one hearing . The mind is readier to grasp a composition full of strokes and strong hits than it is to separate into its various factors one in which the development is more purely organic . Absolute music , developing itself from a thematic germ , is a fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world . If the theme be really vital , if it do really " contain the potency and power " of a living composition , its rational development will be beautifully gradual and uneventful . Whether this epitomizing of cosmic growth is the highest mission of music or not is apart from the present question . In considering any particular work of a man , it is impertinent to ask whether he has done the highest possible thing ; all that we have a right to ask is whether he has done well the thing he palpably tried to do . To come more closely to the point , then , we are in no condition to analyze Mr. Paine 's symphony ( we have not even seen the score , much less studied it ) , but can only give our impressions of it . It gave us unalloyed enjoyment from beginning to end . It is melodious , natural , spirited , with that strength that comes from perfect equilibrium . Of dryness of detail we found not a trace ; it is thoroughly genial throughout . One technical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paine has made a long stride in handling the orchestra since he wrote his St. Peter . The orchestral coloring is throughout good , at times even peculiarly fascinating . We must all heartily thatik Mr. Thomas for giving us a hearing of this work ; both the performances were good , the second one even masterly . - It is an ungrateful task at best to speak of the performance of Bach 's great Magnificat by Mr. Sharland 's choral society and Mr. Thomas 's orchestra . One thing is certain : every musician who has the progress of our musical culture at heart must thank Mr. Sharland and Mr. Thomas most heartily for the good-will they have manifested in bringing out this important work . Whether the musical means they had at hand , and the cond*itions under which the work was . inevitably brought out , made the venture a piece of artistic good judgment or not is another question . At the worst they can say , and with reason too , that the conditions under which Bach 's choral music can be well given in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the compositions themselves , and that a beginning , either good or bad , must be made sometime . We for one regard the ultimate , we will not say popularity , but wide-spread recognition of Bach 's works in this country as just as much a certainty as the ultimate triumph of right over wrong . It can only be a matter of time . Encour // Aliusw. aged by this belief , we also think that great delicacy of management in introducing Isis works to our public is not so much needed as it is with some other composers . Take Spohr , for instance . Spohr was a man whose really high genius has been greatly thrown into the shade by his overpoweringly brilliant contemporaries , and who has consequently missed much of the recognition due him from the world . A condition of general musical culture is easily conceivable in which an intimate acquaintance with Spohr s music might be of great benefit to the music-loving community , and it would then be the duty of our leaders in musical matters to do all in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would have to go to work much more carefully than if it were Bach they were trying to introduce . Any bad first impression the public might receive would be far more fatal to the cause of Spohr than to that of Bach . When a man attains to a certain pitch of musical culture , Bach becomes , *sthetically speaking , an absolute necessary of life to him . Without Bach there is no further musical life conceivable . So we may be pretty sure that if Bach frightens away an audience at one time , he will conquer them at another . Hence we are by no means sorry that the attempt was made . The performance was , upon the whole , not a satisfactory one ; it is only justice to the great John Sebastian to say so . But , on the other hand , it is only justice to Mr. Sharland and Mr. Thomas to state , with all attainable brevity , why it was , humanly speaking , impossible that the performance should have been satisfactory under the existing circumstances . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult . Each part in the chorus is of itself quite a task for the ordinary singer . To all the florid vocalization of which we find so much in Hdndel ' * choruses Bach often adds an extreme difficulty of intonation , arising from his habitual use of much more daring modulations than those of his great contemporary . The Magnificat is in five real parts , and the choral business is almost without exception in more or less strict imitation , so that one , two , or three parts are often left singing alone . Now it can not be asked of any chorus to sing such music with assurance , unless they are thoroughly familiar with it . Mr. Sharland 's chorus was forced , unavoidably , as we believe , to learn the Magnificat in an exceedingly short time . We are well aware that May , some most remarkable results have been obtained from a very small number of rehearsals . Hector Berlioz mentions in his Letters from Germany some almost incredi. ble instances of rapid rehearsing . But his rehearsals were all conducted on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of his letters from Berlin , " The next day finds us at our work , Ries with his violin , the accompanist , ' and myself ; we take successively the children , the female voices , the first soprani , the second soprani , the first tenors , the second tenors , the first and second basses ; we make them sing by groups of ten , then by twenties ; after which we make two parts sing together , then three , four , and at last the whole chorus . " This is the only feasible method of making a chorus learn a work in few rehearsals ; indeed , Berlioz assures us that it is the only way to ever get a really fine performance of a choral work of more than common difficulty , and he had no little experience in drilling choruses . But this plan of rehearsing is just the one of all others that is impossible with us . Our choral societies are composed of amateurs who come together for the pleasure of rehear*ing , - mark this well , - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and rehearsing in the Berlioz fashion is exceedingly poor fun . Sueh rehearsing with any of our societies would probably have for a result not a fine performance , but a fine harvest of tenders of resignation from nine tenths of the members . It is only paid musicians that you can drill in that way , not amateur volunteers . Berlioz 's choruses in Germany were also made up of volunteers , hut Berlioz came to Germany as a lion of the first magnitude . If Anton Iluhinstein or Charles Gounod were to come to Boston and drill a chorus for a week or so , no doubt he would find no lack of singers willing to undergo any amount of tough rehearsing for such an occasion . Another great difficulty in bringing out a great choral work of Bach 's is the immense difficulty of the solos . Bach 's airs stand almost without parallel in the history of music . They are not only of great technical difficulty , but the high intellectual and aesthetic qualities they demand in the singer place them beyond the reach of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singers are good musicians even ! It is no slur upon our singers to say that they can not sing Bach . A man may be able to sing " It is enough , " in Elijah , exceedingly well , and // Miu8w. the baritone song from the Prodigal Son really superbly , without having the faintest conception of a Bach aria . It is one thing to sing " If with all your hearts , " and altogether another to sing " Deposuit potentes . " Mr. Joseph Jefferson is an exceedingly good actor , and can really exhaust the dramatic , pathetic , and humorous possibilities of Rip Van Winkle or Asa Trenchard , but it takes no great acumen to say what he would make of Hamlet ' soliloquy , or the death-scene in King Lear . We must insist that we are not wrong in our estimate of Bach 's airs and of the qualities they demand . Bach is not alone in this . How many singers are there who can really sinq " Thou shalt break them , " in the Messiah , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Giovanni l And yet we have all grown up in an atmosphere , so to speak , of the Messiah , and most of us know Don Giovanni nearly by heart . But Bach we hardly know a note of ; his vocal style is wholly unfamiliar to us , and we sing his music - as might be expected . It is true that there may be found , even in America , here a singer and there a singer who has made a loving and fruitful study of Bach 's works for his or her own aesthetic delig ht , but whoever they may be , they were not on the platform at the performance of the Magnificat . Still another quite sensible difficulty stood in the way of the performance . In re-scoring the Magnificat , Franz has written out a very elaborate organ part , which was found to be virtually impracticable in the Music Hall . Whether this organ part is a piece of bad musical judgment on the part of Franz himself , as some excellent judges seem inclined to think , or not , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prefer to think that Franz 's organ part would be perfectly practicable in halls or churches where the organist is placed near the conductor , and where the organ itself " sneaks " well to the action . In the Music Hall the organist is seated in the worst possible position for following the conductor well , and moreover the action of the organ is such that the audible note follows the action of the key-board only at a very appreciable interval of time . Many of the pipes being at a great distance from the orchestral and choral body on the stage makes the matter worse . It is therefore manifestly impossible for an elaborate organ part to tally well with the orchestra unless the organist has had long practice 635 with this particular organ , and has accus* tomed himself to play always a few seconds before the beat of the conductor . The chances , even then , of any passages of more than moderate intricacy being clearly rendered are very slight . As it was , Mr. Paine found himself forced to greatly simplify Franz 's organ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and chorus at all , thus nullifying many of Franz 's intentions , and to a greater or less extent marring the clearness of the performance . Again , the chorus had been rehearsed by Mr. Sharland at different tempi , in many instances , from those Mr. Thomas took at the concert , and it was only at the last rehearsal that they were made to sing at Mr. Thomas 's tempi . But even with all these dra*vbacks , any one listening reverently and with a goodwill ( arid no one ougbt to listen otherwise ) could not help feeling the unspeakable beauty and grandeur of the work . We hope that it will be given again and again , until both our singers and onr public have become really familiar with it . Mr. Sharland and Mr. Thomas certainly merit all praise for their earnest zeal in the good cause . - The Saint-Sa*ns concerto , 1 played at one of the Harvard Musical Association 's concerts by Mr. B. J. Lang , strikes us as being , all things considered , the best thing that has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concertos . The first movement is simply great . The dainty little scherzo that follows it and the tarantella finale are gems of their kind . In playing it , Mr. Lang fairly outdid himself , especially in the first two movements ; the effect upon the audience was electric . And yet there is something about the work that rather puzzles us . We do not remember ever hearing a work that we enjoyed so intensely while hearing it , and that left so vague an impression upon our minds when it was all over . While listening to it we are delighted , and when it is done we somehow feel dissatisfied . It may be that the scherzo and tarantella are somewhat overpowered by the superb first movement , which is after all the strongest in the work , but we are inclined to think that the finale is susceptible of being made more strongly effective than Mr. Lang made it . There is a certain savage energy inherent in the tarantella form , as there is I Deuxitme c'oneerte pour Piano , avec Accompagnement WOrchestre , par @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schoenewerk , &amp; Cie . // Education . indeed in many of the dance forms , a certain wild , unkempt fierccness of animal spirits , that seems to he wholly foreign to Mr. Lang 's nature . He plays with no lack of fire , but it is a highly refined fire . The noble breadth of phrasing and the dainty elegance of style that made his playing of the first two movements so noteworthy did not stand him in such good stead in the tarantella . There are some things that will not bear much refining , things in which a certain coarseness of texture is an essential factor . There is , to be sure , a certain " modesty of nature " that should not be too often overstepped ; there is a certain dignity and self-control to be preserved even in moments of the intensest passion . But there are some few things of which selfabandonment is the prime essence . It would seem as if the tarantella , which is supposed to result in absolute fainting , might be one of these . - The Hay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a song that we somehow can not help rather May , liking . It is insignificant enough , and reminds one of the late lamented Mr. iDempster , but it sounds genuine and unforced . The last three bars of the last verse strike us as unnecessary , and as weakening the general effect of the song . - George Osgood 's The Lake and the Lily ' has much delicate beauty in it , but we think it tends too much to sameness . The fifth and sixth measures from the end , however , are susceptible of being made very effective by good singing . Gounod himself could not have written sweeter harmony .. - Joachim Raff 's Impromptu Valse ( Op. 94 ) for the piano-forte8 only shows how sure of his reputation the composer must be to allow himself to flood the market as he does with very second-rate compositions . We see little to recommend this waltz as music , but it might be made good use of as a study . It is well put upon the instrument .

There is great outlay and pride in school buildings in the West , the most extraordinary example of this being in Omaha , Nebraska . The superintendent of Indiana , however , warns against large school-houses , thinking that " as a rule five or six hundred pupils are enough for one building . " The superintendent of Iowa also complains of mistakes and waste in building . Co-education , from the district school to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only exceptions to it being in private or denominational schools , principally Catholic and Episcopalian . The status of the public schools varies as much in the Western as it does in the New England States . In Michigan , Wisconsin , Illinois , and Kansas , they seem to he comparatively in advance , and the Territories of Utah and Colorado are following after them . But in Indiana , Minnesota , Missouri , and Iowa , the standard is low . Owing to the immense German population of the West , German is taught in many localities as one of the regular branches , hut we do not find that anywhere sewing ( or any industrial art ) , drawing , or music is taught by state law . Indiana has the largest school-fund of any State , hut her schools Ceem ahout on a level with those of Vermont , and the people not more interested or liberal toward them . School grounds are entirely neglected , and there is great lack of everything that decent school-houses require . There is no general high-school system , and neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taught in the public schools . The state of things in Minnesota is very similar : neither ancient nor modern languages are taught even in the normal schools ; the sciences and general history are almost entirely ignored in them , and in that at Markato only a " brief United States history** is taught during the first out of six terms . " The intellectual condition of those who resort to this institution to prepare for the work of teaching is a sad commentary upon the character of our schools as a whole . Vagueness and superficiality seem to he the order of the day . " The University of Minnesota , " pending its rise into college rank 's ! ( as says the report ) , instead of setting its standard and expecting the schools to come up to it , " begins where the schools leave off , " and thus has had to perform the work of the high school since its foundation . Tired 637 of this r51e , the unfortunate institution is now speculating how to get students properly prepared for a college course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already seen strenuously condemned in the State of New York ; that , namely , of state aid to private academies . It is a tonching fact to know , however , and tells one what the struggle for education is in these young States , that out of two hundred and seventy-eight students of the university , one hundred and fifty-eight are dependent wholly or partly on their own earnings . In Missouri there are over one hundred and fifty thousand children who could not go to school if they wished to do so , from want of school room . Only four months of school annually are now provided by law . County superintendents are so hampered and ill-paid that the office has not been efficient , and at the date of this report popular feeling was threatening to abolish it . The schools suffer from changing the boards of directors too often , and the state superintendent is borne down by the burden of office work . The greater part of the teachers in the rural districts are farmers who possess a limited education and whom " it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All the aim they have in view is to get through the book , ' and as to a knowledge of their subjects , they do n't seem to know that they are doing anything more than stuffing a gourd with cotton . " Superintendents are sometimes so lazy , or so incapable of examining teachers as to their qualifications , that perhaps an entire stranger will be asked some such question as " Can you make a wooden nutmeg l " and a certificate will be granted without further inquiry ! The device of one board of directors for rousing up their teachers is rather funny . They abolished the teacher 's chair , and congratulate themselves that the pedagogues being kept on their feet , their wits also are more active . The best friends of the education of the colored people are said to be the old slave masters . The negroes prefer the teachers of their own race , but at present there are not enough of these to supply their schools . There is considerable prejudice in Missouri against women teachers , and the men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superintendent thinks " that for the majority of the schools they make the best teachers , and the same amount of money will produce better teaching talent among women than men . " In St. Louis the women // Education . principals receive the same salaries as men for the same grade of school . In Iowa the school population increased in 1872-73 hy 29,062 persons , hut school attendance decreased 7522 , while the number of persons attending private schools in the same year rose from 6163 to 12,132 - figures which show some very unusual state of things , for the general rule is that the public schools are gaining , and the private schools losing , all the time . There are no normal schools in the State , and no highschool system . Consequently , inefficient teachers are the rule , and teachers ' institutes are " much set hy . " Teachers are required to pass an examination in physiology , hut as yet it is taught only in the graded schools , or in about one in twenty . No general history is required for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States history are absurdly superficial . In Kansas the school system is promising , and the local superintendents seem to he wide-awake and energetic . One of them actually wishes the study of our national history and constitution to he made compulsory , and another , that the children he taught to " fear God and speak the truth " ! This State is so afflicted with the text-hooks which her children have brought with them from all parts of the Union , that she is talking of the Maine plan of the text-hooks being owned by the town . The superintendent is anxious to have drawing introduced , and the report eulogizes women teachers . " They attach more importance to the improvement of morals , and pay more attention to cleanliness than the men . When the mind of the child has gone astray , they will lead it hack into the right path more gently and more successfully than men . " The University and the Agricultural College of Kansas are both open to women , and in the latter they are taught sewing and dressmaking , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that cooking had not come first l ) In the high-school course the historical instruction covers two school years , which is nearly twice the time that most other high schools vouchsafe to it . Mathematics , however , are pressed upon the scholar from the beginning to the end of the course , and botany and zoology are brought in only at the end , thus imitating the colleges in making studies which involve perception and memory come after those which require reason and reflection . " An increase of nearly twelve thousand children of school May , age in one year shows plainly that Nebraska is rapidly filling up with actual settlers , and an increase of three hundred and eighty-six good , substantial school-houses conclusively proves that these settlers bring with them intelligence and enterprise . " But many of the earlier school-houses are entirely destitute of the necessary conveniences and decencies . The superintendent dwells upon the benefit of neat and pleasant school-rooms , and is anxious to have teachers chosen who , both by precept and by example , can teach morals and manners . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the knowledge of scientific truths . I consider them a greater means of happiness and success in life than all the learning hidden in ten thousand hooks . " At the same time he urges increased facilities for study . At present , the state university has its own preparatory school , and in the six years ' course laid down for the two , the study of history holds an almost inappreciable place . In Michi , , an the interest in the public schools is said to he " marked and universal . " She is called the " Massachusetts of the West " in educational matters , and certainly they are alike in paying less to their women teachers , in proportion to the men , than any other States in the Union . Though her school attendance is greater , however , Michigan has only one normal school to six in Massachusetts . In Detroit , drawing is taught in the public schools , hut it is said that only three eighths of the school population of that city attend school . One of the local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Could I say as much for my brethren in the profession , no comparison would he necessary . " The superintendent of Grand Rapids has a suggestion which we have never before seen . It is that each teacher should have but thirty scholars instead of fifty or sixty , and that she should not only try to do them good in school , hut also become acquainted with their parents , and use her influence with the latter to prevent irregular attendance , truancy , and all immoral conduct at any time . Under the influence of her enlightened superintendent , lion . Newton Bateman , who in his turn seems to have been stimulated hy the example of Mr. Harris , of St. Louis , Illinois has the honor of being the first State in the Union to make the study of the elements of the natural sciences - z. e. , botany , zoiilogy , natural philosophy , physi // Education . ology , and hygiene - compulsory throughout her schools . The testimony of Mr. Harris was that the effect in a single year , in St. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week in natural science had been to increase the general efficiency and power of the teachers in that city at least fifty per cent . Similarly says Mr. Bateman : " Never before has such a spectacle been presented to the people of Illinois . From the time the new law was fairly promulgated , in April last L1872 , till the schools opened iu the autumn , the whole State became , as it were , one great camp of instruction , and everywhere great numbers of teachers were assiduously engaged in preparing themselves for examination in the elements of natural science . " In October " the number of teachers who passed a successful examination was 3114 , which added to those who were previously qualified made the total number of teachers in line on the new branches , for the first day of school , at ) out one fifth of the entire teachia* force of the State . " From the local reports we do not glean much concerning the state of the schools iu Illinois , the most striking remark in them being one from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pupils under twelve are remarkably intelligent , after that age they seem to become altogether dulled and lifeless . He pronounces it a delusion , inculcated by educational platform speakers , that children can learn without study , and says that before the teacher can " draw out " something from the child 's mind , he must first " pound in . " In Wisconsin the number of children reported as attending private schools in 1872 was 18,020 , and in 1873 , but 9581 , while the public scbools gained largely in excess of the addition to the school population . The superintendent urges the introduction of the natural sciences into the public schools , after the example of Illinois and St. Louis . The reports presented at the annual meeting of the State Teachers ' Association exhibit an unusual amount of earnestness and thought . They recommend that the superintendents of county schools should have a plan of correspondence with each teacher and school , instead of trusting to visits " few and far between ; " that they should encourage the permanence of good teachers " by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt in tangible reward ; " that drawing should be taught in the public schools throughout the State ; 639 and that the state university should have a thoroughly equipped art department , and also departments in journalism and pedagogics , and that an appropriate denree should be conferred after a course in the latter , in order " to secure for teaching a public recognition as a profession . " We note with alarm , however , among the committees appointed for 1874 , one on the " reform of spelling . " We trust that the scholars and philologists of America will take warning in time , and not let this maggot of phonetic spelling get into the pedagogical brain , and so history be hunted from our many-voiced English tongue , as it already has been from the school-room . The visitors to the three normal schools of the State , contrary to the usual practice of visitors , really do criticise those institutions . At the Oshkosh Normal School , for instance , they avow the conviction that instructing third-grade teachers merely in the common branches which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breadth of thought , but tends to narrowness and bigotry . " In California the truancy and non-attendance is forty per cent. , to nine per cent . in Connecticut , and the superintendent is urgent for a compulsory law . He devotes many pages to the subject of trained teachers . " No wonder , " he says , " that the attention paid to the manners and morals of the pupils is so unsatisfactory , when the manners of the teacher are never inquired into , and his morals are sufficient if he has not been guilty of any gross or notorious violation of the decalogue . " The superintendent finds the only remedy to be that every teacher should pass through a normal school , and he thinks that California could get a thousand such teachers in one year from other States , if only she would offer " wages " enough , which is a wild idea indeed . By the way , we do not like the speakin' of the salaries of teachers as " wa , , es , " which is so common throughout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to degrade the office in popular estimation to the level of the mechanic or the domestic servant . The superintendeimt of San Fraiicisco reports that the examination papers of the schools of that city for several years past " have shown conclusively that while many pupils are well up in definitions . parsian , and analysis , comparatively few are able to write English with even a tolerahle de*ree of accuracy or elegance ; " facts which are , doubtless , as true for the whole country as for his locality . The new law // for the choosing of school directors in San Francisco provides for their election at large from the whole city , instead of their being chosen from each separate district . The special interest of this lies in the fact that it is the first experiment we have heard of in the simplest or " natural " form of proportional representation . The principle of it is simply that of the unit of our form of government , i. a. , the commune or village , in which each memher of the community casts one vote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular office , and the one who gets the highest number of votes is the one elected . When school coinmittees , aldermen , and members of the city councils are thus chosen at large from our cities , and members of the state legislatures and of Congress at large from our States , the American republic will at last rest on those foundations of common sense and ancient precedent upon which it should have originally been hased . The district and ward system for our heterogeneous population is the real source of our political corruption , and of our inahility to bring our best men to the front . - Dr. Calderwood 's little essay ' was suggested by considerations which occurred to him as an officer under the new Education Act , hy which the public-school system of Edinhurgh was made to conform somewhat to the systems of Prussia and America .

He sees clearly enough the tendency of organized school systems to run to seed in a dull routine , and he finds the remedy where it must he found , in the living teacher ; we think he is somewhat disposed to underestimate the power of general discipline over the individual scholar , and to credit the teacher of a large class with more opportunity for individual training than he is likely to possess , hut with the principles of the essay we are in hearty accord . There is one passage in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Taking now a somewhat wider survey of the requirements of our national life , a teacher 's attention would need to be turned to our prevailing national vices , and the best means for fortifying the young against them . Early school life should do much to guard against the rudeness and coarseness which turn domestic life to bitterness , and prepare the way for outbreaks of violence . A constant stream of refining influence should flow through the minds of the pupils . Everything favorable in the reading-hook , in history , or in the incidents of the schoolroom , should be utilized for this end .
