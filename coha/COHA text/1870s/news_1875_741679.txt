txt Within the past season , a well-known estate on the Upper Hudson , beautifully situated and carefully laid out , which cost the owner $100,000 , was sold for less than the mortgage upon it , or for $30,000 . As the traveler sails up the Hudson beyond Newburg he will , within a short distance , see three fine properties , one of which belonged to a British Ambassador , another to one of our own foreign Ministers , and the other to an equally prominent person , all of which are in the market , unsalable and unrentable , one , indeed , being turned into a brick-yard . Passing still further up the stately river , the traveler will be pointed to other splendid properties belonging to old manorial estates ? some whose titles came from the British crown , and others whose deeds were signed by the Indian chiefs  --  now utterly worthless as sources of profit , the expenses of keeping them up exceeding any rent possible for them , and they themselves not finding a buyer at the price of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be remarked , are among the finest in the Northern States , with handsome lawns and gardens , old trees and parks , and superb views of river and mountain . The houses themselves are perhaps old , but not uncomfortable , and they arc easy of access by boat and . railroad . The same state of things prevails further from the river There is one place in Dutchess County , which is said to have cost $250,000 , and which could not be rented , and probably not sold , for a third of its value . In the interior of the State there are numerous other estates iu the same plight . In fact , one of the poorest properties to hold . now is a first-class villa and grounds more than sixty miles from New-York or not near any large town . Are we , then , becoming more indifferent to rural life than our ancestors if There is no lack of taste and love for rural pursuits among our people . The ideal of many a hard-working business man is a farm or a villa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ou which to plant or experiment agriculturally . Moreover , there are plenty who would gladly take the position of the country gentleman , or live as did our manor landlords fifty years ago . The difficulties , however , in the way of a comfortable country . life of this kind are manifold , and such as finally discourage all concerned . To make country life of value , it must be continued through the year . The family must be recognized as a fixture ; as part and parcel of the neighborhood . There must be country society ; not merely visiting from city friends . But to a Winter residence in a lonely " manor-house , " there is first the great obstacle of procuring good servants . These are willing enough to spend the Summer months there , ( provided a Catholic Church be near , ) but at the first approach of Autumn frosts , they flit to the city . Then life is made miserable by the hunt for servants and the disorder resulting from it . Then , in all our village districts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before snow has come , or early in the Spring , traveling is very difficult , and party giving almost impossible . Country houses , too , have not the modern improvements in the perfection to which we are accustomed . Markets are far away , and luxuries not easily obtained . But worst of all , the villa residents miss their concerts and opera , and all the busy and social life of the city in Winter . There is , in fact , very little social life anywhere in our country districts'outside of villages and . towns ; - villa owners depend on society from a distance . People must now have their pleasures and luxuries all . the year round . They can get them at watering-places , o ; within fifty miles of a capital , or in a European journey ; but they can not in remote " Manorial estates . " Hence they are abandoning these and residing nearer large cities , or taking their rural pleasures in a rougher way .               @ @ @ @ @ @
