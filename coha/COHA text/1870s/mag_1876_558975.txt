ART . V. - LAW IN AMERICA , 1776 - 1876 . OF all the varied methods of viewing and discussing the character and extent of our national progress , the one which , in many important respects , is the most deserving of serious attention is that which directs us to the consideration of the development of American jurisprudence . The idea of law must be the one which underlies and affects , to a greater or less degree , all other ideas of popular life , and which imperatively demands investigation at the hands of any one who is seeking to get an impression , at once comprehensive and accurate , of the progress of civilization in any age or nation . The history of the jurisprudence of a country must always , of course , be one of the co-ordinates by reference to which we are to measure the direction and extent of national progression or retrogression . Religion , literature , the mechanical arts , the fine arts , science , manners , and dress may all furnish tests by which the inclination of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be determined ; but as none of these have such a practical , universal , and important bearing upon their daily life and daily relations as their system of laws , so none of them can be so safely consulted for the purpose of solving the problems of national life . It is to the *jurisprudence of a people that we must especially look , if w* wish to ascertain // the character of their civilization ; and it is therefore to the jurisprudence of the United States of America that we must turn if we wish to be able to say , truthfully and intelligently , whether the great Republic has or has not made real progress during its hundred years of life . The general method of dealing with this subject might be twofold . On the one hand we might consider the advances which law in this country has made in comparison with English law , travelling along the same paths and in the same general directions . That is to say , taking those numerous branches of jurisprudence in which the American has adhered ( in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system , we might institute a comparison between the advances made by the two . In considering the subject in this light we would look , not to those cases in which the American has departed from the English law , but rather to those in which travelling ( so to speak ) side by side the one has outstripped , or fallen behind , the other . The question , in such a method of investigation , would always be : In which country has the development been most healthful and proper ? We would study to find out , not what new ideas have had their birth upon this side of the Atlantic , but whether , in the first place , old ideas have been improved upon at all , and , if so , to what degree . For example : The idea of modifying the common-law rule by which the husband became the owner , or acquired the right of becoming the owner of the wife 's personal property , and of securing the enjoyment and control of that property to the wife , is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took practical shape in the creation , by courts of equity , of what was known as the separate use of married women . But in America , before many years in the life of the Republic had passed by , this idea not only appeared in the English chancery dress , but became , also , the subject of statutory enactment , and hence the passage of the numerous " Married Women 's Acts " in nearly all the States of the Union . The fundamental principle already existed , and was being applied in both countries ; but while the two systems of jurisprudence were advancing along the same highway and in the same general direction , the American was placed many steps in advance of the // English system by the aid of positive legislation , and the gap , notwithstanding recent enactments in England , has not been quite closed up . Nevertheless , as has been said , the general direction of legal progress , upon this point , has been the same on both sides of the Atlantic . It was admitted , in both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to some extent , the property of a married woman ought to be her own , and the only question was as to the best means of attaining this result . In England the indisposition to statutory reform in law forced the courts ( or , at all events , one set of the courts , those , namely , of equity jurisdiction ) to redress the grievance , as such it undoubtedly was . With us the tendency towards reformation by legislation led to the adoption of the other method of remedying the evil ; and we shall see , further on , that this method of attaining the desired end was in accordance with the American tendency to a fondness for legislation which has developed itself , in such a striking manner , during the last fifty years . It can not be asserted , however , that except in the method of carrying out the reform , there has been , in this instance , any development of a feature distinctively and characteristically American . On the other hand a still more striking and interesting topic is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principles ; and the cases here presented would be those in which , from circumstances which it ought to be the task of the student to discover and explain , American jurisprudence has found the rules of English law unsuited to the conditions of American life , has therefore repudiated or modified them , and has established a set of legal rules which may be termed essentially and properly American . This latter view of the general subject is one which would seem to present the greatest attractions to the student , and one which would , with the greatest propriety , be considered the most interesting and instructive at this period of the national existence , when we are occupied in looking for , pointing out , and discussing those features in the different relations of life which are often grouped together under the somewhat vague term of American institutions . Both methods , however , of dealing with the general subject will have to be , to a certain extent , adopted ; and in // endeavoring to find out what are the peculiarities of American law which have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother country , and which tend to give our jurisprudence a national individuality , we shall be compelled to touch upon some points in which the American has advanced beyond , or fallen behind , English law in paths which are common to both . It is a trite remark and one which has been made at many different times and with varying phraseology , that all law is the adaptation of principles of action to the physical and political conditions of a country and to its moral , social , and intellectual growth . All national institutions must bear the impress of the outward features of nature by which the inhabitants are surrounded and their modes of life , to a great extent , determined , and must also reflect the inward life of a nation and the external associations and internal consciousness by which that inward life has been moulded . If we were to imagine a man placed , in a savage state , in a new country , and were at liberty to suppose that his individual existence could be sufficiently prolonged to enable him to reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and enlightenment , it would seem to be plain that the causes which control this development and determine its character must be sought for , in the first place , in the external physical phenomena by which he was surrounded . Whether he were active or slothful , hardy or effeminate , bold or timid , prudent or reckless , and , so on , would depend , to a measurable degree , upon the inclemency or mildness , the ruggedness or softness , the sterility or fertility , which belonged to the climate , scenery , and soil of the country where he lived . In the next place the nature of the society in which he was thrown , the character of the human beings among whom he was placed , and the events in his history , would enter into the determination of the character of the development . And , finally , his intellectual life , when it came into play ( its nature determined by the food upon which it had fed ) , would make itself felt in its contribution to the general sum of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are three great causes which control and guide the character of national development , - first , phys // ical ; second , political , historical , or social ; and , third , intellectual : for every man must be regarded , first , as a dweller upon the earth ; secondly , as a citizen or social being ; and , thirdly , as a reasoning being ; and it is to the causes which control his life in each of these three aspects that we must look to discover why any one particular side of his life has assumed any particular shape . And this is true in respect to nearly all institutions*- religion , art , literature , and so on . Mr. Buckle has very well and forcibly pointed out how the physical phenomena by which a people are surrounded influence their religious belief , rendering them more or less sceptical or superstitious , as the case may be ; and he has pointed out the further fact that such circumstances as religion , literature , and law are the results , rather than the causes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are to be found either in external influences or in internal mental action . Now , as external influences may . come either from inanimate nature or from men with whom we associate , it follows that the external influences may be divided into those which are due to nature ( in the sense of the inanimate creation ) and to society ; so that this view is substantially the same as that which is here suggested , inasmuch as it asserts that the causes of all human progress must be found in nature , in society , and in internal mental action . if this is so , then the development of American law , whether considered in respect to its departures from the law of the mother country , or in respect of its advances upon that law , must be sought for , first , in the physical features of the United States ; secondly , in its political or social history ; and , lastly , in the intellectual life of the people . The obvious truth must , just here , be borne in mind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down amid new influences , the traditions of the old life which they have left necessarily cling to them for a shorter or a longer period , and that the new influences may sometimes make themselves felt but slowly . Colonists adhere with no little affection and tenacity to the institutions of the mother coun* try , and the effect of influences , which would otherwise be rapid , becomes necessarily tardy when their growth involves // the destruction of old modes of thought , as well as the establishment of new . Hence it is that , in considering the development of American law , it may be not unfrequently found that the results which would otherwise have promptly fol-. lowed , have been in many instances retarded by an involuntary adherence to the English laws which the colonists brought over with them . We pass from these preliminary observations to the first of the divisions suggested by the general treatment of the subject indicated above . The differences between the physical or geographical peculiarities of England and of this country are numerous , varied , and striking . England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ features of which are on a small scale , and whose resources , upon which its vast population must depend for support , are of such a character and of so limited an extent as to require to he constantly and carefully husbanded . Its greatest river is but a puny stream compared with the vast water-courses of the Western continent ; its waste and vacant lands of a comparatively limited area ; its forests the objects of jealous cpre ; and its mines , though great and rich , yet of a measurable extent . Population is dense ; labor cheap ; wealth unequally distributed . Turning , on the other hand , to our own country , we find a continent of almost boundless area , irrigated , in every direction , by streams of enormous magnitude ; with a mineral wealth which is almost illimitable , and a population in all quarters ( at least at the date of the separation from the British Crown ) extremely sparse . Land was cheap ; roads few ; timber so abundant as to be something which was to be got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be looked upon as a subject for protection . The physical differences between the two countries have been and are , in short , enormous ; and the conditions of life in which the two peoples have found themselves thrown have been , in many instances , as wide as the poles asunder . A priori , therefore , * these great geographical differences should have had a very considerable effect upon the development of the legal institutions of the two // countries ; and accordingly we find that almost every one of these great differences noted above have been , in fact , productive of peculiarities in American legal principles . One of the most important of these differences between American and English law , due to the geographical peculiarities of our continent , and one which may therefore be selected as a convenient illustration of this branch of the subject , is that which is based upon the character of our great rivers , and the consequent inapplicability of the English test of the ebb and flow of the tide as determining what streams are and what are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be regarded as navigable waters . This distinction , based upon a physical difference , is of importance in two ways : first , in determining the right of riparian owners ; and , secondly , as defining the extent of the jurisdiction of the Federal courts in admiralty causes . It will be useful to give a brief notice to each of these two heads , and to occupy some little space in the consideration of this rather dry suW ject . It is well known that , at common law , a navigable river was technically defined to be one in which the tide ebbs and flows . This definition was first laid down in the case of the Royal Fishery of the River Banne ( Davies 's Reports , 149 ) , and is stated to be the law in the work De Jure Mans et Brachiorum , which has been generally recognized as the authoritative treatise upon this subject . It has , indeed , been doubtcd whether even in England the ebb and flow of the tide is to be regarded as the only test of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Houck , of the St. Louis bar , has pointed out the fact that the generally received opinion upon this subject is possibly erroneous , and that it is a mistake to suppose that the sole test of navigability in England was the flux and reflux of the tide . According to this writer , the true test in England would be public user ; and that when such user exists the stream must be considered navigable in law , independently of the question of tides . It must be observed , however , that the most recent English treatises in which the subject is noticed ( Hunt on Boundaries , p. 16 ; Hall on the Sea-Shore , edition of 1875 , by Loveland , pp. 4 , 13 ) , the ebb and flowof the tide is still considered // a test of navigability , and the conclusions of Mr. buck should probably be received with some caution . The question is not material for the purpose of the present examination , for it is undoubtedly true as an historical fact that , heretofore , in judicial reasoning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it has been assumed that such was the test of the English law , and it is from this principle ( whether correctly or in correctly ascribed to English jurisprudence ) that certain of the American 3ourts , as we are about to mention , have taken their departure . It resulted from the English rule that the ownership of riparian proprietors was held to extend to the middle of the stream ; and this view of the rights of riparian owners , under the geographical features in this respect which existed in England , worked no injustice . But in the United States most of the great rivers are actually navigable far above tide water ; and to apply the conclusion of the English law in reference to the rights of riparian owners would , under such a condition of things , be productive of great injustice . Hence in many of the States of the Union the English test has been discarded , and the navigability in law of rivers has been held to depend upon navigability in fact ; and hence , as a corollary to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those streams which were in fact navigable the rights of riparian owners were limited by the shore , and did not extend ad medium filum aquw . It is interesting to notice , on the one hand , the common-sense departure from the English rule in some States , and , on the other , the difficulty with which inherited law ( so to speak ) has been shaken off . The earliest case in which the English doctrine upon this subject was repudiated , as being inapplicable to the physical features of this country , was Carson v. Blazer ( 2 Binney , 475 ) , decided by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in 1810 . In this case the plaintiff claimed an exclusive right of fishing . in the Susquehanna River , opposite land owned by him ; and the contention in favor of the enjoyment of this right was expressly based upon the fact that the Susquehanna was not a tide-water river , and that consequently , according to the rules // of the common law , the ownership of riparian proprietors extended to the middle of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party , opposite the . plaintiff 's land , was an infringement of this right . But Chief Justice Tilghman declined to be governed by this argument , and took the broad and common-sense view , that the size and character of freshwater rivers ( such as the Susquehanna ) , in this country , rendered the English rule totally inapplicable ; in other words , the general proposition was recognized that the rules of the common law which had been , in general , adopted must necessarily , in certain cases , be modified by the geographical conformations of the country . This modification of the common-law doctrine has been recognized by the Supreme Court of the United States , and especially in the comparatively recent case of The Daniel Ball , decided in 1870 , and reported in 10 Wallace , 557 . The facts of the case were these : The Act of Congress of July 7 , 1838 , provides , in its second section , that it shall not be lawful for the owner , master , or captain of any vessel , propelled in whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or passengers upon the " bays , lakes , rivers , or other navigable waters of the United States , " after a certain date , without a license , with a proviso for the recovery of a penalty and the forfeiture of the vessel , in case of such violation . The Daniel Ball , a vessel propelled by steam , was engaged in navigating Grand River , in the State of Michigan , between the cities of Grand Rapids and Grand Haven , without a license , and it was to recover the penalty , consequent upon the alleged violation of the aforesaid act of Congress , that this action was brought . The libel described Grand River as a " navigable water of the United States " ; and the answer , inter alia , denied that the said river was such a navigable water . It was admitted in the argument , on behalf of the libelled vessel , that the term " navigable water " included " not simply the tide waters , as is understood by it In England , but also the great fresh-water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in a still broader sense , the term was applicable to every stream or body of water susceptible of being made , in its natural condition , a highway for commerce . But it was contended that // the term was used in contradistinction to domestic waters , and implied a capacity in the stream , in reference to which it was used , for the carrying on of commerce between States . The Supreme Court , however , held that the term " navigable river** was applicable to Grand River ; and the opinion of Mr. Justice Field is useful , in the present connection , not so much in laying down the law that the navigability of a stream , within the meaning of the act of Congress , does not depend upon the circumstance that the stream may or may not furnish the means of intercommunication between States , but as giving an expression to the views entertained by the highest tribunal of the country as to the original test of navigability prescribed by the law of England , and as to the applicability , or rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the United States . " The doctrine of the common law , as to the navigability of waters , " say the court , " has no application to this country . here the ebb and flow of the tide do not constitute the usual test , as in England , or any test at all , of the navigability of waters . There no waters are navigable in fact , or at least to any considerable extent , which are not subject to the tide , and from this circumstance tide water and navigable water there signify , substantially , the same thing . But in this country the case is widely different . " * In some States the law upon this subject has been subject to very considerable fluctuations . Such has been the case in New York , where , however , the rule seems to have been at last settled in favor of what may be termed the American doctrine ; and also in South Carolina , where one or two recent decisions appear to be in conflict with the anti-common-law rule established in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , upon this point , be divided into those in which the common-law rule has been adhered to , either by judicial decision or in obedience to some statute , and those in which it has been repudiated . The first class includes nearly all of the New England States , two or three Western States , and , of the Southern States , Mississippi and Virginia . Under the second class are embraced New York , Pennsylvania , many of the Southern , and one or two of the Western States . It is a little singular to remark that // the Supreme Court of Kentucky , in the case of Berry v. Snyder ( 3 Bush , 266 ) , decided in 1867 , applied the commonlaw doctrine to the determination of the rights of riparian owners on the shores of so great a river as the Ohio . In spite , however , of the adherence to the common-law rule in some of the States , and of the fluctuations of the law in others , it may be fairly said that the tendency of American law is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that whenever the question is squarely brought before the courts , the disposition is to admit the force of the argument founded on the physical peculiarities of the country . Passing now to the question of jurisdiction , as affected by the rule now under consideration , we find that in the courts of the United States the common-law doctrine has been distinctly repudiated . By the Constitution of the United Stated the judicial power of the Federal courts was extended to " all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction " ; and in the infancy of the Republic the question was , " What is the extent of the admiralty jurisdiction thus secured to the courts of the United States ? " It was , at first , the universal opinion that this jurisdiction was limited by tide water , and that constitutionally it could not be extended further . But in the great case of The Genessee Chief ( 12 Howard , 457 ) , decided in 1851 , this question was finally set at rest and the doctrine finally established that the " jurisdiction , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wherever ships float and navigation successfully aids commerce , whether internal or external . " It was , in that case , pointed out that the basis of the limitation of the admiralty jurisdiction in England to tide waters was the geographical fact that , in that country , tide water and navigable water were synonymous terms , " and tide water , with a few small and unimportant exceptions , meant nothing more than public rivers , as distinguished from private ones . " And it was further noticed , that the same physical basis for the rule not existing in this country , it would be absurd to apply such a rule where the foundation , whereon it might rest , was wanting ; and that the change of law , in this particular , was but the application of the familiar legal maxim , " ces8ante rations // cessat et ipsa lex . " The decision in the case of The Genessee Chief has been recognized and followed in subsequent authorities , and the departure of American from the English law upon this subject is thoroughly established . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illustration of the effect of the physical features of the country upon the departures of American law from the principles of English jurisprudence ; and some little prominence has been given to this topic , because it is one which has not only received the mature and deliberate consideration of the highest tribunal in the country , but is one also which most suitably illustrates the influence of the geography of a nation upon its laws . Hence it has been selected as typical of the changes which have been produced by this cause . Other examples , however , of this direct influence may be readily pointed out . Thus wl*ile , in England , a tenant for life or the holder of other limited estates was not permitted to cut down timber ( except for reasonable estovers ) , and such destruction was considered waste , and was deemed so grave an offence as to be punishable with forfeiture of the place wasted for the benefit of the remainder-man or reversioner , whose inheritance was supposed to be thereby damnified , in the United States , the dense growth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the clearing away of timber , so far from being an injury to land , was a necessity for its use and development , rendered the application of such a rule absurd . This impossibility of applying the English law of waste has been recognized in most of the courts of this country ; and hence it has been generally held that the cutting down of timber , for the purpose of clearing and cultivation , is to be regarded as a proper use of land by a tenant with a limited estate , and as not constituting that injury to the inheritance which should be cofts'idered , in a technical sense , waste . So also in the case of mines ; while in England the opening of new mines on demised lands is waste at common law , on this side of the Atlantic the tendency is to regard such a user of realty as proper and lawful on the part of one having only a limited estate therein , in cases where the value of the property depends altogether , or very much , upon the min*erals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the discussion of the direct and obvious effects which the geographical characteristics of the country have had upon American law , to the consideration of others of a more indirect and derivative character . A very brief notice of one or two of these indirect effects will serve as illustrations of this part of the subject . And , in the first place , the subjection of lands to the payment of debts , in which American has so much taken the lead of English legislation , while owing in a very great degree to the historical , social , and political associations and institutions of the country must partly , at least , be ' ascribed to the abundance of land . That in some portions of our country there is a certain sacredness which attaches to land , that this feeling is growing ( especially in the Atlantic States ) with the growth of population , and is being fostered even amid the plentiful abundance of land in the West , by " homestead " and " exemption " laws , may be conceded ; but the sentiment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the landowner or even landholder in England feels for acres which have been his and his ancestors , from generation to generation . And in very many parts of the United States no such feeling exists at all ; for in the West , at all events , the facility with which land is obtained detracts very much from the pride of its acquisition , lessens the importance of its possession , and necessarily takes away , in a proportionate degree , from the bitterness of its loss . The man who has seen his predecessors acquire vast tracts by the exercise of a pre-emption right at a nominal figure , and who has , himself , the almost boundless West before him , with the indefinite chance of squatter privileges beyond the limits of civilized settlements , not only lacks any sentiment of attachment to the soil , but is pressed by no practical necessity whereb'y such a sentiment might be produced and fostered . Hence it has followed that the legislation of the American States has tended , with almost universal uniformity , towards the subjection of land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which have only been reached in England during a comparatively recent period were attained in this country from ( it might almost be said ) the earliest times in our colonial history . Of course , this tardi // ness in the English law , and the tenacity with which it clung to the exemption of the land of a decedent from the payment of his debts , were due , in a very great extent , to the influence of ideas derived from the feudal system , and to the constitution of society which that system produced ; and the advances made by American law are to be ascribed in no small degree to the absence of such social influences in this country . But the difference is not , perhaps , to be altogether accounted for by considerations of such a character , and is to be set down , in a very great degree , to the credit of the abundance of real estate , the facility with which it can be acquired and disposed of , and the consequent little value which is attached to it by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partly attributed the facility of alienating land which obtains throughout the United States . It is true that the whole theory of the feudal system was opposed to the easy alienation of real property , and it is equally true that the non-existence of that system in the United States has contributed vastly towards the unfettering of lands and their free transmission from hand to hand ; and therefore it may be said and truthfully said that the departure of American from the English law in this respect is due largely to political and not to geographical causes . But as in England the comparative scarcity of real estate fortified the results which the feudal doctrines had already produced , so in this country the extent and consequent cheapness of land strengthened the anti-feudal feeling to which the social institutions of the country had given birth . In other words , land has , in this country , become an article of commerce , not solely from the absence of those principles of the feudal law which fostered restraints upon alienation , and whose abrogation in this country was due to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extent of the country and from the result which flowed naturally from that fact , namely , that there was produced a " market " for real estate . When real estate became an article of commerce and speculation , when a man bought land , not for the solemn purpose set forth in fee-simple deeds , " to hold to him and his heirs forever , " but with the design of cutting it up into town lots , or founding a real-estate association , or // launching a mining company or a cemetery ; when transactions in this species of property became so rapid and extensive that the title to thousands of acres , worth millions of dollars , passed through scores of owners in a few days or possibly a dozen hours , - it is not to be wondered that the business exigencies of the community forced the law to adapt itself to them , and that the title to land became almost as capable of rapid and informal transmission from hand to hand , as the ownership of a bale of merchandise or the title to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reports of some of our States without being struck with the facility with which " articles of agreement " for the sale of land passed between vendor and purchaser , and answered the purpose of more formal title deeds . The manner in which in Pennsylvania ( for example ) these " articles " ( or rather the title of which they were the evidence ) were sold , pledged , mortgaged , surrendered , assigned , levied upon , and disposed of in every imaginable way , is a forcible illustration of the method in which the wants of a community comp , el a rapid and easy working of legal inachinery ; but , as before stated , this facility for alienation is undoubtedly due , not only to the political , but to the geographical characteristics of the country . We must leave this branch of the general subject with the above hasty illustrations of it . They are sufficient , perhaps , to show the soundness of the proposition already stated , that the external or physical peculiarities of the North American continent have influenced the character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that influence has been , and through what more detailed and intricate ramifications it might be traced , may be readily conjectured ; but such an amplification of the topic must be abandoned , for the purpose of passing to the consideration of the other main heads of the subject . The peculiarities of American law which are due to the political history of the nation , while important , are of a some what obvious and commonplace character ; and it would seem , therefore , to be sufficient to dismiss them with a brief notice . The changes in the common law , affecting private rights , which // have occurred in consequence of the character of the political institutions of America , took place at such an early period in our history , and were so complete and thorough , that they have about them little or nothing of a present progressive nature , and therefore furnish few or no indications of the future tendencies of American jurisprudence . It is undoubtedly true that the political institutions of the country have had an effect , and a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American intellect ; and as this intellectual development has made itself felt in jurisprudence , and has given to it some of the peculiarities by which it is distinguished from the jurisprudence of England or of the nations of the European Continent , it is therefore also true , as a necessary corollary , that these political institutions have thus had a very great indirect , as well as direct , effect upon jurisprudence . But as this effect has been produced through the medium of the intellectual life of the nation , it will be proper to reserve its consideration until that branch of the general subject is reached . At present , we have to do with one or two obvious and direct consequences which followed from the political history of the country . When the political structure , then , of American society was altered by the Revolution and by the subsequent establishment of the Constitution of the United States , the effect of the change was to produce certain modifications of the rules of law in regard to private rights which the change in the form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , expedient . Not that these changes in the law of private rights were due solely to the Revolution and to the establishment of the present form of government , for they may , in many instances , be traced to ideas which flourished in the Colonies during the ante-Revolutionary period ; and these ideas were themselves the outgrowth of changed political conditions which had existed from very early periods in colonial history . Accordingly we find that , in several cases , the modifications of the common law which grew out of peculiarities in the political condition of the American people can be traced to causes which were in existence prior to the separation of the Colonies from the British crown . // Jan . Of these modifications one of the first , the most natural , and the most important which took place , was that which abrogated the third c*on of descent in the English law , the right of primogeniture . The whole spirit of the institutions of this country was so much opposed to the doctrine , it was so contrary to that principle of equality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was abrogated from very early times . The influence of the doctrine did not , however , immediately disappear . The law of primogeniture prevailed in some of the Colonies until the Revolution , and even for several years after that date the eldest son was in many of the States distinguished by a right to receive a double portion ; and this right , which was spoken of as being " according to the law of nature and the dignity of birthright , " was not abolished until several years after the Revolution . Thus , such was the law of Pennsylvania until 1794 , and in Connecticut until 1792 . Estates tail lingered in some States for many years afterwards ; and , while ordinary fees descended to all children equally , a limitation was still capable of being made by which real estate would descend to the eldest son , in obedience to the statute of Westminster II. , and " according to the form of the gift . " The influence of American political institutions , however , has nearly altogether done away with these lingering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of nearly all the States of the Union have , under this influence , reached a state of uniformity upon this branch of the law of descents . Another of the English canons of descent was also abolished , namely , that which required title by descent to be derived from a person last seized . This rule was of purely feudal origin . The whole system of the enjoyment and transmission of real estate according to the early English law was , as is well known , based upon the idea that it was a gift to the fendatory by the lord . The gift was in the earliest times for life only ; and even where the gift came subsequently to be made to one and his heirs , the heir was originally considered as taking rather by the immediate bounty of the donor , by which he had been included in the gift , than by any transmission of title from his deceased ancestor . One form of this prevailing idea continued to exist in copyhold lands , where upon every fresh // descent the heir did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the lord of the manor . Now . it was considered . as the lord 's privilege to know who was going to hold the fee , as it was his right to see that no one intruded therein who was not a person fit and likely to perform the necessary services of tenure . Investiture by the lord was the solemn declaration that the party receiving it had been selected as tenant . The maxim that required the heir to trace his descent to the person last seized was , therefore , simply a substitution for the rite of investiture ; for where this could be shown , the ancestor having received the actual gift from the lord , and assumed the position of tenant , the heir also was supposed to be in by virtue of the same gift and with the lord 's sanction . This rule was obviously entirely out of place in the conditions of life in which the people of America have found themselves . Accordingly it may be said to have been universally abandoned ; in some instances ( as in New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others having been accomplished by virtue of the common law of the State . The two examples which have been given from the English canons of descent are , perhaps , sufficient illustrations of the mode in which the political history of the country has modified the laws relating to private rights . As has been already stated , the change in such particulars has been complete and decisive , and furnishing as it does little or no suggestions for future reformation in jurisprudence , may be profitably abandoned for the consideration of a more interesting subject . We have seen how the physical features of the North American continent have influenced the development of the jurisprudence of this country , and have produced in it departures from the English system ; and we have also noticed , with great brevity , how similar results have followed from the change in the social and political circumstances of the country which had its rise in the early periods of the colonial annals , and which culminated in the great historical events of the latter part of the eighteenth century . There still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most interesting side of the present subject , namely , the effect produced upon American // law by the development of the intellectual portion of the American character . In examining the effect produced upon the laws of our land by its geography and history we have found , in most instances , that the character of this effect was that some common-law rule or principle , which was or was thought to be , inapplicable , was abrogated , and a new and in many cases totally different principle or rule substituted in its place . On the other hand , in considering that portion of the progress of American law which is due to our intellectual life , we shall find that this progress has sometimes displayed itself in the invention or creation of new ideas , and sometimes in the ingrafting of reforms upon old ones . This general branch of the subject , therefore , embraces not so much those cases in which the peculiarities of American law are developed , as those in which American jurisprudence has shown the twofold spirit of originality and of reformation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of originality , and that this originality is due rather to internal or mental causes than to those which are external or physical , can not be doubted . American philosophy affected American law . The studies of men who in the infancy of the Republic guided political events , the bent of their intellects , the philosophical doctrines which they imbibed , and the modes of thought which they brought to the consideration of the problems of government which were then presented to them , necessarily made themselves felt in guiding the direction and controlling the extent of the advances of American jurisprudence , and necessarily also produced what may be justly termed an American intellect which had qualities and characteristics peculiarly its own and not borrowed from European mental growth . To examine the subject thoroughly would require a profound and prolonged study of the movement of European philosophy in the eighteenth century , and of the effect which this movement had upon the American Revolution ; but even a cursory and somewhat superficial glance will be fruitful of suggestions of no common interest and , possibly , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and perhaps earlier , the // American mind had acquired ideas upon ( among other things ) the science of government which appear to be of indigenous growth . Certainly they can not be traced , with any distinctness and accuracy , to any intellectual influence coming from England or from France . A great writer has pointed out and commented upon this fact . After speaking of the general activity of human thought in the eighteenth century , M. Guizot says : " The popular sciences soared upwards , and still higher than the sciences mounted the philosophical spirit of the age , - haughty and self-willed , aspiring to pervade everything and to regulate everything . Without excitement , without commotion , - rather by yielding itself to its natural bent , than by forcing itself into new paths , - Anglo-America took its place in this grand movement . " What was this " natural bent " of the Anglo-American mind ? What place did it seek to take for itself in this grand intellectual movement ? That American philosophy had a vigor which was essentially original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tendencies of European thought , were not borrowed directly from European sources , may be shown by reference to one or two familiar examples . Thus , in criminal jurisprudence the American mind has always been far in advance of the English in the enlightened character and originality of its views . The experiment of substituting hard labor for capital punishment was tried at an early period in Pennsylvania , and was recommended by Jefferson and his co-revisors of the Virginia code in 1779 ; and the seeds of reform in criminal law , sown at an early date , have borne most luxuriant harvests . A. still more striking illustration of the originality and progressiveness of American philosophical jurisprudence is found in the early legislation upon the subject of public education . In Connecticut , as early as 1672 , it was enacted that every township which numbered fifty householders should forthwith appoint one within the town " to teach all such children as shall resort to him to write and read , whose wages shall be paid either by the parents or masters of such children , or by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the major part of those who order the prudentials of the town shall appoint . " Early in the succeeding century additional legislation took // place in the same State , whereby it was prescribed that schools should be kept open for eleven months in the year , and a tax for their support was directed to be levied . Well might Zephaniah Swift say , " Did I know the name of the legislator who first conceived and suggested the idea , I should pay to his memory the highest tribute of reverence and regard I feel a pride to think that my country has been enriched by such a noble discovery . " In other ages and in other nations , by great writers and profound thinkers , in Rome , in England , and in France , by Quintilian , by Locke , and by Rousseau , had educational systems been thought over in the recesses of philosophical minds and brought to light for the benefit of mankind . But they were systems for the rich and patrician , not for the poor and plebeian ; and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practical as well as liberal , brought down this boon from the region of speculation and applied it , through the machinery of statute law , to the direct and practical amelioration of mankind . These , however , are but passing illustrations of the originality of American thought in jurisprudence . The great fact in the progress of American jurisprudence which deserves special notice and reflection is its tendency towards organic statute law and towards the systematizing of law ; in other words , towards written constitutions and codification . It is well known that the spirit of free inquiry ( which was the characteristic spirit of the eighteenth century ) was , on the other side of the Atlantic , of a theoretical rather than a practical character , arid that the men by whose writings it was illustrated and fostered were those who , either from lack of opportunity or want of ability , had no power to put their teachings into practice . Hence it happened that , while the eighteent.h century was rife with speculations upon government as a science , constitutional government , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written constitution , was a thing unknown . In America , however , the theory of written constitutions was , at a very early period , practically and successfully applied to the science of government . The first germ of the theory of a government by a written constitution is perhaps to be found in the " Fundamental // Orders " adopted on 14th January , 1639 , for the government of the three towns of Hartford , Wethersfield , and Windsor , in Connecticut . By this instrument the inhabitants of the three towns " doe assotiate and conioyne our selues to be as one Publike State or Commonweith " and " in our Cinch Affaires to be guided and gourned according to such Lawes , Rules , Orders and Decrees " as are thereinafter set forth . This constitution endured until the establishment of the Charter government in 1665 . But the earliest important step in the direction of government by a written constitution may be considered to be the adoption of a written constitution by Virginia , on June 29 , 1776 . It is true that in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been adopted in South Carolina , and even prior to the last-mentioned date New Hampshire had prepared and declared in force a system of organic law ; but both of these so-called constitutions were of a temporary character , and were in terms only designed to remain in force " during the unhappy - and unnatural contest with Great Britain " ( as the New Hampshire convention expressed it ) , or " until an accommodation between Great Britain and America could be obtained " ( as was the language used in South Carolina ) . Virginia must therefore be considered as entitled to the honor of having first given a permanent and satisfactory demonstration of the great governmental theorem that communities can be successfully governed through the medium of a written organic law . It is not forgotten that prior to 1776 written constitutional laws had existed , and written forms of government had been in practical operation ; the circumstance that organic statutes , forming a part of the basis of the English government ( such as Magna Charta ) , had existed for centuries ; that in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) had existed ; and the other circumstance that written charters or written codes of laws had prevailed in the American Colonies from the period of their earliest settlement . But these are facts which do not militate against the proposition above laid down , for the English constitutional statutes only affect to embody a few out of the many fundamental legal principles upon which its government rests , and // fall far short of that complete legal framework to which ainne the name of a constitution can be in strictness applied ; and the colonial governments , while furnishing illustrations of complete ( or attempted complete ) political systems , approach , too nearly , mere schemes far the management of municipal corporations which do not depend , either in their original creation or for their permanent endurance , upon any original social compact of the governed . For two capital elements must enter into every true idea of a constitution : namely , first , that it should be created only by the society which is to be governed by it ; and , secondly , that it must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in accordance with , provisions contained in itself , or , in the absence of such provisions , by the people . If these are the correct tests , and if they are applied to modern European history prior to the American Revolution , it will be found that the above proposition is correct ; namely , that , prior to the adoption of the Virginia Constitution of 1776 , the science of jurisprudence had not yet reached that pitch of practical perfection which enabled a community to reduce the legal framework of society to writing , and to create instruments which should be paramount to the ordinary lawmaking power , and which should not be altered , save in obedience to methods presented in itself , or by the people . It will , of course be remembered that the experiment had been tried , and that the genius of John Locke had furnished to the Carolinas a constitution which had been attractive theoretically , but had proved utterly unable to stand the ordeal of practical operation . But Locke 's scheme , though a failure , had turned the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constitutions , and had developed the idea that , apart from the question of concession from a sovereign , it was desirable that the organic law of a State should be in writing . And this is the idea which has distinguished the Constitution of the United States , and the constitutions of the various States of the Union , from the so-called constitutions which have , during the present century , been granted by European monarchs to their people , and from the charters of . the Middle Ages . It is desirable that constitutions which a people wrest from a despot by whom they have been governed should be put in writing , // in order that some fixed and known limits should be established , by which newly acquired liberties may be guarded ; but whether or not a free people should put their organic law in writing is another matter , and depends on other considerations . It is purely a question in the science of government . In America the question has been decided in favor of written constitutions . The idea of liberty has , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question ; for while in the case of a free people , who are perfectly at liberty to form their own governmental institutions , it is unnecessary to provide against the encroachments of existing despotism , it is , nevertheless , desirable to guard against such encroachments in the future , that is to say , against possible revolutions in favor of absolutism . Yet the primary idea among such a people is ( it may be repeated ) the purely scientific one , that the theory of good government is more likely to be successfully carried out under a written than an unwritten organic law ; and it is the practical and successful application of this theory which must be considered as a . great step forward in the progress of civilization made by America . The example of Virginia was followed very shortly in Pennsylvania , the first written constitution of the latter State having been adopted on September 28 , 1776 ; and nearly all the other States , in following out the recommendation of the Continental Congress of June 14 , 1776 , to " form governments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the basis of written organic law . The example of America in this particular was felt directly , and almost immediately , in Europe . Not only did the ideas of civil liberty , which had sprung up in America during the Revolution , penetrate into France , and contribute towards the accomplishment of the revolution in that country , but the still further idea of a government by the means of a written constitution took root in France , and has never since been eradicated . The first written constitution of that country was adopted on 8-14 September , 1791 . It was essentially a fundamental instrument . It was preceded by a declaration of rights , and by an express abolition of former institutions , and // it contained ( in Title III. , Arts . 1 and 2 ) averments which indicated its radical and comprehensive character , namely : - 1er La souvorainet6 est une , indivisible , inali6nable , et ilnprescriptible . Elle appartient iL la nation ; aucuno section du peuple ni aucun individu ne pent s'en attribuer l'exercice. 2d , La nation , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oxercor quo par d6l6gation . La constitution fran*aiso ost repr6-sentativo ; los ropr6sontans sont lo corps l6gislatif ot lo roi . It is a matter of history that the ideas of republican governmont thus promulgated were derived largely from America , and particularly from Jefferson , who must , it may be remarked , be regarded as the expounder of the system of representative government which was then being established , and which has , since his time , exercised such an important influence throughout the world . How well the system of written constitutions has stood the trials of one hundred years , all the world has seen . We have seen how these organic laws have been amended from time to time , when reformation has been necessary , without seriously impairing the just reverence for constitutional law , which is one of the safeguards of government ; and the present generation has witnessed how well such written constitutions have stood the shock and strain of war . Among all the lessons which the world has learned from the progress of the American people , none are of greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong enough to restrain human passions in times of the greatest excitement , and , at the same time , mobile enough to be compatible with true progress . Akin to the disposition to crystallize organic law in the form of written constitutions is the disposition to codify municipal law , which has always displayed itself in the legal history of all of the States of the Union . When codification is possible in a nation , it is a proof that it has reached a mature stage in its progress in civilization ; it is not evidence ( as has been , it is submitted , erroneously asserted ) that the people among whom it has thus become possible have reached such a degree of maturity that further development is difficult , if not impracticable . This erroneous idea has been promulgated by a modern writer ( D. C. Heron , History of Jurisprudence , page 141 ) , but its unsound-. // ness may be demonstrated by one of the very examples which is brought forward in its support . The history of France is cited as a proof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progress ceases ; and " France , " says the author just quoted , " now appears stationary in wealth and population . " These words were published in 1860 . Eleven years later that nation demonstrated the fallacy of at least one branch of the above proposition , by showing her ability to meet a war indemnity 50 grievous and vast that it seemed almost impossible that any people could avoid being financially ruined by it , but which was met , nay , anticipated , in a manner which must not only redound forever to the credit of the people upon whom it was imposed , but must Je a convincing proof that national wealth , under the system of codification , became in France not only enormous in extent , but capable of being turned with promptitude and facility to meet exigencies of the most extraordinary and unforeseen description . So far , therefore , from codification being the proof of an effete or even stationary civilization , it is on the contrary the evidence of intelligent and scientific efforts to meet the legal wants of a progressive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , constantly increasing in extent and variety by the increasing demands and developments of society , within reasonable and manageable bounds . Codification , to a greater or less extent , must , in truth , become indispensable to any nation which draws its laws from varied sources , ( and what nation does not ? ) and which designs or attempts to make the progress of those laws keep pace with the growing wants of the times without developing into a mass of unmanageable and contradictory rules . The practical administration of law depends , in a measurable extent , upon its simplicity ; and this end can only be attained , and overwhelming complexity and voluminousness avoided , by resorting to the expedient of codification . Not only does the mass of laws increase with the constant increase in number and complexity of the relations of life produced by modern civilization , but the sources and instruments of law are continually accumulating by the system of preserving decisions and multiplying reports . No nation , in modern times , can afford to go on accumulating vast masses of authoritative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to revise written laws . // In most of the States of the Union the sy*tems of laws under which the people have lived have been drawn from numerous and varied sources . It is true that in most of them the English common law has furnished the basis for their jurisprudence . But when we consider the various sources from which English municipal law has itself been derived , when we reflect upon the changes in that system rendered necessary by the changed conditions of life under which people on this side of the Atlantic have flourished , and when we add to these facts the further fact of the necessary complexity of law which has been produced by the very progress of civilized life , it is not difficult to see that codification , partial or entire , must have become in- dispensable . Codification has , indeed , been decried both on the European continent and in England ; but the objections which have been urged against it have been shown by one of the most profound and intelligent writers in modern times to be fallacious . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Positive Law , " John Austin has analyzed these objections , and has pointed out the fact that the evils which have been alleged to exist in divers codes of European States have been due to the faulty manner in which the work of codification has been executed , not to any defeats necessarily inherent in the system itself . That author truly says that " A code , as meaning a body of law expressed in general formuhe , arranged systematically , and complete , is a modern idea , " and the value of this " modern idea " has been recognized in England only during the past few years . But this truth which has so slowly forced itself upon the minds of English jurists , or rather ( it should be said ) on the attention of English legislators , was understood and appreciated on this side of the Atlantic at a much earlier date . Shortly after the close of the first quarter of this century , New York and Pennsylvania began the task of arranging , formulating , and systematizing their laws in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few states in which general revisions of the statute law have not taken place from time to time , and codification , more or less general , been carried out . The tendency still exists , and is almost every year producing practical results . During the last ten years , not only have // " Revised Codes " been adopted in the Southern States ( where the political changes produced by the war would render such revisions of the law a necessity ) , but also in Western and New England States . Such , for example , are the Revised Code of Iowa , completed in 1873 , and of Connecticut , adopted during the year which has just closed. * The improvemeuts and advances in American law resulting from the carrying out of the tendency to codification have been of a marked and important character . Among the more striking are , first , the abolition of the distinction ( derived from the English law ) between courts of law and courts of equity , and , secondly , the simplification of the methods of legal procedure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equity is plain enough ; but the circumstance that justice is administered according to one system in one set of courts , and according to another ( and in many instances contradictory ) system in another set , must be extremely puzzling . That rigid rules are generally requisite for the regulation of civil conduct , but that under certain circumstances , and in certain exceptional cases , these rules require modification , is an elementary truth in the administration of justice which is readily recognized by every one . It is a necessary and unavoidable concession to the weaknesses of human nature , or to the force of accident . It is desirable , for example , when parties to a contract have put their agreement in writing , that they should be bound by the tqrms of the written instrument which they have thus constituted the evidence of their intenlion ; but it is also equally desirable that when , through the fraud of one party , the written document does not faithfully represent the true meaning of the transaction , the other party should not be hound thereby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uneducated understanding , that a man should , as a general rule , be permitted to assert any right , title , or interest which he may happen to have acquired in or to any property ; but it is also equally apparent that such assertion of right should not , in fairness , take place when the party entitled to it has so acted as to induce another to believe that no such right existed , or would be insisted upon , and has induced the expenditure of * The recent revision of the Federal Laws must also be remembered . // money , or the parting with something of value , on the faith of such belief . Now these two illustrations of fraud and estoppel are instances of equitable doctrines which coincide with the ordinary ideas of justice which exist in the mind of every one , layman or lawyer . But why a man should not be suffered in one court to show the fraud upon which in another tribunal he would be entitled to rest his claim for relief , or why , * on one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to assert and recover upon a title which , on the other side of the Hall , he would not be allowed to set up , or , in other words , why the law administered in one court should be different from that administered in another court of the same nation , is a proposition which , at first glance , at all events , appears to the mind of the layman to be utterly unreasonable . It is clear , therefore , that the inherent distinction between law and equity , in certain senses of the term , is in accordance with ordinary common-sense , but that it is not in accordance with unprofessional reasoning that these two systems should not be recognized and enforced in all the tribunals of a country . Now the reason for this division of the administration of justice between different tribunals in England was historical rather than philosophical . In other words , " equity , " in the sense used in English jurisprudence , has never been found capable of any distinct and satisfactory scientific definition , but can only be properly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which . courts of justice , in early times , grew up and were organized . In the earliest period of their history , the Courts of King 's Bench and Common Pleas felt bound to recognize only legal titles and legal rights , and were , of course , unable to apply any remedies except those which were allowed by the somewhat cramped and unyielding forms of common-law writs . Hence there arose , in a perfectly natural way , and as a part of the national growth , a distinction between common-law and equitable courts , which , while it had no foundation in scientific jurisprudence , had such a deep root in the English Constitution , that it has been but yesterday abolished . Like other institutions of the mother country , this distinction between courts of law and courts of equity was imported // into the American colonies , and was retained in many States after the Declaration of Independence . Very many of them had separate equity judges ( chancellors ) , and almost all of them had separate courts , in which equitable doctrines were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ *ho acted in the other courts as common-law judges . In Pennsylvania a system existed which may be considered as the precursor of the statutory consolidation of law and equity which has taken place during the middle of the present century in other States of the Union , and which has just been adopted in England . This system was simply the adoption of equitable doctrines by the common-law courts , and their administration , as far as practicable , under common-law forms . The theory upon which the administration of justice , according to this system , was based , the extent to which it was carried , and the practical success and efficiency by which it was attended , were explained in a remarkable essay , first read as a lecture before an association of students-at-law and younger members of the bar in Philadelphia , ' and subsequently published in book form , namely " Anthony Laussat 's Essay on Equity in Pennsylvania . " This work , when profoundly considered , must be regarded , in spite of its brevity and comparatively ephemeral character , as one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of jurisprudence either in this country or England . It recognizes , enforces , and illustrates the truth , which it has been the aim of reformers during the last thirty years to reach , namely , that there is no inherent necessity that equitable relief should be administered in courts which are separate and distinct from ordinary legal tribunals , and it points out the facl how this consolidation of justice had been very largely ( though not completely ) attained in Pennsylvania by the administration of equitable principles in common-law actions . According to this system , equitable titles were always enforced in common-law suits ; equitable rights were constantly recognized in all the courts ; and the only failure of the system was that which occurred when certain equitable remedies were desired , and when the common-law writs were then powerless to do complete justice , although , even in this last case , at least // one equitable remedy , that , namely , of specific performance of contracts for the sale of land , was enforced through the medium of the action of ejectment . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in 1836 , equitable jurisdiction was conferred upon the courts Pennsylvania , and relief is now administered not by separare equity judges , but by the judges of the ordinary courts according to the course and practice of chancery ; but it has nevertheless been held , and is now the thoroughly established doctrine in that State , that , notwithstanding the grant of chancery powers , the old system of administering equitable relief under common-law forms is still unimpaired , and this doctrine is constantly being acted upon , and equitable titles and rights are always recognized , as heretofore , in common-law suits . The consolidation of courts of law and equity in those States in which they . had previously existed as distinct tribunals began in 1840 with New York . It was followed in other States , from time to time ; and while there are many States in which equitable jurisdiction is exercised by common-law judges according to the course and practice of chancery there , there are very few in which distinct chancery tribunals are maintained . The desirability of the consolidation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England , but the end , however much desired , was not attained until the passage of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act in 1873 , which , after some postponements , has at last gone into practical operation . Every credit is due to English legal reformers for the passage of such an act , and every allowance must in fairness be . made for the difficulties which existed in the way of uprooting old institutions which had groWn and flourished from the very day when the seeds of English jurisprudence were sown . But when we reflect on the promptness and energy with which we on this side of the Atlantic have solved the problem , we can not but congratulate ourselves that the activity which has been the characteristic of the American mind in so many departments of life has not been wanting in the science of jurisprudence , and has brought about results which have furnished examples to be imitated by those from whom our legal institutions have been derived . // Scarcely less important than the consolidation of the tribunals by which justice is administered is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ procedure . This simplification has been twofold ; first , in abolishing the variety of forms of actions , and second , in substituting a statement and answer for the English system of pleading . Theoretically , the English system of process and pleading seems to have been perfect . The writ notified the defendant of the general nature of the action in which the plaintiff alleged that he was answerable , and of the court in which he was to appear . The declaration contained a statement of the particular and specific wrong of which the plaintiff complained , and the subsequent pleadings were designed to eliminate such matters as were not disputed or were immaterial , and to bring the controversy down to the matter or matters in dispute , which were called issues . The trial of a cause consisted in the determination of these issues , the same being passed upon by a jury , if they were issues of fact , and by the court , if issues of law . But , however perfect in theory , the system was liable to abuse or disarrangement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of perfectly trained lawyers , the ancient English system of pleading might not be the best in the world for the accurate and speedy administration of justice , is a question as to which a great deal could be truthfully said upon the affirmative . But the intricacies of special pleading , and the frightful consequences which ensued from the slightest mistakes in matters of form , were such as to call loudly for legislative reform , and accordingly , in England , at the present day , pleading and practice have been much simplified . In this country still greater steps in this direction have been taken . Under the system of procedure which has been adopted in many of the old and nearly all of the new States in the Union , the case of a plaintiff is presented to the court in a brief , simple , and informal statement , and the answer of the defendant is of the same character . Whether the results of this simplification of procedure have been altogether desirable , may possibly be doubted . That in many respects they have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ method of presenting a case for decision by mere statement and answer , there is lost that precise and clear definition of the exact points in dispute which is found when the technical forms of the pleading of the common law are skilfully and carefully applied . Hence , in a great many instances , the trials of causes in this country are encumbered and prolonged by the introduction of a vast mass of irrelevant testimony which has nothing whatever to do with the issues really existing between the parties , and which serves only to confuse the jury and weary all concerned . This was a fault against which even the common-law system of pleading did not sufficiently guard , for the wide latitude for the introduction of evidence , which was permitted by the general issue , conduced , in a high degree , to uncertainty in ascertaining the real points in controversy , and to prolixity in the trial of a cause . Hence the necessity for the adoption of the rules of ilulary Term , in 4 Will . IV. , in accordance with the recommendation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue was limited so that the questions raised thereby became less numerous and more precise . It may well be doubted , therefore , whether legislation presenting a simple statement and answer , in place of a scientific system of pleading , is altogether wise , and whether , therefore , the steps in that direction which have been taken in many of the States of the Union have not been steps towards sUppO8ed rather than actual reform . Undoubtedly this system of pleading at large , as it has been termed , has its advantages ; it prevents , or certainly tends to prevent , any decision of the rights of parties on the ground of mere form , and by its simplicity , and the readiness with which it is mastered , renders causes less likely to miscarry through these slight formal errors , which should never , m a system where justice is fairly administered , be permitted to prejudice the real merits of a case . But it is plain that at some stage or other of a judicial proceeding , immaterial and admitted facts must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confused ; and it does seem to be better that , where the system of deciding upon questions of fact through the means of a jury prevails , and where juries are composed , as must always of necessity // be the case , of those who are untrained in the art of sifting evidence and discriminating the real points in issue between parties , some preliminary process should be invoked whereby the case should be presented to the jury in a clear , sharp , and well-defined manner . Under the Constitution adopted in Pennsylvania in 1814 , parties are allowed , in certain cases , by consent , to have the facts as well as the law of the case determined by a judge , without the interposition of a jury . Wherever some such plan as this could be practicable , pleading at large might be allowed with advantage . A trained judicial mind , accustomed to the rules of pleading and evidence , able to discriminate clearly and promptly between such matters as are or are not material , and able , moreover , to hear without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other of the parties , are purely collateral to the point in controversy , and not , therefore , to be fairly taken into consideration in rendering a judgment , - such a mind , we say , might well be trusted to hear the whole story , on both sides , in full , and to arrive at a sound and just decision . And this is just what is done by the method of pleading in equity . But such a system could not be introduced in a compulsory form without infringing upon that great and deservedly valued right , - trial by jury ; and th' surrender of such a right would be too high a price to pay for the great , but still comparatively inferior , advantage of untechnical pleading . Upon the whole , therefore , it may be concluded that the true principle of reform in this department of justice would be , to take the common-law system of pleading , to simplify it , to render it more precise in some respects , less technical in others ; to reduce the number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be , against prolixity . In this way , perhaps , more desirable results would be obtained than are reached by tle sweeping enactments in many of the States , by which technical pleading is completely abrogated and all forms of actions abolished . Another plan would be to adhere to the system of a statement and an answer , and then to have the issues in dispute ascertained by a judge or a master , after which a reference to have them decided by a jury would follow , according to the practice which obtained in the English Chancery of having // issues of fact directed to be tried by a jury for the enlightenment of the conscience of the chancellor . In carrying out the details of codification , efforts have been made in some of the States towards the simplification , or supposed simplification , of the rules of the common law in other directions besides these which have been already noticed . The doctrine of Uses and Trusts , which had its origin at a very early period of the English law , was one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body of the law of the mother country into our jurisprudence . This doctrine , whereby the complete title to property was supposed by a legal fiction to be divided or resolved into the two elements of legal title on the one hand , and equitable title , or beneficial ownership , on the other , is apparently of English origin ( not having any exact parallel in any other legal system ) , and has been , as is well known , of the very first importance in the English law of real property , especially since the passage of the . Statute of Uses of 27 , Henry VIII . In fact , it is upon the Statute of Uses that the whole system of modern English conveyancing is based . Moreover , in the administration of justice the fictions of what are known as Implied , Resulting , and Constructive Trusts are employed for the purpose of carrying out certain equitable doctrines which thus employed constitute the machinery for the enforcement of a very large class of rights respecting both real and personal property . The subject has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ importance , and the law has become complicated , and in many instances difficult , and in a few cases contradictory . Legal literature comprises many treatises of great learning and research upon this difficult branch of English jurisprudence , and upon no subject are the decisions of the courts so numerous and important . That reformers in law in this country should make some attempts to lop off a few superfluous branches from this widespreading growth was to have been expected ; but in some States the axe has been laid to the root of the tree , and the whole doctrine of Uses and Trusts has been sought to be eradicated . Thus in New York the Revised Statutes abolished Uses , and confined Trusts within very narrow limits ; and // similar legislation has been adopted in several other , principally Western , States . The advisability of so-called reformation in this particular is very questionable . The system of the law of real property must necessarily be , to a very great extent , artificial . The complex requirements of modern life in regard to the enjoyment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . A forcible attempt to compel these transactions to be simple and uniform must , of course , be a failure ; and to take away the legal machinery by which ends so justifiable and desirable have heretofore been carried out can be productive , in many instances , of nothing but embarrassment and confusion . That trust deeds under the English system have been prolix and complicated , is true ; that the intention of the parties to such instruments may have in some instances been defeated by the very means by which they have been sought to be carried out , may be admitted ; and it may also be conceded that , in the exposition of the doctrines growing out of tim law of Uses and Trusts , unnecessary refinements and subtleties have occasionally crept into the law ; but most of these objections are objections which are inherent in the nature of things , and proceed rather from the complex wants of men in relation to their property than from the means whereby . the law has endeavored to carry them out . The true part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the more patient and praiseworthy task of correcting the evils in the system , instead of the despairing process of abolishing the system altogether . Indeed , this last method of reform seems to be opposed to the proper spirit of the American intellect , which has always been to simplify , but never to destroy . The legislators of the country might well take a lesson from those who have to do with its mechanical arts , and remember how often American workmen have transformed the complicated and unmanageable machinery of their English cousins into models of simplicity and adaptiveness . The criticism of a great American jurist and commentator upon this very subject is thoroughly wise and just . Chancellor Kent has said , " The attempt to bring all trusts within the narrowest compass strikes me as one of the most questionable undertakings in the whole business of the Revision // It is in vain to think that an end can be put to the interininable nature of trusts arising in a great community , busy in the pursuit , anxious for the security , and blessed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tangible modifications . " And the same great writer truly says that the abolition of Uses can have no effect , " it is the abolition of a phantom . " Remarks similar to these which have just been suggested may also be made in reference to other attempts at reform which have been made iii the law of Real Property in very many of the States . Time rule in Shelley 's Case , the rule which forbids the creation of legal freehold estates to commence in future , the rule which forbids the limitation of a remainder which will operate to abridge the particular estate , have all been abrogated by statute in many States . Time policy of such a method of reformation may have been advocated by able men , and there may be much to be said in its support ; but it is submitted with deference , that such a method is not that which is marked by the profoundest wisdom and foresight , and that it loses sight of one of the great ends of codification . The design of codification is to arrange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been found necessary to regulate civil conduct in a given society . Now if social relations are simple , the laws should be simple and few ; and if by bad or careless legislation the laws have been uselessly complex , it is the business of the Revisory Code to lop off these excrescences . But where laws have become complex from the circumstance that the social relations which they regulate are intricate and varied , the difficulty is inherent in the nature of things , and no code or statute can compel simplicity in rules of civil conduct in such a state of affairs , any more than a foolish act of Congress could keep gold at par . Other subjects which have engaged the attention of American codifiers - the rights of married women , marriage and divorce , evidence , , insolvency , exemption laws - are well worthy of attention , but want of time and space forbids their discussion . From time review , then , of the tendencies of American jurisprudence considered witim reference to the causes whiclm have produced its peculiarities and controlled its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to a statement of the general // ckaracter of the results which have been attained . And as to these results we may sa.y that they may be grouped under three general heads , in that the law in this country has , in the progress of its hundred years of life , become ( 1 ) more simple , ( 2 ) more humane , and ( 3 ) more adaptive . That it has tended to become more simple would seem to be sufficiently plain from the instances which have been given under the head of codification ; of its increased humanity , the criminal code and the laws relating to married women are fair proofs ; while the facility with which it has met the changes produced by the physical and political peculiarities of the country , and the nature of its institutions , is evidence of its adaptiveness . The pathway which American law has pursued is one upon which we can turn our eyes with feelings of no little pride ; and if the progress of our national jurisprudence has not always been in precisely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way , and has certainly been no laggard .
