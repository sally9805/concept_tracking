ART . VI . - MODERN ARCHITECTURE . THERE has been a lull in the angry debates about modern architecture , which for thirty years had kept people busy and interested . This pause may be the result of better knowledge and wider sympathies ; but it has in it something very like despair . The discussions of twenty years ago , and since that time , have been narrow-minded enough ; but they were possible only to hopeful men intent upon a great result , supposed to be within easy reach . There is too much reason to fear that the eagerness has vanished only with the hope . The partisans of the different styles had their infallible schemes for creating the architecture of the future ; schemes wild enough , and theories unfounded enough , as experience seems to show , and as recent criticism has proved to every one 's satisfaction . But the immense advance that has been made in the knowledge of the fine and industrial arts of the past has brought to the present generation a sense of its own shortcomings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from its own efforts to apply fine art to building . A well-known instance is the atten*pted Gothic revival , which began in the general belief that the desired " new style " of architecture was to be sought by adop*Ling some old style , and a medi√¶val one , as most available , and working in it until the new should develop itself . Unfortunately , in England and in Germany , where the controversy was most warm betwecn the advocates of the Gothic revival and the classic status , the question of purity of style was allowed to assume so much importance in the Gothic camp , that architectural design became more and more a matter of archa3ological knowledge and faithful copying . In this instance , then , we find that the earlier buildings of the Gothic revival were wretched Gothic and poor architecture , but that their authors believed in them , and saw their way in imagination to a new Gothic , as real , as universal , and as splendid as the old . Nowadays , while better buildings are built by the English churchbuilders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and some " lost arts " of medheval decoration have been rediscovered , it is found that the hope of a modern Gothic archi // tecture , fit for every occasion , universally inspiring and universally recognized , has almost wholly passed away . In the same manner all other attempts have failed , the rediscoverers of the one great lost art of architecture are silent , and although everybody is profoundly dissatisfied , no new experiment is being tried and no new theory proclaimed . If , then , no change for the better is seen to be at hand , is it safe to conclude that such a change is as far away as ever ? Is the present to be accepted as the only possible state of things , at least during the present generation ? There are many reasons for thinking so , at least . The consideration of some of these reasons is the business of this essay . The main inquiry will be confined to this country , in which , while there are no monuments of the past for example and for encouragement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of routine , and a willingness to disregard precedent , which have been too rare among the modern architects of Europe , - virtues that might prove saving ones , if we had knowledge and judgment enough to use them . In this paper the word " architecture " will not be used very often , because it is of very uncertain and indefinable meaning . Thus , the definition of it that might be deduced from the writings of Viollet-le-Duc would be , " intelligent building . " That is to say , a noble architecture will be one in which all the needs of life - shelter , defenca , public worship , state - are provided for in the most complete way , by means of edifices of the most economical , permanent , useful , and dignified character , decorated , if at all , by the appliances and in the style best adapted to help the impressiveness of the structure . Such a definition might seem sufficient but that other definitions have an equal claim . What word have we for modern falsehoods and absurdities , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strictly favorable meaning ? Moreover , it is common to speak of naval or marine architecture , and of military architecture , and with reasonable propriety , considering the derivation of the word ; but beauty of design is ignored in those arts , and if a glacis or the bow of a boat is beautiful , it is not intentionally made so . The fact that they are beautiful may help our inquiry , but the arts that produce them are not less purely mechanical because of that beauty . // The word " architecture " is to be avoided , then , because too vague , and to be used only in a general sense , in which sense it is accurate . And in like manner the word " architect " will be used to mean , not a designer of beautiful form or color , nor an artist in any sense of the word , but one of that body of business men who charge themselves with the planning and erection of buildings and the expenditure of large sums of money , and who , as fiduciary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount expended by them . For the purpose of our inquiry , an architect is a nineteenth-century business-man , as much so as a stockbroker , and other terms will be used when there is question of skilful constructors or of decorative artists ; for , though the best builders , except of bridges and tunnels , and the only able designers of ornament , are to be found among the architects , in the same body and in good standing are very many men who are merely respectable professional advisers , overseeing the erection of buildings of well-known types , according to a well-understood business routine . There is one thing peculiarly noticeable in the American cities , namely , the use of iron in building for fronts , as well as for floors and roofs . Such cast-iron exteriors as those *f many great warehouses in New York , and other buildings than warehouses in the same city , and in Boston , the Public Ledger building in Philadelphia , and hundreds more , not in the great cities only , but in busy places all over the land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a London journal of building , in commenting upon these cast-iron exte-. riors in our cities , remarked that they seemed to contain no new principles of design ; that they were designs for stone buildings carried out in iron . This statement , which , however , is a mere reminiscence of the words of the journal in question , is far from being adequate . In fact , a design for a stone or marble or granite building is merely copied in iron , just as it might be copied in cork on a smaller scale , and for a mantel ornament . That is to say , the fronts of our cast-iron buildings are designed ( if the word must needs be so misused ) without any reference to the way in which those fronts are really built . These buildings are constructed throughout in the most primitive of all ways ; they consist wholly of hollow // posts or pillars of cast-iron , supporting floors of rolled or laminated iron beams . That is the whole construction . The spaces between the pillars of the exterior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , usually of cast iron , and set below the sills of the windows . The thickness of each floor is marked by a seeming lintel , with no weight upon it but that of the window and panel above . The spaces between the floorbeams are spanned by thin brick arches , and the floor is brought level at top with cement or concrete . There are faults , or rather deficiencies , in the system , but they need not detain us now . It is obvious that we have here as simple an instance of pure post-and-beam architecture as an early Greek temple , and one differing from Greek , and even from Egyptian examples , mainly , so far as the main theory of construction is concerned , in the superimposition of story above story . But there are many differences : thus , the strength of cast-iron , when used to resist crushing weight , is so great , and the strength of rolled iron , when used as a beam , is so great , that a building of these materials is removed from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is for this reason that iron building was first caught at by our mercantile houses , for the sake of the huge windows for light and for display . But there is still another difference : in all constructions of masonry , either the mere weight of the materials secures stability , as in Greek work , or mortars and cements are used , as in all modern work ; but in iron building , where the weight of material is nothing in comparison with the spaces covered , and where adhesive mixtures are , of course , useless , the different parts are bolted together in a more or less skilful and economical way . And one who should look at the naked structure of one of these buildings would see that here the traditional form of masonry would be out of place ; that vertical posts , very slender in proportion to the openings between them , are the leading constructional forms ; that horizontal lintels of some kind , at the levels of the floors , are needed but secondary parts ; that the remaining spaces are mere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to secure the parts to each other are visibly of supreme importance , and explain the possibility of the construction , as well as point out its unlikeness to the // masonry constructions which at first seemed so nearly similar to it . The observer will see that column rests upon column , end to end , through the whole height of the seven or eight stories , and that the horizontal members rest upon brackets provided at the heads of the columns , and that the bolting is of two sorts , that which holds the vertical columns one to the other , and makes one continuous pier or shaft of six or seven separate castings , and that which merely keeps the lintel or the girder in its place . Any one inquisitive as to the nature of the building would see all this ; and , as he had at first seen the likeness of the work to the post-and-lintel architecture of antiquity , he would see also , on examination , its many differences from that archetype . If besides being curious about the essentials of construction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural power of artistic design and some practise in designing , he would inevitably feel within him the first conception of a system of decoration , or of what is usually called architectural treatment , founded upon the construction . For it is to be never forgotten that all fine designing within our knowledge is in harmony with the form and make of the thing adorned . It is generally true , indeed , that the more elaborate and studied the construction , the more it controls the decorative design . It can not be wholly explained , perhaps , why men never design so well as when strictly controlled by the limitations of building ; but it is almost universally true , and it may be considered an axiom that no design is fine that ignores these things . It is instinctive to a born designer to explain , develop , and emphasize , while he adorns the necessary shape and make of his subject . Take anything very fine in building , and it will be found that the design was half made when the materials came to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a style of building like that to which the Parthenon belongs should have grown up except in a marble-producing century . An iron Parthenon would be actually impossible , except as a piece of soulless and senseless copying ; we may see one begun at any moment , but that is what it will be . If a designer of a store-front knew and felt the meaning of arch-construction in masonry , or if he cared for any one of // the many styles of architecture which have been based upon arch-construction , it would be unnatural and almost impossible for him to get up an iron front in imitation of such building . Or if he felt the force of the new material and the opportunity and the need for decorative as well as merely constructive treatment of it , it would be nearly impossible for him to avoid putting into his design some new idea . Now it is from the putting new ideas into designs that new styles of architecture begin ; and it is from the still further addition , time after time , of new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the former new ones , that styles of architecture are developed and perfected . A style of architecture grows like ship-building , - nobody invents it , nobody can be said to do much to it , only each builder thinks he can make his vessel swifter , or stiffer , or more seaworthy by just one degree ; and out of the Great Harry gradually comes the clipper-ship of the old California trade , - only each master-builder having a stone roof to build looks at other roofs and thinks for himself ; pointed vaulting ribs are tried as a purely constructional device , after circular ones have been found insufficient ; new combinations are found to be possible , and in twenty years Gothic vaulting in stone is developed , and what is called Gothic architecture with it . It is not desirable that people should annoy themselves about the invention of a new style ; it will come of itself when we have common sense and simplicity enough to let it come . New styles of book-illustration develop themselves easily and naturally enough under the hands of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new style is taking form in America , because book-illustration is in harmony with our modern thoughts , and we accept and enjoy what each artist has to offer ; not criticising much , nor generally appreciating the greatness that may be in the work ; just as young people read Shakespeare for the story. ** If it is natural to put new ideas into designs for new systems of building , - ideas , too , springing from the facts and necessities of the case , - it is right to ask for instances of design so modified , in the case of our cast-iron exteriors ? Even if we suppose that the theory of their decoration is imperfectly de veloped at first , or even marred by unskilful carrying out in the // first few buildings , where are the evidences that any artistic thought has been given to the matter ? Nowhere . The writer is unable at the moment to recall a single instance of frank and natural treatment of a cast-iron front . The nearest approach to it is in one or two instances in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cast-iron columns , where the columns are so treated as to confess their material , and effect is sought by judicious decorative painting . For it is to be observed , that iron-work used for exterior support must be kept perfectly covered with oil-paint , or it will rust and go rapidly to ruin ; this is one of its faults as a building material , but this suggests the natural way to decorate it . It is in vain to try to make it look like stone by means of gray paint and sand , or like marble by means of white paint ; its surface , lustreles dead , and easily soiled and injured , gives the lie to all such feeble deceptions ; any one who likes may compare the , translucency and effective lightness of a marble shaft with the dead weight of a white-painted iron one , both before and after it has grown dirty . The natural way to treat iron is to paint it with combinations of color . Even our lifeless cast-iron buildings might be improved by judicious painting ; but they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth the thought it would cost to decorate them rightly . Is there no good iron-work , then ? There is enough good engineering , noble roof and bridge building , - that is not the question . The inquiry is for a single instance of rational design used for the decorative treatment of an iron building . And if no instance can be given , and if the best modern ornamental iron-work to be found is just a piece or two of wroughtiron railing , or such an accident as the curious vaulted saloon built in the court-yard of the Astor House , then it must be confessed that things look badly . Either we have no good designers , or else there are influences at work that keep this important new problem from being submitted to them , and in either case there is some reason for feeling hopeless . But , it will be argued , iron is such a poor building material , it is so treacherous , it needs , as has been said , so much cost and care to keep it painted , your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is so impos // sible to decorate it , except by means of color , because cast-iron is incapable of ornamental treatment in relief , and wroughtiron or even sheet-iron decorations applied afterwards are so uncouth and so expensive , is it not , after all , a mere temporary fashion , this business of building in iron , and is if worth the while of anybody who can design to meddle with it ? It is probably true that our habit of building cast-iron exteriors is a huge blunder . It is certainly true that there is too high a premium offered by it to mere repetition of one motive , one capital , one base , or one group of mouldings , all over a building or a score of buildings . It is probably true that iron will always be the most expensive at first , and the least economical in the long run of all materials , and that wiser second-thought will relegate it to a position of last resort ; the thing to use when nothing else will serve , - so far , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for ten years and more iron fronts have been going up , one after another . It is natural to mean to make new designs for new systems of building ; it is very hard for anybody who can design to avoid expressing himself when the chance is given . If , then , it is impossible to get an attempt at something better than what we have had in iron , it must be from one or the other of the reasons given above , - either because there are so few designers in readiness , that as yet no one of them has chanced to be intrusted with an iron bnilding , or because no owner will allow his exterior to be other than those around , and in either case it may be said roughly to be because nobody cares . Worse than that things could hardly be . But let us leave the iron buildings , and if there is any comfort to be got out of those of the old-fashioned materials and construction , let us try to find it . One of the most peculiarly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from thirty thousand dollars to a quarter of a million , and pretending to architectural display , such as make up the bulk of certain parts of our thickly built cities , are peculiarly Cisatlantic in character . The regular London house of pale brick is not unlike the regular New York house or the regular Boston house of a few years ago ; but the brown-stone-fronted , high-stoop , or English-basement house of these late times is like nothing but itself . The style // and fashion of these , as developed in New York , have been fob lowed almost exactly in Chicago and other cities , very closely in Boston , less closely in Philadelphia . For the most part a modification of revived classic has been employed , deserving mention as the nearest approach to a real style that we have , ugly , poor , and bald as it is . All twenty-five foot fronts in New York are alike , or nearly so . All are arranged with openings for doors and windows , where the interior disposition requires it . " Money is freely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and even in decorative carving ; and when larger dwellings are built , the style proves elastic enough to cover all the exigencies . The plan and disposition of these houses , in spite of some bad things about them , as , for instance , the almost universal " areas " which are sunk in front of them , and give them the look , fatal to architectural dignity , of standing in pits , - the plan and disposition of these New York houses has proved capable of better exteriors , in the few cases in which an attempt has been made to treat the problem more artistically . There is some reason to believe that the very best opportunity offered to architectural artists in America is in these city houses in their crowded blocks . For , observe , buildings in the country are , one here and one there , too far apart and too seldom to be seen to influence much the builders of new ones . Commercial buildings must be show-cards , and simplicity and repose are of necessity , it seems , banished from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so we shall see in the course of our discussion . Public buildings only share in the advantages of these city dwellings , and the public buildings will go with the dwellings in their improvement or decline . The greatest chance offered our architectural designers to help each other and to build up in harmony a really indigenous and natural , and therefore permanent style of building , is in the rows of fine houses that are to spring up around our great parks . What is one man 's partial success , even in an important building , to his success in building a good house in such a neighborhood , which his friend may have in mind in building another house near by for a different owner , and which he himself will improve upon a few months later in his design for still a third dwelling // near to both the former ? It is of artistic progress that we are speaking , and the best art does not come of the most ambitious buildings , nor of those that cost the most or have given the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designers are quite strong enough to walk without leading-strings ; few of our designers can design a free building of irregular plan , as well as a front one of a row . To go on for the next ten years building up the streets around Central Park one house at a time , each for its one owner who should mean to live in it , having previously thrown overboard some annoying encumbrances to free thought , would be the ideal condition of architectural progress . As it is , however , among the thousands of costly and elaborate houses that cover a parallelogram two miles long and a mile wide in the heart of New York City , it is doubtful if there are two hundred that have been designed one at a time , each for itself ; it is doubtful if there are twenty that have actual merit as simple and unaffected works of architectural art . Our brown-stone fronts are built more generally in lots of from two to ten , by speculators , who hurry them through in time for renting or sale in spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or two of dollars will make plans of five stories and an elevation of a front , which " design " will serve for all the houses of that size that our speculator means to erect . It is all legitimate enough in a mercantile sense ; nobody is cheated except by his own ignorance of what he might have for his money ; but the lost art of beautiful building will never be found again where such practices prevail . The type of all our houses , both in plan and exterior , is established by these constructors , who are in the immense majority . Then it becomes hard for one who would build his own house not to expect one just like his neighbor 's . It is probable that anything at all different will really shock him and unsettle his notions of what a house ought to be . The same man who would employ on his work in the country the most artistically minded architect he might know , will have his city house copied accurately after his neighbor 's , with the change of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better in Boston , because there a much larger proportion of the houses have been designed for their // inhabitants . Walking about the newly built parts of Boston , with your eye on the buildings , is certainly less depressing than doing the same thing in New York . There is perhaps a ray of hope to be seen in the strange vagaries that the houses on Western Avenue and Commonwealth Avenue have indulged in . On the other hand , there are few of them that are at all refined or graceful or soign*s , cared for , in design . The writer has seen a house in Philadelphia that is very nearly a success ; but the general appearance of the city is that of many years ago , that is to say , attempts at making designs for dwelling-houses have been but few . There are at least these two classes of buildings in America to which architectural thought is not applied , except in single and few instances . It is easy to see , in this very fact , good reason for the ill-success of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ independently in other departments . The country houses , for instance , scattered all over the land and clustering thickly around the cities , are generally planned with thought and good intention , not for sale , but to be lived in ; and while the owner often would be pleased to have the exterior graceful and pretty , the designer , if an architect of standing , would generally have an idea of the exterior and take some pains to carry it out . But it is notorious that very few of the country houses are pretty , and that still fewer are of a high order of artistic design , and that almost none are excellent . Suppose there were question of sending photographs of American buildings to undergo the examination of really high critical authority in Europe , in that case it is safe to assume that , apart from ways of building that are purely American , there would be little in the photographs of our country houses , roughly classed together , to command the respect or the careful consideration of such authority . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than ours , but only that there does exist there something like criticism , which might be appealed to as disinterested and somewhat calmer than our own , as being more conversant with the mighty past . If , then , it is tru3 that our best men have worked at country houses with small resulting influence upon the general state of the art , and if the fashion of our country houses has undergone no // improvement that can be estimated , except the doubtful one of greater variety in treatment , the first reason for this discouraging state of things is to be found in the total failure of city building to set a better example . It is obvious that the country looks to the city for instruction . In the city more money per cubic foot is spent , in the city the best materials are used much more than in the country , in the city the best mechanics are to be found , that is to say , those who are the most skilful in elaborate and highly finished work ; in the city those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power of design , smaller or greater , is kept in use , are generally resident , and these can work with the greatest freedom and zeal upon buildings near their offices , which buildings , also , will be seen and criticised more than others . But country houses are better than city ones already ; more ingenious , more novel , more various in design , more near to good architecture , though still far enough away from it . If the time ever comes that our architects have among them so much of the spirit of good building and of the arts of design that they can study and improve upon one another 's works , in the natural way , the city will take the lead , and , as has been said above , the streets of residences in the great cities will be alternately the study and the scene of triumph of each artist . But until that time the country houses must look to themselves , and owner and designer will take long journeys to see in a distant village how two colors of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of study in an arrangement of roof they have heard of . It will be argued , however , that the architects , when properly paid and properly trusted , ought to do something , even under our vicious system , and that more pleasing designs and properly built houses ought to be found in our suburban villages . Now , in the first place this is true , and in the second place there are seyeral considerations which are to be taken into the account ; and these , although very much dependent upon each other and modifying each other in all sorts of ways , must be distinguished one from the other in some way . They may be numbered , therefore , from one to five . I. The modern architect is one of the busiest men even in // our busy cities . Tn all the occupation and bustle and constant succession of different claims upon attention , which make life in New York the over-exciting and exhausting thing it is , no man is more harassed than an architect in large practice . The office of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but not more imperatively than an architectural office . The great " railroad man , " with different boards of direction to attend , with a score of different and perhaps conflicting duties to do , with responsibilities pressing upon him on all sides , needs to divide his time carefully to make his engagements fit one another , and to take intervals of rest by violence , as it were , in spite of what seems most pressing and most in need of his attention , but not more absolutely than a busy architect . Indeed , the duties of half a dozen men are laid upon him . He is and must be , in all his most important work , an agent , charged with great responsibility , wielding great patronage , beset by powerful temptations to make money by irregular , if not dishonest means , the one person who is to blame , and who is blamed if anything costs a dollar more than it might have been got for . He is a constructor , supposed to know all the laws of good building , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sundr*r , seeing to it that his hundreds of working drawings are each one faultless , and that his dozen or score of builders ' foremen , working from them and guiding their scores of mechanics , are all carrying them out to the minutest particular . lie is supposed to have time to watch the new inventions , and to decide which to employ and which are not yet proved ; and the flood of circulars , that sets " like to the Pontic Sea " right into every well-known architect 's office , is a measure of that task in this age and country of inventions . lie is supposed to know which kitchen range to recommend at a high price , and which is best of those at sixty dollars . Which hot-air furnace will work the best in a given house , and which steam-heater is the best for a large building ; what strength of water-pipe is needed for the plumbing in Brooklyn , where the water head is high and the pressure great , and what sized water-tank is needed on the top of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But his first duty is to plan buildings ; and to do this aright his power of // adaptation and his quickness of perception , whatever they may be , must be trained by habits of constantly observing and always remembering the requirements of every kind of edifice . No man , for instance , can plan a dwelling-house , even the smallest , as well as it ought to be planned , if he is not thoroughly conversant with the life that is to be led in it , as the most intelligent village carpenter can hardly plan a cottage for a cultivated family , accustomed to what is called elegant life ; and this merely because of want of experience of such life . But , on the other hand , no man can plan well who is not always planning . The experience of nearly all architects will probably agree in this , that their most successful plans for dwellings have been those to which the owner contributed nothing but criticism and modifications , the plan in its principal features having been created at the first visit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which comes of long practice . And as the architect 's first duty is planning , so his second duty is artistic design , which is the subject of this inquiry , and which is the one thing to suffer . The constant and engrossing occupations alluded to are not inconsistent with one another ; the unceasing toil they make necessary is delightful to many men , no pleasure is so great to those who can taste it as the rapid , successful , efficient getting through of important work . But it all interferes with artistic design . To design , the artist should have peace , and , above all , no distracting and contradictory claims upon his attention . What might have been a fine design is ruined by interruptions and by distracting responsibilities . More often still , he who might have been a fine designer gives up in despair all attempt at doing his best , and year by year leaves the matter of artistic design more and more to his growing pow6r of rapid decision and to chance , hoping to get something good , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only safe way for them is to keep their designs plastic , as it were , to the last moment , and to decide finally upon each detail at the right time , as the work goes on ; but the amount of thought , watchfulness , and labor involved by this course it would be in vain to try to describe . For a busy architect to make a tolerable design and carry it out , he must be not only a designer by nature , but also a trained // student of the fine arts , critically familiar with the most perfect fine art of the world , and therefore able to judge his own work with remorseless severity . 2 . There are many modern materials and modern processes of building which have proved singularly unfavorable to good artistic effect , both interior and exterior . The work of the planing-mill , the jig-saw , the cut-nail machine , the moulding-mill , the new arts of working iron and cast-iron , the introduction of artificial stones and thin metal imitations of stone cornices and dormers , - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been hitherto almost wholly evil in their effect upon the beauty of our buildings . They have been used in constant and direct violation of the principle laid down , that all good architectural design must be based upon the nature and the uses of the building . And while they have driven out , as it was inevitable they should , the picturesque half-timbered house , the solid framed church roof , and the groined vault , they have supplied no new elements of design to take their places . It is to be supposed that they can not drive out carved stone , and the proper use of bricks and solid wood ; but it is clear that they must abolish very many of the sacred traditions , and as yet they bring nothing good to take their place . This would not have been so had the architects grappled with the difficulty . What has been said above is a partial answer to the question , Why have they not done so ? That they ought to have done more than they have has also been admitted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the general question very much . As many small churches are needed , as many public buildings , and as many or more private houses , all in proportion to the population , as if we were able to build as cheaply as in England . And not only does all building-work cost more , in proportion to other things , than in Europe , what is worse , all fine hand-work , all that is not the regular stock " finish* ' of the carpenters and masons , costs more , in proportion to other expenses of building , than in Europe . Connected with this is the fear the builders all show of everything like a new style of work , - new to them , that is to say ; and , unfortunately , nearly all good work is new to them . // A partial exception exists in the great cities , where a few mechanics become trained to doing fine work according to drawings . But it is generally impossible to persuade master builders to contract for such work , except at prices which are confessedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guard against the possibility of loss on untried work . The amount of resistance that all this opposes to true progress is incalculable . There is no room here to enlarge upon the topic ; but , fortunately , instances of the difficulty in question are within the experience of many persons , and the difficulty itself is obvious . 4 . The obstacles that have been mentioned as obstructing the architects in whatever attempts they may make to give the world better art are obstacles for which they are partly responsible , and which they can little by little remove . But those that remain to be spoken of are of another kind . There is nothing , on the whole , so hostile to good art of any kind as ostentation ; and this is true of all forms of that small kind of pride . The desire to surpass yonr neighbor , in a mean way , by mere glitter , and the wish to impress the passers-by with a mere display of costliness , are not more mischievous than the common form ,  --  the settled conviction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insufficient means to build it well , must have everything supposed to be a part of a stylish house , or that life in it will be insupportable . This is at the bottom of half our bad building and childish copying of each other 's ugly houses . Every one knows that a house with cheap plumbing that will fail , poor wood-work that will gape , and slight foundations that will settle , will still be salable enough if it has " a neat brown-stone front " and an elaborate galvanized iron cornice . But whether a thoroughly well-built and well-appointed house , of " old-fashioned* ' exterior , will sell depends wholly upon whether one of the few more sensible members of the community wants a house at the moment and chances to hear of the one in question . In like manner , let the architect propose to his client a quaint and picturesque interior , and , in most cases , it will be rejected ; not because of a high standard of taste that insists upon more simplicity and repose , but because the houses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received type , // weigh upon the owner 's mind and overawe him into meek imitation of their feeble modishness . A very noble design could not be approved for the same reason , but for another reason as well , which must pass unexplained this time . 5 . And the fifth consideration is the timidity of men ; but this is so nearly allied in every-day life with the commoner forms of ostentation , that it is hard to distinguish in a given case , much more to distinguish between them in a general inquiry . The remedy is beyond special prescription ; it is to be found only in that higher education of our people , towards which every effort of true patriots ought to tend . These general considerations have been stated apropos of American country houses , the most nearly successful , taken as a class , of all American buildings . The same burdens weigh upon progress in decorative design , in all the departments of building . And in some there are still other difficulties in the way of steady or rapid advance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , the recognized custom to build churches in some form or modification of Gothic , and theatres and ball-rooms in some kind of florid modern classic ? Other buildings are freer ; no one style is assumed to be peculiarly domestic , no one style is supposed to be the only possible one for a bank . An architect who cares for artistic design may , if his feeling and knowledge control him as they ought , design all his buildings according to the same principles and with the same end in view , except that he will be compelled to build a church according to received maxims of ecclesiology , a very different thing from good art , and except that his interest will bid him decorate the interior of a theatre in as near the " style of the Empire " as his feelings of disgust will allow . Now as regards churches , at least it may be admitted that a good copy of fine Gothic work has its beauty , and that in some cases the order to copy has saved the world from a perfectly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are to be Gothic , and the codicil to that , that the best Gothic is the most like thirteenth-century Gothic , are foes to artistic progress . Let it be remembered how hard it is for any one to do well in art , in these modern times , with little encouragement to strive , with little sympathy for his best // efforts , with no ancestral fine designing to appeal to , with his pecuniary interest almost directly opposed to his sense of what is right and what is lovely . If achievement is made still harder and languid acquiescence easjer by the exhortation to copy , - to copy , moreover , admirable art confessedly beyond the power of living artists to equal , and capable of giving great delight to the student of its characteristics , - modern art is deprived of its one remaining chance . The best of these derivative and archaeological styles of art is to living art very nearly as copying pictures by great masters is to painting pictures of one 's own . And this copying of pictures , however good for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole power of the master , tends but very slightly to produce good original painters . Modern criticism is of incalculable importance ; the whole fabric of the future , its knowledge and its original achievement , is to be built up according to the dictates of this criticism , and may be expected to assume extraordinary , novel , and splendid forms of perfection under this new influence . But in itself it is destructive , not creative , and knocks to pieces the showy bits of finery we set up with little consideration of how we are to replace them . There are unbounded possibilities for art in that great civilization of the future which is dimly to be seen forming itself out of the present chaos of half-understood tradition and half-digested schemes ; but the immediate horizon is dark . Whether any light of hope can be descried by careful scrutiny , and what , if anything , lies with this generation to do , is another part of our inquiry .
