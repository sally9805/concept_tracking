T. LAST summer and autumn comprised our second season in Utah . Accompanied by my wife , I had leisurely travelled over the northern part of the territory , advancing into Idaho , where we passed the delightful month of August , at the comparatively unknown but wonderfully health-restoring Soda Springs . Thence we journeyed south and east , through the Bear Lake district and along the banks of that water , rivalling in transparent beauty and grand surroundings Lake George , Tahoe , or Geneva . Coming down from those lofty plains , six thousand feet above the level of the sea , we emerged through Logan cafion amid an indescribable magnificence of scenery , and found our way to the city of Salt Lake , from whence we had taken our departure . This journey of several hundred miles had been chiefly accomplished on horseback , by which pleasant and exhilarating method of travelling we had been enabled to see more of the country and to form more correct ideas of its peculiar people , than by observation in any other way . We were everywhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our purpose was generally without hotels . It is scarcely necessary to remark that as ladies are more communicative with each other than with a sex less accustomed to questions and answers , I had unsurpassed opportunities for obtaining information of domestic affairs . The impressions of that tour were given to the readers of the New York " Evening Post , " and I now propose to furnish similar but more general experiences of the country and people of western and southern Utah . We were told that as we had hitherto seen only Salt Lake City and the northern part of the territory , our favorable opinions would be dissipated when we beheld the ignorance , poverty , and degradation of the south ; but we found that those who gave us this information possessed the first of these characteristics themselves . We are constrained to admit that notwithstanding the abnormal practice of matrimony which prevails in many families , the Mormons as a class are , with this single exception , a virtuous , industrious , happy , and religious people . In very many respects their traducers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this series of papers , when it comes in my way to remark upon the society into which we were thrown , I shall do so with the same impartiality I have heretofore endeavored to maintain . That there may be no misunderstanding of my sentiments , I will say in the outset that I consider the practice of polygamy a dark stain upon an otherwise attractive picture , a crime against the law of the land , and a serious drawback to the prosperity of Utah . Most ardently desiring its abolition , I am opposed to all Congressional legislation intended to accomplish it , but in reality conducing to its continuance . I do not know if slavery could have been brought to an end without war , but we are all aware that there was a class of patriots who preferred to end it in that way , and whose rancor has not abated with its extinction . There is a similar spirit abroad as opposed to polygamy . There are j ' Gentile ring " politicians in Utah , and there are ignorant and fanatical politicians in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the latter legislate in accordance with their wishes chiefly from ignorance or a craving for popularity . The intent of the one and the practice of the other is only evil , and that continually . Of course argument would be wasted on the men who compose the political 7 N // ring of Salt Lake City , but it may not be in vain to appeal to our national legislators , and to ask them to abstain from forcible measures when the end can be attained more readily by simply leaving polygamy to the omnipotent jurisdiction of railroads and fashions , and to the common sense of the rising and more cultured generation who , seeing its evil influences on their parents , are almost universally opposed to it . Scarcely a traveller on the pleasure trip to California omits to spend*a day or two at Salt Lake . In a short stay tourists are scarcely able to form correct opinions of everything they see and hear , although they often persuade themselves that they have acquired the fullest information . Yet they do succeed in furnishing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediate surroundings , that I should not be thanked for again travelling over their narrow but well-beaten paths . I prefer to take my readers at once on excursions similar to those I have already mentioned . These too were accomplished generally in wagons and on horseback , in the same company and with the same advantages . Without more preface , we will leave the city on a pleasant day about the close of September last , and as we travel west and south we will see the Great Salt Lake , the mountains , the valleys , the mines , and the people . The distance from Salt Lake City to Ophir cafion is fifty-five miles . When the Utah Western railroad is completed so far as contemplated , this will be one of the most agreeable excursions from the city . Then it was a tedious dusty drive in the stage-coach . Still , there are many pleasant views to be had from the road , which passes across the long desert wastes and over the spurs of rugged mountains . I shall have more to say of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrative . In no part of the Union has it been so economically or profitably developed under more discouraging conditions . Isolated from the outside world of business , a self-dependent people , constantly under the ban of their countrymen , who claim a higher standard of virtue and civilization , the Mormons have been stimulated by circumstances to display a wonderful energy . When the Union Pacific railroad extended itself to the confines of their territory , they at once realized the advantages that would accrue to them from connection with it . The " Utah Central , ' ? uniting the Union and Central Pacifics with Salt Lake , a distance south of thirty-eight miles , was immediately commenced ; the Utah Southern has since been extended seventy-seven miles still further to the south , and will soon reach the southern limits of the tcrritory . Three narrow-gauge roads , of from fifteen to twenty-five miles in length , are profitably operated in connection with this main trunk , and now the Utah Western is fairly under way , and by the next season will have been finished forty-five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the rich mining districts of Ophir and Dry cafions . This country is admirably adapted to the construction and profitable running of narrowgauge roads . The cheapness of the grading , the iron , and the equipment will combine to greatly lessen their first cost and running expenses . Experience gained on the roads previously built has enabled the projectors of the Utah Western to avoid mistakes and to adopt such improvements that an absolute success will be insured . The grade of this road being less than that of any of the others , and the mining regions to which it advances being the most profitable localities of Utah , give it superior advantages above them all . Whatever may have been the calculutions of Brigham Young in secluding his people from the world before the idea of a Pacific railroad was entertained , he is certainly now a progressive railroad man . His sons are enthusiastically devoted to such objects , and none of them have evinced more // sagacity and energy in this respect than John W. Young , to whom the Utah Western owes its inception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and high character in overcoming the senseless prejudices of Eastern capitalists against the safety of investment among the Mormons , and has shown them , to their own advantage , that a Mormon gentleman can understand business as well as if he had been educated in Wall street , and what is better , he can conduct it more honorably . We reached the shores of the Great Lake after a drive of three hours . Such is the optical illusion caused by this rarefied atmosphere , that the city , left eighteen miles behind us , seemed to be only four or five miles distant , the houses being distinctly visible . The formation of the land contributes to this deception , ridges of mountains running north and south , and enclosing valleys of a width of about twenty-five miles , with no intervening elevations . We drove for an hour along the southern bank of Salt Lake , fanned by the breath of its sea air , and looking over its waste of waters dotted with mountain islands . It required but little imagination to transport ourselves to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ninety miles to the north , no land could be seen beyond the line of the clearly defined horizon . Some years ago a steamboat of three hundred tons was built for freight and passenger traffic , in connection with the Union and Central Pacific roads ; but her fair prospects were ruined by the construction of the Utah Central , and she now lies at the wharf , her only value being her aid in making our imaginary ocean seem more real . How this great basin of salt water came to be deposited in the interior of the continent , has been a study for geographers and naturalists . The changes that are taking place in its character at the present day are observed with much interest . It was first discovered by a party of trappers long before the religious discovery of Joseph Smith . When they had taste*I of its waters they supposed that it was an arm of the sea coming in from the Gulf of California ; but on their attempt to sail into the Pacific by that route , they experienced the same disappointment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ North river , although they might have been led to the same conclusions from different tests . The trappers should have realized that the water was too salt , and the Dutchmen should have found that the water was too fresh to communicate with the Pacific ocean . Salt making has been a business of great importance on the banks of the lake since the occupation of this territory by the Mormons . The water is so densely saline that it is impossible for a body to find the bottom . It is a capital place to acquire the art of swimming with perfect safety . In former times three barrels of water left to evaporate would produce one barrel of salt ; but the freshening within the last twenty years has so weakenened it that now four barrels of it are required to obtain that quantity . It has become fresh , therefore , in a proportion of somewhat more than one per cent . yearly . Hence it follows that in less than one hundred years the name of Great Salt Lake should be changed ; for by this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all its impurities . I have previously noticed the regular water lines , called benches , which are so distinctly defined on all the mountain ranges surrounding these various valleys , and which afford such unmistakable evidence that in former days they enclosed vast inland seas . The deep alkaline soil of the bottoms has led to the supposition that these seas were of salt water , and that all of them excepting this have been completely evaporated , Salt Lake being the sole survivor , and that being destined to dwindle to a puddle and then to dry up for ever . But the last part of this theory is negatived by the evident intention of the lake to assume somewhat of its original proportions ; while // it is becoming fresher , it is growing larger . Within the twenty-seven years that the country around it has been settled , it has encroached all along its low banks nearly a mile upon the land and deepened five feet . Several fine farms are now permanently under water , and the road on which we travelled has been moved far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this change is going on , atmospheric causes for a part of it are apparent . The climate is becoming more mild , although it is still excessively dry . But each succeeding season brings a greater rainfall . This has doubled within twelve years . The lake is fed by Bear river on the north and Jordan on the south , besides some small rivulets that find their way into it . Every year their volumes increase , and contribute to the filling up of the great basin into which they pour themselves . Notwithstanding this , the increase of the lake can not be thus accounted for , as they are still but insignificant streams . It must be true that new fresh-water fountains have burst out from the bottom , and are the chief causes of the increase . A like phenomenon has produced the lake near which we afterward passed at Stockton , where on the ground en camped upon by Connor 's army there is now a body of water two miles square and of considerable depth . If these changes go on as they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long become completely sub merged . His enemies will say that a second flood has been commissioned to overflow the desert that he has reclaim ed , because of the sins of the people , and that like Sodom and Gomorrah these modern cities of the plain have been overwhelmed as a punishment for their unnatural crimes . But those judgments are yet afar off . Brigham teaches that when Utah is destroyed all the earth will perish likewise , except ing that favored spot , Jackson county , Missouri . There it was that a divine revelation commanded him to build a temple which , although destroyed by the ruthless Gentiles , is destined to rise again from its ashes . All the low lands around it will rise at the same time , and the chosen remnant of mankind will flock to this elevated plateau , from whence , like Noah looking over the bulwarks of the ark , they shall behold the drowning Gentiles struggling in the deep waters , while Mormons , in dry , white robes , with harps in their hands , shall touch the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the universe . Then Jackson county itself is to be caught up , and its glorified saints are to be distributed among the stars of the firmament , where with crowns on their heads they are to reign for ever and ever . Thus th ? e gradual rise of Salt Lake is not an indication of their destruction , but a harbinger of their glory . Leaving Salt Lake far behind us , our way led over the spur of the Oquirrh ridge , which there tcrminates and forms the eastern boundary of Tooele valley . Soon aftcr we had dined at a wretched " half-way ' * house , we came in sight of the pretty little town of Toocle , that springs into life by the side of a mountain stream , enriching it by its irrigation and presenting it in beautiful contrast with the surrounding desert waste . It is not like a town laid out in blocks and squares , but it is literally an accumulation of garden spots . Each house is surrounded by the foliage of fruit trees and vines , almost hiding it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apples , pears , peaches2 melons , and grapes , which , being gathered , are dried and preserved for use and exportation . Entering one of the gardens , we were offered an abundance of the delicious produce . The peaches were large and luscious-quite equal in flavor to those gathered on the Delaware . This little village , now so peaceful and quiet , was lately the scene of intense political excitement ; the newspapers have been full of the election quarrels at Toocle . They have not related to Republicanism or Democracy . Such trifling issues did not affect // 318 THROUGH UTAH . votes in any degree . The people did not trouble themselves about the " third term " question , nor if there was a prospect of another rebellion , would they have thought the subject worthy of their consideration . The great question was , shall Judge Rowberry , the Mormon bishop , who for years had presided at the Probate Court , retain his office , or shall the Gentile Brown occupy his place ? In short , it was a religious fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Paradise Lost " could only approach in prose or poetry to an idea of the fury of the battle .. Mormon hosts were marshalled against the Gentile cohorts , the one considering themselves the armies of the Lord , and the others willing to be called the soldiers of Lucifer , so that they might gain the victory . Mormonism pressed every man and woman into its service , and the Gentile element ransacked all the mining camps of the country for its supplies . It was Lowlander against Highlander-the saints dwelling on the plains against the irreverent " cusses " of the mountains who had invaded the soil , heretofore sacred to the religion of the prophet . It was the first organized attempt to gain a Gentile foothold in any part of ti*e territory . The means used for the assault were as unscrupulous as those wielded for the defence . Governor Woods descended from the dignity of his office to mingle in the broil , threatening , when he was interrupted in his speech , to " punch the head " of his assailant , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not " dry up . " Parson Smith , of the Methodist persuasion , is such a muscular Christian that when he was damned by some devout Mormons , he replied to them that he was not allowed to swear , but , suiting the action to the words by throwing off his coat , he " would lick the whole crowd , three at a time . " . Per contra , in a rather more quiet style of warfare , when they found the election was going against them , the Mormon Judge and his clerk carried off the records of the court , which were not recovered without much difficulty . There was doubtless a great deal of illegal voting on both sides , from Mormon women who paid no taxes , and from Gentile miners who constituted themselves residents of two or three different camps at the same time . The end attained was a Gentile victory . The Probate Court is now in Gentile hands , and as Salt Lake City is in the same district , it is proposed to bring Brigham Young and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and to put down by this decisive blow the " twin relic of barbarism , " which has so heavily weighed upon the consciences of those virtuous mining Gentiles , so that they can henceforward drink their whiskey without molestation , and use their pistols and bowie knives in peace . This must be accomplished before the next election , for in the mean time Brigham , warned by the disastrous results of this campaign , will not fail to pour a sufficient Mormon reinforcement into Tooele county to insure a victory for the church , by reinstating the deposed judge and his clerk . II . Liun travellers on Sahara , we had espied the green oasis of Tooele from afar . We had entered beneath its shady trees and luxuriated in its fruitful gardens , and now , leaving it regretfully behind , we were whirled along by our six-horse team , through clouds of dust , over the desert again . All was a barren waste of stunted sage brush and alkali , till after three hours ' drive we came to the Gentile . settlement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charming little village of the saints . There the people , having planted their own vines and fig trees , were content to sit down beneath them and enjoy their fruits , with no ambitious desires of aggrandizement ; they are satisfied with the sure returns of husbandry , from which , after paying their tithing to the // church , there is an abundance left to supply all the absolute wants of life . Tooele is a picture of happiness , if not the realization of what can never be fully attained ; Stockton seemed to be a representation of misery sought for and found . Pitched on one of the bleakest spots that could be selected , where no tree can take root , and scarcely a sage brush can show its head , built of rambling piles of logs , the only exception an abortive frame house called a hotel , where bad dinners are eaten and worse liquors are quaffed , it is the home of a few workmen , who are employed in the neighboring furnaces of ore . What wages these men earn to repay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ execrable hole I do not know , but I am sure that a Tooele Mormon would not exchange his home for this , unless some special " exaltati&amp;n " be promised for the world to come . A Mormon will do everything for that . A man will fill his home with wives , and a woman will " go into polygamy , " thus living in a hell upon earth , with the joyful anticipation of a heaven in the future . Some such consideration as this might induce them to make a short stay in Stockton . It would be the only thing that would influence me . The Chicago Furnace Company own the works situated a mile beyond the town . This is operated by them for smelting the ore from their own mine , and also that which is offered to them by others . it is a very profitable concern , and being under efficient management is regarded with as great if not greater confidence than any other establishment of the kind in thedistrict . Passing the lake of recent formation , referred to in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the otherwise dreary landscape , we drove on toward Ophir . From the level of Salt Lake our ascent had been gradual . Although over what appeared to be vast plains , it was scarcely discernible . But now it was quite apparent as we drew on toward the foot hills of the range looming up grandly before us . The sun had been pouring hotly down upon us all the day , and it was an inexpressible relief and pleasure when we entered the mouth of the cafion , and the first tall cliff on the left threw its shadow over our path , permitting us to trace its dark outlines on the opposite mountain , whose summit was still in a blaze of brightness . In this delightful coolness of evening below , under the light of sunshine from above , we followed up the caflon for three miles , and arrived at the city of Ophir . Like all the mining " cities " of these mountains , Ophiris a mere camp , containing a few stores , bar-rooms , and shanties for the supplies and accommodation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hills , only visiting the cities fortheir necessities , or for the enjoyment of Sunday after their own fashion . One of the buildings serves the purpose of city hall , lyceum , dance-house , and church , as occasion demands . On the day after our arrival the pulpit scaffolding was occupied in the morning by an Episcopal clergyman , and in the evening by a Catholic priest , both of whom came in one coach from Salt Lake* When the latter preached , his Protestant brother aided with us in making the congregation to number a little more than a dozen . On the previous evening the hall had been crowded with dancers , who kept up a hideous noise till morning . Nevertheless it is fair to say that Sunday was very quietly observed , and there were few cases of drunkenness that caused much disturbance . But the Ophir citizens are not church-going as a class , though as tolerant as they are ignorant in religious matters . The other Sunday a Methodist clei ? gyman officiated , opening the services by requesting them to sing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God . " After the meeting one of the congregation thanked him for his preaching , adding ; " But , parson , you . was more . // comp'mentry than we deserves . I dunno 's Ophir camp 's any better'n the rest of em ; we all walks a good deal closer the other way . " I have a photograph of the hotel restaurant of Monsieur Simon , where last year I was so comfortably lodged , and where we were now welcomed by the proprietor with the same ceremony observed at a " descent " before a Parisian hotel . The " hotel restaurant " itself in the picture , but far more in the reality , presents a ludicrous contrast to its background of Zion mountain , towering three thousand feet above it . Whenever a stranger comes into these camps he is immediately encompassed by a crowd of kindly disposed gentlemen , who are willing to divide their interests in the most promising mines , which only require a little of your money for their development . They have prospects of wonderful " indications , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quartzite formations , " " hanging and foot walls , " " carbonate , " " chloride , ** and other certainties of producing unlimited quantities of rich ore , thousands of tons of which are frequently " in sight . " They want you to invest in the " running of tunnels " and the " sinking of shafts , " and then to " put the mine in the market , " in New York or London . As to " prospects , " the mountains are as full of them as sandbanks are ever bored by swallows for their nests . The laboring miners are universally poor . They keep themselves industriously in that condition ; toiling away at their prospects until their flour and bacon give out , and then working by the day in the large mines until they get money enough to buy powder and provisions to work on another prospect , when they find a " trace " or cropping out that affords them any hope . They have known or have heard of a few men who , having " struck a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own to the rank of millionaires , and why should not the same good fortune at last be theirs ? Instead of gambling with dice and cards , they gamble with the spade and pick , working harder and gaining as little . Among the thousand blanks there is occasionally a prize . The Walker brothers have drawn their full share . They came to Utah as members of the Mormon Church , toiled in the caflons , cutting and drawing wood , gained a little property in this way , invested in land and merchandise , paying their tithing with regularity , until they accumulated a property on the income of which they did not care to pay ten per cent . One day they were reminded of their duty by Brigham Young , and they sent him a check for ten thousand dollars . Brigham returned it with a notice that it was insufficient , whereupon they tore it up , paid tithing no longer , and left the Church . They say the Lord has prospered them ever since . Brigham says the devil hasbeen their friend . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done something for themselves . Their great warehouses are potent rivals of " Zion 's Cooperative Mercantile Institution , " and every hole of ground into which they dig becomes a mine of wealth . They own them in every cafion , and here in Ophir they reign supreme . What wonder is it that poor men , who but a few years ago worked side by side with these Walker brothers , should ask themselves , " As we have been equals once , why should we not be equals again ? " m . Tins pursuits of Utah people may be classed like medicines , " vegetable " and- " mineral . " The Mormons are almost strictly agricultural , and the Gentiles devote themselves nearly universally to mining labor and speculation . Brigham encourages his saints to cultivate the soil , and preaches farming to them as a religious duty . The wisdom of his advice is apparent in the success attending its practice . They abandon the precarious chances of the // qwq grade mines now abandoned will start again into life , and " prospects " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be given to mining enterprise that a Gentile population will pour into the territory sufficient to out-vote the Mormons and satiate the ambition of those virtuous officeseekers whose morality is daily shocked by the iniquities around them . Mr. Goodspeed may prove a more successful missionary than the Rev. Dr. Newman . We spent a day in climbing the mountains on horseback and on foot , with the purpose of looking at some of the mines on the summit of Zion mountain . At an almost perpendicular height of twenty-five hundred feet above the village , and consequently eleven thousand feet above the level of the sea , is a mine owned by the Walker Brothers , which they work to supply the demands of their mill , getting out yearly , without any special development , the interest on the sum of $1,500,000 , the price at which they offer to sell this little bit of their property . As we wound up the mountain on the opposite side of the valley to a still higher point , we looked down upon their extensive works and tramways , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led first to Dry cai'ion , to arrive at which we passed through Jacob City . This city , not " set upon a hill , " but hanging like a collection of crows ' nests on the side of a mountain , can not be approached on wheels . Sure-footed horses and mules are rather doubtful of their foothold in its streets , paved with boulders and drained by the gully of a torrent . If heavy raius should swell the stream as they are liable to do , or an avalanche of snow , which every winter threatens , should descend , the flimsy structures of Jacob City would fly down into the abyss below like a pile of shingles before the storm . Precarious indeed is the existence or the capital of Dry cafion . As we ascend , we see on the left the celebrated " Mono " mine , one half of which was cheaply sold last summer for $400,000 . We met Mr. Gisborne , who owns the other half . The net income of the mine is said to average $60,000 per month . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City , clothed in a shabby suit that at most could not have cost twenty dollars , smoking a cigar made far away from Cuba , and all his surroundings betokening a man in debt for his last meal , we asked ourselves , what is the use to him of an income of $360,000 per year ? A little boy once wished he was a king , for " then he would swing on a gate all day and lick lasses . " We perhaps would do something similar if we had the income of Mr. Gisborne . We would *uy a house on the Fifth avenue , loaf about the streets of New York , visit the clubs , and do nothing . We would have the dyspepsia and die of ennui . I apprehend that Mr. Gisborne values his immense fortune only as a proof of his success as a business man , and is far happier in his mountain life , in exuberant health , than he would find himself if he followed any bad advice that we could give him . On the other side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There we dismoUnted and descended into the bowels of the earth , down a shaft for hundreds of feet , through tunnels and drifts , dropping down on ladders , crawling on all fours through damp caverns , as we carried lighted candles in our hands , meeting begrimed workmen , and startled by the report of subterranean blasts . Here we saw the ore , deep buried for ages , now to be excavated , smelted , refined , coined and made into wealth for the luxury of those who will never see and pity as we have done the hard toil by which it is being obtained . A very productive property in the mountains is a beautiful spring of water , running in a small stream over a great cliff of a thousand feet , and then descending in thin spray to an unapproachable chasm . The proprietor located this claim , and there he has established himself for the sale of all // the water on the mountain ; for it is only after the melting of the snows that , for a short time , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is no drilling or blasting needed to produce wealth for this fortunate man . He sells the water for two and a half cents per gallon , thus realizing thousands of dollars annually without the outlay of a penny . The " Mono " and the " Chicago " may give out , but the spring is not likely to dry up . Leaving our horses at a place where their further progress was impracticable , we proceeded on foot , though often swinging by our arms from one craggy rock to another , over the topmost ridge , to survey some prospects in which the gentlemen who accompanied us were interested . The location of a " prospect " is determined by various indications , the chief of which is the presence of a yellow ochre-colored dust . This leads to " croppings , " the ore on the surface containing mineral . These " croppings " afford encouragement for the miner to sink a tunnel , epon which he works nine times out of ten without success . We returned to the place where our horses had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divide above the Chicago mine to the side of the mountain sloping down toward Ophir . At a distance of a mile and a half above the village we came to the Gray Rock mine , of which Col. Kelley , a veteran miner , is the manager and a large owner . His superintendent politely waited upon us through the shaft and tunnels , pointing out the course of the vein , which measured four and a half feet , the assays of it showing thirty to forty per cent . of lead and thirty to fifty ounces of silver . The upper tunnel is 100 feet long ; the one below it is 300 feet , and it is under contract to go 100 feet more . After walking 250 feet in the second tunnel , we came to an air shaft connecting the two tunnels , and at the same point another shaft of 100 feet is contracted for dev*lopment into a proposed tunnel below . It is already down sixty feet , and is constantly showing richer ore . It was explained to us that this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , the mine is located where one formation is split off from another , by a convulsion of nature , so that it cuts the stratification . When ore is thus found , the inference is that a greater body of mineral below , has split the mountain . Therefore the miner , with an almost certain expectation , is encouraged to penetrate the earth until he arrives at the rich deposit which caused the fissure where the ore was first discovered , near the surface . These fissure veins are rather uncommon . Veins generally run with instead of across the stratification . Indeed ; most of the mines are of this character . Many of them are very profitable , but there is a much greater uncertainty about the continuance of fissure veins . The " walls " that enclose the veins are smooth surfaces of brimstone and quartzite , or limestone and slate , sometimes limestone on both sides . Good and bad veins are found in all these formations . Although in the course of our toilsome yet pleasurable day 's work we visited several other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with any more descriptions , the working of the " Chicago " and " Gray Rock , " two of the most prominent , being fair samples of the whole . If all that h*as been said can be digested as well as the good supper at M. Simon 's was assimilated after our excursion upon the mountains , some ideas will be formed perhaps not previously entertained of silver-mining operations . JOHN CODHAN.
