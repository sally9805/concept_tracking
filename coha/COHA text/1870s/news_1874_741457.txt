txt Whatever we may , any of us , think in regard to the education of girls by the same system and under the same circumstances as boys , we must all:concede that the girls labor under one disadvantage that ought to be removed as speedily and as completely as possible . They do not obtain nearly their proper share of that pure air which is just as essential to their healthy development , and to the happiness of their future lives , as it is to the other sex . Boys enjoy a liberty that we can not accord to They can run , ride , row , swim , play ball , fish and hunt , and some , one or more of these things they always manage to do , whatever may be the means or the disposition of their parents . Their natural tendencies , and the incentive of emulation , keep thorn a great deal of the time actively engaged in out-door exercise , and the narrow streets and pent-up dwellings of the City do not wholly confine them .

Riding is expensive , mid our pavements , slippery , rough , and full of pit-holes , often make it dangerous . The waters that surround the City are not easily accessible , and are , for the most part , too crowded to admit of rowing by girls . Gardening , though by no means out of the question , has but limited scope in our small " yards " at the rear of our houses , where nothing but pure love of the pursuit can attract our girls . The gymnasium , as it exists hi schools , is generally but poorly cared for , is often defective in ventilation , and not kept free from dust , so that energetic exercise taken there is sometimes worse than none at all . In the midst of these difficulties , the parent who appreciates the absolute necessity of affording his young daughters vigorous exercise in pure open air may well be discouraged . Yet the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with it . The girl who habitually breathes air deficient in oxygen , or burdened with dust and other impurities , or who fails each day to get exercise in such air sufficient to stimulate the lungs , set the blood Bowing rapidly , and awaken the nervestoactivity , lsbonndtofail in the severe trials to which in her maturer years she will be subjected . The process by which the healthful constitution , strong to perform and to endure , is built up , is dependent on several well-defined conditions . The different parts of the system must be exercised , the blood must be well-fed and sufficiently aerated , and for this the lungs must have plenty of good air , and must receive it while in a state of moderate stimulation . Steady , frequent , pleasurable activity in the open air is an imperative reani.Tement of health , and it is peculiarly imperative in the case of young and growing girls . ? What , then , is to be done t That is a question which each parent must answer , to some extent , in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are , of course , in the case of the great mass of our population ? families who are neither poor nor rich  --  insuperable objections to the more expensive means of providing open-air exercise for their children . But there are few who are entirely destitute of resources . For one thing , a school can be selected at a distance of a mile or more from home , and the girls can be required to walk to and from it when in good health . If they can secure pleasant companions from among their acquaintances and schoolmates , so mach the hotter . The air of our streets is by no means the best , but it is the best we have , and ought to be freely used . Except cases of sickness  --  when girls ought to be rigidly kept from school entirely  --  the walk morning and afternoon might with advantage be insisted on in all except the most extremely stormy weather . Injurious heat is seldom encountered during school terms . Another resource that should be diligently used is the Saturday excursion , in fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New-York , and , if may be , a game of croquet . One bright and gay afternoon of innocent pleasure in the open air each week ought , if possible , to be provided for every girl . If parents plead , as some will , that they have not time to supervise such excursions , we are bound to say that to provide healthy pleasures for children is a part of the duties of a parent , the responsibility for which is assumed when the relation is entered on , and the cost of which , in every way , ought to be taken into account as much as any other consideration . There is still another way of securing exercise and good air for girls , which is a trifle old-fashioned , but which we are convinced might be brought again into general use with great advantage . It is the performance of household work , in rooms with open windows and a good current of fresh air blowing through them .

We venture to commend it as worth at least an experiment .
