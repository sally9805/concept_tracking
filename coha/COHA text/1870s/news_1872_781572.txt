txt deleted paragraph Senator WiLsort owes his nomination in a treat measure-to his own hard services and ugh character  --  but he must also thank Senator SUMNER for some share in bringing about the result . The delegates were determined to express their opinion of the shameful slanders which Mr. SUMNER poured out against the President , and to give his fellow-Senator the second place on the ticket with Gen. Giterr seemed to afford the most allectual means of gratifying this desire . We believe it is a positive fact that lfr . SUMNER was fully convinced that his tirade would prevent the nomination of General GRANT at Philadelphia ! It is only mother proof of the fact that a man may nurse and " coddle " his vanity until it completely runs away with his judgment . We do not suppose that Mr. SUMNER has any misgivings about his recent course , for in his eyes whatever Mr. SUMNER does must be right . His friends , however , can all see pretty plainly how irreparable is the mistake he has committed , and if the question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Massachusetts , he would find out what the people of that State think of his descending to become a conduit for:Clumps A. DANA 'S slanders . Mr. WILSON is very popular with the working classes , and he well . deserves the recognition he has received . He is'a strong man , and will assist the ticket  --  if it needed . any assistance  --  in various directions . It is : only proper , however , for us to add that Mr. COLFAX has not lost one particle of the respect or confidence of the country . The feeling for him at Philadelphia was of the kindest description , and we wish he could have heard the cordial manner in which the delegations spoke of him . An odd story has crept about to the effect that newspaper correspondents were decidedly against Mr. COLFAX . If they were , it made no difference one way or the other . Journalists are men of little influence when they step out from their papers to advocate any man , and their incapacity for " running " a convention was sufficiently proved at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had anything to do with the nomination of HENRY WILSON , they merely afford a fresh application of the fable in which the fly on the wheel expresses prodigious astonishment at the dust he is raising . Newspaper men seldom show to so little advantage as when they are fussing about to get this or that candidate elected. ; and if they could only get it into their heads how little people respect or care for them , apart from their papers , it would . save them a world of trouble , and sometimes prevent them making great fools of themselves . Mr. COLFAX can scarcely be said to be defeated . The rivalry  --  if such it was  --  was conducted on the most friendly terms , and we are far from believing that the public would be contented to see Mr. COLFAX relegated . permanently to private life . He will vet occupy a distinguished and useful position in the country . He has done absolutely nothing to forfeit the confidence with which he has long been regarded . We should . have been happy to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  but it is a satisfaction to know that his successor is a man in every way deserving of the honor paid to him . The sentiment prevailed very generally among the delegates that Mr. WILSON deserved some reward for his services , and . that it was not wise to postpone that reward too long . We shall not takeleave of Mr. COLFAX when Mr. WILSON succeeds him , but rely confidently on seeing him once more in a prominent position before the nation , and still followed . by their cordial respect and good wishes . Altogether , this Convention will rank as one of the moat memorable in our history . The delegations were composed of singularly able and independent men . It is the stupidest of all slanders to represent those gentlemen as " corrupt office-holders , " as the - Tribune does , for that only offends the people of the States from which they come , and does not really deceive anybody . The insults which the Tribune has leveled at the Convention are dictated by the merest fatuity , and will go far toward . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two parties who know how false are the Tribune 's assertions  --  the delegates themselves and the people who sent them . What is the good , then , of " telling lies , " as GREELEY used . to call it , which have not even the negative merit of taking anybody in ? The truth is that the Convention was an extremely creditable body of men , and they did their work in a most intelligent and . businesslike manner . What they have done the people will ratify , as surely as the sun will rise and set today . Let us only work carefully and properly , and while despising the enemy ? as we can not help doing , for he is at once a foolish and dishonest enemy  --  take care to circutnvent his " dodges , " and the Democrats , with GREELEY at their head , will be consigned to certain destruction in November . By all means let us get GREELEY and all of them in one pit , so that they may be decently interred with as little expense and trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
