txt Two or three of the gentlemen who adhered to the " Liberal " organization after the North Carolina election of 1872 are determined to remain above ground . Of these , as of the Church at Sardis , it may be said . " Thou hast a name that thou livest , and art dead . " It was reported that Mr. FENToN had signified his intention of voting with the Republicans this Pall . Whereupon the persistent gentlemen above referred to made up their minds that they world I hold a convention . Wby not e Everybody holds conventions . Spiritualists , bricklayers , book-sellers , and lumbermen meet in convention . There is no good reason why the forlorn and post-mortem remains of the Greeley Party should not have a conyenton , all by themselves . It could not hurt anybody . and it might afford amusement to some . So Cochrane , the ornate and eloquent , decided to have a " Liberal " rally at Albany , just to show that Mx . FENTON was not , in his own proper person , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three other men who claimed to be that association . COCHRANE says he is the " 1 , iberal " Party , and that the organization was not wholly merged when Mr. FENTON returned to the Republicans . The organic remains came together at Albany yesterday , and great was the rattling of dry bones . Gen. COCHRANE , who always has an eye on any contingent remainders - which may give him a few crumbs of City Hall patronage , acted as residuary legatee . Ho shook up the party skeleton with great animation , and , in the language of slangy reporters , " sailed into " the Republican Party with all his accustomed vehemence and impassioned earnestness . Gen. COCHRANE is never frugal of his adjectives when he has a Republican Administration to assail . Whether it is LINCOLN 'S or GRANT 'S , the redoubtable carpet-knight has a  --  prodigal way of letting loose his adjectives , adverbs , and descriptive nouns . Then there was " BEN " WILLIE , that pure and . spotless patriot , elected to Congress from this City on a " Reform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the legatees of the Greeley Party . WILLIE , who signalized his intention of making Washington his future home by opening a " law " office at the national capital immediately after his election , was there with a proposition to indorse TILDEN 'S ticket , out of hand , as it were . Then there was a flagitious person from Kings County , who was not willing that the Tribune should run the " Liberal " Party . This mischief-maker actually said that if the orders of " the Great Moral Organ " were followed , and no action taken by the convention , he might as well have staid at borne . He bad had his journey to Albany for nothing . Ho was quite right . There was no occasion for the Kings County delegate , nor , for that matter , for the other five members of the convention , to go about parading their dry bones in the " gay beams of garish day . " However , since this melancholy assembly had met under such peculiarly depressing circumstances , they might as well tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they approved of Gov . TILDEN . One delegate wanted . the " convention " to say that they approved of both State tickets now in the field , but would give their entire six votes to the Democratic candidates , with an assurance that they could be happy with either were t' other dear charmer away . This uncommercial proposition - was smothered , and the Democracy were effusively welcomed as the final depositary of the mortuary relics of the " Liberal " Party . There were , of course , the usual inflammatory declarations about the rights of man , the a3gis of our liberties , a free press , march of civilization , and administrative reform , all of which has the familiar ring of CocaRANE 'S speeches and the editorial articles in the Tribune . The irrepressible delegate from Kings County persisted in asking that the meeting declare that it indorsed the Democratic ticket , and that the " Liberal " and Democratic Parties were identical . This , of course , was too straightforward . It was not intended to spoil any possible trade by accepting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six melancholy relics of the disastrous campaign of 1872 were identical with any party organization was a little too impudent for even the serene COCHRANE to attempt . So the Kings County man subsided , and the convention , as they called it , was adjourned . There had been some talk of hanging out a sign , which should inform an incurious public that the concern had gone into liquidation , and that inquiring creditors would find the accounts of " the ' late deceased " at the head-quarters of the Democratic State Central Committee . Encouraged , however , by the appearance of a fair number of idle spectators , drawn into the hall by the amusing spectacle of Gen. COCHRANE in the act of making a speech , the mourners brightened up a bit and seriously talked of coming together again . One bold man said that there ought to be a National Convention . A Broadway stage would contain the New-York remnant ; but , reinforced by NEWTON BOOTH , the solitary man from California , and GRATZ BROWN , the eminent Missouri blatherskite , the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ends to hold another public auction in 1876.
