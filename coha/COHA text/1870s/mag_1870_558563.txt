ART . IV . - CONGRESSIONAL REFORM . THE adoption of the Fifteenth Amendment seems to have brought to a fitting close the struggle which has absorbed onr national politics for more than a quarter of a century , and the relations of the black and white races must now appareiitly be left to be adjusted by time . Other problems are pressing for solution , the neglect of which threatens disasters hardly less serious than those which we have so lately encountered . In the first fifty years following the establishment of the Union the functions of the general government were extremely limited . The conduct of our foreign affairs and of the moderate army and navy , the small civil service required for the post-offices and the collection of the customs , which more than sufficed for the national expenses ,  --  all these went on without much interference or connection with the mass of internal affairs in the hands of the States . As the generation of great men born of the Revolution passed away , the intellectual , if not moral , character , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declined . The encroachments of the slave power and the antislavery agitation overshadowed all other political interests , and upon this contest were charged all the increasingly manifest defects of our Federal organization . The conservative party accused the abolitionists of absorbing the time and attention of Congress with their wrangling , while the latter refused to see any public duty comparable in importance with opposition to the enemy which , not only in their view , but in that of foreign nations , threatened the speedy overthrow of the Republic . It will hardly be denied that most , if not all , of our prominent political leaders owe their positibus to the tenacity with which for many years they maintained a stubborn resistance to the slave power . We use the term " leaders " with reference to Congress , because , as we shall presently attempt to show , the members of the executive are not leaders in the sense of directing legislation . Good and faithful service these men have done , and the eduntry owes and acknowledges a debt of gratitude . But while the main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favor , and while they are still occupied with theories and experiments of // reconstruction ,  --  a subject which , if not wholly to be left to time , is at all events of minor importance ,  --  we think there is through the country an increasing and painful sense of their inability to deal with other questions which now occupy the first rank . The civil service , which has been so vastly increased , and the condition of which excites such despairing comment ; the diplomatic service , perhaps not too severely characterized as the wont known to any civilized nation ; the management of the finances , including the public debt , the customs , considered both as a means of revenue and of protection , and the currency and banking systems , which have assumed such formidable proportions ; and , finally , the manner in which private interests have assumed the control of the government ; - these all are matters of which the vital importance will not be disputed . Yet if we look at the manner of conducting business in Congress , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bills and resolutions introduced at random by any member , and 4uietly referred to committees ; if we consider that the real measures to be acted upon are discussed and prepared in secret committees subject to the tremendous pressure of private interests , which govetn not only the manner of treatment , but the subjects themselves to be tre*ted ; and , further , that the measures thus elaborated are reported to Congress without any official explanation of the theory and arguments.upon which they are bed , or of their relation to the general plan of legislation ; that debate is suppressed or amounts only to a mere form ; and that , after lying in abeyance during most of the session , these bills are hurried through at last by a getieral party vote , and because something must be one ; - under these circumstances , what hope or prospect is there of any intelligent , comprehensive , and systematic treatment of the great problems which we have just now mentioned ? The fundamental defect of organization seems to be in the separation and diffusion of powdr and responsibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heads of the executive departments . The practical operation of legislative measures must be conducted by them ; and as the efficiency or the reverse of the subordinate agencies must be better known to them and better judged of by them than any // one else , the individual changes and appointments and the method of condncting business should be , in a great measure , under their guidance . Under our system these heads of departments have little or no power . In the expression of their wishes , they are limited to their annual reports , which Congress can attend to or not as it pleases , and to private interviews with the committees . Should these committees fall to adopt their views , or should they even report bills adverse to them , the officials have no remedy whatever , but must accept and carry out whatever measures Congress sees fit to adopt . They may , it is true , complain in their next report ; but as this not very dignified proceeding does not compel Congress to defend its course , the country presumes that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Having thus but little power , heads of departments can not be held to any strict responsibility . Whatever the failures of a secretary 's administration , except in cases so flagrant as to justify extreme measures , Congress has no power of calling him to account ; nor can it obtain from him any explanations or information , unless by messages in response to cumbrous resolutions , which messages probably reach Congress only after it has passed on to , and is absorbed by , other business . Tnrning next to Congress , we find that the initiative of legislation , which should properly belong to the chief official of the branch of the public service to be affected , actually belongs to nobody in particnlar . Any member may introduce a bill or resolution upon any subject in which he feels an interest . A dozen of these may be presented upon the same subject , which differ entirely from one another . The member who presents a bill usually feels called upon to accompany it with a speech . This takes np the time of the body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constituents , has no practical effect , because the real measure to be acted upon is to come from a committee . All these promiscuous bills and resolutions are referred to committees , and as the real work is done in them , Congress is at liberty to divide its time between " bunkum " speeches and personal contests , which together make up the bulk of its proceedings. * * " To keep a legislature efficient , it must have a sufficient supply of substantial business . If you employ the best set of men to do nearly nothing , they will quarrel with each other about that nothing . " - The English Gonstitution , by W. BAGEHOT . London , 1869. // The preparation of legislative measures in committees is perhaps indispensable , but the manner of conducting this preparation , and the extent to which it is carried , seem to be open to the gravest objection . All the new material , including reports of secretaries and the propositions of individual members , are thrown into this retort . Each subject of legislation is handed over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention . Private interests , which would be almost powerless if they had to deal with the whole body of members acting openly before the country , find their labors greatly simplified , and as the work of committees is done in secret , the efforts of the lobby are effectually screened from the public eye . The committees are composed wholly of members of Congress , each amenable to a small section of constituents , and naturally attending more to the interests of these than to those of the whole country . It is natural , also , that the committees should be led to report measures likely to meet the approbation of the Honses as actually composed , rather than such as being in themselves just and expedient , may yet be unpopular with members , and require the aid of public opinion to force their adoption . Could there be an arrangement more suited to induce corruption , direct or indirect ? When these measures , thus adjusted upon a balance of special interests , rather than upon general principles of equity , are reported to the houses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppressed . Public discussion is not the ordeal with reference to which the bills have been framed , and even if there is opposition , it is from individuals , and is neutralized by the shades of difference between them . There is no leader to gather up the dissenticuts and oppose their united force to an obnoxious bill . Members who have no direct interest resign themselves to voting with their party , being shielded from responsibility through the enforced ignorance of their constituents . It often happens , - indeed it is almost always the case with the most important measures , - that bills are held over to the end of the session from the known uncertainty of commanding support , and then rushed through because opposition is hopeless . When legislation of this kind , without any general plan or defined purpose , is handed over to a secretary , who has hitherto had no official // share in it , to be carried out as he best may , how is it possible that the best talents of the country cau be secured in the departments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the office of the public press to keep the people informed concerning measures , and to guide them in the elections . But not to mention that the press is quite as often interested to mislead as to enlighten , it is out of the question that any considerable proportio i of the people should read or digest the diYfering views of hundreds of journals . Congress is the real centre at which the people should learn the reasons of legislation , and get the means of judging of the conduct , principles , and abilities of their representatives . Under the present system no such facilities are afforded them . The questions of slavery and the war were porfeetly simple . Tile people comprehended these , and the manner in which they performed their duty , and the sacrifices which they cheerfully made for the right , give us every reason to be hopeful , wherever the popular will and intelligence can be brought to bear . But the questions which are now pressing upon us are technical , and call for the exercise of statesmanship . It is of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people do not understand the subjects , and require to be led . The general principle which we would indicate as the starting-point of reform is this , that the Executive , which represents the whole people , as distinct from members of Congress , who represent their several bodies of constituents , should have a direct voice in the shaping of legislation , and should to the same extent be held responsible for its results . To illustrate the idea , we will take the office of the Secretary of the Treasury . Suppose that instead of sending in an annual written report , he were to state his views orally before the House , and that one or more days were afterwards set apart for the discussion of the views presented . He should be open to cross-examination by any member , and thus the general nature and principles of the legislation proposed might be sifted and discussed in the presence of the country . Thenceforward , at stated intervals during the session , he should be present in the House in order to explain , either of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working of the machinery of his department , and of acts previously passed , and to suggest such improvements , and // ask for such further powers as he might deem necessary . The Secretary should further have the right of attendance at the meeting , not only of the Committee of Ways and Means , but of all other committees upon business connected with his department . With such a position and such responsibility , not only would he have no sympathy with the private interests at work upon the committees , but his interest being identified with the success of his administration , he would be directly opposed to them . If the bills thus prepared and reported to the House were in accordance with the views of the Secretary , it would be for his interest that they should be thoroughly discussed and explained , not only to members , but to the country at large . He would , therefore , desire that certain days , separated by an interval of a week or more , should be set apart for the first , second , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only inform themselves , but gather the sense of their constituents . If , on the other hand , the bills were adverse to the plans of the Secretary , it would be for him to point out the defects , to propose amendments , or to urge the recommitment of the subject . Supposing his opposition to represent the interest of the country against private combinelion , he would serve as a rallying-point for the independent members , who have now no means of uniting their forces . It is evident that such a position would call for ability of the first class . The shield which is now held before mediocrity by isolation , and by the fact that the Secretary is a mere instrument for carrying out tije plans of others , - plans in forming which he has had but little influence , and for which he can not , therefore , be held responsible ,  --  would be removed . A man who had not a clear and definite policy , and the ability to defend it , would be overwhelmed by the attacks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other hand , the opportunity for ability to make itself felt would furnish an attraction for the highest class of intellect . The demands made upon the opposition , also , would tend to bring the foremost men to the front , and would direct the choice of the President in the formation of new Cabinets , in place of his being 19ft , as now , to select members almost at random . Candidates for the Presidency would also be presented upon their own merits , instead of upon // the " availability " which nominating conventions usually find in utter obscurity. * Congressional proceedings , instead of being regarded as now almost with contempt , as having no practical result , would be read with interest , as a key to the spirit of legislation . A new basis would also be given for the method of congressional elections , and relief might be furnished from the present system of nominations in caucus . A fundamental difference between Congress and the Secretary might involve the resign ati on of the latter , and it may be urged that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms , - an objection to which we shall recur presently . Meantime we propose to , consider some instances of the working of our present system , and the manner in which the remedy suggested may be expected to operate . To begin with the diploniatic service . In an article which appeared in this Review , t Mr. Henry Brooks Adams gave the history of an attempt commenced by Mr. Everett in 1858 to establish a system of consular pupils . The effort was often repeated through a period of ten years by Mr. Marcy , Mr. Cass , and Mr. Seward , the process and the result being constantly the same . The Secretary , by great efforts with the Senate committee , would induce * The London Economist of June 4 , after praising the conduct of General Grant during the Fenian invasion of Canada , remarks - " Bat enough has happened since his election to show that he is by no means equal to exerting influence at all , good or had , on a great many of the most important political questions of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first ; an ( l it is quite certain that if America had had equal means of knowing the firmness and constancy and good sense of any generally infoi4ned politician , the choice of such a man as President would have been already full of benefit to the country , which General Grant , from the extreme limitation of his political knowledge auti interest , has not been able to confer . A statesman as well known to the people as General Grant - as well known to Americans , say , as Mr. Gladstone is to us - would have had quite equal confidence in himself and in his countrymen , and would , besides , have felt that confidence on a hundred other subjects on which the expression of an authoritative judgment would at once turn the scale of public opinion . What American institutions seem to us to want most , is the means of familiarizing the country with such statesmen . And this we do not see how the Republic can ever have , till it gives to Congress the paramount importance attaching to a body which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of tlmis conclusion is not wlmat we should adhere to , but we agree to its substance , namely , that statesmen should be found and made known to the public hy open debate in Con gress . I Uc*ober , 1s69. // it to bring in a bill for the purpose ; but there would be nobody to support or defend it , and it would fall under the shallow rhetoric of individuals who feared it might conflict with the congressional power of appointment . Finally , under Mr. Seward , a bill was forced through both houses . The system worked well , consular pupils were appointed , some of great promise were trained , and three of them appointed to office ; within a short period , however , two out of the three were sacrificed to the political jobbery of rotation in office . Probably not one person in ten thousand in this country knows anything of this history . But if the Secretary of State had held a place in the Senate with or without a vote , and had been thus in a position to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merits of the case , and would , or at least might , have secured a different result . We will quote two other cases before quitting foreign affairs . The result of the treaty with Denmark , as to the island of St. Thomas , is most mortifying to our national pride . The Danes were at first very reluctant to treat . By persistent efforts , however , Mr. Seward induced them to entertain proposals . The price was arranged , a vote of the inhabitants of the island taken , and the affair was supposed to be concluded , when lo ! the Senate refused to confirm the treaty , and the Danes were informed , to their astonishment , that , in consequence of this , all previous negotiations must go for nothing . One may easily judge how ready foreign nations will henceforth be to deal with our State department ! Had Mr. Seward occupied a place in the Senate , taking part in its deliberations , and being himself open to question , he could not , at least without great personal obloquy , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Senate had been previously rendered certain . Again , Mr. Sumner 's speech upon the Alabama question created the greatest excitement in England . It was hardly possible for an Englishman to conceive that so important a speech , made by our leading statesman on the subject of foreign affairs , could be utterly without significance as regards the policy of the government . Had the Secretary of State been present in the Senate , he must have committed the government either dircetly or by silence , or , on the other hand , must have disarmed the attack by positive dissent . Indeed , in that cas Mr. Sumner would // probably never have made the speech , without being sure whether it expressed the views of the government . The diplomatic service suffers in common with the civil service from perhaps the greatest evil which afflicts our national affairs , - rotation in office for political purposes . Mr. Adams points out , in the article referred to , the fearful development to which this system has attained . He describes it as the result of the usurpation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and states , as we think justly , that unless checked it will certainly result in national corruption and decay , and the ultimate overthrow of the government . Having read with interest his statement of the facts , we looked eagerly for a corresponding indication of the remedy . But in this he seems to us to have failed . His points are , first , that the President , resisting legislative infiueiice , should himself institute a competitive examination for office , or some other method of appointment , if any other appear preferable ; and , secondly , that a sound public opiiiion should force Congress to keep its hands off of the functions of the executive . As to the first remedy , he admits that we have never had , and probably never may have , a President less trammelled by his antecedents , a person of more resolute firmness , than General Grant ; and yet that the President has been forced to succumb completely . As to public opinion , the elections are now managed by office-seeking politicians , availing themselves of party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is aware of the existing corruption and laments it , very few persons know anything of the details of the process by which General Grant has for the first time been brought to a surrender . How can Congress , constituted and elected as that body is , be brouo*ht by public opinion to give up a power which constitutes its very life ? We believe that the Executive must fight its own battles . If under the present system it is too weak to do so , a fair field must be furnished it in which it may state its c0se before the people , in order that it may throw itself upon the country . In 1868 Mr. Jeuckes , of Rhode Island , introduced a bill for the reform of the civil service , which was hailed by the country with delight . It was referred to a committee , from which place of retirement it has once or twice emerged , only to be summarily recommitted. // Mr. Adams thinks that it is not suited to accomplish its . object . But if it were never so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success . Even if a committee could be induced to report it , it would encounter the fiercest opposition from almost the entire House , and there is nothing in the position of Mr. Jenckes or of any other member which would give him the authority of a leader to unite the scattered forces of the minor . ity . We suppose the department most interested in the civil service to be the Treasury . if the Secretary of the Treasury were to introduce into the House in person a measure of reform , pointing out , as no one ought to be able to do better , the evils of the existing system , and the necessity of the change for the proper administration of his department , the vote of every member would be carefully . watehed by his constituents , and he would be held to a strict account . if Congress refused to adopt the measure , the Secretary would appeal to the country , both in debate in the House and by speeches in the intervals of sessions , - a practice of " stumpiiig " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the government , would cease to have that undignified appearance which it now presents . One of the departments of our government administration which causes the most pain and humiliation to humane and par . triotic citizens is that of Indian Affitirs. it is charged that our treaties with the tribes , even when well made , are badly executed ; that the agents intrusted with the payment of pensions , etc. , are of the most corrupt kind ; and it is evident that when the Indians , exasperated by repeated acts of treachery and oppression , resort to hostilities , an Indian war furnishes a golden harvest to thousand of adventurers seeking to fatten upon the government expenditure . Nominally , this branch of administration belongs to the Secretary of the Interior . He has , however , no power of proposing to , and demanding of , Congress and the country a settled scheme of policy which shall remedy these abuses . On the other hand , there is no one in Congress who can be held directly responsible . Members may vent their in ? . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have charge of the subject , because the difficulty may be citherin the scheme of policy or in the execution of it ; andthe former being inthecoutrolof the committee , audthelatterin thit otto // Secretary , neither is responsible for the results of the policy adopted . The enormous grants of land to railways , which are exciting so much comment , furnish another illustration in point . Each one passes through on its own merits , if the word is not a misnomer ; or if there is anything like concert of action , it is among the varions interests which leAd each other support for the purpose of avoiding opposition . Anything like a permanent and comprehensive policy is not possible to Congress and its committees of constantly changing members , mostly little familiar with precedents . It is true the members of the Cabinet change also , but the necessities of executive administration require a more connected system , and with junction of power and responsibility , a traditional policy would be likely to arise , in which past experience would be brought to bear upon present and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as others see us , " we will quote , with reference to another department , an extract from the Pall Mall Gazette of April 22d - " Inst uces arc occurring cv cry day illustrative of that peculiar feature of the Presidential or American form of government which excludes the ministers of the executive from the legislative chambers . The manner in which the funding and tariff bills are just now faring at the hands of irresponsible members in Congress , and the inconsistent and contradictory resolutions so frequently adopted in both houses with regard to them , while the Secretary of the Treasury , who has to administer the finances of the country , is obliged to look idly on , are cases in point . But perhaps an equally good illustration is afforded by the attempted ' army legislation of the I ) resent session . About a year ago the strength of the United States military forces was reduced by the disbandment of twenty regiments . The officers of these regiments , however , were all retained in the service , to the number of five hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a quarter of a million sterling . As they were not needed , General Logan , the chairman of the Military Committee of the i-louse of Representatives , shortly after the meeting of Congress , in December last , introduced a bill for saving this sum . lie did not propose to dismiss the identical officers whom the chances of disbandment had left without employment . The principle he adopted was that a carefully organized board was to be appointed , and to it was to be remitted the duty of seleetin0 the five // hundred officers whose services could best be dispensed with . They were then to be mustered out , receiving a year 's pay and allowances as compensation . The bill passed the house with remarkable unanimity , and was approved by the press of the country generally . But when it came to the Senate , it was there met by Mr. Wilson with a rival scheme . In the first place , Mr. Wilson proposes to reduce the army still further , fixing its strength at 25,000 men . In the second place , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not ; and in the third place , instead of a year 's pay and allowances , he would give only six months in some cases , while he would allow eighteen months in others . But not only does Mr. Wilson propose to reduce the army still further , contrary to the declared opinion of General Sherhun , and at the same time fail to secure the reduction of taxation which the House bill aimed at , he actually provides for the appointment of more officers in the staff corps . These corps were constituted in 1866 , on the calculation that the army was to consist of 75,000 men . When last year the army was reduced to about 35,000 , it was enacted that no vacancy should be filled up until the proportion before existing should be again attained . But . Senator Wilson 's bill repeals the prohibition . of new appointments in three out of seven of the corps . General Sherman has strongly condemned this bill , and it is believed that the President is equally opposed to it . Nevertheless , it is expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see one principle of legislation adopted by the House , and another by the Senate , and both gene*ally believed to be disapproved by those who have to carry on the government of the country . " Whether the facts are here correctly stated or not , it is certainly a fair example of much of our legislation . It may be said that committees of conference reconcile the differences between the two Houses ; but these committees , like all others , work in secret , and their aim is generally compromise rather than sound principles or the interest of the whole country , especially as there is an increasing jealousy between the two Houses . Besides they are still in no way obliged to consult the wishes of the . Exeentive . Second only to the civil service in importance , if second to that , is the department of the finances . In the case of the civil service , however , the question is comparatively simple , while the questions involved in the conduct of the finances require the application of abstruse principles both of theory and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merchant with the ana // lytical and philosophical qualities of the student . The amount of writing upon this subject which has appeared in the last five years is truly astounding , and there is no authority which can distinguish between the wildest fustian and the soundest reasoning based upon experience . The public stands completely bewildered among the multiplicity of doctors , and sees no other course than to reject the whole and to adopt the expectant system , with faith in our national resources , and a patient hope that matters will in the end come right of themselves . It is safe to say , however , that matters will not come right of themselves . The late Mr. Cobden is said to have remarked that the United States have suffered more from the evils of a bad currency than from slavery itself ; and if we may assume that all our previous violations of the laws of currency have been trifling compared with those which have been committed since the war broke out , - though it may be rash to predict in what form the disaster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sowing the wind we shall escape the harvest of the whirlwind . When we come to Congress the popular confusion is merely concentrated . The cardinal points of Mr. Boutwell 's policy are a bill for refunding the debt at a lower rate of interest , the maintenance of taxation at full rates with a view to obtaining a large surplus for reducing the debt , and the selling of the surplus gold in the treasury , for the double purpose of depressing the price and obtaining means for the purchase of bonds . On all these points it is of the utmost importance that the views and plans of the Secretary should be fully and publicly explained . We have yet to see in the public press any expression of confidence in the funding scheme . It is of very doubtful practicability . The saving proposed is some ten or twelve millions , which , at a time when our surplus is one hundred millions , and the treasury is giving away more than the sum first named to the national banks upon their circulation , does not seem to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has any bearing upon a return to specie payments , which we believe it has not , as neither Congress nor the country has any clear idea of the method of its action , this is precisely the kind of point which a Secretary should be called on to explain . A funding bill was passed in the Senate , shorn of some of the // main features which Mr. Boutwell was understood to desire . It was brought in by Mr. Sherman and defended by him in a half-hearted way , chiefly upon the ground that the Secretary was daily pressing him for its passage . As to the House , for weeks and weeks the public were entertained with the prospects of a bill being brought in by the committee , and with rumors as to Mr. Boutwell 's hopes , wishes , and fears . The whole session , in fact , was spent in waiting for bills from independent committees on subjects which should be treated as a whole . Bills upon funding , upon the tariff , upon internal taxation , and upon the currency , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one another , are brought in just at the close of the session , while the debates of the entire season have turned upon the fancies and merits of individual members . As a consequence of this , when the time of real debate conies , in which , from the absence of leadership , every member feels entitled to have his say , whether relevant or not , it becomes necessary to limit the speeches to fifteen minutes , or some short time , in which it is impossible that the subject should be intelligently treated . Thus it happened , last July , that in a few days were passed a tax and tariff bill , which , involving as it does a large loss of revenue , - unless this should be made up by increased productiveness ,  --  and therefore directly opposed to Mr. Boutwell 's policy , was yet prepared upon no general plan which the country could understand ; a currency bill which may call for forty-five millions of dollars , and yet provides no source from which this sum shall be derived , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specie payments , its ostensible purpose being to satisfy certain individuals or classes who think themselves entitled to banking privileges ; and a funding bill , which , while transparently impracticable , is deprived of the two features which alone gave it a chance of success , foreign agencies and compulsory funding by the banks . As these were two features which Mr. Boutwell especially insisted upon , of course he can not be held responsible for any failure of the measure . Is it to be expected that men of first-class abilities will submit to be treated in that way ? As to the point of responsibility , Mr. Boutwell began a year ago to buy up a large amount of bonds in excess of the sinking fund , // giving out that they would be held as a " special fund at the disposal of Congress . " No action was taken by Congress upon this course for a long time , until finally it was glided over by ordering all the bonds in the sinking and special funds to be cancelled . It remains , finally , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innovation . The first remark of everybody to whom it is suggested is , that it is the English system . There is , however , quite enough of difference between the two systems to save us from an infringement of patent , and we think that ours admits of decided improvement upon the original . In England , the office of the sovereign being permanent , the appointments to office and the change of administration rest with the Prime Minister . A defeat of the government , therefore , upon any one point , involves a resignation and a new formation of the whole Cabinet . If the country is dissatisfied with the Home Department , this may cause a change of the secretary for India , notwithstanding that this of cc may be filled in the most satisfactory manner . This defect in the English system has been often noticed , but it is so bound up with their Constitution that no remedy has as yet been devised . Under our system it does not appear that the resignation of a single official would require an entire change of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue to hold office in case of a defeat , he would be no worse off than at present , and the election of a new Congress would , within a short period , give the final decision of the country . Another peculiarity of the English system is , that the Cabinet is virtually elected by the legislature . If the Ministry is defeated , it may appeal to the country by a dissolution , but the men indicated by the voice of Parliament must succeed to office sooner or later . The nominal executive , the sovereign , has no longer in practice the use of the veto . He can oppose Parliament only through a dissolution , while over the house of Lords , as against the popular will , he holds the rod of a possible fresh creation of peers . Apparently , therefore , the Executive is wholly under the control of the House of Coinmons . But the protection against this consists in the presence in that House , and the participation in debate , of Cabinet officers . The Ministers have the power of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and if they can satisfy the latter , either as to the merits of their ease or as to theit own ability and inte*-rity , they can defend themselves against Parliament through the electors . Thus the Irish Land Bill was not at all likely to be popular in either house of Parliament . But " the British electors had had time to consider , and though they did not understand the bill , and do not understand it now , they did understand that the Premier in proposing it was within the range of his genius , and they warned all recalcitrant liberals , in a low l ) ut perfectly audible growl , that under those circumstances their function was not opposition to the government , but silent voting in its supporL * * If the Ministers had been exeluded from Parliament , it is very possible that the Corn Laws mhht have been in existence to this day . The English writers , in eomparing their own *system with the " Presidential , " assume that under the latter no such arrangements are possible , on the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intervals , and can not be removed ; that heads of departments being appointed by him , even if Congress should compel the resignation of an obnoxious official , they can not compel the President to a change ot policy ; and that if a sudden crisis of affairs occurs , which in England is met by a change of Ministry , the fixed terms of office prevent such a change here . It seems to us that the difference is not in principle , but in form . Our terms of office are short enough to preclude any very great harm from fixity of tenure . The main point is to bring the questions at issue directly before the people , and the evil of a brief delay in the elections may well be no greater than that which may arise from a too hasty change of Ministry through a sudden reversal of a Parliamentary majority . It may be objected that such a change is contrary to both the letter and the spirit of our institutions . The Constitution of the United States has nothing in reference to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bills for raising revenue shall - originate in the House of IRepresentatives , " and to this we shall presently refer . We have been able to discover nothing adverse to it in the rules and orders of the Houses . The // " Federalist " is silent updn this point , though in Paper XLVII. , which was written by Mr. Madison , there is a sentence which has an interesting bearing upon it . At that , time the great object of public apprehension was the power of the Executive , and the aim was to separate wholly the powers of each department Mit . Madison says : " I shall undertake to show that , unless these departments be so far connected and blended as to give to each a %*onstitutional control over the others , the degree of separation which the maxim requires as essential to a free government can never in practice be duly maintained . " If the view we have taken is correct , the prediction has been strikingly verified . Lu the debate in the House of Representatives on the establishment of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was upon the duty of the Secretary " to digest and report plans for the improvement and management of the revenue and the support of the public credit . " The arguments against the clause were based on jealousy of the Executive . It was said that all revenue bills must originate with the House , that it did not consist with the dignity of that body that its work , should be dictated by a public officer , and that with his superior information a Secretary might deceive and mislead the House to the most ii*jurious measures . On the other hand , it was contended that a bill was not " originated " till it had passed the House , and that the mere proposal of measures by any person did not interfere with this ; that it was perfectly open to the House to amend or reject the measures proposed by the Secretary ; and that as the House would be constantly refilled with new members from local and distant constituencies , their want of knowledge would expose them to the most serious mistakes , the best preventive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the requisite information and experience . Mr. Hartley replied to the last argument by one of those general propositions which show that the present Congress only retains something of the original spirit *It was pos$ble , he sail , that there might be iiiju4ous mistakes in finance , " but Iwould rather submit to this evil than , by my voice , establish tenets subversive of the liberties of.my country . " Another argument apparently needed to be developed by time , that the absence of crystallizing power in the oppos // ing views of members from the want of leadership would prevent them from arriving at any intelligent and definite conclusion . On the 21st of September , Mr. Hamilton , then Secretary of the Treasury , informed the Houses that he had prepared , as requested , a report on the public credit , and the question arose how it should be received . In favor of oral communication , it was urged that members would not be able to understand the subject-matter without explanations ; but in favor of a written communication , it was replied that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that the main report , as well as all explanations , should be given in writing . It does not seem to have been suggested that both methods might be combined with advantage . Thus casually appears to have been settled the policy of the government in this respect . In establishing the Departments of War and For . eign Affairs , this point appears not to have been touched upon , the long debate in the House in the latter case having turned upon the question whether the Secretary should be removable by the President . That both the Secretary and the President did attend the meetings of the Senate we learn from the following items : " Tuesday , July 21 , 1789 . Ordered , That the Secretary for Foreign Affairs attend the Senate to-morrow and bring with him such papers as are requisite , " ete . With which request the Secretary complied ; and again on Saturday , August 22d : " ThePresident of the United States came intothe Senate Chamber , attended by General Knox , and laid before the Senate the following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any such attendance , but these cases at least serve to show that the exclusion of the Executive from the Houses was not originally insisted upon . If* , then , there is nothing in our laws or precedents contrary to the proposed reform , we have next to inquire how it could be brought about . Supposing the experiment to commence with the Treasury , it is evident that it requires a disposition on thepartoftheSecretary , because itisnottobeexpectedthat Congress should force him to take the step . But , the advantages to a Secretary desirous of corrying out a definite policy are so obvious , that a man must sooner or later be found who will prefer them to the shelter given to incapacity by the present YOL. on . - xo. 229. 28 // system . On the part of Congress a corresponding disposition can hardly be expected . The measure is directly antagonistic to the private interests which hold such sway in the existing confusion , and almost eqipilyso to the principles of election to which many members owe their seats . We venture to assume , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .. tions lower than the interest of their country . One such member , having an understanding with the Secretary might introduos a resolution to the efibct that the Secretary be requested to make his annual report orally to the House , and to appear in that body on one day of each week thereafter during the session , for the purpose of making explanations , answering inquiries , and reporting progress in relation to the affairs of his departm*nt . If Congress should refuse to adopt this , it would be a legitimate ground for a canvass of the country , both by the Secretary himself ; by members and others who should perceive its advantages , and by the public press . It wbuld have the merits of simplicity and directness as compared with the complicated details upon which the public are now required to form a judgment . Supposing this measure to have been at last forced upon Congress , some other points suggest themselves as to its working . If the fear of executive influence be still urged as in 1789 , we answer that the increased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furnished by isolation would be removed . A Secretary who should favor the maintenance of excessive taxation for the sake of buying up jlebt at a large premium , the placing the management of our debt in the hands of foreign agents , and the selling of Treasury gold when the actual balance at his command was less than five per cent of the paper money afloat , would be required to give full and sgltiQfactory reasons for his policy . If the head of any department failed to secure a majority in Congress , it would be open to the President to appoint another man . If , however , the President and the Secretary were in accord that the latter should not resign , he might accept as now , though under protest , what measures he could secure from Congress , or he might allow matters to stand until a new election either of Congress or the Executive , while in the mean time the opinion of the country would be forming . The same // course would apply ill the case of the entire Cabinet . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in England seems to be no argument against its adoption . As many bills have to pass both Houses , it might be necessary for some members to attend in both Honses , though it seems that the Secretary of State would need to appear only in the Senate . It may be further objected that the system is inconsistent with our method of doing business by committees . In England it is not the practice to ref*r different classes of business to special committees . Occasionally a select committee is appointed for some special business , but every subject of importance is debated in Committee of the Whole . The result is that the House of Commons is greatly overworked . The sittings last from about noUn till two and even four o'clock in the morning , and this day after day ; yet only a fraction of the mass of pressing business can be got through with . Of course , human strength can not bear this , and there is much discussion as to the remedy . One of the means suggested is that of appointing special committees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final , that the grand object of publicity would sn*fer ; that the business must necessarily be conducted in secret ; and that thus the country would lose the requisite information as to the several objects of legislation . We believe , or at least hope , that the objection is not insuperable .. The chairman of a committee is the person who now reports and explains the results of its deliberations , and many persons believe that he corresponds to the English Cabinet Minister . But the difference is fundamental . Such a chairmah has , or needs to have , but one object ,  --  that of securing the passage of the bill ; the Secretary would have quite a different one , - that of proinoting the successful administration of his department . The chairman is interested in but one bill or set of bills ; the Secretary would be equally interested in everything pertaining to his department . The chairman has an interest in the temporary measure of the moment ; the Secretary would be guided by the past traditions and the permanent policy of his office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can hold a position of leadership to the whole Ilouse . If , therefore . the head of a department were to attend the meetings of the various // 850 Congreeeionai Reform . Oct. committees in which he was interested , while he would endeavor to reconcile their action , he would also upon their reporting to Congress stand ready to enforce or correct it , and give such information as would lead to intelligent response on the part of members and the country . One great advantage from the change would , we think , appear in the improved tone of congressional proceedings . A Secretary , anxious to gain supporters for a plan of administration , would use courtesy in debate , at least in form , as one of the simplest and most obvious of instruments. ; and the same would be true of a leader of opposition . It would be a new . and not unworthy experiment in Congress of the manner m which " a soft answer turneth away wrath . " Other objections to the scheme , of more or less force , may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strongly , as probable results , what might be more properly described as tendencies ; but we ask whether any more practicable plan be proposed to meet existing evils ? In Prance , under the imperial system , the executive absorbed the legislature , so that the meetings of the Chambers were little more than a form , while in. this country we have to encounter precisely the opposite evil . We are by no means blind admirers of the English Con .. stitution , and were it our present object we could , doubtless , point out evils in the state of English society as great as those from which we suffer . But when we consider what has been accomplished under that government ; that for more than two centuries , while the rest of Europe has been torn with the struggle between the spirit of feudalism and democracy , England has been free from violent social revolution ; that one great danger after another ; threatening to involve the whole social fabric in the contest , h4s been successfully dealt with by a process of continued reform ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involved with the interests of classes and the traditions of the past than any now before us are being grappled with , not without a good hope , and , at all events , with an earnest purpose of success ; - when we consider this , it seems well worth while to examine if there : is not some feature of their system which we can adopt with . advantage . That we have need of some remedy , that the country is greatly dissatis // Sod with the proceedings of Congress , and looks with increasing disgust upon the ways of politicians , we think , may be safely assumed . May we not hope for the growth of a party of the country , which shall have for its object the restoration of the true relation between the executive and the legislature ? One method of reform has been proposed and widely discussed under the general name of representation of minorities , or in detail as the cumulative , the preferential , and the limited methods of voting . But , without particularly discussing these , we may say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they do not provide for nomination . The difficulty to be met is not so much that large classes are unrepresented , as that people will not vote . The voters have nothing to guide them , except the nominations in caucus , which are , in great part , such that respectable men prefer not to vote at all . The new methods of voting do not , as it seems to us , provide for this evil . There is nothing to lead a member of Congress , however able , industrious , or patriotic he may be , to hope that the exertion of these qualities will secure for him advancement to high posts of honor and responsibility in his country 's service . In like manner the absence of a real field for the display of these qualities prevents the country from concentrating its attention upon its ablest men . And both these causes combine to deter the best men from seeking the public service . But members of Congress must be chosen , and votes must be concentrated in some way . And soit happens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grade , are employed and desperately clung . to by inferior men , who have yet the talent for using this method of securing votes , - a method which tends constantly to degrade both voters and officials . We have endeavored to show that it is by connecting the executive with the legislature , and by giving publicity to debate , by opening to public competition prizes which shall call out and stimulate the best Went , and by placing the people , than whom there is none in the world more competent than our on , in a position to judge of and reward the exertions of its servants ,  --  that it is by such means that we must hope once more to attract our voters to the ballot-box , and to secure a solution of the great and pressing questions of the day .
