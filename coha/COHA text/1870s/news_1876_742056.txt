txt The story of MILLER , alias WOODRUFF , accused in California ' of fraud and embezzlement , it ' it were fairly told , would be as absorbing in interest as any in criminal annals . In old times , such a man would have figured as a freebooter or a highwayman . But the day of the Captain Kidds and Dick Turpius has gone , and the genteel robber pockets his employer'e cash , hies him to a land where extradition can not  --  reach him , or compromises with the people whom he has robbed , and lives comfortably on his " share " of the spoils . This MILLER was what is called a sharp man . He went to California , a few years ago , in search of employment . Ho proved himself to be a good penman , a fine accountant , and generally " smart as lightning " in all business details . He must have been a prodigy of expertness , or California is the paradise of adventurers , for while yet a stranger he succeeded in working into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Contract and Finance Company of the Central Pacific Railroad corporation . This organization is to the Central Pacific what the Credit Mobilier Company was to the Union Pas:file Railroad Company . Practically , it is a corporation inside of a corporation ; its stockholders are few and rich . MILLER managed the affairs of the concern . He managed them so well that he was looked , upon as a phenomenon of business ability . Ho was trusted implicitly , and . eventually was given full swing . He might have paused once in a while to wonder at the good luck which had enabled him , a stranger and without credentials , to get into so good a place . Probably he hugged himself for his smartness , as he might well have done . Suddenly it was found that MILLER 'S accounts were wrong . It was also discovered that he had been engaged in large financial transactions on his own account . He had a liberal salary , but nothing known of him could explain his purchasing drafts to the amount of twenty or thirty thousand dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a considerable business in his own name . Even his own name was now a matter of doubt . To this day it is not certain whether'ho was MILLER or WOODRUFF . He used either cognomen at his convenience . It was also alleged that he had two wives  --  one in San Francisco and one in Australia . To this latter partner it was said he was making remittances and transfers of property preparatory to joining her when discovered in his plans . It would really appear that the man had two separate names and lives . As MILLER , he was the trusted agent of a wealthy corporation , with a respectable wife and other belongings . As WOODRUFF , he had " another life " and wife ho " longed to meet " in another hemisphere , and to whom he dutifully forwarded his gains . When the explosion came , he disappeared under the accusation of having robbed the Contract and Finance Company of about one million dollars . It is supposed that his apparently bigamous dispositiou was the cause of his ruin . If he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gotten away with his booty . As in ninetynine cases out of a hundred , the women undid him . The Central Pacific Railroad Company were either more vigilant or stronger than the local Police authority . The fugitive was caught and imprisoned in one of the offices of the corporation . For several days this ingenious person was the victim of an arrest and confinement more arbitrary than any ever effected during the days of that much slandered government , the Council of Ten . The Police could not find him , but the railroad company could ; and , what is more , they held him until he had gone over the books , explained everything , and , it is said , had disgorged ae much of his plunder as was in reach of his late employers . While the detectives were running hither and thither on false trails , the late Secretary was under lock and key in the company 's office , calmly unraveling his tangldd web . During this time attorneys were oub busily hunting up the property which MILLER had " conveyed " into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned . ' His delinquencies were brought out by an examination of the books , and a " defalcation. " of nearly one million dollars was said to have been proved . ? When the prisoner had been squeezed dry , it was all at once whispered about that he was confined in the railroad company 's offices . The Police rushed madly through the building , and , opening a business room , discovered the long-missing " defaulter , " who was comfortably waiting to be arrested . Although in an ordinary business office , he had been kept a close prisoner , and the signsof his concealment were not yet cleared away . A formal arrest was made , and he was formally indicted for embezzlement . More than a year has passed . since the country rung with the exploits of MILLER , alias WOODRUFF , who was credited with having stolen a million dollars from his employers . He has just been tried and acquitted on the charge of having embezzled ten thousand ' dollars from the Contract and Finance Company . It was impossible to convict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presented to the jury would warrant no other verdict than one for acquittal . The corporation which had raised such a prodigious din when MILLER first fled was quiet while he was being pumped out , and made no appearance in court when he was tried . The judicial proceedings in the case were merely a form ; and if it had been agreed that the alleged delinquent should go free , since he had given up the company 's property in his possession , the affair could not have terminated more to his advantage . The remarkable immunity from punishment which MILLER has secured , the bold career which he ran , and the mystery which has enshrouded the case from beginning to end , ha4e made his story peculiarly interesting . If he had beaten his San Francisco wife , and had stolen a handful of gold from the safe of his employers , he would now be in jail . Being an " operator on a large scale , ' ' justice ( as some people call it ) permits him to enter on a new car eer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
