txt A comparative statement published the other day exhibited a shrinkage of something like one-third in the market value of the capital stock of twenty-three railway companies since the Spring of 1873 . The list embraced only companies whose securities are dealt in here , and whose general standing is bettor than the average . Had it included bonds as well as shares , and the railroads which have passed into bankruptcy as well as those which are still available for quotation , the reasonableness of the popular distrust in relation to railroad securities would have been placed beyond controversy . It may be unjust to visit upon an enormous property-interest the ems of rash speculation and gross mismanagement ; but the difficulty of discriminating is practically insuperable . The prophetic " boar " who four years ago should have warned investors of the fate that was in store for them , would have been laughed at as a lunatic . The experience has been so much worse than  --  the anticipation that there is nothing surprising in the prevailing unwillingness to take for granted the hopeful auguries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great as it has been , is not yet equivalent in amount to the halation that had previously occurred , and the required guarantees of good management are apparently as far off as ever . The only consolation within reach of unfortunate investors in railroad securities is the fact that another large interest has fared still worse . The decline in values which has occurred in New-York is , proportionately , a trifle compared with that which has taken place at San Francisco . Railroad management , mysterious as it is , is an embodiment of integrity by the side of tho management which distinguishes the conduct of corporate enterprises on the Pacific slope . Assuming that the morals of the San Francisco Stock Exchange are neither better nor worse than those of Wall-street , the inference suggested by the recent fall in the shares of the best known mining companies is even more fatal to confidence than that which has taken place in the values of other corporate properties . The " big bonanza " has proved to be a big bubble . The mania for gambling a mining stocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the California mines was , three years ago , used to foster , furnished pretexts for more impudent frauds than have been discovered elsewhere , and has resulted in losses which , compared with the amounts at stake , exceed those endured by any other class of investors . The reaction , which began early last year , has gone on steadily , all the time acquiring increased force , and widening the area of disaster . If values form any criterion , the downward course of prices has culminated iu a panic in which every luckless holder of mining stocks who does not happen to be concerned in some managing " ring , " is trying to save what he can from the general wreck . Many companies have dropped out of sight  --  the mines being abandoned , the large sums paid for them lost to the stockholders , and the rose-colored representations made by their promoters tacitly admitted to be false and fraudulent . The lot of those who in good faith put their money into these swindling projects is deplorable , mid it is aggravated by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gambling operations by the managers and their allies . Leaving these frauds out of the account , and confining the comparison of the prices that obtain now to those maintained last Spring , the lesson taught may help to reconcile Eastern holders of defaulting and depreciated railroad securities to the misfortunes that have overtaken them . Wo head the list with  --  the California mine , whose capital stock , which in April , 1876 , represented $49,410,000 , has dwindled to $19,380,000 . Its shares , then $91 50 , at latest dates were quoted at $34 . The Consolidated Virginia stands next in importance . Its shares stood at $89 50 in April of last year ; now they sell with difficulty at $30 . The property , which was then rated in the market at $47 , - 700,000 , is maintained by the most desperate manoeuvres at $16,200,000 . As these are the greatest mining properties on the Pacific slope ; are backed by larger capital than all others combined , and are controlled by magnates of the milling world , who make and unmake Senators , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compelling the nation to remonetize silver , it is evident that the tremendous sacrifice indicated by the figures which we give , fairly exemplfies the strength of the current , which still rushes toward lower values . The panic which has wrought havoc upon the California and the Consolidated Virginia , has swept the flood of ruin over mines of much less magnitude but better known among Eastern investors . The old Gould &; Curry was rated at $2,376,000 in April , 1870 ; now it can not stand pressure at $891 , - DUO . ThaSavage once had charms at $2 , - 576,000 ; it has few wooers at $124,000 . The Yellow Jacket has declined from $5,940,000 to $840,000 ; Ophir from $7,459,200 to $1,411 , - 200 ; Hale &; Norcross from $1,100,000 to $230,000 ; Crown Point from $3,500,000 to ? 8537.500 . We need not continue the enuweration . These examples will suffice to elucidate the general statement that within the t welve months the depreciation in the market values of mines on the Comstock ledge has been little short of one hundred and twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literally swept away , Would be added the four or five millions which during the same period have been exacted from the stockholders as assessments to keep the properties from still further depreciation . To sustain the present standard of productiveness , the Work must be extended to lower levels , involving an increased percentage of expense . The demand for working capital , therefore , proceeds side by side with the lessened capacity of the mines for yielding an adequate return . The case would he bad enough if these losses were simply the results of a business which at the best is more or less precarious , and therefore should never be touched save by capitalists who can afford to lose money , and whose direct personal supervision is a guarantee against the tricks and frauds for which the corporate management of mining enterprises affords medal facilities . In the present position of affairs , the sufferers by the losses wo have indicated have not the satisfaction of knowing that they suffer from the accidents inseparable from a peculiarly risky form of enterprise . They were unconsciously made parties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end , and they are at this moment helpless in the hands of mon who pride themselves on the smartness which enables them to squeeze out assessments , at one time to repair the consequences of wasteful management , and at another to frighten timid holders into the sacrifice of their property .
