txt The memorial of Emeline B. Wells and Seina Young Williams , daughters of the late Brigham Young , presented to the House by the Speaker today , and referred to the ComMitteo on the JudiCiary . asks for the repeal of the Anti-Polygamy law of ? 1862 , and for legislation to protect the women and children of Utah Territory . They say that previous to the decision by the Supreme Court of the United States that the law of 1862 was constitutional , , the Mormon women generally implicitly believed to the contrary ; that under their present civilization they have a peaceful , prosperous , and healthful condition of society . Their children are owned and supported by their fathers , and are equally recognized as heirs to their father 's estates , and women are protected from the temptation to infanticide and kindred crimes ; that the enforcement of the law of 1862 would imprison their husbands , despoil and destroy their homes , render their children illegitimate before the world , and leave  --  liemSelves and many thousands of women desolate and unprotected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would encourage mobs to assault and afflict them as in times past when they were driven from State to State , far out beyond the pale of this Republic ; that after President Fillmore , " by the advice and consent of the Senate , " appointed Brigham Young , then a practical polygamist , Governor of Utah , they had good reason to believe that the Government would continue to protect them in their religions faith and its practice ; and that harsh measures toward the Mormons , such as destruction of families and homes , would have a tendency to drive many to desperation , while just and humane treatment would foster and strengthen their love and affection for the Government , thereby securing a more peaceful issue of affairs now pending . In conclusion , the petitioners ask : " That in any future legislation concerning the marriage relation in any Territory under its jurisdiction , it will consider the rights , the hearts , and the consciences of the women to be affected by such , legislation , and that it will consider the permanent care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State .
