txt The great boat race of the year is over , and the excitement of college oarsmen , graduate and undergraduate , will now subside as rapidly as that of standing soda water . Learned allusions to the Isthmian games ( lucus a non , for there there were no boat races , ) may be left for eleven months by the Sophomores to the editors of the sporting newspapers  --  that is , all this - may happen when . the . rejoicings are over for Cornell 's gallantly and hardly won victory . A goodly degree of pride may Cornell honestly take in the position she has won . She carries off the honors in both the races this year ; and when we remember that last Autumn she took both the prize and the honorable mention for literary essays in the intercollegiate contest , producing two that , by , their great positive merit , surprised the judges , her advanced position as to mind and muscle is not to be questioned . It is only fair to say , however , that in the literary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yale among her competitors . Second in the boat race comes Columbia , the victor of last year , with hardly a leaf of her twelve-months crown faded ; for Cornell certainly might , and probably would , have changed places with her save for the misfortune of a broken oar  --  a vexatious accident , the consequences of which , however , must be taken as part of the chances of such a struggle , and borne with equanimity . For moral as well as physical endurance is a benefit to be derived from this athletic discipline . And if , after the old Southern fashion , we were inclined to limit on ; sympathies by State boundaries , we might glorify New-York not a little upon an occasion when her oldest college and her youngest take the first and second places in a contest with such veteran victors as Harvard and Yale , and when the victory this year is one of.New-York over itself , last year . But we would much rather leave such narrow pride among the things of the dead past , and regard these yearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only , indeed , it is ; for wherever our colleges may be situated , their Alumni come from all quarters of the laud . As to the athletic or physiological aspects of the race , there is ' hardly sufficient warrant for important inferences . The indications of the match seem , however , to be decidedly in favor of age as an important element of success in such physical strife . Of the three leading crews , the average age of the first , Cornell , is 22% years ; of the second , Columbia , 21 1-6 , and of the third , Harvard , 20 ; . ; . Now , of these , Harvard had much the mast muscular crew , their average weight being 169 pounds to an average height of 5 feet 1014 inches ; while Columbia 's average was 166 pounds to 5 feet 10 inches ; and Cornell 's 159 pounds to 5 feet 93 : ; inches . Thus it will be seen that the order of age in these crews was just inversely that of apparent muscular force ; while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the race . True , there are facts in regard to the remaining crews which are ' not entirely in accordance with this infercrence ; but discipline and training account for these in a great measure , and it is safe to look to the three leading crews for strong indications at least of the requisites to victory in coming contests . And these indications are encouraging in every respect . The difference of two or three years at the be-. ginning of the third decade of man 's life is of more consequence than would be supposed , except by close observers . A man 's full strength can not be looked for before he is twenty-three years old , and is rarely at-tabled before he is twenty-eight . Nor can the endurance or " staying " power of adolescents be much relied upon . To overtask it is sometimes ruinous . It is well , therefore , ou all accounts to select crews from the elder no less than the more stronglybuilt undergraduate oarsmen , as those who are to.bear the trials of the severe training necessary for these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ severer trial of the contests themselves . This is a point upon which we need the teachings of experience ? and of physiology ; . for we are too  --  mach inclined in all matters to push our lads into men 's places : In ' other aspects the race compares very favorably. with that of last year . Not- withstanding the go number of entries for the race , and the difficult and delicate task of Separating so many long-oared shells from each other , in au exciting struggle , only by buoyedlines , there appears to have been no interference or unpleasant feeling Worth mentioning . This it is pleasant to record ; and it is to be hoped that the scenes of last year will never be repeated , and will be soon forgotten . In one respect , however , it world seem that the present arrangements for this race might be improved upon . It can hardly be that there is no water where it might not be just as well rowed as upon Saratoga Lake . Saratoga , , in the Summer time , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undergraduates front all parts of the country . The crews themselves may be under such strict discipline that they may be protected against temptations to which their college-mates might yield . About this season of . the year , Saratoga is made a rendezvous of men and of women who would take an interest in a college race , but in nothing else pertaining to collegiate life ; and the temptations to gambling and all sorts of dissoluteness have for years been great there , and if we may judge by some lively accounts that have reached us , they are manifestly increased these last two years by the great event of the season . Now , what our college oarsmen want is not dissipalion , but simply a good stretch of still water , and their comrades and friends look1 ins* on . This , we should think , might be found on some quiet river or lake in NewEngland or New-York , where there would be all the advantages and none of the dis ' advantages of Saratoga . With which suggestion wo give our parting cheer to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
