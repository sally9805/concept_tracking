txt Ths town of Bloomington , in Illinois , is full of doctors . For the reason of this excessive quantity of medical men we need not now inquire , but that the quantity is excessive is clearly shown by the fact that they now cut one another into pieces instead of dissecting the corpses of the outside public . Some time since one Dr. ROTEL of Bloomington , died of a very attractive assortment of diseases , and was in due time cut up in the best style of the art by Dr. WORRELL . It may strike the reader , as it undoubtedly did strike the other Bloomington doctors , that Dr. WORRELL showed a selfish and grasping spirit in dissecting his subject entirely alone , instead of inviting a dozen or so other doctors to come and bring their scalpels with them and make a night of it . However , Dr. WORRELL may have had good and satisfactory reasons for his conduct , and , at any rate , it is not fair to judge him until lie has had an opportunity to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ROTH it was mentioned by Dr. WORRELL that the aorta of the subject was ossified . He mentioned this in a casual sort of way , as though ho was accustomed to meet with ossified aortas daily , and . had a half a dozen jars full of them in his private office . Now , as is well known , an ossified aorta is not only one of the rarest treasures that a medical man can hope to meet , but , until Dr. Woman made his statement , it was by no means certain that any such thing had ever existed . Naturally , Dr. Rout 's ossified aorta created a great dael of interest among the Bloomington doctors , and they unanimously determined that they must see it , cost what it might . Dr. 117oRItELL acted in a really frank and generous way . He showed the aorta to several of his brother physicians , who were perfectly delighted with it , and agreed that it was the most beautiful thing they load ever seen . So great was their enthusiasm that a special meeting of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ossified aorta might be exhibited and discussed in a thorough and scientific way . In due time the society accordingly met , and Dr. Rom ) ; aorta Was received with tremendous applause . Quantities of learned papers were read , in which different views of the nature and uses of ossified aortas were set forth . One doctor showed clearly what was the original cause of the ossification , and how it could have been arrested by a prompt use of a prescription for which he kindly gave the formula . Another pointed out certain peculiarities in the aorta which , he said , constituted the difference between the human aorta and the aorta of other anlands . A third doctor , who had been previously presented with a fragment of the specimen , told how he had subjected it to chemical analysis , and had detected the presence of nicotine . This fact proved , so he said , that Dr. ROTH 'S ! notorious use of tobacco was really the cause of the ossification , and he proposed that his brother physicians should then and there found a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eminent traveler and friend of conciliation being understood to be inflexibly opposed to permitting any body to smoke in her parlor . Finally , the society , having expressed all the different opinions of the subject of which they could think , passed a vote of thanks to Dr. WORRELL for his able conduct in discovering au ossified aorta . Dr. WORRELL rose up to return thanks . He said he was greatly obliged to his brother physicians for their flattering opinion of him . At the same time he felt it his duty to explain that there was a slight mistake in regard to Dr. ROTH 'S aorta . That in point of fact Dr. ROTH never had an ossified aorta , and that the ossification which had been the subject of so much learned and improving discussion was in reality the rena cora of a calf , which ho had brought to the meeting with a view of creating universal harmony and good feeling . It will scarcely lie believed , but it is nevertheless true , that the deceived doctors flew into a most tremendous rage , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great credit to their professional knowledge . They told him that he deserved a list of incurable and painful diseases as long as his arm , and threatened that after his death they would subject all his interior organs to the most unpleasant chemical processes and send them to the State Medical Museum , with labels describing them as abstruse parts of undesirable animals . Then they unanimously passed a resolution censuring him in dignified but severe terms , and would undoubtedly have thrown his ossified specimen at his head had he not prudently withdrawn . This story , which is more or less true , will not increase the reputation of the Bloomington doctors , It shows that they can not distinguish between pieces of a calf and pieces of a human being , and it must necessarily lessen the confidence of the community in their skill . While it will ' fill physicians of other and hostile schools with a lively appreciation of Dr. WORRELL as a humorist , it will also lose him the patronage of that large and ' worthy class of people who believe that no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trusted . Finally , it teaches the great lesson that medical men should not set their affections upon ossified human ? aortas , and should never put any confidence in any alleged human organs which they have not personally excavated with their own scalpels.
