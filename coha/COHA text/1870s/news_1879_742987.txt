txt The strong probability of Friday night that the race belonged to the Englishman , Rowell , gradually developed into a certainty as the hours went by yesterday , and the scores showed that Ennis , though doing his best , was unable to decrease the plucky little fellow 's lead . Yet this fact did not abate the extraordinary public interest in the match for the long-distance championship . The attendance at Gilmore 's Garden was by long odds the greatest of the week . At night the crush was tremendous , and the excitement reached a climax . Soon after 8 o'clock Harriman succeeded in finishing his four hundred and fiftieth mile , after an exhibition of endurance and pluck that has seldom been equaled . Rowell and Ennis both helped him materially throughout the day , particularly Rowell , who devoted almost his entire time to coaching the poor , tottering Yankee boy . This generous spirit was emulated by Ennis . In the early hours of the morning , a drunken loafer attempted to assault Rowell . Ennis , who was ahead , stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mob , threatened to stop walking if his rival did not receive fair play . In the evening a large extra force of Police was on band , but its services were not needed . The assemblage was a most orderly though crazily-demonstrative one , and the victory of the Englishman was as enthusiastically applauded as though he were not carrying the coveted championship belt from these shores . Lady Thornton , and Mr .. , Victor A. W. Drummond , the British Secretary of Legation , were present to witness the triumph of the representative of their nation . Baron Shishkin , the Russian Minister , was also in the throng , which included a large proportion of the wealth and fashion of the Metropolis . Ennis 's Performance yesterday was a most extraordinary one . He covered 09 miles and three laps . the greatest sixth day record except Rowell 's ever known . Two of his miles were the fastest of the match . One  --  the four hundroth and fiftieth  --  was run in 7:10 , and the other  --  the last ? in 6:05 . Rowell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an even 00 miles , which , considering his condition , was most astonishing of all . Leonard Jerome , who was in the Garden last evening , received a dispatch from James it . Keene , the millionaire speculator , dated Babylon , Long Island , suggesting the getting up of a subscription for the plucky Yankee , and offering to head it with $500 . Al . Smith had wagered $3,000 to $5,000 that Ennis would finish 473 miles . went to the latter and offered him $1,000 if ho would do it .. Ennis is consequently so much richer . Mr. Kelly yesterday officially announced that , by the terms of the match . $1,000was to be given to each competitor whether or not he covered 450 miles , and that O'Leary will receive that amount , thus corroborating in part the statements published in yesterday 's TE , 11. ; s . A great deal of criticism has been passed upon Rowell for " dogging " his competitors , it was presumed for the purpose of annoying them . His friends assert that such jockeying was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the others for the purpose of resting himself , being relieved for the time from keeping a look-out for his pace . When sufficiently refreshed , lie started on again and gained a lap or two when he could . When it is censidercd that there is more wear and tear on the brain and nerves than on the muscles in a tramp like that which he was undertaking , the value of the policy will beat once apparent . Ennis was wonderfully fresh at the close of the match . It is thought by many persons that if he had had sufficient confidence in himself to try for the belt from the start , and had had the services of a good trainer the first two days , he would have won , as the English man 's feet were very soro and he had all he could do to retain his lead at the close . Ennis has already announced his intention of challenging Rowell next week to another trial , to be had at the earliest possible moment .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
