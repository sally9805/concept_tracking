LOOKING FOR PEARLS . AN ORIENTAL LEGEND . THE Master came one evening to the gate Of a far city : - it was growing late , And sending his disciples to buy food , He wandered forth intent on doing good As was his wont . And in the market-place He saw a crowd , close gathered in one space , Gazing with eager eyes upon the ground . Jesus drew nearer , and thereon he found A noisome creature , a bedraggled wreck ,  - -  A dead dog with a halter round his neck . And those who stood by mocked the object there , And one said scoffing , " It pollutes the air ! Another jeering , asked , " H ow long to-night Shall such a miscreant cur offend our sight ? " " Look at his torn hide , " sneered a Jewish wit , " You could not cut even a shoe from it , " And turned away . " Behold his ears that bleed , " A fourth chimed in , " an unclean wretch indeed ! " He hath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And spurned the loathsome beast from side to side . Then Jesus , standing by them in the street , Looked on the poor spent creature at his feet , And , bending o'er him , spake unto the men , " Pearls are itot whiter than his teeth . " And then The people at each other gazed , asking , " Who is this stranger pitying the vile thing ? " Then one exclaimed , with awe-abated breath , " This surely is the Man of Nazareth ; This must be Jesus , for none else but he Something to praise in a dead dog could see ! " And , being ashamed , each scoffer bowed his head , And from the sight of Jesus turned and fled . UPS AND DOWNS OF THE BONAPARTES AND BOURBONS . qwq and engaged Joseph in conversation . When , soon afterwards , he resumed his seat , he exclaimed , " What do you suppose that man has the audacity to think ? That the days of the Bonapartes are not over in France ! " It certainly seemed incredible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from which that most wonderful of men , who first gave glory to the name , had been twice removed . Various members of the family , after the restoration of the Bourbons , withdrew from public gaze , while others , whose possessions and position had been little affected by the imperial downfall , continued to be surrounded by the glitter of their former prosperity , and to receive such consideration as was due to their personal merit . Of these the most interesting was the mother of the Emperor , who resided at Rome in a superb palace , which she left in 1829 , when she died , to her brother , Cardinal Fesch , a gentleman of much culture and excellent character . Lucien , her younger son , resided at Rome , as did also her daughter Pauline , the Princess Borghese , whose exquisite form was perpetuated by Canova in his sleeping " Venus . " An anecdote told of her in connection with this masterpiece of art indicates more sound sense and real delicacy than it has always received credit for . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a model for the work , her ingenuous reply was , that there was a fire in the room . A year or two after the conversation already alluded to took place , a young friend of about my own age from a neighboring city proposed that we should make a tour in Europe , then not so generally considered an essential part of education as at present . We took passage at NewYork in May for Liverpool . The sailing packets of that period are memories of the past . But though the passages were of long and uncertain duration , they compared favorably in comfort and actual enjoyment with the speedier *nd more bustling trips of the present steamers . In the rolling or pitching , the jar or din , the packets were not nearly as disagreeable as the steamers are . The passengers were fewer in number , there was abundant opportunity to become acquainted , and the ocean phenomena and fickle breezes afforded variety . No comfort known ashore that could be compassed aboard was wanting , and what with music and pleasant chat the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ e xperience of European travel . Who that is old enough to remember can ever forget the delights of posting , the luxurious seats and cushions , the postilion astride of one of his horses , and the uninterrupted views thus allowed of the changing landscape through the ample windows which formed the front of the carriage ? In this way for a twelvemonth we traversed the length and breadth of England , Scotland , and Ireland , and after a similar fashion much of the Continent . Circumstances which need not be particularly mentioned afforded us constant opportunities of meeting and becoming acquainted with many of those best worth knowing abroad , especially in Edinburgh , then in the zenith of its glory as the abode of genius and centre of gayety . Sir Walter Scott was widely known and celebrated as a poet , but as a novelist , though generally recognized through his disguise , so far as depended on any acknowledgment he was " the great unknown . " We met the younger members of his family in society , and were presented to him . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as clerk of sessions , engrossed in his marvellous creations . It was our good fortune to be frequent guests at the house of Lord Harmon , then judge of the same court , who , when the case on hearing permitted , was said to have whiled away his weary moments in reading them . When later , in London , we were about starting for the Continent , Governor Bradish of New York , who had recently returned from Italy , gave us letters of introduction - a pleasant usage now unfortunately for the most // 289 part passed away - to his friends in that country . Among others was one to the sculptor Trentanova , whom he requested to take us at once upon our arrival in Rome to the palace of . the Princess Gabrielli , with whom was then residing her sister , the Countess of Possi , afterwards Lady Dudley Stuart . These ladies were the daughters of Lucien Bonaparte . He had preferred the tranquillity of private life to the thrones proffered by the Emperor to him , as well as to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his life to science and literature , of which the principal fruit was a poem entitled " Charlemagne ; or , The Church Delivered . " He is said to have written it in England , where , having been taken prisoner by a British cruiser in the Mediterranean in i8io , while on his way to America , he was detained for three years . He lived till 184o , and in 1825 was in the prime of life , full of courtesy and kindness and universally beloved . Without overstepping the bounds of social propriety , brief allusion in commendation may be permitted , after half a century , to personages already historical as near relatives of Napoleon . He himself , on one occasion , speaking of his mother , said that she was a woman of noble nature , who had trained her children well , suffering no thing but what was great and elevated to take root in their understandings , abhorring falsehood , and not tolerating the slightest act of disobedience , combining the energy of a man with the gentleness and delicacy of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her descendants ; and it has been well remarked by Sir Bernard BUrke , that " the ladies of the Bonaparte family were ever to a surpassing degree remarkable for talent , beauty , and strength of mind . " Such encomium had especial application to the daughters of Lucien , whose society constituted one chief source of our enjoyment in Rome . In their saloons conversation flowed on with a pleasant ripple of freshness VOL . XXVII. - NO. i6x. 19 and good-humor , bringing to a fitting close days passed among the marvels of art and antiquity in the Eternal City . They were excellent linguists , at home in French and English as in Italian . The Princess Gabrielli , an excellent musician , sang with great sweetness and effect ; and Trentanova , who had also a good voice , contributed , his part to the general entertainment . An improvisatore , a variety of social amusement then in vogue , often attended . Thorwaldsen and many other celebrities frequented the palace , as well as cardinals and other dignitaries of the Church . Cardinal Fesch , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and full vigor , and , though dignified , frank and cordial in his address . In person he was not unlike our late Secretary of State , not very tall or stout , bearing himself simply and without pretension , engaging readily in conversation , with a voice and expression peculiarly winning . His usual dress was of white cloth or flannel , with the red stockings indicative of his rank in the hierarchy . He was good enough to procure for us an interview with the Pope , then Leo XII. , with whom we passed half an hour in animated conversation . Partly through the friendship of the Cardinal and his lovely nieces , who were so kind as to take an especial interest that we should pass our time pleasantly in Rome , partly from our other letters of introduction , opportunities were constantly offered us to attend balls at the great palaces , never seen to such advantage as on these occasions . The Countess Possi , still very young , excelled in the waltz , a dance then recently introduced in polite society , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were apparently unconscious of any especial claim to consideration , putting every one at ease in their presence . They were gay and companionable , quick at repartee , and always graceful and engaging . We were indebted to them for many pleasant acquaintances , and found they were // equally disposed to devote their own moments to our entertainment . We found in Florence Louis and Jerome Bonaparte , as also the Prince and Princess Borghese , who were then at their palaces in that city ; and in the six weeks that we passed there we had frequent opportunities of meeting them . At the British Minister 's and Prince Demidoff 's , where our letters had insured us welcome , many celebrities were to be seen . As young Americans then found their way so far from home in less formidable numbers , we received the greater attention , and were gratified with the privilege , perhaps somewhat overvalued , of conversing with personages whom ability or connection with historical events made famous . Florence was unusually gay , and we had an incessant round of entertainments . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasure and not an embarrassment . Four years later , being again abroad , but now with a young family to care for , an appointment by Mr. McLane as attachd to his legation in London , of which Washington Irving was secretary , made me known in April , 1830 , to Mr. Rives , representing the United States in France . General Lafayette , whom I had seen in America , and sat near at a Fourth-of-July dinner over which he presided in 1825 at Paris , was then a member of the Chamber of Deputies . He was zealously engaged in opposition to the arbitrary measures of the government , which were crushing . out what little liberty had been tolerated under the Bourbons . Mr. Rives took me to his house , and almost his first exclamation , after receiving us , was Do you know what occurred last night at the Chamber ? They were prorogued . Had this been done a few years since , they would have pulled down the palace of the Tuileries about the king 's ears ; but the French are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no revolution now . " That same day he sent for me to go with him to a gathering of Liberals , at which men of the most distinguished position and commanding influence denounced the Ministers in no measured terms , and counselled unhesitating resistance , unless Polignac , then at the head of the Cabinet , receded from his repressive policy . At that meeting , it was said afterwards , originated the Revolution which broke out three months later in July . Although neither Lafayette nor Mr. Rives at that time seemed to anticipate any immediate disturbances , the political horizon was portentous of coming storm . Everywhere throughout France an intense and widespread disaffection to the house of Bourbon was assuming form , and in the capital no occasion was lost to give it vent . It was easy to discover at every turn indications of something imminent and unusual . There seemed no attempt at concealment . Had the press been free , much of the pent-up force might have escaped harmless . But as this was under strict control , violent harangues were to be heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ferment had become so universal as to overawe and paralyze both king and cabinet , who had too much pride and too little wisdom to make timely concessions . Once kindled the flame spread with marvellous celerity throughout the land , and the people rose as one against the throne . These disturbed elements were not confined to France . In England a general spirit of discontent agitated the popular mind , which found only partial relief in clamor for parliamentary reform . The public services of Wellington did not protect his windows , and his town abode , Apsley House , was provided with iron shutters . The Duke in the crisis had turned to America for help . He was busily engrossed in organizing on paper what he called his American army ,  --  a volunteer militia for defence in war or reliance in the event of civil commotion . At the house of Mr. McLane he took pains to inform himself of our method , which now of late in part adopted , affords England // its surest dependence against foes foreign or domestic . When the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took every one by surprise . Tidings came across the Channel that the Tuileries were in possession of the mob . Colonel Hunter , our Consul at Cowes , whose daughters were at school in Paris , hastened to their protection . No other American being at hand to perform his functions , he requested the present writer , then residing at Ryde , to act as Vice-Consul during his absence . The day after his departure , while I was on a visit to Admiral Locke , then at Portsmouth , two officers came to announce the arrival of the fugitive king , Charles X. , and his family , on the Great Britain and the Charles Carroll , American packet - ships , attended by a French frigate , corvette , and yacht . As they were under the American flag , and time was needed to arrange with the British Cabinet certain preliminaries supposed to be necessary , it was obviously the duty of the only American Consul in the neighborhood to repair on board . Friendly relations existing between the United States and France , it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merits of the controversy which had driven the aged king into exile . The warm acknowledgments with which proffers of service were received proved how sincerely they were appreciated . In the king 's situation it would have been surprising if some sensibility had not been testified at any well-intended courtesy . The whole group around him entered with alacrity into consideration of different propositions that were made for their reception on shore . The consulate at Cowes , a large and well-furnished establishment , was offered for their accommodation , no doubt being entertained , and very justly , that such an arrangement would have been proposed by Colonel Hunter if present . The king decided it was best for himself to remain aboard , as also for the Duke d'Angoul*me , but requested that apartments might be procured for the ladies and children at the hotel at Cowes , their disembarkation at which place was not so likely to attract attention as at Portsmouth . General Marmont , Duke of Ragusa , who had commanded the royal forces during the three days , was to proceed to London to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was desirable that his baggage should pass the customs without delay . As it was thought this could be best effected through the consulate , it was so arranged . Preparations were made forthwith at the hotel for the reception of the family the next day . The landlord consented to remove some partitions , that the dining-room assigned for their use might be made sufficiently spacious , several officials of the late court being in attendance . The Duchess d'Angoul6me had mentioned in conversation , that , among other friends in England who had been intimate at the Tuileries , was the Marquis of Anglesey , a member of the Cabinet , who was then governor of the Isle of Wight , and residing at the castle at Cowes . She expressed a wish that he might be unofficially and confidentially apprised of their arrival , as she did not wish that any crowd should be attracted to the landing when they disembarked . It chanced that , when the first arrangements were completed at the hot*1 , it was towards ten o'clock , - in that latitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farther south . The circumstances warranting some disregard ot conventional usage , it seemed best not to defer communicating with the governor . The Marquis had retired indisposed , but being ushered into the library to write him a note , intimation was given me that his son was passing through the hall . As it was important that the posture of affairs should be fully explained , an interview with him was requested upon a matter of some urgency . The reply was that he did not know me , and that the communication should be made through the servant . Displeased at an apparent discourtesy , I returned for answer // that the visit was to inform his father of a circumstance in which it was believed he would take an interest , but which he would probably learn soon enough in the morning . Early the next day I went to find the collector of the port , still at his slumbers , some little distance from the town . Permission was obtained from him to expedite Marmont to London , where upon his arrival he was with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Duke of Wellington , who took him into Apsley House . On my return from the collector one of the consular clerks announced that they had been aroused at night by a messenger from the governor , his family having been alarmed in consequence of the visit the evening before . They were apprehending some attack by the Chartists on the castle , which not long before had been threatened ; and imagining I had come to warn them of some pressing danger , his son and servants had been despatched to ascertain the purport of my intended communication . After receiving on shore the Duchess d'Angoul*me , the Duchess of Bern and her children , the Duke of Bourdeaux and his sister , later Duchess of Modena , and seeing them established in their apartments , it seemed due to the official position of the Marquis , his age , and well-earned celebrity , to acquaint him with what had occurred . He sent down at once to request that his visitor would come up to his dressing-room , where he was seated with his wooden leg - the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table . He was very polite , excusing himself for continuing his task of shaving , in which I had interrupted him , as his complaint , the tic douloureux , to which he was subject , might return and prevent him from completing it , if this interval of relief were not improved . He confirmed what the Duchess had said of his intimacy at the palace , and expressed his willingness to do what he could for the royal exiles , but said that , as a member of the Cabinet and governor at Cowes , he must await the action of the Duke of Wellington . He promised , nevertheless , to do what was in his power , though that was not much . When his inquiry as to what was intended for their occupation during their stay had been answered , he requested to be daily informed of what was done . As no allusion was made to the message which had given offence , this last request seemed more than could be reasonably complied with . The Marquis called soon after upon the ladies at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not ask to be admitted . Some days later his son called at the consulate , at his father 's request , " to do away the impression left by his *l which visit was duly returned . A general sense of uneasiness and insecurity prevailed throughout England at the time , in consequence of the menacing attitude of the reformers , who it was thought might seek occasion in the disturbances in France to create commotion . This may in a measure explain the policy of the British Cabinet in avoiding any marked attention to the exiles . The same day that the party came ashore the Duchess of Bern intimated a desire to exchange the napoleons brought from Paris for English gold . They had been received from the Bank of France , in a rough box , which she opened after securing the door of her apartment . When they were counted , their value , about three thousand pounds , was procured for her in sovereigns . In consequence possibly of the feeling alluded to , delays attended the arrangements for the formal reception of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Meanwhile daily excursions for health and exercise were contrived to the many interesting localities of the island . The party was sufficiently numerous to fill two carriages , the young Duke usually driving in a pony phaeton , the gentlemen in attendance and myself --  then rather unexpectedly called upon to do the // honors for the Stars and Stripes - in the saddle . Carisbrooke Castle was too famous as a picturesque relic of the past , as well as from historical association , not to be known to them . As the place of imprisonment for Charles I. , just before his execution , it was likely to awaken mournful memories in the mind of the Duchess d'Angoul*me , whose father , Louis XVI. , had met the same fate at the hands of his subjects . But when she manifested an inclination to go there , it seemed best not to interpose any obstacle . As we stood together in the ruined chamber where Charles had been confined , the Duchess showed great agitation . Regret was expressed that we had come , and an attempt made to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she said the place could not but painfully remind her of the misfortunes of her family . With much natural sensitiveness , quickened by recent events , she could not hear music without tears , and pains were taken , whenever politeness permitted , to stop the bands which as a mark of respect had been introduced at different places that we visited . Although endeavoring not to attract more attention than could be avoided , towards the close of their sojourn on the island several of the prominent residents testified much sympathy for their distinguished visitors , and would have gladly extended to them civilities had aay encouragement been given . The Duchess d'Angoulflme had frequently manifested a wish to go to my cottage at Ryde ' to see my children . As their mother was not able to receive her , the youngest child being hut a few weeks old , such advances were met as simple expressions of civility , in acknowledgment of my evident wish to make their days pass agreeably . But when one day intimation was given by one of the party that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how much they would be pleased to see my family , nothing was left but to make preparation . A boat was 293 despatched to give notice of what was to be expected , and to carry such refreshments as might be needed . As we were proceeding in the direction of Ryde , the carriages came to a halt , and when I rode up to that in which the Duchess d'Angoul*me was driving she asked me if I had any objections to her going to see my children ; adding that if I felt any hesitation on account of their mother , she would not ask for her . Of course the only reply was that I should feel much honored by the visit , and would lead the way . Due preparation had been made in pursuance of the order sent , and a table laden with fruit and flowers stood ready for their entertainment . As Charles X. had abdicated in favor of his grandson , the young Duke was invariably addressed as " Monseigneur . " With our republican notions , it may seem strange to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by his mother with marked deference . He was required to take precedence of all present , being first served , and while he partook of his fruit the rest stood aside . He was considered , in virtue of the abdication , as their king , if not king of France , and established etiquette forbade that any one should eat before him . When he had finishet* his repast he went into the gar*len , and the rest of the party were permitted to refresh themselves after their drive . XVhen we returned to the drawingrooms , the children were brought in , the boys in petticoats , the infant in arms . The Duke went up to one of the boys , since a tall West-Pointer and victim of the war , and placed his arm upon his shoulder . The child , somewhat belligerent , repulsed his caress by boxing his ears . When something was said in extenuation of so rude a procedure , the Duchess , with true French politeness , took the child on her lap , and , calling the Duke to admire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the visit , the Duchess on the street quite early , she told me she had just been carrying to the consulate a baby-house for my // daughter , the child in arms . It was a handsome toy , and was carefully preserved for a dozen years , but , with nearly as many boys and girls in the family , it finally came to grief . I am not so great an admirer of rank as to be easily dazzled by it , but I feel it is due to the character of one who bore her trials nobly to bear witness to the excellent traits the Duchess daily exhibited . It would be out of place to dwell on the many interesting conversations held both with her and her companions , and after so great a lapse of time only dimly remembered ; grateful for those attentions it was my official duty to render , they all conversed with me , without reserve , on what chiefly engaged their attention in their own situation as well as on other topics . However much our social ideas were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us to see the unabated devotion of those who , having shared the prosperity of the royal family , never permitted them to realize their changed condition by any want of zeal or respect . As the king had chosen to remain in an American ship and under the protection of its flag , and had suggested that a daily visit , when convenient , would be acceptable , this was made a rule . Each day at noon he was glad to hear of the party ashore , taking an interest in their occupations as well as in what was transpiring of a public nature . These visits apparently afforded him much satisfaction . Indeed , in a life so monotonous , any interruption was a diversion . He always gave me a cordial greeting and conversed pleasantly and without formality on whatever subject was started . The brilliant Count d'Artois , fifty years earlier the ornament of the court of his brother , had led a life of vicissitudes calculated to sadden the gayest nature . He had been but six years on the throne when called upon to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afflictions that might have crushed the stoutest heart . Thouo-h *rave and dignified , he had lost little of the refinement and grace which distinguished his earlier years . He was gentle and kindly , more thoughtful of others than himself . His manner had an indescribable charm , partly from the politeness of his nation and growing out of the obligations imposed by his position as a king , but probably in some measure the product of a life which had had its share of the blessed influences of adversity . It was gratifying to receive his warm acknowledgments for such service as it had been in my power to render . On one occasion , as the boat was ready for shore , coming to the gangway he told me with much earnestness , in English , - in which , from his want of familiarity , he did not gene rally care to- trust himself ,  --  that he had heard from his family how well I understood the ladies , and that he thanked me . The Duke d'Angoul*me , standing by , said his father had spoken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the greater compliment , and hoped that I should so consider it . It was natural to reply , that it had given me much pleasure to be useful , and I had done no more than my country would consider my duty , since they had been pleased to find a home under our flag . As the time drew near for his departure for Lullworth Castle , his new abode , an entertainment was given me by the king on board the ship , at which his son presided . Polite speeches were made , highly complimentary to the United States . Reference was frequent to the friendly relations that had so long subsisted between the two countries , and to the exiles ' grateful sense of the kindness shown them in their necessity . It is superfluous to say that , in reply , I did not forget to speak of the aid extended to America in its struggle for independence , or to say that , in remembering the unhappy crisis from which Louis XVI . so generously had extricated us , to make any return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speech-making at home to be wanting on such occasions . It did not matter much , however , in the // friendly disposition that prevailed , what was said . It was an occasion of enjoyment to all , especially to the hosts , whose opportunities for hilarity or social intercourse were rare . A day or two later a steamer brought the Duke of Wellington to accompany Charles X. to Lullworth . He had not seen the children since they left the ship , and the meeting was evidently one of much genuine delights both to him and to them . As they were taking their departure , the Duke of Bordeaux , having been probably instructed to do so , in a manner quite commendable in a child of ten years of age , made me a little speech of his own . After expressing his acknowledgments to the country for its protection to himself and his family , and his gratitude for my personal attention , he prayed at the close that , whatever might be his condition in life , whether high or low , I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following out the dictates of my own judgment in the peculiar circumstances in which chance had placed me , care was taken not to subject Mr. McLane to any responsibility . The privilege of being attached to his legation , which he had kindly allowed me , was promptly surrendered , so as not to embarrass him . He was kept informed of what was done . The interruption of the mail , in consequence of the disturbances , prevented much intercourse with Colonel Hunter , to whoi* was regularly despatched the report of my proceedings as his representative . But he , as well as the Minister , expressed himself entirely contented ; and when he returned , he gave his hearty approval to all that had been done . I was constantly in coirespondence also with Mr. Bates , of the house of Baring , who added to his approbation and encouragement cordial congratulations upon my good fortune in having this favorable opportunity of witnessing what , if a very sad , was still a most interesting incident of that memorable history . Hostile as we naturally are in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the condition that produced them , - as great a disadvantage to the few who possess as to the rest who do not , - they exist elsewhere beyond our reach or power to disturb . There seems reason to believe they are losing their prestige and hold in all civilized countries , and it is almost safe to hazard the prediction that in half a century they will be as much a matter of the past as predial servitude . But however just our jealousy against a system differing from that of our own adoption and preference , interest in what concerns monarchs , throned or dethroned , will long continue to hold sway , and it would be affectation even for an American not to value the chance of helping royalty in distress , or to profess indifference to the minute details which form part of so great catastrophes . Sixteen years later I was again in England , but this time alone . Numerous acquaintances and friends of my former visits , besides many more well known at home , now found abroad , made every moment devoted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and many persons of scientific celebrity , were untiring in attention . At one house , where it had been an especial privilege for me to be intimate whenever in London , Louis Napoleon was also a frequent and favored guest . Boulogne and Strasburg , his somewhat Quixotic efforts to overthrow the government of France with means altogether inadequate , had been forgotten in the good sense and ability of his various publications , in his agreeable conversation and prepossessing traits . He was justly popular in the circles in which he was moving , many persons of the highest standing , who would not have been attracted towards him had he not possessed sterling qualities , holding him high in their regard . Meeting him frequently at the same table , various topics of mutual interest drew us together . He had been , in America , acquainted with persons nearly allied to me , and this fact and the incidents already related , connected // with his kinsfolk in Italy in 1824 , and with the royal family of France six years later , naturally afforded much subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , justly deny Louis Napoleon credit for great ability . His information was extensive and exact . His natural endowments , carefully developed by early training , had been ripened and strengthened by the study and meditations of his six years ' imprisonment . It seems difficult to believe he should have escaped from Ham without the connivance of the French government . The circumstances attending both his escape and detention , which he related to me , are too well known for repetition here ; but it was easy to see that his confinement , in its effect upon his mind and disposition , had been a blessing in disguise . Upon these topics , and numberless others of equal interest , we discoursed when brought into companionship . We occasionally traversed together the London streets or visited the theatres , frequent opportunities being offered and improved for long and instructive conversation . The brilliant ladies whom I had known so well in Rome he spoke of as his favorite cousins and whenever the great Emperor was the topic , his eye kindled and his animation indicated the pleasure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on military science , the pains he took when first upon the throne in organizing the armies that gained Solferino and Magenta , all prove how gladly he would have emulated his uncle in the field , if his military training had been complete . It was his especial delight to converse on political questions , and the fulness of his information and the broad and philosophic views which he took of them , showed how much they had engaged his attention . He was then , in faith and principle with regard to France , a republican , expressing his confidence in the capabilities of the people to govern themselves . One day in alluding to the opinions expressed by the Duchess d'Angoul*me , - for whose judgment and good sense he professed much respect , as did also , as is well known , the elder Napoleon , - that the French required a strong government , he combated the idea as doing injustice to a noble and generous people , who had not had a fair chance to try the experiment of free institutions . He avowed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a large degree of political liberty , and that no government could be strong and enduring that did not rest on their consent , and which did not conciliate their affection . Louis Napoleon was then in the prime and vigor of manhood , his mind fully matured by study and observation , his manners highly polished and agreeable . As there was no reason then to anticipate the marvellous career the outset of which he was rapidly nearing , the impression he made on his friends could not have been prejudiced by even the possibilities of his subsequent elevation . If his good sense and cleverness inspired respect , it was his amiability and generosity of character that won regard . However much he may have shaped his opinions on those of his uncle , he certainly was not , like him , a fatalist , or believer in destiny . He had an enlightened trust in Providence , and the way in which he alluded to serious subjects proved he was very far from being indifferent to such considerations . There is a feeling that few Frenchmen care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never looks beyond it . Human nature is much the same everywhere , and the possession of faith depends much upon individual character . It was . evident enough , from the tenor of his remarks on other subjects , that he was neither infidel nor scoffer . Nothing in his words or conduct betrayed any aspirations beyond his actual position . He had been too far sobered by disappointments to indulge in extravagant delusions or impracticable dreams . He did not fail to perceive the growing disaffection in Fiance towards Louis Philippe , who reigned // without glory , and without that zeal in promoting alike the internal prosperity and external influence of France , which the French people require of their rulers . Communism was spreading secret and infectious detestation of arbitrary power throughout the land ; and though the last agony of legitimacy was a siniple quarrel about political banquets , the throne of the barricades had been completely undermined , and left without affection or respect to support it . Louis Philippe , an exemplary and most respectable character , was forced in his old age to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his fickle countrymen , who had received him from the hands of Lafayette as the royal apostle of liberty and of the best of republics . It can not he denied that it was the wisest choice in the existing conjuncture , for Europe was not inclined to tolerate in France either a radical or aggressive government . But under the influences of the palace and of old tradition , the salutary lessons he had given and received in America faded out , and he , too , was a fugitive . It would have been better for his peace had he left the dry bones of Napoleon in their island sepulchre . The old fondness was not dead , but slumbered . It needed but a spark to rekindle glorious associations that clustered around the memory of the idolized Emperor . The Red Republic was made heroic by the genius of Lamartine , Lut the workshops proved agrarianism and social order incompatible . That bubble burst , and no alternative was presented but the constitutional government which a single day in February* 1851 , transformed into the Second Empire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in 1847 , was identified with no party or intrigue to bring it about . His pursuits were social , among the refined and educated , and if he had any of the defects of his nation , they were studiously kept out of sight . It was not long before the overthrow of Louis Philippe that he wrote to request me to come and see him in his apartment . Some reference to his uncle suggested the act , and now , avoiding all appearance of display , he took from a wardrobe a gray coat , believed to have been that last worn by the Emperor at St. Helena , his sword , chapeau , boots , and spurs . Placing them on the sofa , he said : " Some day , my friend , you may remember that I have shown you what you see I take pleasure in showing , kno wing also that you respect the memory of one I loved so much . " Public opinion , apt to be dastard , is now ( October , 1870 ) setting strongly against him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhibit an amiable disposition , may serve to lessen in candid minds the growing prejudice . The personal popularity which constituted him the choice of the French people needs no explanation with any one familiar with much that was kindly in his nature . After the establishment of the provisional government , his application to Lamartine for leave to enter France was refused . But when he had been chosen with triumphant majorities by two separate constituencies to the Chamber , and the influence of Lamartine was on the wane , he passed the frontier without being recognized and took his seat . His election as head of the French Republic followed . The day that the messages from Lamartine reached London I met him looking ill and dejected . Without any attempt on my part to question its cause , he discovered easily my ready sym* ) athy with his depression , and seemed peculiarly grateful . He invited me to go with him to purchase a horse , and we sauntered along to a fashionable stable near Regent Street . His manner was especially friendly and confiding . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bearing himself in the saddle , as in society , with much grace and elegance . Having also sotiie knowledge of horses , it chanced , when several were brought out , I praised that which he himself had selected , and it was bought . // Though evidently possessed with the idea that the future promised him a fitting field for his aspirations , no expression ever betrayed overweening conceit of his own importance . Certainly he never would have gained ascendency over the hearts of the French people had he not traits which compel respect as well as affection . When , by the Revolution of 1848 , the way was opened for his return to France and to its chief magistracy , it seems reasonable to believe he intended fair by its liberties . Controlled by the course of events when the alternative was presented of his overthrow or that of his enemies , he acted with vigor for his own preservation certainly as a motive , but also , it may be , from conviction that the course he was taking was best for the country . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he been sent back into exile ; I believe that for nearly a quarter of a century he proved himself one of the best monarchs France has ever had . He never lost sight of his obligations to promote the material welfare of France by developing its industry , improving its means of communication , embellishing its cities , improving the public health , insuring justice . His foreign policies secured for France , until within a year , an honorable place among nations at little cost of blood or treas ure , and the recent plebiscite proved that his popularity was undiminished . It must of course be admitted that his persistency , after the withdrawal of the Hohenzollern prince as a candidate for the Spanish throne , in exacting guaranties compromising the dignity of King William , was a political blunder , but the odium of the present war rests not so much upon him as upon his Ministers and the excitable temper of the French people . Certainly in one respect Louis Napoleon deserves especial commendation . In the days of his prosperity he was never unmindful of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was never disloyal to any claim from former intimacy . When in Paris in 1851 , just before the coup c/dial , I accompanied our Minister to his reception , and his cordial greeting and immediate reference to our l ) leasant intercourse in London was followed up by a disposition to renew it . Engagements which took me away from Paris prevented me from availing myself of his advances . Neither the coup d7ta/ nor the present war , so far as he brought it about , are grounds for admiration ; but whoever feels inclined to condemn him should bear in mind what he has done for his country , and , if the conclusion is to his disadvantage , some little allowance must be made for circumstances beyond his control . 7 .
