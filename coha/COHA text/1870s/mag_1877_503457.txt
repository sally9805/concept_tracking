THE year 1864 was one of severe trial to President Lincoln . For nearly three years from his inauguration he had put forth his strength and that of the Government in the mighty struggle to preserve the national integrity against dismemberment , and had , while resisting the sectional efforts of the South to dissolve the Union , encountered persistent opposiuon from the Democratic party organization of the North . Besides these ifficulties , the radical element of the Republican party , comprising the most enthusiastic as well as the most violent politicians in prosecuting the war , had become dissatisfied with the conciliatory policy of the Administration and the slow progress of our armies . Some victories had been achieved , but they seemed barren of results , and the radical leaders in Congress availed themselves of this fact , and also of the murmurs and complaints that the war was unreasonably protracted , to promote greater discontent . The President was held responsible for delays and military mismanatrement , and the approaching Presidential election served as a stimulant to the dissatisfied spirits , who began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party politicians as they were patriots , began to cast about for a candidate more arbitrary and severe than Mr. Lincoln , who was represented as soft-hearted , and not sufficiently energetic for such a war . The intrigues instituted in the autumn became active in the winter and spring , and , to the annoyance of the President , one of the Cabinet , a member of his political family , the Secretary of the Treasury , was quietly attending some of the meetings of the disaffected , and for a time became identified with them , and a prominent candidate to lead them . The assaults of open opponents , and the calumnies of professed friends , circulated often by petty officials , the President did not regard ; but he was affected by the course of the Secretary of the Treasury , to whom he had given his confidence . Without any intention or thought of change in the financial officer of the Administration , he never considered himself or the Administration dependent on any one individual for its permanency or success , but was intimate and confidential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governmental views of Mr. Chase , as exemplified during his Senatorial career , and maintained in the conduct of the administration of his department and support of the Government , during the first half of Mr. Lincoln 's term , had favorably impressed the President , who himself , after entering upon his duties as Chief Magistrate , became more attached to the federal system , and more convinced of the necessity of a rigid observance of both the granted and limited powers of the Government under the Constitution . The President and the Secretary of the Treasury , and indeed the whole Cabinet , though opposed to slavery , recognized and strictly adhered to the principle of non-interference with slavery in the States . Mr. Chase distinctly stated this in a letter of September , 1861 , to Green Adams , when lie said : I am sure that neither the President nor any member of the Administration has any desire to convert this war for the Union and for national existence in the Union . and under the constitution , into a war upon any State institution . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1861 . But a year later the President , under the pressure of military necessity , found it essential for the successful prosecution of the war and the salvation of the Government , to issue his preliminary proclamation of Septem // ber 22 , 1862 , for the emancipation of slaves in the rebel States  --  a bold measure , devised , decided upon , and adopted by himself , as he declared when he read the document to his full Cabinet , and for it and its consequences he then and there avowed that he alone was responsible . To Mr. Chase , the recognized , distinctive anti-slavery man of the Cabinet , the proceeding was wholly unexpected . He was , of course , not unfavorable to emancipation , but its advocate , and had not doubted that war would secure it . He anticipated , however , that it would be effected gradually and by military successes . The steps taken by Fremont in Missouri , Hunter at Port Royal , and others , to give freedom to the slaves within the lines of the Union armies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His suppositions and convictions were that the generals , as they made advances , would , from military necessity , give freedom to the bondmen . With a belief that though a work of detail the results would be certain , he had encouraged that policy . Fremont 's unauthorized proceeding led to that officer 's being relieved of his command , and Hunter 's emancipation order was revoked by the Pre*ident in a proclamation of May 19 , 1862 , disowning any knowledge of the act-proclaiming that neither General Hunter , nor any other commander , was authorized to declare the slaves of any State free-that whether the President , as Commander-in-Chief of the army and navy , was competent to do it , might be questioned ; but if it became a necessity indispensable to the maintenance of the Government to exercise such power , he , under his responsibility , reserved to himself its exercise , and that he did not feel justified in leaving the decision to commanders in the field . When , in September , 1862 , the war had made such progress as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not leave the subject to subordinates , but took upon himself the responsibility alluded to in his proclamation of May . Mr. Chase had the sagacity to see that the prestige previously accorded him as the leading emancipationist of the Administration would thereafter cease . What he had expected would be brought about in detail by the generals in their progress upon rebel territories , the President , as Commanderin-Chief , had by one bold stroke accomplished under the war powers . Emancipation , as decreed by Mr. Lincoln , was not a legislative enactment , a statutory law under the Constitution , but an Executive order , the result of military necessity-an act of the President as Commander-in-Chief in the prosecution of the war rather than in his civil administrative capacity as Chief Magistrate , striking down at one blow one of the most sacred and specially guarded of all the rights which the States had reserved to themselves . It was claimed , however , and by none more strenuously than by some of the radicals in Congress , that it was a high-handed assumption ; that while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consummate the measure . Yet in truth neither the legislative nor the executive branch , nor both combined , were constitutionally empowered to emancipate-it was purely a war measure , and of its necessity the President had to judge , and take the responsibility . If the Executive could do this , why , asked the radicals , had not he and Congress power to go still further with the rebels and rebel States , and modify their institutions in other respects ? Why not protect the slaves when free-endow them with suffrage , and though ignorant and uncultured , make them by law politically the equals of the whites , who were cultured and refined ? The answer was those would be civil acts , and did not come under the laws of war or military necessity . But the radicals insisted that Congress could emancipate without regard for the Constitu // tion , or considering the change which this assumption wouJA effect in our federal system-making the general Government supervisory and absolute over the States and people-a government of persons regulating and dictating the social and political condition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , overruling local sovereignties , and absorbing and exercising powers never delegated . Senator Sumner , who seemed to consider huinself the patron and special guardian of the colored race , and particularly of the slaves , early claimed that Government aid and protection must be given to the negroes , whom he styled " wards of the nation , " and the States compelled to allow them to vote . Mr. Chase earnestly supported the President 's emancipation policy , but did not at once assent to the centralizing theories of Sumner and the extremists . A regard for the reserved sovereignty of the States and the principle of strict construction which he had previously maintained , gave way after the President 's emancipation proclamation , and he cobperated with Senator Sumner in the policy of excluding the rebel States from the Union , and denying them restoration until the negroes were permitted to vote . The dissatisfaction of the leading radicals in Congress because the President had , by an executive order , without Congressional assistance , done an act which they could not disapprove , was increased , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a Presidential candidate of less individuality to succeed Mr. Lincoln . Their minds seemed to concentrate on the Secretary of the Treasury , and he , nothing loth , was approached on the subject . While exceedingly solicitous in regard to the office , he felt the delicacy of his position , and his relation to the chief who gave him his confidence-was coy and reserved - met in secret with these uneasy spirits , but did not communicate that fact or the purpose to the President . His sentiments on the subject of being a candidate , and especially his feelings toward and his honest opinions of Mr. Lincoln , are truthfully expressed in the following private letter to his son-in-law , Governor Sprague : WASHINGTON , November 26 , 1863. - If I were controlled by merely personal sentiments , I should prefer the redlection of Mr. Lincoln to that of any other man . But I douht the expediency of redlecting anybody , and I think a man of different qualities from those the President has will he needed for the next four years . I am not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am quite willing to leave that question to the decision of those who agree in thinking that some such man should be chosen . I can never permit myself to be driven into any hostile or unfriendly position as to Mr. Lincoln . His course toward me has always been so fair and kind , his progress toward entire agreement with me on the great question of slavery has been so constant , though rather slower than I wished for , and his general character is so marked by traits which command respect and affection , that I can never consent to anything which be himself could or would consider as incompatible with perfect honor and good faith , if I were capable-which I hope I am not-of a departure from either , even where an enemy mi , , ht he concerned . A few days after this letter was written , President Lincoln issued his amnesty proclamation , extending pardon to those rebels who would return to duty , and also inviting reconstruction and restoration . This document , intended to promote reconciliation and the rei*stablishment of the suspended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Cabinet , and distinctly approved by every member , but was denounced by the radicals as another Executive assumption . The amnesty proclamation and annual message were transmitted to Congrcss on the 8th of December , 1863 , and on the 15th of December Thaddeus Stevens moved a reference of that part which related to the condition and treatment of the rebel States to a special committee . This motion was amended by H. Winter Davis , who proposed to refer that part of the message which related to the duty of the United States to guarantee to the States a republican form of government , to a committee of nine . It was well understood that this movement // was antagonistic to the policy of the President , and by those in the intrigue , to the President himself . The persons concerned were in constant intimate intercourse with the Secretary of the Treasury , and , on the 22d of February , on the appearance of the Pomeroy circular , three months after the letter to Governor Sprague , Mr. Chase informed the President that he had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President , and consented himself to be a candidate . About this time his views of amnesty and the President 's policy of extending pardon to the rebels , and a restoration of the suspended States *o the Union , appear to have undergone a change . In a letter to Gerritt Smith on the 2d of March , 1864 , when the efforts in his behalf were at the culminating point , he said : The amnesty proclamation seems to fail . I do n't like the qualification in the oath required ; nor the limitation of the right of suffrage to those who take the oath , and are otherwise qualified according to the State laws in Corce before the rebellion . I fear these are fatal concessions . Why should not all soldiers who fi*ht for their country vote in it ? Why should not the intelligent colored man of Louisiana have a voice as a free citizen in restorin* and maintaining loyal as-ceudency ? Not until these radical meetings in the winter of 1864 to make a President do I recollect that Mr. Chase favored the policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the exercise of federal authority , nor even then that he thought the amnesty proclamation seemed to fail . It is due to President Lincoln and Secretary Chase to state that at a later period , and only a day or two preceding the President 's death , there arose a difference as to the sentiments of Mr. Chase on some points of the amnesty proclamation . The points are of historical interest , and though the issue was raised subsequently , it may be properly introduced here . Mr. Lincoln , on his return to Washington , after the fall of Richmond , was serenaded on the evening of the 11th of April , by his fellow citizens , whom he addressed from the portico of the White I-louse in a carefully prepared speech . The occasion was one of deep interest , not only from the fact of the downfall of the rebellion , bat from the opening future of our political condition . The crisis had arrived when it was to be decided whether his policy of conciliation , giving to the rebels amnesty , to the suspended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the whole country reconciliation and peace , or whether the radical policy of continued contention , subjugation , disunion of States , sectional animosity , sectional government of a part of the States by other sections , and a disregard and destruction of that political equality of the States which was guaranteed by the Constitution , should prevail . Down to this period , when the Confederacy was dissolving , and the war virtually at an end , the President , who , by his ability , skill , and management , had continued to keep the Republicans united , and in the main succeeded in carrying forword his humane and paternal policy , was at O* en issue with the radicals , whose vengeful , irreconcilable , and persecuting hatred he had defeated . Returning triumphant from Richmond , he was more fully than ever before convinced of the rectitude of his course and the necessity of magnanimity to the Southern people if the country was to be united , prosperous , and at peace . At the same time he was aware that he would be compelled to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who took different views , and had party ends to subserve . It was under these circumstances , and with a full knowledge of the difficulties to be met in rebstabhishing the Union by a restoration of the States to their proper practical relation , that his speech of the 11th of April was prepared . It was not an impromptu speech , but a written document , deliberately and studiously prep* red  --  the last public utterance of President Lincoln on the subject of reconstruction which he // had adopted and consistently pursued , and which , had he not been murdered , he would , without doubt , have carried to successful completion , but for adhering to which his successor , not less honest and firm , but less skilful and adroit in. managing men , was impeached . President Lincoln said : As a general rule I abstain from reading the reports of attacks upon myself , wishing not to be provoked by that to which I can not properly offer an answer . In spite of this precaution , however , it comes to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in setting up and seeking to sustain the new State government of Louisiana . In this I have done just so much as and no more than the public knows . In the annual messa*e of December , 1863 , and accompanying proclamation , I presented a plan of reconstruction ( as the phrase goes ) which 1 promised , if adopted by any State , should be acceptable to and sustained by the executive government of the nation . I distinctly stated that this was not the only plan which might possibly be acceptable and I also distinctly protested that the Executive claimed no right to say when or whether members should be admitted to seats in Congress from such States . This plan was , in advance , submitted to the then cabinet , and distinctly approved by every member of it . One of them suggested that I should then , and in that connection , apply the emancipation proclamation to the theretofore excepted parts of Vir* , inia and Louisiana ; that I should drop the suggestion about apprenticeship for freed people , and that I should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in regard to the admission of members of Congress ; but even he approved every part and parcel of the plan which has since been employed or touched by the action of Louisiana . I have been shown a letter on this subject , sup . posed to be an able one , in which the writer expresses regret that my mind has not seemed to be definitely fixed on the question whether the seceding States , so called , are in the Union or out of it . It would perhaps add astonishment to his regret were he to learn that , since I have found professed Union men endeavoring to make that question , I have purposefy forborne any public expression upon it . As appears to me that question has not been , or yet is , a practically material one , and that any discussion of it , while it thus remains practically immaterial , could have no effect other than the mischievous one of dividing our friends . As yet , whatever it may hereafter become , that question is bad , as a basis of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a merely pernicious abstraction . We all agree that the seceding States , so called , are out of their proper practical relation with the Union , and that the sole object of the Government , civil and military , in regard to those States , is to again get them into that proper practical relation . I believe it is not only possible , but in fact easior to do this without deciding , or even considering , whether these States have ever been out of the Uoion , than with it . Finding themselves safely at home , it would be utterly immaterial whether they had ever been abroad . Let us all join in doin , , the acts necessary to restoring the proper practical relations between these States and the Union , and each for ever after innocently indulge his own opinion whether , in doing the acts , he brought the States from without into the Union , or only gave them proper assistance , they never having been out of it . President Lincoln 's policy of peace and reconstruction adopted at an early day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had encountered persistent opposition from the radical leaders , but from it he never swerved . It may be regarded as his unalterable conviction , and the above address his last communication to his countrymen on these subjects . This speech , delivered on the 11th of April , drew from Mr. Chase on the following day , the 12th of April , a letter , in which that gentleman said : I recollect the su , , , gestions you mention ; my impression is that they were in writing . There was another which you do not mention , and which . I think was not in writing . It is distinct in my memory , though doubtless forgotten by you . It was an objection to the restriction of participation in reorganization to persons having the qualification of voters under the laws in force just before rebellion . Ever since questions of reconstruction have been talked about it has been my opinion that colored loyalists ought to be allowed to participate in it ; and it was because of this opinion that I was anxious to have this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say much about the restriction . I was the only one who ' expressed a wish for its omission , and did not desire to seem pertinacious . The extracts are characteristic of the two men , and exemplify the position and character of each . The President was assassinated on the 14th day of April , two days after the date of Mr. Chase 's letter ; and this subject of difference between them terminated at his death . My own recollection of the discussion in Cabinet on the amnesty proclamation , in the autumn of 1863-particularly that which related to the subject of restricting the privilege of voting on the question of reconstruction-is in accord with that of the President . The radical opposition to that restriction , and to the President 's amnesty proclamation and method of reconstruc. tion , was immediate and active . His propositions were denounced as Executive assumptions . Stevens , Wade , // H. Winter Davis , and others took instant measures to counteract and defeat them , by referring the subject to a select committee , that matured a scheme , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States a republican form of government . On the 22d of February , after the publication of the Pomeroy electioneering circular , Mr. Chase , feeling it necessary to make some explanation , wrote the President , disavowing an " knowledge of the existence of the letter , " but admitted that " a few weeks ago several gentlemen called on me , and expressed their desire - shared by many earnest friends of our common cause-that I would allow my name to be submitted to the consideration of the people , in convention , in connection with the approaching election of Chief Magistrate . We have had several interviews . I accepted their judgment as decisive . The organization of the committee followed these conversations . Thought this explanation due you , " etc . The explanation was not made until after the intrigue became public by the publication of Pomeroy 's confidential circular ; but the movement , though secret , had been known to the President almost from its inception . He replied to Mr. Chase on the 29th of February , stating : My knowledge of Mr. Pomeroy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day you wrote ; but I had , in spite of myself , known of its existence several days before . I have not yet read it , and I think I shall not . I was not shocked or surprised by the appearance of the letter , because I had had knowledge of Mr. Pomeroy 's committee , and of secret issues which , I supposed , came from it , and of secret agents who , I supposed , were sent out by it , for several weeks . I have known just as little of those things as my friends have allowed me to know . They bring the documents to me , but I do not read them ; they tell me what they think lit to tell me , but I do not inquire for more . Mr. Chase resigned his place in the Treasury , after the nomination at Baltimore , and left the Department on the 30th of June  --  the close of the fiscal year . There had been for some time constrained courtesy , or want of that cordial intimacy which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Treasury officials were among his sharpest opponents , and that in Congress as well as in the Treasury exception was taken to his management of affairs and his method of administering the Government . It was also circulated that he was under improper influences-alluding to the Secretary of State . Mr. Lincoln was declared by the radicals to be too yielding in his disposition ; was granting too liberal amnesty to the rebels ; was for too easy reconstruction ; wanted firmness ; and was in fact unequal to the vast and responsible duties of Chief Magistrate at such an important period . If these complaints or rumors were not prompted by the Secretary of the Treasury , as was said by his opponents , they were not checked or discountenanced by him . Some of the most offensive objections to the President emanated from subordinates of the Treasury Department  --  the personal confidants and official dependents of the Secretary . They asserted , morcover , that the Treasury and finances were in such a condition that the system inaugurated by Mr. Chase was necessary to the administration of the Treasury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was indispensable for its successful operation . It was at this juncture , and with these warnings to the President and the country , that Mr. Chase tendered his resignation . It was , as unexpectedly to himself as others , promptJy accepted ; for he had , on one or two previous occasions , suggested resignation , a proposition which the President quietly put aside . The occasion and alleged cause for this resignation was a difference in regard to the person to be appointed assistant treasurer at New York . Mr. John J. Cisco , the incumbent , who resigned from infirm health , was a Democrat , and there were difficulties in selecting a successor ; but the Secretary , after canvassing many names , finally recommended his assistant in the Department , Maunsell B. // Field , who had at one time been associated with Mr. Ciseo , and who was also a Democrat . The selection was exceedingly distasteful to Senator Morgan and sundry prominent Republicans , who objected to the appointment because they desired , as the Secretary feared and said , " to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the necessities of the service . " The apprehensions of the Secretary may have been unfounded in this instance ; but there is no doubt that the interference of members of Congress to control appointmeats is often highly detrimental to good Government . In the scramble to get Congressional support for this important Executive appointment at New York-an appointment for the correct management of which the Secretary and not members of Congress was held responsible-Mr . Field succeeded in obtaining a majority of the New York members in his favor ; and this was claimed to be conclusive . But the President , who personally knew Mr. Field , did not think him a proper man for the place . Other circumstances not unlikely influenced him to decline accepting the Secretary 's selection , though he usually acquiesced in the nominations of subordinates by heads of departments to places for the proper management of which they were more immediately responsible . Meantime , Mr. Cisco , on the earnest appeal of the Secretary , consented to hold the office for another quarter ; and Mr. Chase , when communicating this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refusal to appoint Mr. Field , tendered his resignation , because , he said , " I can not help feeling that my position here is not altogether acceptable to you . " The resignation was an important step for both himself and the President ; and the announcement that it had been tendered and was accepted was a surprise to the friends of both and to the country . Governor Tod of Ohio was offered the place , but declined it . The office was then conferred on Senator Fessenden of Maine . That gentleman , though gratified with the honor , entered upon the duties with doubt and reluctance . He was , at the time-and had been from the commencement of Mr. Lincoln 's administration-chairman of the Finance Committee , which brought him into close intimacy with Mr. Chase , and was a warm supporter of that gentleman and his financial policy . He had ceased to be a supporter of Mr. Seward , whom he had once admired , but was not antagonistic to Mr. Lincoln . As a lawyer Mr. Fessenden stood well at the bar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possessed legislative experience ; but he was physically and often mentally dyspeptic ; and , though honest and conservative , was , in his infirm health , at times afflicted with an irritable temper that impaired his usefulness . He was nevertheless recognized as occupying a place in the front rank of the Senate of that day , where he was faithful and industrious . If not always profound , he had quick perceptions , and was an excellent critic ; but his political views were tainted in some degree with the prejudice of early partisanship , of which he could not always entirely divest himself . Yet he was ever desirous to be just . It was a trial to him to undertake the laborious duties of the Treasury ; and in resigning his seat in the Senate to enter upon those duties , he was actuated by patriotic motives , and a willingness to make any sacrifice for his country . It was soon obvious , however , to his friends and himself , that his mind and temperament were not as well adapted to his new position as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be his legislative capacity , which was in many respects second to few of his associates , he was deficient in executive power and administrative skill and ability . The retirement of Mr. Chase did not create the sensation that was anticipated . His administration of the Treasury and the finances had been so vio // lently assailed by the Democrats , that they were compelled to accept his withdrawal as a relief ; and the friends of the President , who had witnessed with disfavor the efforts to supersede Mr. Lincoln , were not sorry that Mr. Chase was disconnected with the Administration . Sagacious men were unable to form an opinion as to the financial policy of the President in these Treasury appointments . The truth was , he had none , and did not profess to have any . Overwhelmed with labor and the responsibility which the war imposed , he had trusted to his Secretary , when not in conflict with his own opinions , as he had trusted other Secretaries . The currency and national finances had not , in the tumult of hostilities , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was understood to be a constitutional hard-money man , yielded to the opposite doctrine , assented to the issue of irredeemable paper currency , legalizing it as money , making paper during war a lawful tender for debt , and connected with this policy the establishment of national banks , the President had acquiesced in the proceedings , though some of the Cabinet had questioned their wisdom and correctness . Governor Tod of Ohio , who was first offered the Treasury on the retirement of Mr. Chase , was a Democrat in his antecedents , a resolute supporter of the war for the Union , and the Administration in its measures , but was opposed to an irredeemable paper currency ; was an avowed hardmoney man of the Jackson and Benton school ; consequently not a disciple of Mr. Chase , nor an admirer of his financial policy , though in the emergency created by the war he acquiesced and did not oppose it . Mr. Fessenden , a Whig of the old school , was the opposite of Governor Tod on banking and paper-money questions , past and present . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very consistent-that two men of such opposing views on currency , money , and finance should have been succes sively and within a few days invited to the same important position . The result proved that the President , if committed to no financial policy , had acted with political shrewdness in the steps which he had taken . The appointments were made without consultation or advice with his Cabinet . In tendering the office to Governor Tod , an old Jacksonian Democrat , he disarmed , in a measure , or blunted , the edge of Democratic hostility . It did not disappoint him that Tod declined to step into the shoes which Mr. Chase vacated . Perhaps he would have been disappointed had he accepted . It would have been difficult , in the then existing state of things , to change the financial policy of the Government ; and Governor Tod-an Ohio man as well as Mr. Chase-sould not , with his convictions , if he possessed the requisite talents and ability , adopt it . On the other band , when the President called upon Mr. Fessenden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Chase  --  the chairman of the finance committee of the Senate , the participant in and adviser of all the Treasury measures which had been adopted throughout Mr. Chase 's administration of the department . It was difficult for the friends of that gentleman to take exceptions or umbrage to the appointment , or to condemn the financial management of his most conspicuous adviser and confidant . By the two selections thus made it was apparent the President was wedded to none of the disputed financial theories or systems . The policy of the Treasury which had been instituted was not changed with the change of the Secretary ; and the Administration lost no strength in consequence , but was really benefited , for Mr. Fessenden , if he had less executive power and ability than Mr. Chase , had incurred no enmities , was opposed by no rivalries , but enjoyed the general confidence of the country . If Mr. Chase experienced disappointment from the course which things // had taken , and in which most of his considerate partisans acquiesced , he and they had the good sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were occasional expressions in private of uneasy discontent . The President well understood the case , and had little apprehension from that quarter . Few persons could better feel the public pulse or judge more correctly the sentiments and wishes of the people , their views on important questions , and their estimate , whether right or Wrong , of men . The course of events had satisfied him that Mr. Chase , whatever might be his mental strength , did not possess that inspiring magnetism which controls or leads the popular mind , nor had he the political power which derives strength from public opinion . He had courted the radicals and possessed such standing and influence that they would have consented as an alternative to make him their candidate , but he was not in all respects what they demanded in a leader . He declined to commit himself fully to their ultra views , and when they became convinced he had not the popular support which they once supposed he possessed , he was no longer their man . He had assented to the amnesty proclamation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the radical managers required , had regard for the rights of the States-rights which it was the object of Stevens , Davis , and others to break down . They therefore felt little reluctance in abandoning him . Nor was Fremont , whohadbeen substituted at Cleveland , a favorite with them . His letter of acceptance , while it showed he was as emphatic in his hostility to Lincoln as they could wish , was in other respects exceptionable . Thaddeus Stevens , skilful beyond others as a party tactician , shrewd , cunning , audacious , and unscrupulous , had never been an admirer of Fremont , and became indifferent after the Cleveland nomination in regard to candidates . The great ends which he labored to attain were sub-47 jugation of the Southern people , confiscation of their property , reduction of their States to provinces , and national centralization ; but these ends were no nearer consummation with Fremont than with Lincoln . The Winter Davis reconstruction act , as it was called , which from the time of its introduction , in February , had been used as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the selection of a candidate and also to influence the action of the President , had lingered through the session until after the convention at Baltimore renominated Mr. Lincolna result that was accomplished despite the chicanery of the managing radicals . Not succeeding in defeating his nomination , they persisted in pressing the law that was designed to override his amnesty proclamation and reconstruction policy , which they pronounced Executive assumptions . It was claimed that the President must not act on these important questions until " after obtaining the assent of Congress " ; that " the Executive ought not to be permitted to handle this great question " ; that it belongs to the Senate and the House of Representatives . " It was asked in reply if the right of the President to pardon , grant amnesty , and prescribe a method of reconstruction was denied , that the friends of the bill should point out the provision in the Constitution which authorized Congress to exercise any more power than the President . It was of course impossible for the radicals to give any satisfactory answer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guarantee to every State a republican form of government , which is no grant of power to Congress to pardon , to grant amnesty , to make new constitutions for the States or destroy the old ones . Congress adjourned on the Fourth of July , and the passage of the bill had been delayed until the last hour of the session ; consequently the bill did not reach the President in time for him to assign the reasohs why he // was unprepared to give it his approval . Not doubting that it would become a law , the gentlemen who had prepared and navigated the bill , with its various proposed amendments , and directed the discussion which at opportune times had taken place , congratulated themselves on the consummation of their labors as a crowning radical achievement at the moment of separation . The same gentlemen were astounded and indignant a few days later on reading the proclamation of the President of the 8th of July informing the country that Congress had passed a bill which expressed the sense of that department of the Government for restoring the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Union , which plan it was thought fit to lay before the people for their consideration , as the Executive department had already done in the amnesty proclamation and annual message of December . Thus presenting the case , he said : Now , therefore , I , Abraham Lincoln , President of the United States , do proclaim , declare , and make known , that while I am , as I was in December last , when by proclamation I propounded a plan for restoration , nnprepared by a formal approval of this bill to be inflexibly committed to any single plan of restoration , and while I am also nnprepared to declare that the free State constitntions and governments already adopted and installed in Arkansas and Louisiana shall he set aside and held for naught , thereby repellio* and discouraging the loyal citizens who have set up the same , as to further effort , or to declare a constitutional competency in Congress to abolish slavery in the States , but at the same time sincerely hoping and expecting that a constitutional amendment abolishing throughout the nation may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system for restoration contained in the bill as one very proper for the loyal people of any State choosing to adopt it ; and that I am , and at all times shall be , prepared to give the Executive aid and assistance to any such people , so soon as military resistance to the United States shall have been suppressed in any such State , and the people thereof shall have sufficiently returned to their obedience to the Constitution and the laws of the United States , in which case military governors will he appointed , with directions to proceed according to the bill . This presentation of the issue or difference between the President and the radical schemers in Congress , involving the distinctive and fundamental principles of each , was so plain and trnthful that it could not be denied , and yet it placed the radicals in such a predicament that they could not afford to be nor were they disposed to be silent . A very elaborate manifesto , or as it was termed a protest , was therefore prepared against the President and his proclamation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Davis of the House of Representatives , who had been chairmen of the committees of their respective houses in reporting and carrying through the Congressional reconstruction law to which the President did not give his approval . This manifesto or protest arraigning President Lincoln was addressed " to the supporters of the Government , " and began by saying : We have read without surprise but not without indi , * , nation , the proclamation of the President of the 8th of July , 1864 . The supporters of the Administration are responsible to the country for its conduct , and it is their right and duty to check the encroachments of the Executive on the authority of Con*ress , and to require it to confine itself to its proper sphere . It is impossible to pass in silence this proclamation without neglecting that duty ; and having as much responsibility as any others in supporting the Administration , we are not disposed to fail in the other duty of asserting the ri. , hts of Congress . The protest , illogical , unconstitutional in its premises , filled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through several pages , too long to be quoted here , charges the President with equivocation and falsehood , and proceeds , among other things , to say : The proclamation is neither an approval nor a veto of the bill ; it is therefore a document unknown to the laws and Constitution of the United States . So far as it contains an apology for not signing the bill it is a political manifesto against the friends of the Government . So far as it proposes to execute the bill which is not a law it is a grave Executive usurpation . It is fitting that the facts necessary to enable the friends of the Administration to appreciate the apology and the usurpation be spread before them . Alluding to that part of the proclamation where the President says it is fit the Congressional as well as the Executive plan of reconstruction 742 // should be presented to the people7 the tion have so long practised , in view of the ardu asks : ous conflict in which we are euga*ed and the protest reckless ferocity of our political opponents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he must understand that our support is of what forms ? The result to be declared by - horn ? a cause and not of a man ; that the authority of Congress is paramount and must be respected : that the whole body of the Union men of Congress will not submit to be impeached by him of rash and unconstitutional legislation ; and if he wishes our support , he must coed e h mse*f to ins Executive duties : to obey cad xecute , not make the laws ; to suppress by arms armed rebellion , and leave political reorganiaatioa to Congress . it the supporters of the Government fail to insist on this , they become responsible for the usurpations which they fail to rebuke , and are justly liable to the indignation of the people , whose rights d security , committed to their keeping , they sacrifice . Let them consider the remedy of these usurpations , and having found it , fearlessly execute it . B. F. WADE , Chairman Senate Committee . H. WINTEn DAvIs , Chairman Committee House of Representatives on the itebellious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the supporters of the Government " from the official organs of a majority in Congress , at a crisis when the Administration was putting forth its entire energies to sustain the Government , published at the commencement of a political campaign for the choice of Chief Magistrate , had obviously other objects in view than that of strengthening the President in his efforts to suppress the rebellion . The missile was aimed at Abraham Lincoln by ostensible friends , but who had for months labored to supersede him and defeat his policy of amnesty and reconstruction . The two gentlemen whose names were appended and who with the assistance and counsel of others prepared the protest , were the representative men of a clique in Congress who by caucus machinery and party discipline controlled the majority of that lSody . Had Congress been in session when the President 's proclamaMon was published , the same machinery and the same discipline might have had some effect . As it was , Congress having adjourned and the members separated and at their homes , where their thoughts and reflections had free exercise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with no favorable response from the with what effect when ascertained ? Insinuating that the President has a purpose in his leniency and tolerance toward the rebels , Messrs . Wade and Davis say : The President by preventing this bill from becomin* , . a law holds the electoral votes of the rebel States at the dictation of his personal ambition . If those votes turn the balance in his favor , is it to be supposed that his competitor , defeated by such means , will acquiesce ? If the rebel majority assert their supremacy in those States , and send votes which elect an enemy of the Government , will we not repel his claims ? And is not that civil war for the Presidency inaugurated by the votes of the rebel States ? Seriously impressed with these dangers , Congress , " the proper constitutional authority , " formally declared that there are no State governments in the rebel States , and provided for their erection at a proper time . The protest goes on to say : Under the Constitution , the right to Senators and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a State government , the right is absolute . If there be no State government , there can be no Senators or Representatives chosen . The two Houses of Congress are expressly declared to be the sole judges of their own members . when , therefore , Senators and Representatives are admitted , the State government under whose authority they were chosen is conclusively established ; when they are rejected , its existence is as conclusively rejected and denied ; and to this judgment the President is bound to submit . The President proceeds to express his unwillingness " to declare a constitutional competency in Congress to abolish slavery in States* ' as another reason for not signing the bill . But the bill nowhere proposes to abolish slavery in States . The bill did provide that all sieves in the rebel States should be manumitted . And as regards the proclamation it-self : A more studied outrage upon the legislative authority of the people has never been perpetrated . Passing a multitude of captious and denunciatory flings at the President and his policy , the radical protest concludes with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has greatly presumed on the forbearance which the supporters of his Adminiatra // country . Nevertheless the manifesto from two among the most conspicuous leaders of the Union party in Congress had , with an accumulation of troubles and cares in the summer of 1864 , a depressing effect on the President . Military successes were at a stand , and did not come up to public expectation . General Grant had promised the President personally , in presence of the Cabinet , that he would capture Richmond if furnished with a sufficient number of troops , which he was assured he should have , and the power of the nation had been taxed to fulfil that assurance . The vast army of the Potomac for a time made advances toward Richmond ; but the waste and slaughter , the immense sacrifices of blood and treasure to sustain the General and reinforce the army so that its numbers should not diminish , drew heavily on the Government and country . It was said by General Grant at the commencement of his march toward Richmond that he should cotitinue on that line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country applauded his pluck and persistency , and responded with unstinted offerings of men and means to his calls for support after the successive terrible losses at the Wilderness , Spottsylvania , Cold Harbor , and almost every step , indeed , of that bloody march . Whatever losses were sustained were immediately repaired by reinforcements , so that the progress of the troops was still onward ; but these vast efforts were exhausting to the country and severely trying to the Administration , which was held responsible for all the disasters that occurred , but received little credit for any military successes . The great army of Grant , after immense slaughter , though it did not retreat , because constantly strengthened , had , without other results than the loss of more men than the entire army of Lee and at a cost of hundreds of millions of treasure , reached the position near Richmond from which McClellan had been withdrawn in 1862 . There it remained for months inactive , andits immobility caused great discontent through the North and West . The President had supplied the army with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the James than when he left the Potomac ; but the President , while he sent him men could not furnish his general with tact and strategy to capture the capital of the Confederacy . He had an army twice the number of that of Lee , but seemed incapable of accomplishing anything-lay inert and almost passive , at an expense of more than a million per day , on the banks of the James , not only during the summer of 1864 , but until after the fall of Fort Fisher and the advance of Sherman in the spring of 1865 . The failure of Grant to take Richmond , after his bloody overland march and the great sacrifices which had been made to reach it , was discouraging . The President , borne down with the anxiety and labor of recruiting , reinforcing , and supplying the army , which was doing so little , in inspiring the country , disappointed in its expectations of military success , in warding off the blows of radical friends , and in reconciling political differences among his supporters , many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measures , began to feel that the Democrats would be likely to succeed in the political campaign that was then progressing . Entering his office on one of these days , when it was evident that McClellan was to be nominated by the Democrats , when reverses prevailed , when affairs were dark , and many friends on whom he felt the Government ought to be enabled to rely were desponding-some of them , like Greeley , proposing impracticable schemes , and not very creditable terms for peace , and others were complaining because a more unrelenting course was not pursued-when the Democrats were assailing him for arbitrary measures , and // both Democrats and radicals were accusing him of usurpations and holding him , not the military commander , accountable for our slaughtered countrymen and slow progress in suppressing the rebellion , he handed me a sealed envelope with a request that I would write my name across the back of it . One or two members of the Cabinet had already done so . In handing it to me he remarked that he would not then inform me of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make , but that he had a purpose , and at some future day I should be informed of it , and be present when the seal was broken . Some three months later , after the election had terminated , all the Cabinet being present , he brought out this sealed document , which he opened and read . It was as follows : EXECUTIVE MANSION , t WASHINGTON , August *3 , 1864 . This morning , as for some days past , it seems exceedingly probable that this Administration will not be reClected . Then it will b* my duty to coilperate with the President elect so as to save the Union between the election and the inauguration , as he will have secured his election on such grounds that he can not possibly save it afterward . A. LINcoLN . Mr. Lincoln had , after his election in 1860 , and preceding his inauguration in 1861 , when the great secession storm which threatened the Union was impending , and States and sections were organizing to resist the Government , received no word of encouragement , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administration . He felt that neglect of himself and the apparent disregard of the public welfare , and , remembering it , he was determined that General McClellan , who , from the then indications , would be nominated and elected , should , in that event , receive his willing assistance and that of the Administration to preserve the Union , though chosen by men who opposed him and his efforts in the national cause .
