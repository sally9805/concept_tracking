Darfore , I hold dat it am not de toofache . At de same time , I wish it to be extinctly understood , dat de ligamentary structuation , known as de narvous system ' casionally penetrates itself into de exterior ob de aforesaid structuation , and effectuates de disagreeable ailimentary symptoms in medical phraseology denominated , achabus toothabus . Crow Crow takes a seat in a chair ; Dr. Squash seats himself at the back of the chair , and produces an enormous pair of forceps , which he rubs with a great flourish . Dr. Squash . Dr. Squash , the Quack Stick back your cocoanut . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , doctor . Easy . Oh ! oh ! Dr. Squash .

The difficulty , I say , is jess here : dis inflamatory intimation is in consequence of its progressive and locomotive tendancy , maintains an active inclination to exaggerate itself throughout the cuticullary system generally , and by its own extraneous action , may produce the most serious consequences . Consequently , there is but one remedy . Julius Csar . Julius Csar Lord a massy ! You do n't mean  --  Dr. Squash Dr. Squash , the Quack whetting thumb-nail on his shoe . D'ye see dat thumb-nail ?

Jumble Tries to interfere , but is restrained by Julius Csar . Both display much excitement while the struggle is going on . Dr. Squash . Dr. Squash , the Quack Now see how nice I 'll do it . After a great deal of struggling , he succeeds in gouging Julius Csar , and holds up an eyeball on the end of his thumb . Whew ! Yah ? yah ? Dar it is . Hold on a minit till I spit in your eye and clap on a plaster . He puts a plaster on Julius Csar 's eye , and both get up . Dem 's um .
