The first buzz of conversation goes on until denotes a change . Every one speaks at once . Secretary . At rise of curtain , to JUDGE NEWBOLD , venerable and dignified . I 'm exceedingly sorry that we shall not have the pleasure of seeing Mrs. Newbold . Judge . She is very much disappointed ; but her old enemy , hay-fever , you know  --  Faith . To MISS NEWBOLD . Oh , I know that dreadful hay-fever ! You must make her go to the Adirondacks for it , right away . Miss Newbold . We 've tried everything  --  but poor mamma is worse than ever . The last thing was electricity . It nearly killed her . After this the JUDGE and MISS NEWBOLD come into the forward room : the JUDGE goes to the PROFESSOR 'S group , where he is warmly welcomed . MISS NEWBOLD goes to the MISSES FFRENCH who greet her effusively . ) Professor . Speaking at rise of curtain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not die ; it will develop , unite , and humanize the ruggedness of the German in perfection . Mrs. Harley . In reply to PROFESSOR . The only draw-back that we find to the German Opera is the difficulty of getting a box . If it was n't for that , the whole thing would be delightful . Harley . To PROFESSOR . We took one on shares with a friend  --  but as he goes all the first nights  --  we do n't seem to get quite our half of the investment . General Prance . At rise of curtain to the two MISSES FFRENCH . So you young ladies have been up to West Point and turned the heads of all our cadets . I think we 'll have to move the school out to Denver  --  for the health of the boys . Eldest Miss Ffrench . How horrid ! You could n't be such a bear , General . We girls would die , positively . Now tell me you 're joking  --  there 's a dear . Youngest Miss Ffrench . I 'm sure we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys . I ca n't say I 'd care much . I 'm not fond of boys . Mrs. General Prance . At rise of curtain to MRS . FFRENCH . Left us on the spot without as much as mentioning that she was going . Had a better offer , I suppose . They say she can get forty any minute . Mrs. French . To MRS . PRANCE . But she was with you so long . What a shame . I do n't know what I would do without Aunt Chloe  --  no one ever had such a faithful old soul . Miss Ff . No. 1 . To No. 2 . I do n't like the way it 's cut up the back . I think if it had been perfectly plain  --  or with just a row of puffs , it would have been just the thing . Miss Ff . No. 2 . But the waist is too long , and then that horrid bump on the shoulder . I wo n't wear it . I just told mamma so . After this chatter has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groups break and reform as follows : MR . FFRENCH and MR. and MRS . HOFFMAN appear at door L. C. JUDGE and MISS NEWBOLD come forward . The JUDGE goes to the PROFESSOR 'S group , where he is warmly welcomed and MISS NEWBOLD goes to the twin sisters FFRENCH who greet her effusively . The SECRETARY and FAITH receive their new guests at the door and the chatter goes on as follows , all talking together to Faith . Shaking hands with MR . FFRENCH . How do you do . So glad you 've come ! To SECRETARY . Papa , there 's Mrs. Hoffman . How do you do ? Shakes hands with MR. and MRS. and MISS HOFFMAN and turns again to MR . FFRENCH . Mrs. Ffrench is looking so well this evening You 'll find her over there . Ffrench . Had to finish a most important letter . We are awfully busy just now . At it night and day . Glad to see you looking so well , Mr. Secretary . After a few moments goes down to the HARLEYS and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Very happy to see you , my dear sir . To MRS . HOFFMAN . I 'm charmed . Most delighted . Going to leave us again ? It hardly seems a week since we had the pleasure of hailing your arrival . Mrs. Hoff . Mrs. Hoffman Off to-morrow . But we could n't resist the attraction of your house . I must say it 's the most cheerful place in Washington . Mr. Hoff . Mr. Hoffman I wish you were going with us . You do n't give yourself holiday enough . The country can spare you a couple of months . Follow us over . Do n't wait to think about it . Come right along . Takes his arm . Miss Hoff . To FAITH . Oh , you do n't know how delightfully we shall be situated . Papa knows a gentleman who had engaged the best rooms at Binda 's a year ago , and now we can have them because he 's laid up at Nice with a broken leg . Faith . To MISS HOFF . I know you 'll have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But it 's right in the busy part of the session , and pa ca n't leave his desk for a day . While the above dialogue has been going on , the chatter has proceeded in the other groups , the former lines , or matter in that spirit being uttered , when a new change takes place . FAITH brings MISS HOFFMAN forward and they join the PRANCE group . The SECRETARY and MR. and MRS . HOFFMAN form a group up C. , facing front . MR . HARLEY goes to the FFRENCH group . MR . FFRENCH takes one MISS FFRENCH over to the PROFESSOR 'S group ; the chatter and laughter continuing through all , when it dies down to a murmur , and the music sinks to pp . Secr . Secretary As he comes forward with MR. and MRS . HOFFMAN . So you are going away so soon ? Seems only a week since we hailed your arrival . During the lull , audibly to MR. and MRS . HOFFMAN . You 'll find a few friends here . Leads the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Professor Rutherell ; Mr. Ffrench , Mrs. Harley . The MISSES FFRENCH are now in one group and FAITH brings MRS . HOFFMAN forward and introduces them . Faith . These young ladies are great admirers of yours ; Miss Minnehaha Ffrench , Miss Oregon Ffrench , Miss Nevada Ffrench . The girls respond with mutual greetings of " So glad , " " Delighted , " " Most pleased to meet you . " The chatter is brief here and subsides , as two of the MISSES FFRENCH and GENERAL PRANCE go up and join the SECRETARY 'S group , C. , while FAITH strolls down to the FFRENCH group again . As the buzz subsides , the following is audible : Hoff . Very pompous party , patronizingly to the PROFESSOR . Where do you keep yourself ? Never see you . Actually never see you anywhere , Professor . Prof. Professor Smiling gently . True , true ! but I 'm a homebody ; and if my dear John  --  I mean my brother , the Secretary , had not insisted , why I fear that even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowd . HOFFMAN shakes his hand , and they talk the matter over with their group . Mrs. Hoff . Mrs. Hoffman To FAITH . My dear , you look positively bewitching to-night . Faith . Oh , hardly that . Amused . Stage L. Mrs. Hoff . Mrs. Hoffman Positively you do . Your dress is a marvel of taste . Oh , it is . They discuss the matter with their group . Secr . Secretary To PROFESSOR . I hope your trip to Florida did you good . You see our friend Hoffman goes away to-morrow to Europe . Takes PROFESSOR to HOFFMAN . BARON STUYVE , an elegant but supercilious foreign swell , appears at entrance . FAITH perceives him and says to SECRETARY . Faith . Papa , BARON advances there 's Baron Stuyve . Goes on conversing with her group . The SECRETARY hurries to greet the BARON , and is very amiable to him . Secr . Secretary My dear Stuyve , I 'm glad to see you . You are looking so well after your Western trip . Stuyve . It 's so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughter will also discover an improvement . Secr . Secretary We 'll try at once . Faith , dear  --  Is about to go to FAITH , who turns quietly and seeing she is not required , goes on with her conversation . STUYVE stops the SECRETARY as he is going to his daughter . Stuyve . A word yet , my dear Rutherell ; one confidential and reassuring word . May I speak to Faith to-night upon the one subject nearest my heart ? May I urge her to name the day which is to make me the happiest of men , the most grateful of sons-in-law ? Secr . Secretary You are impatient , Baron . It has already been agreed between you and me that after to-night 's festivity I should take upon myself to procure a decision from her . Stuyve . And again I beg you to let me speak to her in the voice of love . Her heart might yield to that , while her pride might rebel against a parental command . Secr . Secretary And I have reminded you , my dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; neither love nor pride have ever yet raised a voice against my commands . Faith will accept the inevitable . My word has been given to you  --  my heart is fully bound up in this alliance . Stuyve . Slight laugh . I wish I was as certain that Faith 's heart was even half bound in it . Secr . Secretary Enough , my dear Stuyve . Spare me your jests . Devote your airy persiflage to the lady who is to be your wife . To FAITH . Faith , dear , take Baron Stuyve to all his old acquaintances . Faith . Without looking at the BARON . Yes , papa . Stuyve . Coming down to FAITH . Permit me to congratulate Miss Rutherell upon looking so well . Faith . Thank you ! They chat  --  he interested , she cool and never looking at him . At this point , MR . MOSES MOSSOP , an overdressed and presuming person , appears at the entrance and comes forward to the SECRETARY , watching his chance to speak . Mossop . Slow , oily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you do ? Secr . Secretary Turning stiffly to MOSSOP . Oh  --  ah  --  how are you ? Mossop . Let me dank you again most barticularly for your very kind invitation . It is a great brivilege for a foreigner , to see von of de nobility , so to speak , of your great country , a Prince of the Council , if I may call you , unbending to the levities of fashionable society . Secr . Secretary Amused . Oh , we must bend sometimes , or we 'd break . The original chatter here begins again , not noisily , and the strains of a waltz are heard . This puts the groups in motion . The young men take off the young ladies for the dance , and the elders follow the dancers off C. and R. and L. The SECRETARY mildly urges them off  --  he remains L. The PROFESSOR strolls back to the mantel . The BARON manages in the confusion to whisper and emphasize some instructions to MOSSOP , who argues the point with him and then rejoins the SECRETARY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncle . Mossop . Am I too precipitate , Mr. Sacretary , in mentioning what I have heard is the object of this festivity ? With offensive slyness . Eh ? Eh ? Secr . Secretary Coolly . Hum ! Mossop . If it is true what I haf heard , then allow me to be the first to offer my gongratulations . Secr . Secretary Stiffly . To what do you refer ? Mossop . Still smiling and insinuatingly . A little bird whispered to me dat possibly it was to make public an engagement between Looks around and up at STUYVE and FAITH , to whom STUYVE has just offered his arm and who go off at C. together slowly  --  he talking earnestly , she looking down. your beautiful daughter and that splendid fellow yonder . Ach ! Baron Stuyve is the best match going to-day : glorious fortune  --  rank  --  wealth , high honors  --  all before him . Oh , dere is many after him . Secr . Secretary Annoyed . I do not say that such an event may not possibly take place ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . Be good enough , Mr. Mossop , to make no reference to it at present . As in a less reserved and significant tone  --  laying his hand on MOSSOP 'S arm . Ask me to-morrow  --  ask me to-morrow , Mr. Mossop . Mossop . As they go up and off C. R. Oh , you can drust me . I only did n't want you to lose the Baron for a son-in-law . They exeunt at C. as WINNY enters from L. , putting her head in first to see if anyone is about . Winny . Papa ! Oh , there you are . Where is Faith ? She is in full ball dress , pinned up in front . Prof. Professor Rises surprised . Why , Winny ! Look at your dress ! Winny . What 's the matter ? Looks at herself . Oh , I see . Turns down her dress . I forgot the apron . Laughing . How lucky nobody was here ! You see , papa , at Cousin Faith 's particular request I 've been superintending the finishing touches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And while you were in the butler 's pantry the dancing has begun and you will get no partners . Winny . Oh , yes , I will . I shall dance with every man in the rooms . Dances cross and recross . See if I do n't . For I 've made up my mind to enjoy myself immensely to-night . Prof. Professor Kissing her cheek . WINNY dances up and down . I 'm glad you have . Ah , my dear , when I see you in a pretty new dress , in all your glow of youth and health  --  I ca n't help a feeling of  --  well , not exactly envy ! no , no , not that ! but it would be so nice for you if I were a great man like my brother John  --  and could give a grand party like this , once a week , for your sake . Winny . But , papa , why should you bother when I can come to all the parties here ? Prof. Professor True ! There is really no difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We are happier  --  just as we are , ai n't we ? Winny . Up stage R. Far happier ! We do n't want for a thing in the world . Looks off in the ball-room . Have you seen Mr. Airey yet ? Dancers stop . Prof. Professor Frowns . Have I seen Mr. Airey ? No . And I do n't think I shall . He was to have come to me for a music lesson this afternoon , but as usual he sent an excuse . Winny . Comes down , laughing , and takes his arm . What , again ? Prof. Professor Firmly . But it 's the last time  --  I can tell him that . Winny . Roguishly . Oh , no , papa  --  you must n't discharge such a promising pupil . Prof. Professor He 'll have to find another teacher . I 've been giving him lessons for two years and he has n't got out of Clementi 's sonatas as yet . Winny . Reflectively , holding his arm . What excuse did he give to-day ? Prof. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pocket . Some society engagement with a new beauty . Reads . " My dear Professor : It is impossible for me to take a lesson to-day ; but if you only knew what happened : a new sun has risen above my horizon ! " Winny . Goodness ! Again . Prof. Professor Reads . " But I 'll make up some day for lost time . Until then , with hearty good wishes for yourself , and my warmest regards for Miss Winny , I am devotedly yours  --  " Airey . Suddenly appears at door up stage with a bouquet . " Alexander Airey . " Laughs as he comes forward . Prof. Professor Putting up note . Oh , you are here , are you ? Airey . Shakes hands heartily with both . Is it a surprise ? Winny . We thought the new sun that has arisen might keep you up all night . Airey . It 's the very thing that brought me . In one word , " she " will be here . Prof. Professor Mock gayety . Oh , it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Winny . And who is " she " ? Airey . The most bewitching  --  entrancing ! A foreigner , a Russian ! The daintiest , archest , wittiest , prettiest  --  well ! She is the possessor of three gifts seldom falling to one woman : Young ! lovely ! and a widow ! You may judge what a stunner she is when I tell you that I 'm in love with her in right down earnest . They laugh . No , honest ! I have n't been in love like that all winter . Winny . Does she know of her conquest ? Airey . Ca n't say : I met her last night at the Blenkinsops ' big dinner  --  you know I was there ? Prof. Professor That goes without saying . Airey . Fifty guests . We were packed like sardines . I got a card with the name of the lady I was to take in : I was just going to look at it when I heard a ripple of laughter behind me in the drawing-room . Such a ripple ! About an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunshine . " Oho ! " I said , " who is the possessor of that silver bell ? " I turned , and if I ever saw Venus in petticoats  --  ! Well , I was introduced : Mr. Alexander Airey  --  Baroness something or other  --  I was so delighted that I did n't catch her name . Prof. Professor Interested . One never does . Airey . But what did I care for the name ! I was chained by her glance . It went to my soul . I spent a delicious half hour bathing in the radiance , when dinner was announced . " Madam , " I said with a melancholy bow , " we must unfortunately part . I have to take in some prehistoric wall-flower , I suppose ! Let 's see who it is , anyway : I 've got her name here . " And I took out the card . " Baroness Vera Boraneff ! " She laughed in my face  --  you ought to have heard her laugh ! The silver bell became a whole chime . As soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm your wall-flower ! " Prof. Professor Seriously . That was awkward . Winny . Such a thing never could have happened to anybody but you . Airey . Oh , it came out all right . I took her to table in a breeze of fun . It was a jolly good beginning for an acquaintanceship . We laughed . We drank champagne . It 's incredible how much champagne those Russians can stand . I suppose it 's in the climate . Winny . I suppose so . Airey . And she had such a lot of good stories . I told her a lot , too  --  chestnuts ! But it did n't matter with a foreigner , you know . Prof. Professor By the by , do you speak Russian ? Airey . Not a word . Winny . Oh , you conversed in French ? Airey . No , she spoke English  --  a little bit chipped and broken now and then  --  and I broke mine up to match , and so we got on capitally . Winny . Tell us all you did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dance . Bless him ! I had a waltz with her ! Oh , the memory of that waltz ! Winny . And after the waltz  --  a polka , I suppose ? Airey . And after the polka , a schottische , and then some supplementary etceteras . Oh , it was dizzy ! Looks at his watch . She told me she was going to be here to-night . Prof. Professor That 's what brings you so early ? Airey . Of course . Winny . And that pretty bouquet ? Airey . For her ! Neat , is n't it ? Puts it carefully on the table , L. C. I 'm going to meet her at the door with it . I 've tipped all the servants to let me know when she drives up . The first that announces her to me gets an extra fiver . Winny . That 's a good idea ! Airey . Oh , I 'm full of them since she glanced at me with that glance . It 's inspiring ! What 's that the poet fellow says : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beauty as a Woman 's Eye ! " Eh ? But wo n't it be a grand coup  --  my entering the ball-room with the lovely stranger on my arm ! Suddenly , seriously . Miss Winny ! Winny . Yes ? Airey . Will you answer me seriously if I ask you one question ? You know I always come to you for everything . Winny . Innocently and kindly . Well , what is it ? Airey . Do you think it possible she could ever love me ? Honest now , do you ? Prof. Professor Going aside , good-humoredly . Goose ! Winny . How can I tell ? I do n't know the lady . Airey . But you know me ? Winny . Same . Yes , I know you pretty well . Airey . Oh , if she would , some day ! No matter how distant !  --  but the nearer the better !  --  and say to me : " Sacha , I am yours ! " Sacha is the Russian for Alexander  --  short , I mean , the short for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I got that bit of information at the Russian Minister 's this morning . " Sacha ! " Sounds pretty , does n't it ? " Oh , Sacha , I am yours ! " Oh ! Oh ! Winny . Very pretty ! Goes to her father . Prof. Professor Patting her . The jackanapes ! JORDAN enters at back from L. , and comes down to AIREY . Jordan . Pointing off L. Mr. Airey ! Molly . A maid , enters from back , and L. Mr. Airey ! Robert . A footman , appears at L. C. , and advances to AIREY . Sir , sir , the Baroness is here , sir . Airey . She is ! Overjoyed . All right . To WINNY and the PROFESSOR . Did you hear ? You 'll excuse me , wo n't you ? She 's coming . What 's that the other writer chap says : " She comes , she comes , in all the bloom of youth , Unequalled love and unsuspected truth . " Runs up to go off . Winny . But Sacha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're forgetting the bouquet ! Airey . That 's a fact . Rushes back for it . Thank you . Exits L. rapidly , JORDAN , MOLLY , and ROBERT after him . Winny . Laughs . What do you think of that ? And you used to scold me once for hurting his feelings . Has he any feelings ? Prof. Professor Who has greatly enjoyed all AIREY 'S chatter and softly applauded his exit . Well , never mind , daughter  --  he 's a good fellow at heart . Airey . Heard outside . Positively I did  --  only for you . Vera . Outside . I must believe you . Winny . Here they come . AIREY enters , L. C. , with VERA on his arm , laughing and chatting vigorously . Airey . No mistake this time , eh ? Laughs and brings her forward . Let me make you acquainted with some friends of mine . She carries his bouquet . She speaks with a slight indecision as she tries to find a word at times , and with but a very slight foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I believe I am acquainted already . Holds out her hand to the PROFESSOR . You are Uncle Dick , are you not ? Prof. Professor Yes , I am Uncle Dick . Vera . To WINNY . And you are Winny  --  oh , I beg pardon , Miss Winifred . You are surprised that I know you all . Winny . Of course , you 've heard of us from  --  Vera . I heard all about you from your cousin Faith . She is my dear friend . Very dear !  --  and she has spoken of you so much  --  and all praise . To PROFESSOR . And about your music , too . I love music . Prof. Professor Warming up . Really ! Vera . Above all , old-fashioned music . Airey . Yes , that 's the kind I like . Aside . They do n't play much of it . To VERA . May I ask , Baroness , how you felt after last night 's dissipation ? Vera . I 'm afraid we danced too much  --  or dined too much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crosses L. C. , hand to brow . How do you call it ? Airey . Seedy . Vera . Yes , that is very expressive . Airey . Is n't it . I felt that way myself . But you had a good time . Gesticulates to explain . Nice  --  jolly  --  bang-up ! Vera . Oh , with such a partner as you . Airey . Aside to WINNY . You hear ! Nudges her elbow unconsciously , and she moves away to her father . Vera . It 's incredible  --  incredible is correct ? yes , incredible how much one can do at once . Laugh  --  talk  --  sip  --  and Mr. Airey was indefat  --  Airey . In the fat ? Vera . Yes , indefatigable , and so funny  --  and so fresh ! He told me the most venerable stories with so much enjoyment ! Airey . What ! You do n't mean to say you heard them before ? Vera . Every one  --  and so long ago ! Winny . Aside to AIREY , teasingly . It does n't matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , anyhow , you laughed . Vera . Oh , yes . You looked so happy . Do you know that if I were a queen you should be  --  what is it you say  --  Airey . Enraptured . Anything to be near you . Vera . Oh , very near ! Airey . Queen consort , eh ? Vera . Jollier than that ! Airey . Something very high , eh ? Make everybody bow ? Vera . Make everybody double up . Airey . What  --  what is it ? Vera . My jester ! Goes up . Airey . I accept  --  I accept ! Aside to WINNY . I guess I could fill the bill . FAITH runs in to VERA from back . Faith . I just this moment saw you from the other room . How long have you been here ? Nobody told me . Airey . Aside . No , egad ! They were too busy telling me . Vera . Let me get a good look at you first . Holds her at arm 's length admiringly . Faith . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Airey 's presence . There 's but one woman in Washington now  --  in his eyes . Vera . Indeed ! Faith . He fed me with your praises a full hour this morning . He told me everything you said , and everything you had on . Vera . So , sir ! While I was wasting all my stock of fascinations upon you , you were simply making a catalogue . Airey . Miss Faith , please defend me . Faith . I certainly shall . To VERA . He was all fire and flame . He said a new sun had risen upon his horizon . Prof. Professor Producing the letter . Yes . I can testify to that . I 've got it in black and white . All laugh . PROFESSOR goes up . Airey . That 's very low down of you all  --  when I 'm in dead earnest . Waltz strikes up loudly . He offers his arm to VERA . The music sinks to piano then , and keeps so . May I have the pleasure ? Vera . Thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There 's a young lady . Airey . Aside to her . You have only to command me . Crosses to WINNY . May I have the pleasure ? Going up . Winny . Certainly . She takes his arm . They go up . He looks back at VERA . Airey . Is n't she a stunner ? Winny . Yes . But you do n't seem to have made a very serious impression . Airey . That 's nothing . A mere mask to hide her real feelings . Only wait  --  she 'll drop it some day , and then  --  oh ! Sighs . Winny . Sacha ! At the same moment , VERA and FAITH , who have been conversing , burst into a hearty laugh . AIREY darts off , pulling WINNY , laughing , and followed by PROFESSOR . Faith . Now we are alone , tell me why you have been looking at me so strangely . Vera . Because I 'm lost in admiration ! Faith . Of what ? Vera . Your dissimulation . Faith . My dissimulation ? Vera @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  why do n't you ? Faith . Hesitating . Well , I certainly thought he would have come with you . Vera . So he would , but Cousin Dimitri called at the last moment on business and detained him . It provokes me so to see those two forever plotting  --  their heads together  --  taking each other under the arm  --  so  --  and going into corners  --  whispering as if the greatest secret in the world was under discussion . Oh , it makes me half wild . Faith . But you think he will be here ? Vera . Of course he will . Kissing her tenderly . Does n't he know you are waiting for him ? Faith . To-night I have something particular to tell him . Vera . What , really ? Something left to tell , after all the confidential talks I 've allowed you ? But you silly people in love throw away all your opportunities . You sit as silent as owls  --  and apparently as stupid . Suddenly , with comic indignation . Do you know I really believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But no  --  that 's too absurd ! Faith . Vera , I 've often asked you not to jest about this . I ca n't bear it even from you . Vera . Laughs . Why , you silly child  --  Faith . Do n't laugh at me ; I know that I am foolish  --  judged from the way other girls make sport of what is the most sacred thing in their lives : a man 's love ! BORIS enters , C. L. Vera . Ah , here 's the runaway . FAITH goes up to meet BORIS . Faith . I 'm so glad you 've come . Offers her hand . Boris . Kisses it . Dear Faith . To VERA . I 'm not so late , after all . Dimitri understood and was considerate . Vera . What did that creature want with you ? Boris . Oh , to give me a warning . Vera . A warning ? About what ? Boris . He 's full of apprehension . Vera . But why ? Boris . He says I 'm in great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The police are on my track . Faith . Incredulously . The police ! That 's impossible . Vera . He means the Russian police  --  the secret service . Faith . What ? In America ? Boris . That is what I said to Dimitri . " What ! in America ? " and he replied : " My dear friend , you have everything foreign in America . If you find foreign Anarchists and Nihilists , you must expect to find foreign police ! " I had nothing to say . Faith . Catching him on shoulder . But you are not an Anarchist nor a Nihilist . Boris . No , but I have corresponded for some Russian journals , and furnished them a few articles on political topics independent in tone . Vera . You , Boris  --  connected with our Russian embassy  --  you have become a journalist ! Boris . Only an amateur . I do n't know myself how I drifted into it . At first I sent my impressions of travel , then they encouraged me  --  Vera . To put your head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boris . Oh , I have written everything under another name . No one has yet discovered Boris Bagoleff under the name of Vasilli . Faith . I do n't see any harm in that  --  nor any danger . Boris . Dimitri says that " Vasilli " is being discussed in the private councils of the Russian embassy : that he has been put on the condemned list and is being searched for . Faith . And what of that ? Boris . Oh , there is a chance that they may find me out  --  and some night they may seize me and ship me to Russia . Vera . To think of my coming to America with him for a little holiday , and he goes immediately and gets into  --  what do you call it ? Boris . Laughing . " Scrapes ? " Vera . Yes , scrapes ! That 's the mildest term to use . JORDAN enters at L. Jordan . Beg pardon , madam . To VERA . Your page is outside . Vera . Does he wish to speak to me ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . VERA looks at FAITH . Faith . To JORDAN . Show him in . JORDAN makes way for PAUL , a little Russian boy-page in livery , who enters . Paul . A strange man brought this just after you left home . Hands VERA a large envelope , and she goes above with him , talking and explaining as she opens letter . Faith . Down C. with BORIS and unmindful of what is passing above . Tell me Boris , in earnest  --  is there truly any fear of anything happening to you ? Boris . Not in the least . Our officials over here are a little over-scrupulous , that 's all . Faith . If there should be danger speak to papa . You know he can protect you . Boris . I know he can , but I 'm afraid he wo n't . You know that , in spite of all my efforts since I 've been in Washington , I ca n't seem to get on a friendly footing with him . Somebody is working against me . I am as much a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Faith . I 've seen it and it has grieved me . But do n't misjudge papa . Perhaps it is so hard to find his heart because he is jealous of its being lightly won  --  as I am of mine ! We are very much alike , papa and I : most awkward and shy when we would be most tender . VERA dismisses PAUL . Boris . Tenderly . So that 's the way I must read you ? My own ! Kisses her hand . Faith . ' Sh ! Somebody might see us . Boris . Remember you have promised me the next waltz . Faith . I sha n't forget . Au revoir . Said very tenderly as she exits C. L. Boris . Au revoir . VERA comes down with a letter in her hand . Vera . Advancing to seat L. This is really very singular . Boris . What is it ? Vera . Paul tells me that right after you left a man called and inquired for you . Paul said you were not at home . The man asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter , with instructions to deliver it immediately . Hands him an envelope . Boris . Then let 's see what it 's about at once . Opens and reads . " You are required to appear at the office of the undersigned to receive an important communication . Reckoffsky , Inspector . " Speaks . It looks as if Dimitri was right . Reckoffsky is the foreign agent of the secret service . It 's serious . Vera . Will you go ? Boris . Certainly . And the sooner the better . I 'll go now . Vera . Here 's a pretty " how d'ye do ! " A police summons . And that 's coming abroad for a holiday ! We could have done as well in Russia . Boris . Coming back . Do n't say a word to Faith . I 'll jump into the carriage  --  drive there and be back in half an hour . Exits quickly C. L. Vera . Following up and calling after him . Do n't be longer . HARRY RUTHERELL enters from R. with JORDAN , to whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wears a frock coat . Harry . Do n't forget anything . JORDAN crosses in front to L. and exits L. C. VERA turns and sees HARRY . Good-evening , Baroness ! He places a light overcoat which he carries upon a chair . Vera . Why , Doctor , not going to join us ? Harry . Whose air is that of grave superiority and who carries himself a trifle stiffly . I have shown myself a few moments in the drawing-room to oblige my father , but I have to leave now to catch the evening train . Vera . What  --  to-night ? Harry . Yes . Ten-thirty for New York . I 'm only waiting to bid Faith good-by . Vera . And you wo n't give me one dance  --  the last of the season ? Harry . I never dance . Vera . No ! Why ? Harry . In the first place , because I can not . I have had no time of late to improve in that highly ornamental exercise  --  and the dances of my childhood are now , I believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Faith says you sit up all night reading . Books as big as that ! Illustrating . And that you know really too much . Gravely . And yet you are so young ! He frowns . What a pity ! Harry . I must disclaim being an object of pity . Though my time is engrossed in useful pursuits , it is not altogether without its pleasures . What you find in the triumphs of the ball-room I seek in the fields of science . While you are dancing to-night , for instance , I 'm off to New York , where I am to read a paper before the Medico-Legal Convention to-morrow . Vera . How nice ! And what is the subject of your paper ? Harry . The admission of women to the professions . Vera . How interesting ! And do you know women so thoroughly ? Harry . Thoroughly . Vera . Indeed ! Harry . From my books . Vera . And what have you to say on the subject ? Harry . Smiling . A ball-room is hardly the place for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great number of facts from universal history , by which I hope to prove that the fall of institutions and of nations dates from the moment when undue prominence is given to women . I shall point out that our spirit of excessive gallantry , leading us to make place for her by our side in the marts of commerce , the learned professions and the public works , will ultimately derange the customary relations between the sexes , overturn the social order , and finally wreck our national institutions . Vera . In comic dismay . Heavens ! Pause . Is it as bad as that ? Harry . Calmly . I know I must seem ridiculous in your eyes , with my old fogy notions . But I do n't expect you to admit the danger of man 's submitting to all of a woman 's caprices  --  and , in short , of flopping on his knees before every coquette ! Crosses up L. Vera . As if not understanding the last expression , and seriously . Flopping on his knees ? What is that  --  flopping ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lady . Roguishly . I suppose you would never do that ? Harry . Certainly not . Puts his hat on small table up stage . Vera . Who knows ! If a lady should try to bring you to it  --  in a little sly way ? Harry . I know all women 's sly ways . Vera . Oh , you have studied them , have you ? Harry . I have studied them from my books . Vera . So ! You know them by books . Of course that settles it . Harry . I have investigated the most famous women of history , of fiction and fable , all of them  --  Vera . Oh , but these ladies died a long time ago . If a real live woman ever crosses your path  --  beware ! Changing her tone . However , I 'm very glad you have spoken to me in this way now . Harry . Why ? Vera . Because I used to feel grieved at the way you treated me , whenever I called to see your sister Faith . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  of contempt . Harry . Protesting . Oh , impossible ! Vera . But now that I know you despise all women alike , you see I ca n't feel personally humiliated . Harry . But , Baroness  --  I assure you  --  Vera . Yet all the time  --  perhaps I ought not to tell you  --  but I hate dissimulation  --  in spite of myself I liked you for your indifference . I did . Harry . Thrown off his guard . Is it possible ? You liked me for that ? Vera . Proudly . I said to myself , That 's a man . A real live man . He is born to command . There is something in the brow , the eyes , that shows it . You see I looked at you when you were not looking at me . And when you look at one in a certain way  --  just look at me now . Yes , yes , that 's the look ! You make one feel so  --  inferior  --  so  --  so  --  Bashfully breaking off . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm really very sorry for having affected you . Corrects himself . I mean , I did n't know I had offended you . Vera . Pretending vexation . Of course , you did n't know it . That 's what I complain of . Quickly takes off her right glove . Now just look at this hand . Look at it well . Holds it under his eyes . A Russian poet once wrote verses upon that hand , and very nice verses , and a great many of them . At a charity fair on the ice at Saint Petersburg , I got a hundred roubles for a single kiss upon that hand . And you ! When I hold out my hand to you , like that  --  to shake  --  He extends his own mechanically. how do you do it ? Shakes his hand coldly . It never occurred to you to kiss it , although there was no charge ! Harry . Well , the fact is , I never dared . Kisses it timidly . If I had only known . Kisses it again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smooths it . Yes , you do it now . But I do n't care for it any longer . I know it does n't come from the heart . Harry . Oh , believe me ! Kisses hand again , holding it in both of his . Vera . No , no . If it came from the heart , the kisses would be quite different  --  much warmer and tenderer . Harry . Wo n't you forgive me , Baroness ? Vera . You do n't really care whether I forgive or not . And so I wo n't say anything more . Puts other hand in his . You can go to New York . Harry . I do n't want to go to New York now . Vera . Go  --  go . Withdraws both hands and turns away . Harry . Eagerly . I can not go unless I know that you have forgiven me . What must I do ? I beg you 'll not be offended any longer . Seizes her hand . I entreat ! Sinks on one knee . Vera . Turns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew we 'd get you there . He rises abashed . O most wise Doctor , who boasted he 'd never flop to a woman ! And now you 've flopped ! Harry . But , Baroness ! Vera . Not another word . I 'm furiously angry . I 've taken special pains to look my prettiest to-night , in anticipation of being overwhelmed with compliments by everybody  --  and the very first person I meet reads me a lecture about the evil influence of my sex ! Tells me in my face that I am responsible with the rest of womankind for all the ills of earth . It 's too much . Harry . I assure you  --  Vera . And you pretend to know woman ! I 'll tell you how you may know her . Fall in love once ! Then burn all your books and commit a thousand follies . Write verses and billets-doux , have your hair curled in the morning to tear it out at night ; flop on your knees and pluck daisies ; stand knee-deep in the snow under her window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as that , then you may talk about knowing woman ! Not before ! Not before ! Go  --  consume all the females of fable , fiction , and history , and confess that one live woman is a match for them all ! Exits quickly , C. R. FAITH , who has entered a moment before , at R. , now comes down laughing . Harry . Looks at his watch . It 's a pity I 've got to go . I 'd like to have another talk with her . Faith . Coming down . And make it up  --  eh ? Harry . Brighter . No  --  to make her angry again . She looked too lovely for anything in her rage . Exits L. C. Faith . Well  --  wonder of wonders ! My pedantic brother finds a woman " lovely " at last ! Turns to go up C. and is met by the SECRETARY who enters quickly C. R. Secr . Secretary Faith , my dear  --  just a word . Faith . Yes , papa . Secr . Secretary I am most surprised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her ? Faith . I took it for granted that she and her brother were to be asked . Secr . Secretary Her brother ! Is her brother here too ? Faith . Of course . What have you against Vera  --  and so suddenly ? Secr . Secretary Against her personally , nothing ; it concerns her brother . It was with the greatest reluctance from the first that I received him in my house . Faith . Deeply concerned . What has he done ? Secr . Secretary He is in bad odor with his own government . A marked man , watched , and likely at any moment to be publicly exposed as the companion , if not the accomplice , of assassins . Is not that enough ? Faith . Gravely . No , papa . I know him for an honest , straightforward man . When you and he become better acquainted  --  Secr . Secretary We are not likely to become better acquainted . My respect for the confidence reposed in me by the representatives of a friendly power , who are trying to break @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my family have nothing further to do , publicly or privately , with the gentleman in question . To BAGOLEFF , who enters at L. hastily . Ah , Mr. Bagoleff  --  you are just in time . Boris . Agitated . Thank you . May I beg you to grant me a few moments on a most urgent matter ? Secr . Secretary Hesitating . I prefer that any communication should be official . FAITH goes up stage and listens to the following : Boris . I beg you to hear me . I need your assistance . The assistance of a high officer of a free government . I have just been handed this paper Produces an official document and hands it to the SECRETARY who opens it , sitting. and informed that I must return to my own country immediately ; under penalty of having my true character  --  my true character , these are the words , exposed in the Press here under the sanction of official responsibility . Secr . Secretary Having folded the paper , hands it back coolly . Well , I should advise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am innocent of anything . My true character is , thank Heaven , one that no man need be ashamed of . I am the victim of mistake or of slanders . I ask you to obtain a hearing for me . To give me the opportunity of explaining . I have called at our minister 's , and he only refers me to the warning in this paper : return to Russia , or be exposed . Your influence will make them hear me . You have only to express a wish  --  Secr . Secretary Excuse me . I must decline to interfere . It would not be consistent with  --  with the views I have already expressed of your case . Boris . Then you have been already prejudiced against me ? Secr . Secretary I can not enter into any argument . It is the official concern of another government . Boris . But you know me personally . I have been received on a friendly footing in your house . Secr . Secretary Let me suggest that as a reason why you should not try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of delicacy . Boris . It is the reason why I must set myself right before you and your family . This I can only do when confronted with my accusers . Will you obtain for me the opportunity ? Secr . Secretary It is useless . BORIS turns away in despair . There is no appeal to me . Let me beg you to end this perfectly useless discussion . Boris . In that case I have nothing more to say . Will you permit me to look for my sister and take her away ? We shall leave your house at once . The SECRETARY bows and turns away . FAITH meets BORIS half way as he goes up . He speaks to her with suppressed agitation in a low voice . Miss Rutherell , you must feel that at such a moment I can not say what I would to your father . The time will come when I shall be able , honorably , to ask for your hand . I only beg you to trust me . To believe me ! Exits C. L. , looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coming quickly to her father , and firmly . Papa , you can not let Mr. Bagoleff go away in that manner . Secr . Secretary Amazed . What do you mean ? Faith . You must grant his request . With emotion . He is not a stranger to be shown the door . He is nearer to us than you think . Yes , nearer to me . Secr . Secretary Faith ! Faith . Resolutely . Yes , father . If I have not spoken to you before , it is not because I had anything to hide from you , but it was only to-night that I knew and felt how it stood with Boris and me . Secr . Secretary Do you mean that he has dared  --  that you have encouraged him  --  that you think of marrying that man ? Faith . Yes . He will ask you for me . Secr . Secretary Never ! Never ! Faith . Do n't say never , papa . After a little while , when all this is cleared up  --  Secr . Secretary The hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my heart  --  to an adventurer ! A man forced to leave the country by threats of exposure ! You must see , my child , that it is impossible . You will give him his answer  --  Faith . It is given , papa . He has my promise , my word . Secr . Secretary I , too , have given my word  --  Faith . Papa , I beg of you  --  Secr . Secretary Baron Stuyve has my promise , and you must ratify that promise . Faith . I can not , papa , I can not . Resolutely . And I will not ! Secr . Secretary Not another word . You force me to a decisive step , and it shall be taken to-night . Do not forget that there is but one will in this house  --  mine : but one choice  --  to obey ! Pushes her slowly from him and goes up , as VERA enters , followed by BORIS at C. L. Vera . No , leave me to speak . To SECRETARY , extremely agitated . My brother has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him your house . Secr . Secretary Excuse me . I have no further relations with your brother . The BARON enters followed by MOSSOP , the PROFESSOR , and AIREY and WINNY . Secr . Secretary Will you pardon me one moment . He goes eagerly to the BARON and brings him forward and speaks to him in a voice which is intended to reach all present . My dear Baron , you have come at the right moment . My friends , I hope it will not impart an air of too much solemnity to this social occasion if I make an informal announcement of my daughter 's engagement . Faith . Under breath and entreatingly . Papa ! Boris . Faith ! Advancing . VERA restrains him . Prof. Professor Your daughter 's engagement ! Airey . Who is the happy man ? Faith . Suddenly and firmly . Papa has taken me by surprise . But it is true . I am engaged  --  to this gentleman . Gives her hand to BORIS . Boris . My wife ! Vera . With an outburst , embracing her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hotly . What , girl ! Stuyve . Restraining him . Sh ! CURTAIN . ACT II . SCENE .  --  VERA 'S boudoir . General entrance , C. Doors , R. and L. Plenty of fresh flowers about the apartment . A richly furnished place . THE PROFESSOR enters at rise of curtain , preceded by PAUL , who takes a card from him and goes to door R. C. and raps . LIDA enters and takes card , then exits . THE PROFESSOR removes his cloak , and puts it on table L. He stands hat in hand until PAUL returns . VERA enters , followed by LIDA . Vera . Extending both hands . How nice of you , Professor ! I am so glad to see you . PAUL exits by folding door , and LIDA crosses L. and exits L. D. Prof. Professor I hope I did right to venture without an invitation . Vera . The idea ! Places a chair for him ; they sit . I expected you . Prof. Professor Thank you . I 'm so anxious to hear about our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass the night ? It was terrible for a young girl to have to leave her father 's house . But you were there , and so she has a home . Vera . She has just fallen asleep , for the first time ! Winny is there with her . Presses his hand . How I thank you for sending her . Prof. Professor In a whisper . That was only natural . Vera . You may speak loud . They ca n't hear us . Glancing at door L. There is a passage between that door and Faith 's room . Prof. Professor The darling must have suffered . Has your brother gone ? Vera . Oh , yes ! He went away at midnight . And ever since she has lain in there crying , silently , like one with a broken heart . Then Winny came and helped me comfort her . We have had to do for her as for a child . Rises and looks off at door L. Prof. Professor Rises and crosses R. How good you are . But she is worthy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think I am prouder than ever of her ! To stand up there so calmly , as she did , before all those people , and choose the man she loved  --  no matter what it cost ! I could have taken her in my arms and cried out : " Brother , thank Heaven for such a child ! " Vera . She will be very happy when I tell her that . Gives him her hand . Prof. Professor And tell her never to surrender  --  if she feels in her heart that this way lies happiness . Ah , I know ; there is but one way to be happy  --  and that is to be happy in our own way . Everyone is the architect of his own happiness . Vera . Ah , I know that , too . Prof. Professor Look at me . My father was ambitious for me to study law . Well , I grasped a fiddle as soon as I could walk . Nothing could wean me . " Very well , " says my father , " you prefer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing else , and go . " So I went out into the world . Brother John has been very kind to me , but I see he pities my grovelling taste . And so I walk in the clouds with my music  --  but I walk all alone ; I owe it happiness , though , that makes life a perpetual summer . It has done everything for me , and I have done nothing to pay my debt . Vera . No ? Why , I have heard that you have written a grand opera ? Prof. Professor Proudly . Yes ; my " Nero in Rome . " But who wants a grand opera ? It only served one purpose : to make my days full of joy ; and in the nights spirits come to me in dreams , singing my notes . What is money , what is power , compared to that ! Vera . Moved . You alone know the secret of happiness . Ah , Professor , you are  --  you  --  what is the word  --  Prof. Professor A silly old man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't think that , and that is n't what I wished to say . WINNY enters , L. door . Winny . Oh , papa ! Crosses to VERA . Oh , Baroness , she is sound asleep . Prof. Professor Thank goodness ! WINNY crosses L. I 'll call again to-night . Shakes hands with VERA and WINNY . Good-by , good-by . Goes L. C. Vera . Good-by . Reclining on sofa . Winny . Running up to him . Be sure you come . Kisses him . Prof. Professor Aside to WINNY . She knows about my opera . Winny . Oh , papa ! I hope you did n't mention it . Prof. Professor No , no  --  but what I want to say is , if she should mention it in the course of conversation , and express a desire to hear one or two numbers , I shall be glad to come and play for her . Exits L. D. Winny . Dear papa ! Comes down to VERA , half kneels on chair . He has such an odd way of showing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Is n't he lovely ! Vera . Yes . How can you ever think of marrying and leaving him . Winny . Artlessly . Oh , I shall never marry . Vera . Wait till the right one  --  what do you call it  --  ah ! pops up . Winny . The right one has popped . Vera . What ! And you never told me . Winny . Rises , crosses and kneels to her . That is he has popped and not popped . Popped up and popped off  --  without giving me a look . Vera . Left you for another ? Winny . For several others . Vera . So you are a case of unrequited love . How do you keep so jolly ? Winny . Because I 've no talent for being unhappy . Sits C. That is for tragedy queens , and tragedy queens are not in my line . Vera . Rises . That 's right , my dear . Let your part on the world 's stage be the merrier one : to turn the lime-light of cheerfulness on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humbler part , but the pay is sure . I wish it were mine . Crosses L. Winny . You have a better . You furnish the music . You say such lovely things and you do so much good . Vera . Let us go back to your beau . Did you love him ? Winny . Well , I loved him enough to wish he had asked me  --  but what was the use of crying because he did n't ? That would n't bring him back , would it ? Vera . Not if there was another woman . A woman can do almost anything with a man  --  unless there 's another woman . Then  --  good-by ! Can I guess who your butterfly is ? Winny . Running to her . Impossible ! If you knew you 'd laugh at me . Kneels to her . LIDA enters at folding door and comes to VERA . Lida . At back of table L. The gentleman from the Legation has called , Madam . Vera . At last ! Rises joyously , and to WINNY . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him up , at once . And Lida  --  leave word that I am at home to no one . Lida . Yes , Madam . Exits L. C. Vera . Excuse me , dear  --  it 's about Boris . Winny . No ceremony . I have to go away . Vera . Be sure and come back to dinner . Au revoir . Kisses her and exits R. Winny . I 'll come . Where 's my hat ? Takes it from chair R. and goes to mirror . PAUL appears at L. C. Paul . Will you see Mr. Airey , Miss ? Winny . Mr. Airey  --  certainly . PAUL exits L. C. What a pity he has called just as Vera is busy . AIREY enters L. C. , in morning costume , flower in his buttonhole , and with an enormous bouquet of roses . Oh , is that you ? Airey . Of course it 's I  --  in the house of the Siren . I 'm drawn there . It 's my fate . What 's that the fellow says : " Faith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , how are you ? Winny . Very well , thank you . I need n't ask how you are . Airey . No , all my friends say that I positively shine out  --  for all  --  like the sun ; it 's happiness . My soul is  --  is bathed in joy . Winny . That 's your normal state . I never saw you without a flower in your buttonhole , and your soul bathed in joy . Airey . Ah , but never such a bath as this . This is a regular Russian bath of joy . Love never did such havoc before . Through and through , round and round , heels over head . Winny . Yes , that 's you . But how about the Baroness ? Airey . Sits C. , calming down . Well , I ca n't make her out as yet . She seems to be playing a little game of hide and seek . This is my third call this morning . Winny . You 've seen her twice already ? Airey . No . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home . Winny . Oho ! Airey . Now what do you say " oho " in that tone of voice for ? It 's only a mask she 's putting on . She 's afraid to see me , for fear she 'll betray her real feelings . Winny . Well , I shall never cease wondering that a woman like the Baroness should leave Russia , and pass through all Europe , and cross the Atlantic to come here , just to fall in love with Mr. Alexander Airey . Rises . Airey . Rises . Do n't chaff a fellow like that . Ai n't I good enough to be fallen in love with ? Winny . But you do n't deserve it . Your heart has been a regular hotel  --  changing boarders every twenty-four hours . Airey . Well , I treat ' em well while they stay . They get the best of everything . I keep a good table . Winny . Meditatively . And the Baroness is in love with you ? Airey . You see it 's a case of suppressed affections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now she 's blazing right out . Winny . And to think  --  all for you ! Airey . Well , it 's got to be for somebody . Nettled . See here , you keep on saying that in a very uncomfortable manner . Winny . No , I do n't want to make you more uncomfortable than is inevitable . Put down your bouquet and go home . She wo n't see anyone . Airey . Oh , she 'll make an exception in my case . She will see me . I crossed the Rubicon this morning . Winny . Good-humoredly . Good gracious ! How ? Airey . Sent her a letter . Winny . You never could be so bold  --  Airey . What 's that the fellow says : Crosses to L. " Be bold , be bold , ever more be bold . " Winny . Yes , but the same fellow also says : " Be not too bold . " Airey . I was n't . I broke it gently to her  --  in poetry . Winny . Your own ? Airey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to suit my case . Just listen . Puts bouquet on table ; sits . " Oh , never eye could see thy face , And never ear could hear thy tongue , And never thought could scan thy face That ever thought the labor long . " Winny . There are a great many " evers " and " nevers " in it . Airey . Do n't interrupt : " But eye and ear and every thought Were with thy sweet perfections caught . " Winny . Very beautiful . I always liked that poem . Airey . And here is how I wind up : " Come live with me and be my dear , And we will all the pleasures share That town or country , park or field , Or Fancy 's every wish can yield ! " Winny . Rises . It 's flat burglary . Stolen and melted down . You 'll be found out . Airey . Never mind , if she likes it . Do you think she 'll like it ? Winny . I ca n't say . Airey . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Oh , she ca n't mistake your meaning . LIDA appears C. L. , crossing slowly . Airey . Oh , Miss Lida  --  will you have the kindness to announce me to the Baroness ? Winny . Why , I told you she was at home to no one . Besides , she has a caller . Lida . I beg pardon , Miss , the caller has gone , and the Baroness will see Mr. Airey immediately . Winny . Amazed . She will ! Airey . Triumphantly . What did I tell you ? It was only a mask to hide her real feelings . To LIDA . After you . Lida . No , if you please , you are to go right in . Airey . To WINNY . Aha ! Presents LIDA with his boutonnire gallantly . Pray accept this for your happy tidings . And now for victory ! Taps at door R. and listens . Vera . Inside . Come in . Airey . Exultantly . Come in ! To WINNY . Did you hear that ? " Come in ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with his bouquet , in a bound . Winny . Crosses to LIDA . Can I believe my ears ? Was she really in earnest or only laughing ? Lida . Holds up both hands . Laughing ! My gracious , Miss Winny , it 's no laughing matter , as the gentleman will find out . He 'll catch it ; that 's all . Winny . What ? Do you think she will  --  ? Lida . If I know the Baroness , she was never in so much rage . And when she is angry , because it is so seldom , there is no joke about it . The gentleman will find out . I am afraid to stay . Exit L. C. Winny . Poor Sacha ! I wonder what he will say . The door at R. is suddenly burst open , and AIREY staggers in loaded with his bouquet and two others , in one of which a letter is wired very prominently . He sinks exhausted in a chair . Winny . Views him from the opposite side . Well ? Airey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon ! Airey . Not soon enough . Winny . Did she drop the mask at last ? Airey . She did , and showed her real feelings , too . Winny . And blazed away ? Airey . Yes , and I was right there in the blaze . Winny . Do tell me . Sits at L. table . Airey . She called me in  --  just to turn me out for good . Did you ever know of such calculating malice ? Here are my bouquets . All of ' em . Here 's my poem  --  all of it . They were all piled up in there , ready for me . I tried to apologize . " Not another word , sir ! " " But allow me  --  " " If you do n't leave instantly I 'll ring the bell ! Not once , to summon the maid ; nor twice , to summon the footman , but three times , to summon the  --  how do you call it ? " Winny . That 's her foreign way . Airey .

Crosses to door L. Airey . Coming down . Do n't laugh ! I 'm furious ! The half-civilized barbarian ! The Siberian Circe ! Winny . Pulling on her gloves , vexed . I 'm furious , too . But not at her , though ; at you . Airey . At me ! After being treated this way by that woman with her three bells ! Winny . That 's just it . You ought to have had more self-respect than to make yourself ridiculous . Airey . Ridiculous ! I was never ridiculous in my life . Winny . Hush ! You do n't know what you are saying . Goes on with her gloves . How do you expect to leave the house with those bouquets in your arms ? You 'll be the laughing stock of the whole neighborhood .

Last winter , when I happened to speak of our old black laundress who was ill , you never said anything ; but when I went to look her up I found that you had been there before me , with your doctor and a hired nurse , and had filled her room with comforts . I said to myself : " Well , with all his nonsense , he has something to command respect . " But I was mistaken . Crosses up L. about to go . Airey . Do n't go , Miss Winny ! Winny . I was sadly mistaken ! Exits C. L. Airey . I 'm in hard luck to-day ! VERA enters R. As the door slams behind her AIREY starts up , the bouquets roll off his lap , he hastily scrambles to his feet . Airey . I beg your pardon . I am going . Vera . Are you here yet ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I could n't leave the house with my arms full of these things . I should be the laughing-stock of everybody .

Dashes at him ; he drops the bouquets again . Do n't let me hear you talk in that manner . Airey . You would n't be sorry . You would n't care a snap . Snapping his fingers . That 's what I mean . Picks up bouquets . Vera . Coolly . No , I should not . But there 's a very pretty girl who would . Airey . A pretty girl ? Revives . Who ? Where ? Vera . You do n't deserve it ; but I 'll betray her for your sake . Confidentially . Miss Winny ! Airey . Miss Winny ! Why , she was the very first to laugh at me . You ought to have heard her a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laugh cuts me to the quick every time . Vera . Indeed ! Airey . I believe that girl positively hates me . She has even stopped her father giving me lessons . She grudges me even that little comfort . How can she care about me ? Vera . I 'm certain . Her apparent aversion is only a mask . Airey . A mask ! That settles it . Going up . I know all about masks . No more masks for me . Vera . Then I 'll convince you beyond a doubt . She really loves you , for she confessed it to her cousin Faith  --  under the seal of profoundest secrecy ! And Faith confessed it to me under the same obligation . Airey . And now you confide it to  --  oh , say , you 're not joking . Honor bright ? Vera . You may depend upon it . Airey . Jubilant . She loves me ! A settled despair and gloom comes over him .

Fall on your knees and ask for her forgiveness . You are fortunately one of those people no one can be angry with very long . Airey . Brightening . Do you think so ? Vera . Just look at me . I was furious a little while ago , and now Offers her hand. it 's all over . Shakes both his hands . Airey . Ah , Baroness ! Vera . I will even accept those dreadful bouquets .

I loved papa so dearly . Passes her hand across her forehead . I only now begin to know and feel how much I loved him . And to think he could send me away from him in that way . Sinks into chair , C. Vera . It was not the father that did it , dear , it was the despot . He only did as all despots do  --  exile those who rebel against their stern authority . But there always comes a time when the exile returns . Faith . Quickly . If I could only hope that . PAUL enters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beg pardon , Madam , this gentleman called . Vera .

Perhaps he brings a flag of truce . The war is over . Runs to C. and meets HARRY , who enters L. D. , and clasps her arms about his neck . Oh , Harry  --  darling brother ! Have you come from papa ? Harry . Coldly . Puts hat on chair L. Yes . To BARONESS . Good-morning . Faith . Takes his hand and sits . Did he give you a message for me ? Harry . No ; he does n't know that I am calling here . I only returned home an hour ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once . He unclasps her hand from about his neck , and leads her to a seat . With some sternness . Faith , I wo n't describe the state in which I found father . I saw at the first glance that he had received a blow that had almost killed him . I could hardly believe my ears when he told me all that had happened . How could you act as you did ? You were mad . Faith . Then you have only come to rebuke me . And I trusted so fondly in you to help  --  to intercede for me . Harry . What good would intercession do ? You know father and his inflexible sternness . There is only one way to obtain forgiveness . You must submit . Faith . I can not . Harry . Faith , let me beg you . Think what must happen . Sits . Faith . Starting away from him . No , no ! I will not think . Do not ask me . I have thought and suffered enough since last night . Passing by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fate between you . But one thing I am resolved .

But , Faith  --  sister ! Turns to VERA with anxiety . Wo n't you say a word to her , Baroness ? Vera . Who has , during the foregoing , kept up the stage at window , and evinced displeasure and inquietude , but suppressing her feelings and drumming with one hand on a small table . Who ? I ? Harry . You are her best friend , and you heard all we said . Vera . Yes ; and I 've had to keep my teeth set for fear I should give my opinion before it was asked . With a burst of indignation . But if I hold back any longer , something will give way . Yes , I 'll say a word . Not to her , not to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say to your father . PAUL appears L. C. Order my carriage . PAUL exits . Harry . You will not venture to speak to him ? Vera . I shall venture to speak to him as I venture to say he has never been spoken to before . I love Faith as a sister , and I shall use a sister 's privilege . Harry . But , Baroness , you do n't know my father when he is angered . Vera . For that matter , he does n't know me when I 'm angered . So we 'll both have our little surprise . I wish he 'd try his anger on me . It would give me a chance . I should n't cringe before him as you do . I should knock at his heart  --  if he had one . If he 's so hard and stubborn and fierce . I can be hard and fierce and furious , too . Thank Heaven I 'm not a Russian for nothing . Harry . My advice is not to meet him in that spirit . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night 's scandal . Vera . For which nobody was to blame but himself .

He has done enough for his country , and deserves a rest . He 'll have his hands full bringing up his grandchildren . Harry . Puzzled . His grandchildren ! Vera . I said grandchildren  --  and I meant it . Let 's hope he 'll have plenty of ' em . Harry . Come , Baroness  --  let us talk reason . Vera . No , no . Anything but that . It makes my blood boil to see a young man like you talking reason  --  reason  --  reason . Where 's your heart , your youth , your fire , your flame ? You 've been deceiving us . You 're not flesh and blood . You 're not even alive . You 're a machine with clock-works inside which your father winds up and sets going by his watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe I have nothing further to say , Baroness , except Good-morning .

On that account I excuse you for thinking you may treat me like a fool or a child . Turns to go at door L. C. Vera . Stop ! You sha n't go in that spirit . Thank goodness I have discovered that you have some feeling . That 's what I wanted to know . That 's why I provoked you . Impulsively . Can you forgive me ? Goes to him , puts out her hand . He takes it reluctantly . She takes his hat in the other and lays it upon table L. , then goes to him and offers both hands . Do you forgive me ? Harry . Baroness ! He grasps both her hands warmly . They come forward . Vera . Do you know it becomes you to be a bit angry ? Now I am sure you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a heart to suffer and endure , and to shield one you love .

Just fancy yourself in your sister 's place . Say that you are in love  --  deeply  --  des  --  per  --  ate  --  ly . Harry . With whom ? Vera . With a woman , of course  --  one whom your father refuses to hear mentioned  --  me , for instance . Can you imagine you are in love with me  --  fondly and absorbingly ? Harry . I can , madly  --  devotedly . Vera . Getting nearer . Very well . We two are in love : and you have just been telling me how deeply , how passionately you love me ; how you ca n't live without me : and how you dream of folding me in your arms and pressing kiss upon kiss  --  Harry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And I listen until my heart grows still and I gaze helplessly into your eyes and tremble at your passion  --  Changing tone. and that 's all . I do n't get kissed . Harry . Quickly . Why not ? Vera . Rises . Slowly . Because you have to go home first and ask your father 's permission . And if he should say : " N  --  n  --  no ! " because he did n't fancy me , or for any other reason , then you would have to come back to me and apologize . " I am very sorry , Baroness , but I ca n't kiss you . Because , if I did , my papa would get angry and send in his resignation . " That 's your view of duty under the circumstances , is n't it ? Harry . No , Baroness , it is not . If Heaven really granted me such a happiness , I would seize , would hold it , would defend it ! Vera . Crosses L. quickly . As your sister defends hers ! Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has the right to fight for her love as she would for life ? Harry . Takes her hand . Yes .

And I shall never forget her . Taking her hands and kissing them again . Prof. Professor What , Baroness , you have incited him to rebellion ? Vera . I know it . Oh , when it comes to rebel against tyrants , I 'm in my element . I 'm a Boraneff , and the Boraneffs have always been famous as the greatest family of conspirators in Russia . Harry .

But I could n't summon up courage enough to do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as soon as I touched the door-bell , my courage fell into my boots , and when at last I did brace up , it was too late . Winny . Why ? How late ? Airey . Well , it was a quarter past two in the morning . But I know you have got a good , generous , forgiving disposition  --  have n't you ? Say you have , or I 'll never be able to tell you . Winny . Never mind the disposition  --  what have you got to tell me ? Airey . You 'll be astonished . I was . It 's all up between us . Winny .

Wo n't you let me tell you about the Baroness ? Winny . It 's not of the slightest interest to me . Airey . I know . But you might n't be so icebergy . You have n't given me fair play in the game all along , anyhow . Sits on arm of tte-a-tte . Winny . Coming to C. What 's that ? I did n't treat you fairly ? When was that ? How ? Airey . Why  --  when a girl loves a man  --  she ought to show a little of it , just to let him know whom he can have  --  if he wants her . Winny . Never ! She should keep her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That 's very well too ; but suppose she keeps it locked in several women 's hearts  --  what then ? Winny . Crosses L. , with dignified air . I fail to understand . Airey . You told it to Faith .

But you do know ! Winny . Petulantly . No , I do n't ! Airey . Come , off with the mask . You felt all along that you were the only woman I really loved . Winny . Mr. Airey ! Airey . You know you did . A child could have guessed it . When a man of my age begins to take music lessons when he has no ear and no talent and no taste for it , people naturally ask  --  if the teacher is n't a woman  --  if he has a daughter . Winny . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So it was all for my sake ? Airey . Yes . For your sake . And I had such dreams of our future ! You once talked of a cherished hope  --  a trip to Italy . Do you remember ? I beheld us ; us is you and me , this time . I beheld us in Rome , Florence , Naples , in a dolce far niente , with my arm always about your waist , and you whispering to me : " Alessandro mio ! " Embracing her . I got that at the Italian Embassy . It 's the Italian for " Alexander , I am yours . " Yes , I dreamt you said , " Alessandro mio ! " Sounds well , eh ? Winny . " Alessandro mio ! " Laughs heartily . Airey . Laugh away . But I was in dead earnest , and I loved you madly . Winny . No nonsense now . Airey . Stop ! Do n't you remember one day I was going to say something , and you put up your drawing-board between us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I was going to propose then . Winny . Really ? And I thought you were going to sneeze ! Airey . Turns away disgusted . You ca n't make me believe there 's a girl living who do n't know when a sneeze is coming and when a proposal is . You burst out laughing , too . You did know . Winny . I did laugh , and I was sorry afterward , because you looked hurt . But you were so funny . Your mouth opened  --  just like that  --  and stayed so for so long , and nothing came . Airey . What a Jonah I must be ! When I 'm dead in love I look funny enough to sink a ship . Ah , life 's a strange thing . If you had n't laughed that time She turns on him. we 'd be married now . Winny . Oh , no ! Next day a new sun would have dawned on your horizon . Airey . No , no . When my love is returned , it goes on increasing and increasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in every case . No , if you had n't laughed that time , we 'd have been happy , all three of us . Winny . All three ! What three ? Airey . Why , you and I , and your father . Winny . Papa ? Airey . Of course ; we could n't very well leave him out , could we ? Winny . No , certainly not . Airey . He 'd live with us and I 'd have a jolly little music-room built for him . Piano in the middle , organ in one corner , writing-desk in another , pictures and music-books all around . Stained-glass windows and frescoed ceiling with cherubs like this Folding arms and looking down. leaning out of the cloud to listen to his playing . As the fellow in the play says , " Dost like the picture ? " Winny . Taking his arm . " Alessandro mio ! " Dear papa ! How happy he 'd be ! Airey . Perhaps we 'd all go and hear his own opera performed . I 'd manage it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They always laugh when they see me . And when summer came , we 'd go anywhere we pleased . Winny . No , we would n't . We would n't go anywhere but to the seaside . Papa has always longed for it so . And when we came home  --  Airey . " When we came home ! " " Oui "  --  that 's French for " yes , " you know  --  may I hope then ? Winny . No , no ! I was only supposing . Crosses R. Airey . That is n't fair , Miss Winny . You were just going right into the spirit of the thing , and you liked it , and I 'm entitled to say : " One word from you , and it 's fact instead of fancy . " Do say the word , Miss Winny ! Or , if you do n't want to say it , simply put your hand in mine . Winny . No , no ; it ca n't be settled as quickly as all that . Turns away . Airey . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you might weaken if you did . Just slip your hand behind you  --  then your right hand need n't know what your left hand is doing . Winny . After a short pause .

Takes both her hands and kisses her . Winny . Demurely . No , papa , I always liked him . It was only his faults I was bound to condemn . Are you angry with me ? Arm around his neck . Prof. Professor With you , child ? Certainly not ; but Mr. Airey is old enough to know that my permission ought to have been asked first . This is said with a weak assumption of dignity . Airey . Just the contrary , Professor . When we get as old as I am we know that the main thing is the daughter 's permission . Winny . Apologetically .

Oh , no , papa , I could n't bear the thought of your being alone . Airey . You 'd live with us , in your own beautiful room , with your music and your pictures , and your books and your piano . Winny . Takes his hand . And go to the opera every night . Airey . Takes his hand . Yes , go and hear your own opera , too . Oh , we 've settled all that .

Aside to him . Not before them any more . You can come home with us . Bring papa . Goes up C. , humming an air , her hands behind her . She glances back , singing , with a smile at AIREY , when in the door-way , and then exits . AIREY buttons coat , sings the same song , and then goes up , when HARRY , who has been shaking hands and congratulating the PROFESSOR , turns and calls him . Harry . Do n't go . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was only looking to see that my gloves were in my hat . Harry . Seriously . You have something to tell me , have n't you ? Airey . Recollecting and sobering up . Oh , yes . Wait . Goes to PROFESSOR . Professor , if you have no objection to my walking home with you  --  Prof. Professor Warmly . My dear boy ! Airey . I have just a word to say to Harry . Do n't let Winny go till I come ; then , if you have any particular business anywhere else , I can see her home myself . See ? Prof. Professor Pretending stiffness . Oh , can you ? That means , you want me to be engaged somewhere else . Upon my word , you 're a  --  Crosses up L. , melting. you 're a good boy . I 'll manage it . Pats him on the back and exits quickly , L. C. Harry . Grasping AIREY by the hand . I feel some compunction , my dear fellow , for having asked your assistance in my affairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Airey . Oh , that 's all right . Now that I belong , as it were , to the family , I 'm doubly yours to command . Did you get my note from the club ? Harry . Yes , and I thank you sincerely . It is needless to say I am perfectly satisfied with all that you have done . Airey . Everything fell out as we planned . I drove at once to the club and the first man I saw was the Baron . We went into the library and I came to the business at once . " Last night , " I said , " after leaving Mr. Rutherell 's house , you came here , and in the presence of several gentlemen you made several observations reflecting on the Secretary and his daughter . A friend has apprised his son of the matter and I am here on his behalf to request you to withdraw your insulting remarks in the presence of the parties to whom they were made . " Harry . Who has listened with folded arms , sits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Airey . Most emphatically . Says he merely expressed an opinion , and had nothing to add or retract . Hearing that , of course , I asked him to name a friend with whom I might discuss the matter further . He agreed , and about a minute after sent in Major Civitanti . We settled the preliminaries in a twinkling . I told him we wanted no sham satisfaction , but the most complete reparation for a gross insult . Harry . Thank you ; that was right . Airey . The Major agreed there was no alternative , but I noticed he wanted a good bit of ground between the muzzles : twenty paces . I insisted upon ten . The major said it was murderous . I observed it would be more murderous the other way , for you were so near-sighted that at twenty paces you were as likely to hit one of the seconds as your adversary . That settled it . My conditions were agreed to with alacrity . Harry . Why , that was really a  --  Airey . A bad joke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theory of mine in such cases that one bad joke is often worth a hundred grave suggestions . It makes a fellow 's heart lighter . Harry . You may be right . At all events , I never knew I could look forward to such a meeting with so light a heart as mine is to-day . Airey . Advancing to him . Bravo ! That 's the right spirit . Looks at his watch . Do n't forget  --  it 's seven o'clock . I 'll drive up and wait outside for you if you like . Harry . Thank you , dear boy . Airey . Laughs . You ought to have seen Major Civitanti stare when I told him I knew a real nice place across the river , in the grounds of a friend of mine , who was never so happy as when he was obliging a couple of friends to " come to an understanding , " as he called it , in this way . I wired him and got his answer at once . " All right , " he replied , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tea , and you can have everything to yourselves . " When I showed that telegram to Civitanti he got so faint he called for a brandy-and-soda . But I must n't stay chatting . By-by . Call for you at six . Exits hurriedly at C. L. Harry . And now for my first battle for my sister 's sake . As he goes up the door R. opens and the SECRETARY enters holding an open letter in his hand . He stops on seeing HARRY . Secr . Secretary Oh , you 're there , Harry . Will you explain this letter I found on my desk ? And Jordan tells me that your sister has come back to the house . That she is in your room . That she is there now ! Harry . Yes , sir . I brought her back myself . Secr . Secretary You ! Harry . In low tone . Yes , sir . I knocked at your door this morning , but you would not open . May I speak now ? Secr . Secretary What you have to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bringing her to reason , and to a sense of duty , it would be too late . The scandal is public ; and her marriage with an honorable and distinguished man like Baron Stuyve is now impossible . Harry . You misunderstand me , father . Faith is firm in her  --  Secr . Secretary She still persists in her disobedience ? Harry . Please , listen , sir . Secr . Secretary And she dares cross this threshold , and you dare ask me to receive her ? Harry . We hoped , sir  --  Secr . Secretary For what ? That I would forfeit my word to an honorable man ? Harry . We hoped that you would see that this is exactly her case . She has given her word  --  with her heart  --  and she will not recall either . Secr . Secretary And she dares to return here  --  after my express command  --  and she thinks  --  Harry . She thinks she can find protection with her brother , and that is why she has come back  --  to me . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father , but let her live as a young girl ought to live  --  in her father 's house . Secr . Secretary Sitting , and firmly . I tell you there is no place for her in my house . Harry . There will be , if I go . The rooms you gave me to be mine  --  to use as I thought best  --  I give to her . If a child of yours must dwell under a stranger 's roof let it be I. Secr . Secretary Endeavoring to control his emotion . You  --  you are going to leave me ? Harry . I am going , sir  --  and it may be for a long time . Dashing away a tear . Do n't think me ungrateful , sir . Perhaps I am about to do my best to repay you all you have done for me  --  even when I seem most rebellious . Secr . Secretary Gazing into fire . Go  --  go . Harry . The time comes when one must stand alone . He is too apt then in his helplessness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am I  --  what do I know of life ? I am a bookworm , emerging from a closet , and groping in the light . I have been permitted to seek nothing  --  to have nothing , save by rule and line . You have led me and fed me like a child . Secr . Secretary And the time has come now for you to cast me off . Is that what all this means ? Harry . No . It means that I wish to be closer to you . I have been your son . Let me become your friend . Be my guide and counsellor , not my master . Do something for me out of love ! blind , foolish love for your boy ! Stands beside him and places his hand on his shoulder . Let Faith stay , Father , I beseech you . Do n't let me entreat in vain . Secr . Secretary I let no one entreat in vain . What is right to do and just I do freely . But neither prayer nor threat move me against my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You speak of nothing but justice , sir . I was speaking of love and mercy . The day will come when their voice will sound sweeter and stronger than any other . Secr . Secretary I will wait for that day to come . JORDAN enters , C. , with a card on salver . Jordan . Card , sir , Mr. Mossop , I think . Secr . Secretary Taking card and tossing it contemptuously on table . Show him up . Rises . JORDAN exits , C. Harry . Father , do n't send me away like this . It is in your power to grant me a favor  --  a very great favor  --  the last I may ever ask of you . Secr . Secretary I can not . Plead no further . I have never permitted myself to do as I liked  --  I have always done as I ought . I will not swerve from that rule of my life now  --  though my firmness may cause you , and even myself , a lasting sorrow . Duty has been the first word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word of my life . Harry . The last word , sir ! With a sudden struggle and resolution , going up , and in the doorway . Father ! Heaven grant that you may never regret sending me from you at this moment  --  with that last word ! Good-by ! Exits C. The SECRETARY sits in his chair , nervously twitching his fingers , but otherwise immovable . As HARRY passes out , MOSSOP enters past him at C. , making a low and obsequious bow which HARRY does not notice . Mossop . Putting his hat on small table . I hope I have not intrude on any privacy , Mr. Sacretary . So good of you to see me in the midst of your droubles . Secr . Secretary Not at all . I am always glad to see my friends . What procures me this special pleasure ? Moss . Mossop Drawing a chair closely and sitting beside SECRETARY , eying him like a hawk . You must first let me really gongratulate you upon looking so well . Not a bit altered . Just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much ? Moss . Mossop Well , dere are such stories going about . One he say you have grown ten years older in de last twenty-four hours . Anoder say your health is broken in little pieces ; anoder he say your mind is giving way all de sudden . Secr . Secretary Your friends are mistaken . I am luckily one of those who find under the burden of misfortune the strength to bear it . Moss . Mossop So you are ! So  --  you  --  are ! That is your force of character . Oh , I tell efferybody dat when dey speak of you . Secr . Secretary Am I so much discussed ? Moss . Mossop Oh , de whole city is talking . Ven someding happens vit a man of your brominence , it has got to spread and grow  --  till it grows from a fly-speck to an elephant . Dey make mountains out of your turning your liddle girl out of your house in de night-time , and dey make a great deal of politics out of de intimacy in your house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much gonsideration for your feelings to tell you all dat I have heard . But if you vill imagine de vorst , you vill about hit de mark . Both seated . Secr . Secretary I understand , I understand . But what public man , Mr. Mossop , is proof against slander ? The world , sir , makes no exception in my favor . Moss . Mossop You are right . I don 'd blame de masses  --  de vulgar herds ; because dey only judges by de outside appearances . But dose peoples what you know  --  what haf stood by your side  --  I would not forgif dem . It makes my blood boil . Secr . Secretary But what have they against me ? Have I not done as any of them would ? Moss . Mossop Vat do dey care about dat . De man dat holds on to his power , he only is right ; and ven he has to resign  --  Secr . Secretary Amazed . Is it known , then , that I have sent in my resignation ? Both rise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the President when your letter came  --  and , by the way , as he knew I was goming directly to see you , Mr. President charged me with a confidential message . Secr . Secretary Eagerly . For me ! I have been waiting  --  Moss . Mossop De President stands by you ; he will refuse to receive your resignation . Secr . Secretary Relieved . I thought so . Moss . Mossop Following him . He begs you to withdraw it . Secr . Secretary Proudly . It was only what I expected . Offers MOSSOP his hand . I thank you heartily for this news , coming , as it does , at the most trying moment . Confidentially , but proudly . I shall not conceal from you that I forwarded my resignation simply to ascertain whether I still retained the confidence and approval of the head of my party . To seat L. Moss . Mossop Yes , Mr. President takes dat view of it , too . He dinks de best is you vithdraw your resignation  --  and apply for leave of absence SECRETARY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thunderstruck . What ! Moss . Mossop Den , after a vhile  --  ven efferybody has forgotten de cirgumsdances  --  he vill quietly fill your place . Secr . Secretary Is that the message you are charged to deliver to me ? Moss . Mossop It is gonsidered de best way to avoid remarks and to give you a chance to disappear from the scene unnoticed and without further scandal . Secr . Secretary Bitterly . " To disappear from the scene unnoticed ! " And this is my reward , after years of labor and devotion to my party !  --  and of public service ! Moss . Mossop It is rather hard . But you haf one gonsolation  --  you haf always been as hard on yourself as you were on oder people . But Mr. President knows how faithful and stern you have been to your duty , and he asked me particularly to express his regrets to you . Secr . Secretary Same . Pray convey my most profound gratitude to the President . Moves away . Moss . Mossop I vill do so . Goes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at SECRETARY . By the way , I see you do n't seem to feel much alarmed about your son and Baron Stuyve . Secr . Secretary Turning on him . About my son and the Baron ? Moss . Mossop Oh , you do n't know dat ! Puts his hat down again . It appears de Baron spoke somedings disrespectful about your daughter and you ? Secr . Secretary Baron Stuyve ? Moss . Mossop Exactly . Den your son demanded an apology  --  and dere is talk of a very serious meeting between dem . Secr . Secretary Nonsense , my dear Mr. Mossop . We are not in Europe , where the duel would be a natural outcome  --  Moss . Mossop I do n't say it to frighten you , my dear sir . But it is better dat you interfere . De Baron is a dead shot and he will not be trifled with . Secr . Secretary My son will take care of himself . Waving him off as though he would be alone . I thank you for your interest . Moss . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I go always where dere is some misfortune . When I leave you , I shall go to the Mackenzies . Vot you think  --  deir son-in-law is just gone to Canada  --  and dey is all broken-hearted , and do n't want to see nobody ; but I vill push my way in . Dere is nothing like a friend . Suddenly stretching out his hand . Vell , good-by . The SECRETARY walks to the mantel and leans on it . MOSSOP goes up C. I shall come again ! Yes , Mr. Secretary ? Yes , I shall come again . I have the honor . Exits C. Secr . Secretary This , then , is the end . Harry was right . Standing back to fire . All my life I have weighed and measured : paying according to my sense of justice  --  but giving nothing . And now I am weighed and measured and paid with the justice of the world . Yes , he was right , my son  --  there is something more , and I have not understood it . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darker by degrees , as if evening came on . At C. a light is seen approaching , and old JORDAN enters with a lighted lamp , which he places on the piano . It half illumines the piano , which is further illumined by the red glow from the fire near the chair on which the SECRETARY sits . Then JORDAN comes to the SECRETARY , as if to light the lamp on his table . Jordan . Will you have more light in hyar , sir ? Secr . Secretary No , that 's enough . He sits gazing into the fire , and JORDAN moves slowly off into the room at L. , gazing very affectionately at his master . After a momentary pause the PROFESSOR enters at C. , looks in  --  seeing nobody  --  looks back and beckons to someone . VERA enters and he closes the curtains behind her . Then motions her to be silent . VERA goes up to the window at back and conceals herself behind the blind . The PROFESSOR has a portfolio of music under his arm  --  and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon it . Prof. Professor Tapping again . John ! John ! Secr . Secretary From his chair . What is it ? Prof. Professor Turning round startled . Oh , you are there , brother ? Conceals the portfolio behind his back . Excuse me . I thought you had gone to the office . Secr . Secretary Sighs . I 'm not going to the office . Prof. Professor Oh ! Concealing the portfolio up the back of his coat . Then I wo n't disturb you . I  --  I suppose you want to be alone with your thoughts . Getting to his L. Secr . Secretary To himself . Alone with my thoughts ! Nervously . No ! no  --  stay here ! You 'll oblige me by staying . Will you stay ? Prof. Professor L. of SECRETARY . Why certainly , my dear John . If you do n't mind putting up with me . Edging up , so the SECRETARY wo n't see his back . I shall be happy  --  and proud . Secr . Secretary Without lifting his eyes . What did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , well , John , I have such a great piece of news to tell you . Such a great happiness . My Winifred is engaged to be married . I  --  I did n't want to speak of it in all your troubles  --  but I ca n't keep it in . BARONESS gives a faint cough to warn him . Secr . Secretary Absently . Ah , I am glad that you 're happy and that she is . Prof. Professor Motioning VERA to be quiet . We have been crying and laughing together . And I am to pick out a wedding march from my opera , but my old instrument would n't do ; it is very well for an every-day happiness , but it 's not the thing for a great fortissimo outburst . So I stole in here to try it on your piano . But that 's out of the question now . It 's too noisy . Secr . Secretary No , no ; go on . Prof. Professor Exchanges glances and signs with VERA . May I really ? Goes over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And will you listen ? Opens music , selects a piece , plays and sings loudly . Let us rejoice ! Let us rejoice ! Let us rejoice ! VERA touches him warningly on the shoulder . He stops suddenly , looks round and sees his brother 's head sink on the table . No  --  no  --  no ! That 's not the right thing for you . Softly . Not now . Going to the SECRETARY . Brother , it 's years and years since you have given the time to hear me play anything . And it ought to be something different . Touches the piano softly , playing a few bars of a pensive air , and after a while he speaks . Tell me , brother , have you heard from Faith ? Secr . Secretary Startled . No , no ; why do you ask ? Prof. Professor After a sign from VERA . She has sent you a message . Secr . Secretary Amazed  --  sharply . By you ? Vera . Coming forward R. , gently , and throwing wrap on back of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The SECRETARY starts and turns . The PROFESSOR , who plays on half thoughtfully , permits intervals to lapse , and finally stops his playing as the scene progresses , forgetting his music altogether . Secr . Secretary Starting up . You here , Madam ! She extends her hands as if entreating him to remain . Pardon me if I withdraw . Vera . No , no . I will go away if the sight of me is so hateful . Secr . Secretary Leaning on chair . The subject you would speak on is a forbidden one . Vera . Quickly and soothingly . Very well . I will not speak on her behalf . I will speak on my own . You can not have forgotten the first time that we met . You were a stranger travelling in my country . I was a little child and my father saw you lift me on your knee at his hearthside . Could he think it possible that one day you would close your door against me ? Secr . Secretary Be seated , Madam . I will listen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hand across his brow . Vera . Thank you . In all countries it is the same . Our fireside was broad enough to warm all who entered , as yours is . Sits . I was a glad child when you saw me and for many years after . Sighs . But there is a difference even with fathers , in knowing how to make the child glad and the woman glad . Is it in this new country as in the older land , that a daughter must not find happiness for herself ? With us , in our country , a woman 's life is a journey , a going from station to station : the cradle , the school , the first ball , then at length they cry out suddenly : Last station  --  Marriage ! Rises . All out ! She laughs quietly then becomes bitter . That was the way with me . It was my father who chose my husband , who listened to his vows of love , who answered for me , who gave him my heart . I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes " at the altar . But it was quite right and proper . I was a dutiful child . I laughed . With intensity , giving a bitter laugh , which dies away as she resumes . But after  --  in the wedded life , the years that followed , I laughed no more . Pause . But  --  Rises lightly . I 'm learning how again , little by little . Sits on arm of chair , R. C. , with one hand on SECRETARY 'S chair . Oh , if I could paint for every father what those sorrowful years were to me . If I could say to them : " Make no laws for a daughter 's heart . It became all yours , without her will or power to withhold , when the first dawn of instinct taught her to know . It goes out to another without her will or power to withhold , when the first dawn of love teaches her to feel . " Secr . Secretary Suppressing his feelings , half rises . You are speaking for my daughter  --  you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what use is it for me to speak when you would not listen to your son ! Secr . Secretary Under breath , but struck . My son ! Prof. Professor Brother  --  listen to her . Vera . Has he not been here ? Has he not begged you with a last word ? Have you not refused ? He turns away his head and gazes into the fire . PROFESSOR sits at the piano . You are silent . It is easy to refuse when life is strong , and the blood is warm ! But when we have him no more  --  SECRETARY turns away. when the lips that made the prayer are forever silent , it is a hard thing to remember . I recall the last wish of my own little brother . SECRETARY sinks into seat . He had always been pale and thin , poor little fellow ! a flickering flame from the first  --  fluctuating between day and night . When it came to the time when he was too weak to leave his cot  --  almost too weak to speak  --  he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ image , a priceless gem of carving that stood on a table near him . He used to long for it so , but it was too precious , and father did not want him to play with it . But one day , when his eyes were , oh , so big !  --  it seemed as if he were looking through them from another world , and would soon go away and leave them dark forever  --  papa , who was watching by his side , had a sudden summons to go out , and fearing he 'd be gone all day , bent over and kissed him . " My darling son , " he said , " you will be here when I come back , will you not ? " My little brother opened his eyes and smiled  --  and then glanced toward the little image , as if to say : " May I have it now ? " Papa could resist no longer , but placed it in his poor thin little hand and went out . Pause . When he came back , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knelt beside his bed and cried to break his heart ; for his little boy lay there , with the toy clasped tightly in his tiny hand , and a smile on his sweet face , like sunlight or a last joy . Pause . Rises . But with papa 's tears came the comfort that he had given his boy the last happiness he knew on earth , had listened to his last prayer , and had granted his last wish . Stage L. Secr . Secretary Who has buried his face in his hands , now looks up with a heart-broken outcry . O God ! O God ! Prof. Professor Coming quickly forward at back of chair . What is it , brother ? Secr . Secretary Starting up . My boy  --  my son ! He has left me  --  I let him go ! Vera . But you can grant his last request  --  his last word . Secr . Secretary Yes , yes ! JORDAN appears , opening L. door . Prof. Professor Throwing himself on SECRETARY 'S neck . Oh , brother , brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will see her ! JORDAN holds door L. open for FAITH , who enters . VERA going quickly to meet her . Vera . See , she is here ! Faith . Papa ! Oh , papa ! Secr . Secretary Come , come to my heart  --  for his sake . She falls on her knees as he sinks in his seat and folds her in his arms . Prof. Professor Flies to the piano and bursts forth with the wedding hymn . Let us rejoice ! Let us rejoice ! Let us rejoice ! VERA claps her hands in joy . CURTAIN . ACT IV . SCENE .  --  The same as the last . The day after the events of Act III . JORDAN is discovered at the window up L. , peeping into the street through the curtains , which he rearranges before he comes forward . Jordan . Shu ! Shu ! Laughing and coming forward . I'se done seen folks in love afore dis , but I nebber see any two like Miss Winny and Mars Airey . Goes up and looks out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a'walkin ' up and down de street dere  --  a'talkin ' an ' a'talkin ' as doe dey nebber seen one anoder for six monfs Closes curtain and comes down. when dey was only here last night , helpin ' along de racket of de family reunion when Mars Harry come back safe and soun ' , wind an ' lim ' .

Jordan Mars Rutherell 's been out all de morning , Miss Winny . It wos sich a han'some day . Winny . Going to window and parting the curtains . Yes , it is a very handsome day . After a furtive glance at JORDAN , who is not looking at her , she beckons as if to some one in the street . A lovely day ! Closes curtains suddenly and comes down . How is uncle , this afternoon ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ describe him , Miss . He 's jist bloomin ' all over ! Why , dis mornin ' he came out en his room , a'hummin ' a toon to hisself . Actually a'hummin ' a toon . All de years what I bin wid Mars John , I nebber hear de like er dat . AIREY enters , C. , quickly , hat in hand , stops confused on seeing JORDAN . Airey . Oh , that you , Jordan ? Jord . Jordan Aside . Golly , dere 's de oder one ! Suppresses grin . Airey . Is Mr. Secretary at home , Jordan ? Jord . Jordan No , sir  --  but Miss Winny 's here . Slyly . Airey . Pretending surprise . Miss Winny ? Adjusts eye-glasses . Where ? Oh , there ! What a surprise ! why , Miss Winny  --  I did n't expect to find you here . Jord . Jordan I golly  --  dat 's a good one ! Airey . I have n't seen you for an age . Jord . Jordan Well , bress de lor ' ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Airey . Eying JORDAN . What are you shaking for ? Coming to him . Jord . Jordan You sayin ' as you had n't seen Miss Winny for an age . Bursts out . Airey . Well , what 's there so side-splitting in that ? Jord . Jordan Why , Mars Airey , I'se just been watchin ' you two from de window dar  --  walkin ' up and down de street . Airey . The deuce you have . Jord . Jordan Yes , sir  --  for an age ! Winny . Vexed and turning away . Oh ! Airey . Jordan , you must have something to do downstairs . Jord . Jordan Heh ? Hm , hm !  --  Oh , I understan '  --  I understan ' , Mars Airey . " Two 's company  --  three 's worse'n a camp meeting ! " Exits , C. , giggling . Winny . Reproachfully . It was your fault . Airey . What of it ? I only wanted to be alone with you for half an hour . I knew the Secretary was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strategy for us to drop in casually  --  one after the other  --  then nobody would suspect . Winny . And you see how the strategy worked . Caught the very first thing . Airey . Anyway I managed your father pretty well . Left him in the Smithsonian studying the new phonograph , and listening to Patti 's voice coming through a foghorn , while we just strolled around . He wo n't suspect . Winny . But what 's the use of all this secrecy , now ? Airey . Why , secrecy is the whole charm of being in love . A stolen kiss , a whisper at the carriage-door , a squeeze in the dark ! Winny . Alexander , I 'm surprised ! Airey . Do you think I 'm going to be robbed of all those luxuries , because nobody opposes our union ? Not much ! What 's that the fellow says in the play : " Dost think because we are virtuous there are to be no more cakes and ale ? " That reminds me  --  you ought to have heard my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rascal all your life , but your choice of a wife makes up for everything . " And he just hugged me . Oh , you 've captured him ! Draws her to his side . Winny . Meditatively . What did he mean by " makes up for everything ? " What have you been doing ? Airey . Oh , he meant my wild oats . Winny . What wild oats ? Airey . Oh , seeing the sun rise too often . Winny . Have you been in love very often ? Airey . Very  --  but I never loved till now . Winny . I do n't understand that . Turns away from him . Airey . Do n't you ? A man may be in trouble over and over again , but not be troubled about it , may n't he ? Well , a man may be in love lots of times , run after a pretty face , bask in the sunshine of a smile  --  what 's that the fellow says : " Give sigh for sigh "  --  and not lose a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But that 's flirting ! Airey . Innocently . Is it ? Well , perhaps you know . Winny . Indignantly . No , indeed ! I said to myself when I left school , " I shall give my heart to one , and one only ! " Airey . Well , that 's what I said when I left school : " When the one I love comes along , I shall love her , and her only ! " Winny . And all these wild oats ? Airey . Well , you had n't come along , that 's all . Winny . Never mind ; tell me all about your father . I 'm in love with him . Does he like me very , very much ? Airey . Does he ? See what he went out and bought right away . Produces a jewel case . Winny . Opens case . A bracelet ! With diamonds in it ! For me ? It 's too pretty ! I do n't know how to thank him . Airey . Send him a kiss . Winny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  by me . Winny . No , no ; I 'll wait till I see him . Airey . But I 'll see him so much sooner , and I can hand ' em right over . What ? Winny . No , thank you . Airey . Besides , he told me to collect on delivery . Fact ! Winny . Fibber ! Well , you can take him one . Airey . Kisses her . Ah ! Winny . You know I think you 're very inconsiderate to me . Airey . Why ? Winny . Because you know I ca n't refuse you anything . Airey . Ca n't you ? Winny . No . Airey . Then give me another kiss . Kisses her . PROFESSOR appears at C. , hat in hand . Prof. Professor Ahem ! They separate . Well , I see I might have waited all day by that phonograph . Airey . Why , Professor ! Winny . Papa ! Airey . The Smithsonian is a very big place , Professor . Winny . And it 's so easy to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would be easy to find one another again . Prof. Professor Yes . You seem to have found one another . Sighs . I suppose old people are in the way . Airey . Why , Professor ! Prof. Professor Hold your tongue ! You take me to an inaccessible part of the institution , and then lose me . But it 's my own fault . If I wanted attention , I ought to have opposed the match . A nice prospect for my future ! Talk of strewing my path with roses , of illumining my declining years . If I want illumining , I 'll have to be my own lamp-lighter . FAITH enters door , L. , bright and radiant . Faith . Crosses to PROFESSOR . What 's the matter ? Who is scolding ? WINNY flies to her and Kisses her . Prof. Professor I 'm giving this gentleman , whom in a moment of guilty weakness I took as a son-in-law , a piece of my mind . He monopolizes my daughter . Absorbs her . FAITH goes to him , takes his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's eternally whispering to her . Only this morning I turned to mention something to her , and there he was at the other ear whispering something too , just as he is now . And I 'll be bound she heard what he said , and never heard a word I said . FAITH takes him across the stage , as AIREY joins WINNY on the other side . I tell you they do n't treat me like a father-in-law . They treat me like a mother-in-law . He sits and she remonstrates with him leaning over the back of the chair , and throwing her arms round his neck . Airey . To WINNY . I 've got a capital idea . You take your father aside and pretend you want to talk to him . I 'll take Faith aside and pretend I want to talk to her . Then I 'll slip out and you can follow . Winny . Wavering . Wo n't that be too transparent ? Airey . Not a bit . You 'll see how it 'll work . Goes over to FAITH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Takes her aside as WINNY joins the PROFESSOR . Faith . Certainly , Mr. Airey . Airey . Aside to her seriously . Miss Faith , I want you to talk to the Professor . Not on my account , but Winny 's . He wants her all the time , and I want her all the time . Now where 's the poor girl to find time for all that ? Faith . Smiling . Of course . It is hard . Airey . Is n't it ? Some fathers are so inconsiderate . I tell you what . Suppose I leave you with him now . I can slip off unperceived . Pushes her to L. Faith . Well , I 'll try what I can do . Crosses L. and sits . Airey . Do , do . I 'll do as much for you some time . Steals up C. on tip-toe . Beckons to WINNY and exits C. Winny . To PROFESSOR . Yes , papa . You ought to try and cheer Faith a bit . She pretends to be happy , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prof. Professor Innocently . Do you think so ? Puts on his glasses to observe FAITH . Poor dear ! Winny . I can leave you with her and slip out without her noticing . Prof. Professor Kissing her . You think of everybody . Watches FAITH , going toward her slowly , as WINNY goes up C. , where she meets AIREY , who steals back for her . He puts his arm about her waist , and they go off together . Prof. Professor Coming over to FAITH , who rises and is about to cross to meet him . My dear ! Faith . Yes , uncle . Prof. Professor Winny begged me to have a word with you . Faith . Yes , uncle . And Mr. Airey begged me to have a word with you . Prof. Professor With me ? Why ? Faith . Taking his arm , roguishly  --  and bringing him to C. Why ? I think it 's because they wanted to play us a trick . Prof. Professor Play us a trick ? Looking round . Faith . To give us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Prof. Professor What ? Looking round . Gone again ? Faith . Yes . At window . There they are  --  walking up and down . Prof. Professor Runs to window and adjusts his glasses . What ! It 's a fact . And the villain has the audacity to nod and wink at me . And smile and grin . Shakes his two fists at him . You  --  you  --  pirate ! Faith . Drags him from the window laughing , and they come down stage . Let them go . You must recollect they 've got so much to tell each other . Prof. Professor You 've a kind heart , my dear , and you deserve to be happy . Takes her hand . Are you ? Faith . Ought I not to be ? Just think ! Papa is so kind and so good  --  as if he had just begun to love me . And Harry is so devoted  --  and you so good  --  and Vera , who did it all , more than a sister to me . I should be hateful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's all very well , but it 's not all the happiness you need . Though you do n't speak , I know what is deep down in your heart . Draws her to him . Come , my pretty one  --  you need not be afraid of telling me . Faith . No , no , uncle ! I entreat ! Do n't touch upon that ! I must bear it alone  --  struggle against it  --  if I can : suffer for it , if I must . And however great the pain , no one shall know  --  least of all papa . The SECRETARY enters , C. , with JORDAN . FAITH continues aside , to PROFESSOR . Remember , uncle , not a word before papa . Secr . Secretary Coming forward after dismissing JORDAN with a message . Ah , Faith , darling , I wish to see you . Shakes hands heartily with PROFESSOR . Oh , brother  --  do n't go . Turns to FAITH , takes both her hands and places them on his shoulders .

Secr . Secretary It is to be a feast . Will you and Winny join us ? Prof. Professor Coming down L. With pleasure ! But do n't throw away that old Madeira on us . Secr . Secretary Ah , you dear old soul  --  the best that I have can not be thrown away , if given to you . Dear brother , I have not been as good to you as you deserved . Takes a hand of each . I have been rich in love , and yet have lived all these years like a beggar . But you have both been patient with me and waited . Saving up all the tenderness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But , tut , tut , no more sad thoughts to-day . We are to have a feast  --  such a feast . Yes , there are to be other guests  --  two , in fact .

Kisses him . Secr . Secretary There  --  go and see that everything is made ready . She runs off R. , stopping at the doorway to look back and throw him a kiss . As she exits , the SECRETARY sighs and turns to PROFESSOR . Yes , I am glad . You will see a great change in this old house , brother . I have planned it all , with the help of a most experienced person  --  a revolutionist who comes from an old family of conspirators . Prof. Professor Old family of conspirators ?

Secretary Sh ! Do n't shout it . Prof. Professor In a whisper . You have interceded for him ? Secr . Secretary Yes . To be sure , I did not succeed in reinstating him completely with his government , but I obtained a reprieve for twenty-four hours , to reconsider his case and arrange family matters . Prof. Professor What  --  family matters ? Secr . Secretary That is to be your surprise . You 'll meet him at dinner  --  that is , if he accepts , and Faith does n't object . Prof. Professor Oh , I 'll pledge my life she wo n't object . Secr . Secretary If you like , wait for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ R. U. E. Prof. Professor No , no , I 'll come back .

Tell me , my son , is it true what I heard this morning , that Baron Stuyve owes young Bagoleff large sums of borrowed money , and was unable to pay them ? Harry . Yes , it 's all pretty well known now  --  that Stuyve joined in the conspiracy to blacken Bagoleff 's character and get him out of the country . The boy is as open-hearted and generous and unsuspecting as he is rich . I could not mention all this to you before , because I did not like to pain you . But he has been misjudged . Secr . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought to make him some amends ? Harry . Warmly . If you would , sir . Secr . Secretary Ah ! Sitting by table L. But how  --  tell me how ? Harry . Hesitating .
