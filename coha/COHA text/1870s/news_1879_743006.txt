txt The English financial papers are giving a good deal of attention to what they term the " bank crisis " of the closing months of last year . The peculiar experience which is thus designated was marked by general despondency and gloom , the prevalence of many disquieting rumors , a marked apathy in all departments of the money mar- , ket , and a very decided distrust of the banks . During September there had been more or less vague apprehension . In October this was suddenly aggravated and rendered much more intense by the disastrous and disgraceful failure of the City of Glasgow Bank . When public feeling had in some degree recovered from this shock , there came the break-down of the West of England Bank , which involved a much less amount of loss , but which had an effect nearly as great , coming , as it did , immediately on the heels of the Scotch failure . The most marked features of the situation were . a rapid and general fall in the price of bank shares , a considerable withdrawal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England , and an increase in the deposits of the Bank of England amounting to $35,000,000 in the two last months of the year . The bank rate of interest , however , has not advanced beyond 6 per cent. , at which point it was placed Oct. 17 , and was reduced to 5 per cent . in November , to 4 per cent . and then to 3 per cent . in January . The " crisis " was confined almost entirely to the joint-stock banks . How far these have suffered , it is impossible to say accurately . They have undoubtedly been somewhat crippled by the loss of deposits , and they have also undergone a less direct and less obvious , but perhaps more serious injury in the fall of their shares and their transfer , which , as is pointed out by the Economist , was for the most part from stronger to weaker , or at least more reckless , holders . This latter fact is due to the unlimited liability of shareholders which is the requirement of law for the greater portion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rendered uneasy by the possession of stock which , in the case of a failure such as that of the City of Glasgow Bank , might swallow up their fortunes , and saw but little compensation for this risk id the rate of average profit prevailing . On the other hand , the shares of this class when thrown on the market in large quantities immediately after so disastrous a failure , were apt to fall into the hands of men who , buying them at a low rate , had little to lose by the legal liability , and were tempted by the prospect of considerable immediate profits . The result must have been the infusion into the shareholding body of an element by no means calculated to improve it . Such a change , moreover , would sooner or later have its effect upon the direction of the banks , and the consequences of the crisis which , so far as they are palpable and direct , have now passed away , may in the future , in an indirect but more important - manner , make themselves severely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition of things , no one calls on Parliament to immediately administer a sovereign remedy . England is pretty well cured of the notion that sound banking or prudent administration of private business can be secured by law . The only explicit recommendation of legislation that we have noticed is that the requirement of unlimited liability shall be repealed , and that holders of shares shall be liable only for , say twice the par value of their shares . This , it will be remembered , is the provision of the National Banking law of the United States , and it has worked very well here . It undoubtedly tends to make investment in bank shares attractive to a class who would not consent to hold them at the risk of all their property , and it is , in practice , a more valuable and available security than that of unlimited liability . It is better to have the liability of men who can and will pay , each one , a moderate amount than that of a similar number , of whom only a few can pay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Creditors are mere seoure , and no one is ruined , while the ownership of the bank and , consequently , its final management remain ' in the hands of more responsible persons . Another feature of the situation in England to which some of our financial agita- tors would do well to give attention , is that when there was a very general and natural , and to some extent a well-founded , distrust of the banks , no one proposed that they should be straightway abolished , and that the Government should undertake the business of holding deposits on interest . In such a crisis in the United States , we should have had a score of oracles in and out of Congress proclaiming that the only safe way out of the trouble would be for the Government to issue an interconvertible bond , in which all the world could put its money at discretion , and from which it could draw its money again when it was wanted . It is not to be denied that the situation of the English banks is far from perfect . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are therefore compelled to keep out at interest . Their investment of their deposits is complicated , and the balance between demands and resources is always delicate in the extreme . They are exposed to terrible danger in case of a panic , and the competition , the absolute necessity of doing business , both with them and their customers , is so great that a panic is never impossible . The whole financial system is so highly organized and so extended that a serious disaster to the banks must be followed by very great distress . But English business men are at least aware that they must bear their own burdens and run their own risks , and they very much prefer to do so to trusting the key to their affairs to any legislative or political body . The same sentiment undoubtedly exists among business men of our own country . It is mainly those who have little to lose , and whose chief source of gain is in getting rid of their honest debts , who cry out at every turn for the interference of the Government in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
