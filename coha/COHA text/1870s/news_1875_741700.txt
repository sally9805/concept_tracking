txt Forty years ago the annual export of corn , wheat , and other grain from the United States amounted to but little more than one-half per cent . of the total export trade of the country . At that time the only important items of our exports which came under the head of " broadstuffs " were wheat and cora flour . These two accounted between them for about seven per cent . of the total annual exports . By way of comparison , it may be stated that taking the average of the ten years , 1831-40 , our exports of cotton reached the proportion of sixty per cent . of the entire export trade . Daring the last four years , 1871-4 , these figures show a , very decided change . The proportion of flour exported has , indeed , fallen to about four and a , half per cent . of our total exports ; but wheat , from forming a little over one-quarter per cent. , has risen to eleven per cent. , while Indian corn , from the same figure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the total exports of the country . In other words , during the ten years- ending 1340 the average annual exports of the United States amounted to eighty-eight millions of dollars , of which wheat flour accounted for five millions and . a , half , and wheat and corn for a quarter of a million cacti . During the last four years the average annual exports have reached the sum of five hundred and forty millions and three-quarters , of which there - were twenty-two millions and a , half under the head of wheatflour , fifty-nine millions and a quarter under the head of wheat , and . twenty millions of Indian corn . We export more wheat to-day than we did of cotton forty , or even thirty , years ago , and , taking into account all descriptions of breadstuffs , they represent a larger amount than our exports of cotton did twenty years ago . Now , as then , cotton is king among American exports , but instead of accounting - for from fifty-five to sixty per cent . of the whole , as it did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirtyeight per cent. , while grain and flour , instead of being restricted to from ten to twelve per cent . of the total , now account for : fineteen per cent . of all the annual exports . It is not surprising , therefore , that the prospects of the general business of the country should be to a great extent dependent upon the probable demand for our surplus grain and the prices which we are likely to receive for that commodity . The chief market for American breadstuffs is found in the United Kingdom . For the harvest year closing at the end of this month the estimated demands of the British market from foreign countries were seventytwo millions of bushels of wheat . The harvest of 1874 in the United Kingdom yielded 13,700 , - 000 quarters , but the total annual consumption being nine millions of quarters more r than this , the deficit had to be supplied from abroad . Between Sept. 1 , 1874 , and the middle of last month , the United States had already dispatched forty out of the seventy-two millions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , the prospects of a deficient yield quickened the import movement to England before the close of what is known as the harvest year , and by Aug. 31 it will probably be found that the receipts at British ports have considerably exceeded the estimate of seventy-two millions of bushels . Whatever be the figures , the United States will undoubtedly be found to have furnished its usual quota of from sixty to seventy per cent . of the whole . The most convenient basis of calculation of the probable British demand Om our wheat is to take the wants of the period between Sept. 1 . 1875 , and Aug. 31 , 1876 . The average yield of wheat in the United Kingdom last year was thirty-one bushels per acre , being one bushel and a half below the standard average . It is a tolerably safe assumption that the average yield of the present year will not exceed twenty-eight bushels per acre , corresponding to the average of the nine years 1865-73 . This would leave a , deficit on the same area of consumption as last year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seventytwo millions , of bushels . But the United States will , unquestionably be called upon to supply a larger proportion than usual of this deficit . France had a large surplus crop last year , and appeared against us as a competitor in the English markets . This year she may not improba- bly have to supply from abroad the d.eficieneie'a in her ' . harvest . Data in regard to the wheat harvest in Hungary , Russia , and Germany are still too imperfect to form the ground of calculation , but it seems hardly probable-that the yield is above an average . On th 's whole , for the harvest year beginning with - Sept. 1 , it seems to be a modest enough estimate to make that our exports of wheat will be twenty-five per cent . larger than during the year ending with this mouth , while the average price for the year will be about seven and a half per cent . higher . Our exports of corn will , of course , be affected by this stimulated demand , and , in round numbers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty to twenty-five millions of dollars more during the coming harvest year than we have received during the one about to close .
