BEDS AND TABLES , STOOLS AND CANDLESTICKS : IL MORI ! ABOUT THE LIVING-ROOM . FTER the publication of the first of these chapters ( ScRIBNER for June , 1875 ) , several letters , as might have been expected , came to the editor , all asking for more minute and particular directions on various points only touched upon : the cost of this , that , or the other piece of furniture ; where one might hope to find some piece which looked inviting as pictured in these pages , but , seemed as hopeless of ever being achieved in real life as the prize pansy of a seedsman 's spring catabout anything else ; it really looks as if house-furnishing turned more upon this one item than upon all else besides ; as if , to parody Poor Richard , the American housekeeper were persuaded if she would take care of the carpets , the chairs and tables would take care of themselves . Yet this writer has not had any new inspiration on the subject of carpets and rugs since he wrote his first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the matter of carpets weighs on the housekeeping mind , that even in the summer-time it set people to writing letters about how they are to cover their floors the coming winter . One thinks in these autumn days how pleasant t would be if we could only settle the matter as easily as the model housewife Nature does . Here is the lawn , that has been mowed to a velvet nap-the No . I. " AHA ! I AM WARM-I HAVE SEEN THE FINE ! alogue . But more questions were asked ideal , the poetic carpet I  --  and raked clean in these letters about carpets and rugs than of every slightest twig or stick ; yet a light // breeze stirs of an afternoon , or blows through the night , and the dark green is golden yellow with myriads of locust leaves , that cover the drives as well , and huddle in a bordering fringe along its edges . Nature 's continual , kindly lesson is , " Do n't bother ! " but we can not learn it , and , in spite of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as our wits can devise . The advice to use rugs instead of carpets was given , not as the result of an individual discovery , but as a return to first principles , which had been followed for hundreds of years by nations who are admitted , on all hands , to have successfully solved a great many of the problems of external living . In England and America carpets were used in the beginning to cover up badly made floors , and to promote warmth by keeping the air from coming through cracks . As floors have continued to be badly made in these countries , as a rule , ever since they began to have wooden floors at all , and as these floors are rarely , we may say never , solid , but simply planks resting on beams closed on the under side by the lath and plaster ceiling of the room below , carpets have been held indispensable these many years ; and as great perfection has been reached in their manufacture-as they are thick and soft , and may be handsome-they will hold their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floors are so well made as to permit us to do without them . Yet they ought to be discarded on several grounds . They are the source of by far the greater part of the dirt and dust that annoy housekeepers and endanger health . It only needs some person of a statistical and worrying turn of mind to save the contents of the dust-pan for a month or so , and to insist upon the presence , at Hankinson 's , of the members of the family who stand up for carpets to the bitter end-when the roller brings their end of the acre of painted woolen under the tell-tale beaters  --  to prove to any doubtful persons what dirt-makers and dirt-holders carpets can be . Of course , rugs are dirt-makers and dirt-holders just the same , but the advantage is , that they can be easily moved and shaken whenever it is thought necessary , and without occa V. , No. 2 . T IS HOME WHEREER THE HEAETH IS. // qwq One of these ways the end can be accomplished of making the floor tight and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the way , the sweeping can all be done with a hair broom , and as little dust raised as possible . It is understood that unless it be a table in the center of the room , no heavy piece of furniture is to rest upon the rug , but that it is to be free to get up and go out and shake itself whenever the house-maid whistles to it . All this has been said or hinted before ; but there is one other point that has not yet been touched  --  a point on which nearly all the letters that have been received , in query or criticism on the first of these articles , exhibit anxiety . This is the question of symmetry . Several letters have been received asking how to treat the floors of two rooms opening one into the other , the " front and back parlor " of so many New York houses . But it ought to he understood that " symmetry " - or , to use a word that will apply to color as well as to form- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the owner of one of these multifarious drawingrooms by what he puts forward as his own taste . In nine cases out of ten it is not his taste at all , but the taste of the town , and he has meekly put himself into the hands of the fashionable Furnisher . We might as well lay the charge of the theatrical , vulgar paraphernalia of a modern first-class funeral at the door of the dead man upon whose unresisting body all these hideous " Porai embiems ' are piled . The fashionable Undertaker sits on him when dead , as the fashionable Furnisher sat on him when alive . We can not judge of his taste until he shows it ; until he takes his house into his own hands , and makes it to his mind . It is to persuade people to do this that these papers are written , but the writer is not very hopeful of persuading any but young people and those who have a natural independence . Rich people are for the most part so bullied by their money , they do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are well on in life do not , as a rule , take enough interest in the subject . They find the old shoes easier to the feet . But the young people can be asked to look at nature , or-if they ca n't get into the country to take the next best thing , and study the Japanese decoration on books and trays and tea-pots - with a view to ridding their minds of the belief that things ought to be in suites , * that a front parlor must be like a back one ; that one side of a chimney pier must just reflect the other ; that there must always be a middle and sides , and so forth , and so on ,  --  laws which are Medean and Persian laws to tradesmen and conservative , safe , respectable furnishers , but not laws with which we are concerned . Nature , who never makes two sides of a leaf alike , nor two sides of a flower , nor two sides of a face , will surely repay industrious study of her works by some hint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bent on seeing our back parlor reflected in our front one like the sky in a mill-pond . Each room ought to be considered by itself no matter if it be only nominally separated from another by the piers on each side of a wide archway . Its floor , its walls , its ceilings , ought to be brought into harmony by a right arrangement of colorthat is the first thing . They are only the background for the furniture , the pictures , and the people , but they must have unity among themselves . It is not of course No. 4 A SURPRISE PARTY . meant that they should be like one another , or that any one of them should be all of one hue . But , the wall being first divided up horizontally into its natural parts , the wainscot or dado , the wall-paper. the frieze and the cornice , all these must make an agreeable impression upon the eye ; and if a person does not feel that his own knowledge or instinct is all be needs to help him bring // the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from some artist , or architect , or from some professional decorator , who is a decorator by nature and training . We have plenty of good guides-Mr . Russell Sturgis , Mr. George F. Babh , Mr. Alexander Sandier , Mr. James S. Inglis , Mr. John La Farge , Mr. Francis Lathrop ; if a man were in doubt as " how to present Wall , " any one of these accomplished architects and artists could solve his doubt , and make him glad he had had it . The walls once settled to the owner 's mind , the floor may almost be trusted to take care of itself and yet , before thinking of it , the ceiling ought to be married to the wall by being papered or painted in harmony with it . Our ceilings have been getting into bad ways of late , though rather mending than otherwise from what they were five years or so ago . Then the plasterers had it all their own way , and a pretty mess they made of it . They evidently thought " there was nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of late , than to put into our always small rooms cornices heavy enough for a Roman palace , with centerpieces as ponderous and outlandish as their wits could devise . Since architects have come to be consulted so much with regard to the furniture of the houses they design , it has been getting more and more the custom to put the whole interior decoration into their hands , and the ceilings have shared this good fortune-for it often is good fortune-with the rest . A white ceiling can only look well when the room is white , and it ought to carry out the tone of the room , whatever that may be . The difficulty has been that coloring the ceiling has been thought to be attended with considerable increase of expense ; it must be painted or frescoed , and accordingly it is but rarely colored at all . There is no reason at all why a ceiling should not be papered as well as a wall , and in building houses if all plaster ornaments were omitted from the ceiling , and all cornices also , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper , or washed with color , money could be saved , and a much more agreeable result obtained . Of course the paper on the walls should not be repeated on the ceiling , but one chosen that will harmonize with that , and , as a rule of general application , one that is lighter than the lightest part of the wall . If there is a cornice at all it ought to be small ; something merely to break the ugly line where the wall and ceiling meet ; a wooden molding will often be all that is needed , and will be cheaper than plaster . But , " says one letter-writer , " alt this is expensive , and we are tired of spending money ; besides , you told us in the beginning you were going to show us bow to make our houses pretty on next to nothing . " The coinplaining writer is not quite fair with us . Nothing worth having is to be bad without expense either of time or money , but many of the best things in house decorating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ object to is the measuring beautiful things by a money standard , or a standard of fashion ; and what seems to me most needed just now is , that people should put their own taste into their houses and not depend so much on professional help . It is often seen that people have an instinctive tastea sense of color , a gift at making a room look cozy with simple , inexpensive thingsa gift at making a table look elegant with homely china and linen ; but few even of such persons are willing to trust their own intuitions . Years ago , when the Philistines were telling in Gath , and whispering in the streets of Askelon , that it was a barbarous thing to wear blue and green , or two blues , or two greens , or two any colors in the same dress , a few women who had n't the fear of Philistia before their eyes , and were quite given over by all their fashionable friends , so far as dress went- " makes a perfect guy of herself , you know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wearing blue and green ribbons on their bonnets , or two blues , or two greens , or two any colors they pleased-and , as they were not to be N* . 5 . CHAIR AND TABLE FROM COTTIER'S. // taught how to behave themselves , Mrs. Grundy quietly let them gang their am gait . Now , to-day , Mrs. Grundy thinks blue and green together " just lovely , " and the " Mesdames M*des et Persans , " who make the laws of the modes , have reconciled even the artists to their doings , and combine colors that even artists would n't have dared to put side by side on their palettes a few years ago . The luckless ladies who did as they pleased and flew in the face of fashion , were simply born colorists , though born too early ; but any woman who can make a bouquet , or knows how to dress herself so that artists praise her , is pretty sure to make a room harmonious with very simple materials . It would be very easy for some women to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eye should be at once exhilarated and rested , and the whole should not cost as F much as another woman would spend on a single piece of furniture-of which , after all , the best she could say would be , " You would n't believe it , but this chair cost so many dollars . " Now that wall-papers are so greatly improved in their patterns , and so cheap in price , it can not be that anything but taste is wanted to make a telling arrangement at a small expense ; and if paper is not to be had , the color that is put upon the walls should be water-washes , and not paint , and this , not because of the greater cheapness of the water-wash alone , but , because of the better surface fexture , the avoidance of even as little shine and gloss as the flattest treatment of paint can not avoid . The treatment of the floor is then , after all , the simplest part of the problem , and there is no reason why it should be more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least-for rugs and carpets are always more costly than naint or naDer-not so much more expensive as is thought . A firstrate rug is a first-rate investment for any one who has enough of the artist in him to enjoy seeing things get mellowed and subdued with time , who does not like to see things spick-and-span new . A rug of first-rate make and good design gets better with time , until it is actually used up . That is , it gets better to the artist eye ; but everybody has not the artist eye , and people who do not care for the soft , blended tints of the best Eastern rugs , had better have squares made of the best European carpets with borders sewed on . Have the floor painted , or stained , and shellacked round the edges of the room in a band wide enough for the carpet-rug to overlap it six inches or a foot , and to clear all the large pieces of furniture that stand against the wall . This solves the problem of the carpet , and is getting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A little while ago rugs were a rarity , now they are imported by thouNo 6 " BUT SOFT ! WHAT LIGHT THROUGH YONDER WINDOW BREAKS ! " , sands , and are met with , good , bad , and indifferent ( but rarely " good " ) , at every turn . As for the color , it ought to be light or dark to mate with its own room , but surely it ought not to be insisted on that all the rooms which open into one another should be or seem to be alike . Let the front parlor be good in its way , and the back parlor in its , and they will not be discordant when one is seen from the other . But I wanted this month to say something about fire-places and mantel-pieces . Enough has been said about carpets and rugs-at least I have emptied my wallet and said all the little I know about them . In fact , there is such easy communication in America , that whereas a little while ago , what has been lately said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desirableness , on picturesque grounds as well as grounds of healthfulness , of leaving much of the floor bare , was all " news , " now it has almost become old-fashioned doctrine , and people are waiting for something that shall have the charm of novelty . So with the question of grates and mantel-pieces . We are just putting behind our backs the time when furnaces were all the rage , and the doctors in consequence were rattling round in their gigs with no end of business , and it required a // qwq chimneys out of their houses , or building the piers up solid , kept on putting in expensive make-believe fire-places , and erecting mantel-pieces over them , as if they could n't bear to give up the memory of what had once been so pleasant . In those days , the kitchen came near being the only cheerful room in the house , for there , at least , there was a real fire-place with a real fire in it , giving out heat that was actually warm . Poorish people had to give up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dear ; but rich people who might have kept up the delightful luxury , did n't , of course , dare to , when all the world took to burning hard coal . However , some few of them did , and there were others who wanted to , and so made a compromise by employing that funniest of all the fashionable humbugs of our time , funnier than wedding presents , than funeral flowers , or dinner parties with borrowed silver , the fire-place with its makebelieve andirons supporting make-believe logs with pieces of asbestos stuck between them , and made red-hot by lighting the gas discharged by pipes hidden behind the fraudulent heap . Still , even this , vulgar or babyish as it was , was a concession to the deserved no fair words . It was and is honester to frankly make a hole in the floor and warm yourself at that , than to pretend you still have something left of the beloved old-time fire-place with its hospitable warmth and eye-and-heart-delighting glow . It was noticeable , too , that , all the time we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doors , the traditional surroundings of the fire-place became more and more pretenticus and unmeaning . The house-builders went on building chimneys , and , though we did n't use them , there seemed no way of using the piers except as supports for make-believe mantel-pieces , with mirrors over them . And then cheapness began to run riot in her delight at seeing how much finery could be got for next to nothing . This was the era of marbleized slate , by which invention nature was taught what ugly things in the way of marble she might have made if she had been born a Yankee ; and the manufacturers became at last so intoxicated with their success in the business as to overshoot the mark and produce a reaction . Now , as we know , marbleized slate , if found at all in good houses , is thrust out of sight into rooms little used ; No. 7 . " AND ONE DESCRIBES A CHARMING INDIAN SCREEN . " // but its main employment is in cheap houses made to sell and to tickle the buyer 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stunning mantelpieces are supposed to make the rash gazer1 while he wipes his eye , forget to remark the cracked and blistered plaster , the gaping wood-work , and the wind that whistles through the door and window-frames for want of thought . But marbleized slate , though dead , has let his mantel-piece fall on the shoulders of " wood , " and the fashionable furnishers are trying how much vulgarity they can get for a good deal of money in that material . But not to waste words on these offensive mixtures of veneer and meaningless moldings , let us be glad of anything almost that keeps alive the sentiment of the fire-place , especially since we see how much has been done of late to re-instate the open fire in public favor . People have been finding out that though a furnace may be an excellent thing in the long-continued cold of winter , yet there are days in early spring and late fall when a fire of logs is much pleasanter and seems to go more directly to the right spot . And then all the accompaniments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire-dogs , or the taller andirons , the tiles that border the opening , the brass fender of open-work , the very shovel and tongs , with the bellows ,  --  all these are the shining armor of the god of fire , and he likes to let his sparkling eye roam over them in the twilight , as he recalls a thousand memories of the days that are no more , or feeds a thousand hopes for the days that are to come . It is a good plan to have the fire-place made as in our illustration No. i , which , with No. 2 , has been copied by Mr. Inglis from wood-cuts in " The Architect . " The two fire-places and mantels were designed by Mr. Edward W. Godwin , one of the best of the rising English architects . Mr. Francis Lathrop , who has drawn all the other illustrations in the present article , has added the lady in the first wood-cut , and has kindled the flames that Mr. Marsh has cut with such a flowing hand . The fire in this illustration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the andirons . This being mov*able , a wood fire can be kindled on the hearth at any time , the cradle for coals being simply lifted off and set away . The other illustration , No. 2 , shows a grate set into the pier in the ordinary way , but the reader 's attention is particularly called to the plainness of this grate , which is in pleasant contrast to the showy , over-ornamented , pretentious things that are so much in favor with us . There is this excuse , however , for the bad taste shown in the employment of the " fashionable " New York grates : they are not intended for use , but for show . Probably not one in fifty of them ever was defiled by fire ; yet they are almost always well made , and in the stage scenery of our social life they may be reckoned among the things which the slang of the theaters call " practicable ; " they are real things , not shams . But , if they are used , they very soon lose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of care and labor to keep them neat and bright . The English grates , the best of them , are either kept very plain , or depend for their ornamentation upon good design . The best of the modem English grates , those designed by Mr. Morris particularly , depend for their ornamentation a good deal upon the delicate casting of the iron , which brings out the patNo. 8 . CHINESE CTAGtNE , WITH CUPBOARD . // tern in clear relief on the flat surface . it may be remarked in passing , that very good ornamental casting is done here even now , and in the old time our American casting could not be excelled . The " Franklin " stoves for burning wood were covered with excellent ornament executed in a first-rate No. 9 . CHiNESE *TAG*RE , WITH MODERN ENGLISH SCONCE . manner , and the good design and workmanship were inherited by the " Nott " stoves , that superseded them on the coming in of anthracite ; but the stoves for heating made now are as coarse in execution as they are clumsy in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the cooking stoves , but they are generally kept austerely plain . The English grates I am praising come provided with the prettiest appendages in the shape of andirons , brass shovels , tongs and pokers , fenders , scuttles , with " trivets , " for holding the tea-kettle ; and when the grate is fairly installed with her frame and tiles ( as in No. 2 ) , her ministering kettle singing on the trivet , and all her shining appurtenances in order about her , a man must have an inhospitable streak in him , or be entirely given over to " social science " and the Spencer-Youmans theory of life , who does n't feel the cockles of his heart thrill a wee bit with the cheerful human sight . But , however people have been willing to give up fire-places , they have not been willing to give up mantel-pieces , and , indeed , I suppose the keeping up even a show of fireplaces has been partly owing to the liking for the shelf that has so long been suspended over them . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one way-that is , with two seeming posts , or piers , or pilasters , one on either side supporting an entablature , or sometimes a simple lintel , whether of wood or marble , and the shelf supported by a molding that played the part of cornice . This is the arrangement which , whether reduced to its simple element in upstairs bedrooms , or covered over with a heap of absurdities by way of ornament , obtains in nearly all our houses , and wherever in any country there are fire-places at all . In New York , Boston , and Philadelphia houses of the late last century or early present century , pleasing examples of this may be found where the piers and the lintel are sculptured , sometimes by skillful hands , with delicately designed classic ornamentation of leag or flower , or arabesque ; but this refinement seemed tame to the next generation , and but little of it survives . In England in the time of Queen Anne and the early Georges , there was a great deal of this sort of work done , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carve mantel-pieces ; nor would it be a bad thing now if some of our sculptors would leave their search for the ideal and their search for a big job , and take humbler tasks in hand , that were perhaps better suited to the measure of their talent . In England to-day they are coming to set great store by the delicately carved mantel-piece of Queen Anne 's time ; and as the houses of that period are pulled down , as too many of them are , the mantel-pieces , and not only the mantel , but the wroughtiron stair-rails , the wainscoting and the paneled doors are bought up , often for good round prices . But there , as well as here , houses built thirty or forty years ago have nothing in them worth buying , except as lumber , and it will be so with the houses we are building to-day . In wood-cut No. 2 Mr. Godwin has discarded , even more positively than in No. i , the old post and lintel system , and has devised a very simple way of framing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , // 35 ' in fact , two shelves ,  --  the lower one with projecting ends , and , between it and the upper one , a long strip of mirror , which enables us to look at ourselves on the sly by accident whenever we want to , and also gives opportunity for all sorts of pretty reflections and glancing lights without usurping the room we may happen to want for our favorite picture or print . The wood-work in No. 2 would look best in mahogany , or in some hard wood stained black ; but of course this depends on the general tone of the room . Hardly anything in the modern parlor is so uninteresting as the mantel-piece . It is such a trouble to most people to think what to put on it , that they end by accepting blindly the dictation of friends and tradesmen and making the customary sacrifice to Mammon of the clock-and-candelabra suite . I remember a rich lady who had so much money she never could devise ways enough of spending it , and who one day introduced us to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made , in the very latest style , and costing all that even the most fashionable votary could require . The handsome owner stood before her purchase , and good-naturedly excused herself by declaring that she had been so badgered by her friends , who , one and all , to the self-same tune and words , had declared that she must have a set of mantel-piece ornaments . " I did n't want em ; never did care for such things , and do n't like em now I have em ; but I 've done my duty , and shall have a little peace from my friends . " Now this was a person who had a strong , clear mind of her own on most subjects , who was abundantly able , out of her own pursuits and resources , to have made her house delightful by simply allowing it to reflect her own accomplished individuality , and there was much about the house which did reflect her own tastes and studies , and gave a peculiar charm to certain corners , but this was overcrowed by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the total result was mere tameness and matter-of-fact . The mantel ornaments were the key to the whole . A clock finds itself naturally at home on a mantel-piece , but it is a pity to give up so much space in what ought to be the central opportunity of the room to anything that is not worth looking at for itself apart from its merely utilitarian uses . It is very seldom worth while to look at a clock to know what time it is , and , as a rule , it would be much better to keep clocks out of our dining-room , though , for that matter , it is hard to say where they are not an impertinence . In the dining-room they are a constant rebuke to the people who come down late to breakfast , and they give their moral support to the priggishness of the punctual people , while they have , no doubt , to reproach themselves for a good share in the one bad American habit of eating on time . In a drawing-room a clock plays a still more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell visitors when to go away , a piece of information the well-bred man is in no need of , and which the ill-bred man never heeds . So that , if a clock must usurp the place of honor on a mantel-piece , it ought to have so good a form , or serve as the pedestal to such a bit of bronze , or such a vase , as to make us forget the burden of time-and-tide in the occasional contemplation of art eternities . We get this habit of clocks , with their flanking candlesticks or vases on all our mantel-pieces , , from the French , who have no other way , from the palace to the bourgeois parlor . But they get rid of the main difficulty , by either making sure that the clock does not keep good time ,  --  the best French clock being delightfully irresponsible in this particular ,  --  or by having clocks without any insides to them , a comfortably common thing , as every one used to Paris " flats " knows . Ever since Sam Slick 's day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheap clocks abound . If we were a legend-making people , we should have our Henry IV. , who would have said he wished every peasant might have a clock on his mantel-piece . No. io . HOW FAR THAT LITTLE CANDLE THROVS HIS BEAMS ! " // But , though we have cheap clocks enough , we have no pretty ones , and we are therefore thrown hack on those of French make , which are only to be endured when they are mere blocks of the marble they polish so finely , of which we can make a pedestal to support something we like to look at . It is to be hoped it will not be thought trivial to suggest that the mantel-piece ought to second the intention of the fire-place as the center of the family life  --  the spiritual and intellectual center , as the table is the material center . There ought , then , to be gathered on the shelf , or shelves , over the fire-place , a few beautiful and chosen things  --  the most beautiful that the family purse can afford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should cost much , the main point being that they should be things to lift us up , to feed thought and feeling , things we are willing to live with , to have our children grow up with , and that we never can become tired of , because they belong alike to nature and to humanity . Of course , if one were the happy owner of a beautiful painting  --  but that is so rare a piece of good fortune we need hardly stop to consider it  --  the problem would be easily solved , but we are happy in knowing that in these days there can always be procured , at trifling expense , some copy of a noble picture  --  the Sistine Madonna of Raphael , the Madonna of the Meyer Family , by Holhein , or some one of the lesser , yet still glorious , gifts of Heaven to man . There are photographs taken now in large size from the originals of all the famous pictures ( the Sistine Madonna has just been so taken ) , and they are , both for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these pictures , no matter by what master . There is a certain parlor where , in long years , some of the best and bravest spirits of our time have found loyal welcome and equal companionship , and whose walls are covered with such pictures and engravings as naturally find a place in such a home ; but all these give place in memory to a large photograph of the Madonna of the Grand Duke , which hangs over the fire-place , and which is certainly better to have than any copy . There are German lithographs of the Sistine Madonna , and of the Meyer Family , which , to my thinking , are much more desirable than even Steinla 's engravings of the two great masterpieces , although , as engravings , Steinla 's seem to me far the best that have been made . All this , by the way . It is impossible to choose for another , and it is fortunate there is so wide a field from which to select . All is , to choose something for the living-room No .

However , they can always be ordered from London , Paris , or Berlin ,  - -  the expense of even the very best casts of the good things is but small , the main obstacle is the trouble  --  and there is hardly anything that better rewards trouble than a fine cast of a really noble or lovely piece of sculpture .

And here , too , must be the real candlesticks , with real candles to be lighted at twilight , before the hour for the lamps , in the hour of illusion and of pensive thought , casting a soft , wavering gleam over the down-looking picture and the mysterious cast , and bringing a few moments of poetry to close the weary working-day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways of grouping simple objects in a picturesque and yet natural way , so as to get something out of them besides their individual elegance or interestingness .

In arranging these objects , the artist 's intention was to show how a dark corner may be lighted up , and , perhaps , also how things , which , beautiful or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value by isolation , and are also sometimes in the way , and apt to find themselves thrust into closets and corners , may be made pleasing to their owner and just to themselves . Everybody must have noticed how corners seem to be , in nine cases out of ten , mistakes ; how seldom it is that any good is got out of them . There is , to be sure , the cornercupboard , a delightful invention , of which the reader will find pretty examples in future articles of this series ; but they are more at home in the dining-room ,  --  for no reason , to be sure , except a traditional one . Corners , however , are fond of a bust occasionally , and , as things go , this may be allowed the best thing to do with a bust , seeing how small our rooms are apt to be , and how difficult of solution the pedestal question is . The corner chosen , too , is to be a matter of consideration ; one of those on either side the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shade being the most telling there . Our way of muffling up our windows with heavy upholstery stuffs , however , makes these corners almost useless for any such delicate light as is needed for the refinement of sculpture . Meantime , much pleasure for the eyes can be procured by putting together some such group as this , composed of a few rich-looking ( in this case inexpensive ) things , with subdued color , as in the porcelain vase on the edge of the table , and in the one that holds the flowers , with sober , rich reflection all through the trophy , brought to a ripe accord in the gleaming mirror . There is hardly anything this time of ours enjoys less , less knows how to value , than a clear space of blank wall . Yet there are few things so pleasant to the eye , provided the wall is of a good tone and has a surface that absorbs the light , or at least does not reflect it . The early Italians , painters and builders alike , understood this , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such breadths of breadth so well , that he could sometimes hardly make up his mind to put a fold or a wrinkle into the cloaks // and mantles of his personages . But all the great men knew the secret , Titian best of all ; and this delight in broad stretches of blank wall , broken only , and that rarely , by the shadow of a projecting corbel , or of the wrought-iron support of a lantern , or by the sparse leaves and knotted , straggling branch of a creeping vine , is one of the most encouraging elements in the art of the new school of Italian-Spanish painters . We must try and get something of the feeling in our house-furnishing , trust more to simplicity and unity ; give the eye some repose , and put the little bits of pictures and the knickknacks away in closets and drawers and portfolios , to be looked at only when we have nothing better to do . Cut No. * does not call for much remark . The table is one that Cottier and Co. made recently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made some time ago , and which seems to me perfect of its kind , both for the elegance of its lines and its comfortableness as a seat . This chair must not be confounded with other chairs of the same general shape , but which , as a rule , are as different from it as a cabbage is from a rose . They are almost always too large ; that is their main fault ; and their curves are abrupt , and the proportions not well kept . This chair is small , but amply large enough for a comfortable man , and nothing could be better managed than the flow of its lines . The original chair is covered with a material of a golden yellow color , damasked over with a floriated pattern , and round the bottom is a silk fringe of the same color , with some red introduced into it . It is so pretty to look at , that one forgets to sit down in it ; but this is not to imply that it is too good to use . The stuff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking as if it were made of silk and linen ; but , in reality , the seeming silk is jute , I believe . However , the form is the principal thing , and such a chair , covered with a good chintz , might be as pretty a creature as she is in her golden gown . Next to making simplicity charming , the Cottiers have done us the greatest service , in showing us how to unite usefulness and beauty . All that they manufacture is made for every-day use , and will stand service . If they are not as much sought after as they should be , it is because they do not know how to minister to the popular desire to make a great splurge on a very little money . It is amusing to hear that when they recommend their things as thoroughly well made *nd good for a lifetime , the modish people cry out , " Oh , we do n't want things to last a life-time ! " " What is life ? " says one beauty , as she glances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What is life without new furniture ? " But the number of people increases who like sincerity even in chairs and tables . The table in cut No. * is a good design for a center-table ; it is as light and easily moved as it looks , and of generous size , without being clumsy . And here it occurs to me to meet an objection that has been made to these designs I offer  --  the objection , namely , that , though often very pretty and attractive in themselves , they are of no practical use , because they are not procurable by the general public ; or , if procurable , are too expensive or difficult to find . Now , this objection is valid enough , but it does not touch me , since my main object in writing these papers is not to dogmatize , nor to give definite rules for doing this or that , nor to give people precise patterns to follow . On the contrary , it has been urged from the beginning that people should follow their own taste , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and attractive in their own way . If everybody 's rooms are to be furnished like C 's , how is that better than when they were all furnished like B 's ? There is always a first sheep to leap a fence or run down a side street , and all the sheep follow their leader till a new one tries a new start . I write in the hope that people are not all sheep , and that enough will be found to look at the principle taught , and to try and put it into practice in their own way . This is all 1 am after , and these cuts are meant to indicate my general taste in furnishing a home , and what seems to me likely to be pleasing to many people besides myself . As for getting these things , or things like them , there is n't any real difficulty . We have shops like Sypher 's , where in the course of a year more good things appear and disappear than any one house of ordinary size could find room for , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well made , they can not be called dear . They would not be called dear in most cases if they were new , and careful use improves almost all furniture . Every artist or artistic person would rather have a well-kept piece of old furniture than any new piece . But if old things are not wanted , have new ones made ; and if the Cottiers or Herters can not suit you , do as I have found it profitable to dogo to an architect , to Mr. John F. Miller , or Mr. Babb , or Mr. Sandier , or to anyone // 355 of the company of cultivated , thoughtful young men who are doing so much to honor architecture among us , and tell him what you want , and have him draw you a design . Then with your working- drawings go to the best house-carpenter you can find-if you want the best there is , or can be , find Mr. Matthias J. Miller , No. 126 Amity streetand ask him to carry out the design strictly , in good material , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than met . There is a pleasure in getting things this way that there is not and can not be in going into shops and buying them . We get attached to our surroundings ; we know their history and their character , and feel that we can depend on them . Mr. John F. Miller , who is too well-known for me to praise him , is one of the best-trained architects we have , and one of the most refined men in his taste , though he is , perhaps , more devoted to the Gothic than is likely to bring him favor in these days . He has designed many pieces of furniture for me , and his brother , Mr. Matt . Miller , has made them , and better work than Matt . Miller 's was never done anywhere in any time that I know any thing about . The secret of his good workmanship is , not as he thinks , if he modestly thinks about it , that he went through the painful drill of apprenticeship , nor that he had a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the solid school of Leopold Eidlitz and his brother John , but that he loves his trade , believes in it , and puts all his mind , and heart , and character into it . The wood of which my furniture is made has been chosen by him with as much knowledge and care as Van Eyck would have used in selecting a panel for a picture , and , like the Deacon 's one-horse shay , it will last till it can last no more , and then must all go to powder at once , for one piece is as perfect as another . The construction is as admirable as the material , and in it one may see the carpentry of the times of our great grandfathers brought back , for here are no make-shifts , no nails , nor glue-except where Saint Joseph himself would have ordered it ; but the whole is held together by science and by conscience . If it might be , I would send some of his work to the Centennial-not , of course , for any brag , for what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ praise him , and to show what work has been done by one American carpenter , taught and trained at home . Of course , if we would give our carpenters more such work to do , there would be more Matthias Millers than there are . It would be greatly to our advantage to do so , and a good thing if we could learn to do without much of the sort of furniture made by so-called cabinet-makers . Matthias Miller tells me that he remembers when there was no such trade in New York as " cabinet-making ; " when plain house-carpenters like himself made all the furniture that was made , and it was better designed and better made than the most of what is made even at expensive establishments in New York to-day . The trade of carpentry , however , is in such a state in this country to-day , that no carpenter I know can be trusted to design a piece of furniture , even of a very simple kind . But the expense of getting designs from an architect is comparatively small , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having it well carried out , is great enough to make it worth the trouble and expense . Cuts Nos. 6 and 7 are a little premature in this article . They are intended to go , No 6 with what is to be said about curtains and hangings , and No. 7 with some chat about screens , in the next article . They are both of them incidents in a story of real life which might be good to tell , if I were in for a serial tale . I dare say the reader will enjoy looking at Mr. Lathrop 's little pictures quite as much as he would , if he knew more about this quaint Crusoeish hut and its occupants . He can , at all events , see that it looks a comfortable place , though not painfully proper and conventional . He shall learn more about it , if we can get permission , in the next article for this series . Meanwhile , if he should be led by it , to think it a good notion to divide a large room up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permanent partitions , the little picture will be doing a part of its duty . To many people a large room is a great pleasure . Indeed , I think , most people like to have plenty of space in which to move about , but as we all like privacy sometimes , and seclusion from the doings of others , if for no other end than to have the temptation to talk and to look about us removed , it is good to have easy ways of attaining our object . The long , narrow parlors that are such an affliction to New Yc1*. housekeepers are much more elegantly divided by screens , which may be made as rich or as plain as we choose , or by curtains , than by the ordinary partition and sliding-door . For comfort and for coziness they often need to be divided , and // yet they often need also , when company comes , to be left free from end to end . But , more of this by and by . The window and curtain in cut No. 6 are at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In our formal way of hanging curtains from a so-called cornice , we lose the freedom and artistic movement of a piece of stuff such as this curtain is made of ; it becomes a mere piece of machinery , and calls the dumb-waiter brother , and the furnace-register sister . But , hung by rings and hooks to a brass rod , and moved back and forth at pleasure , it becomes another creature , and is second cousin at least to the pictures and casts . From being a pesky , troublesome , dust-collecting member of the family , it is now a docile , cheerful , neat-handed minister of sunlight and cool shade , no trouble to anybody , and only pleasant to live with . Cuts Nos. 8 and 9 are 6tag*res , both of Chinese make ; one of them , No. 8 , has a cupboard beneath it , and both of them are lifted from the floor by stands which are movable at pleasure . Both are handsome pieces ; but No. 8 is of a more useful kind than No. 9 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the parlor ; certainly it would be found very useful in a room where there are tea-things , especially if they were pretty ones , to put under lock-andkey . No. 8 is of the black wood the Chinese so much affect , and which they carve and polish so skillfully . No. 9 is of a wood resembling mahogany , but without the magic translucent lights that make mahogany so noble a member of the wood family . Giorgione 's and Titian 's women , with their red-gold hair , may have been , after all , only the Hamadryads of the mahogany-tree , seen by the painters in xision . This Chinese wood is , however , less rich than mahogany ; but it is handsome , and makes a good contrast to the darker piece . Both these shelves were bought at Sypher 's , and were of moderate price ; nor is there anything so rare about them as to make it impossible to meet their mates some day . But many of our readers will , we are sure , see how superior they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The object on the top of No. 9 is a jade dish supported on a stand of carved oak , and over the shelves there hangs on the wall , a sconce of beaten brass for three candles , specimens of which are always to be seen at Cottier 's and Tiffany 's , and there are often excellent ones to be found at the rooms of the " Household Art Company , " in Boston . No. io is a jolly bit of old iron-work , a double candlestick picked up at a Christmas booth in Paris streets , and since , for many a day , found a most useftil table companion to one who always works at night by candle-light . It lifts easily by the strong projecting handle , and is not to be upset . I had promised myself , too , the amusement of a tilt against pianos as we make them in this the present year of grace " bow-legged megatheriums , " as somebody has hit them off , the ugliest pieces of furniture which we of this generation , fertile in ugliness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pianos were prettier than any that have been made since , but they were too spindle-legged for real beauty , and owed too much to the color of the wood they were made of , with its pretty inlayings and marquetry , and painted panels above the key-board-too little to the excellence of their form . A handsome piano , one that an artist could enjoy the sight of , does not exist to-day out of museums , nor is made by any one of the legion of manufacturers . But a piano , even a " square** or a " grand , " might be made a stately ornament to our drawing-rooms , and even the " uprights , " which try to be as ugly as their fourfooted and hooved brethren , but can not wholly succeed , might be made much better than they are , in artistic hands . I wish some one would try the experiment of a plain case , were it even of pine , and let it be decorated with color simply , after the fashion of the clavichord in cut No. ii @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lid has a pastoral landscape with figures painted on the inside . There has been for some time at Goupil 's a water-color by one of the new men , Rossi , in which a lady is seated at a piano , in the style of Louis XIV. , very ornate with flourishing carving and gilding not exactly to be recommended , but having the inside of the lid delightfully painted with a dance of Cupids , or some sacred mystery of that sort . Why ca n't some of our young artists plot and plan to induce some one of the young piano-makers with his fortune to make , to combine with some clever designer , and devise a case for them to paint ? The result might be delightful , and even if the first go-off were not wholly successful , it would show the way . It would be goodto see a herd of the present heavyfooted antediluvians that stretch their huge bulks about our drawing-rooms , turned out of their luxurious quarters and sent lumbering down the avenue , yielding place to // 357 something that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is now , the loveliest woman that sits down to play at a modern piano is a little dimmed ; the mstrLiment , instead of setting off her beauty , seems to do its best to disparage it . No. ii . was drawn on the block by Mr. Lathrop , from an etching that appeared in the " Zeitschrift fur Bildende Kunst " ( vol. vn. , p. 8 , 1872 ) . The etching is by W. Unger , after a picture by Gonzales Coques , which is in the Gallery at Cassel . It is called " Em junger Gelehrter mit seiner Frau im Zimmer . " The etching is one of Unger 's best , but Mr. Henry Marsh 's woodcut from Mr. Lathrop 's reduction , is no less a masterpiece in its way . I bad it done mainly for the clavichord , but it will be of much use to us with relation to other matters .
