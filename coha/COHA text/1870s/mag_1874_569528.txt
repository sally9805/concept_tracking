ARTICLE 111-THE EMOTIONS IN MUSIC . WRITERS upon psychology have hitherto somewhat neglected the subject of emotion . The problem of knowledge has occupied their attention , almost to the exclusion of the problem of feeling . How we know , is a more important inquiry than how we feel ; and hence far more has been written upon the human intellect than upon the sensibilities or even the will . Probably , too , far more has been written upon what might be called abstract psychology-upon the laws of thought , as these laws must rule the mental operations of all intelligent beings-than upon what we may call concrete psychology  --  or the science of mind as known to us , dwelling in and manifested by a bodily organisrn . The former might be a very good mental science for disembodied spirits , but the latter only could be of any practical use to us in the present stage of our existence . The science of the human mind , it is evident , must be intimately connected with the science of the human brain , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and has the power of action . There is , indeed , a growing tendency , among thinkers and writers on these subjects , to study the mind and the body in connection , but they generally fall into one or the other of two opposite dangers . One class of thinkers , absorbed with the fact that the mind works through the brain and nerves , forget the part played by the corporeal organism , and ignore the fact that , as different tools do different work , and different instrurnents produce different music , though employed by the same hand , so the instrument of thought or of the expression of thought must necessarily modify , in some way , the operations of the mind inhabiting and using it . Some of them even go so far as to claim , explicitly or implicitly , that the most plainly corporeal desires and feelings , such as hunger and thirst , or the desire of sleep , or physical fear , or the shudder of disgust , pertain to the immortal spirit of man . On the other hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reducing all to material . ism , making thought and feeling to be functions or secretions of the brain , and eliminating the immortal part altogether . // It is not the purpose of the present Article , however , to attempt to mediate between these two ways of viewing the phenomena of intelligence and feeling , or to try to decide precisely at what point matter ceases and mind begins , or vice versa . The former will accomplish itself . Materialism can not continue to satisfy the human mind , for it ignores a most important class of phenomena , and hence is an incomplete philosophy , therefore no philosophy at all . And a psychology , which is applicable to disembodied spirits alone , which ignores the body and the brain , can not thrive in this age , so full of material science , so noted for progress in physiology . " Psychology , " says Pres. Porter , " is usually limited to the science of the human soul , in its connection with the human body . " There can be no doubt that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their mutual relations investigated . But to lay down the exact limits between the influence of each would seem to be a problem too difficult for human powers , and of little or no value in itself but perhaps one that will be incidentally approached , and by successive approximations . Perhaps the time will come when the philosophy of emotion will be revised , and more fully developed , and it will then probably be found that the physical system has far more to do with the emotions than with the intellectual powers . It is certainly far easier to conceive that a pure spirit , without the bodily machinery of expression , can think , reflect , and imagine , than that such a spirit could feel , without the corporeal means of impression . Perception may be an instantaneous act of the mind acting through the senses , and then the deductive powers may be busy in the matter for a long time , until some result is reached , whereupon the physical machinery must again be called upon to assist in its expression . It may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the revival of the old distinction between the soul and the spirit . According to this ancient and profound distinction , the soul ( irovx*i ) , the necessary counterpart of the body and intimately if not inseparably connected with it , contains the principle of animal life , and is the seat of sense , feeling , and emotion ; while the spirit ( irv8v/*a ) , independent in existence , lofty in its attributes , using the body as instrumental and subordinate , is the // seat of intellectual perception , reflection , intuition , and moral will or choice . Dr. Brown-S6quard has recently , in a course of lectures in Boston , defended the theory , " that there are two sets , or a double set , of mental powers in the human organism , or acting through the human organism , essentially different from each other . The one may be designated as ordinary conscious intelligence ; " that is , he probably means , the power of sense-perception , emotion , etc. : " the other a superior power * * * which solves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep , our problems and perplexities*** acting through us , without conscious action of our own . " Proi* Agassiz , in quoting this theory , in the words given above , adds the suggestion , if we understand him rightly , that the former class of mental powers do not differ in kind from those of the lower animals . Doubtless these distinguished lecturers had in mind some such distinction as the ancient and scriptural one between soul and spirit . President Porter , in his work , The human Intellect , says : " The term soul originally signified the principle of life or motion in a material organism . * * * Traces of this signification may be distinctly discovered in the three-fold division of man into body , soul , and spirit , in which the soul occupies the place between the corporeal or material part , and the spiritual or noetic. * * * When the soul wa* limited to man , and si* nified the human soul , it came to designate by eminence those endowments by which man is distinguished from the animals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has in common with them . " There is a debatable land between the soul and the body , by whatever name it may be called . And whether we call it the animal soul or the corporeal spirit , or if we divide it up between the mind and the brain , attributing some things to the activity of the one and some to that of the other , it will be found that it is to this debatable region that the emotions for the most part belong . And if the brain and the mind were each to claim its own , those emotions which are excited through the senses , by means of music for instance , would fall to the share of the physical organism . It is universally admitted that the emotions , usually called by that name , such as love , anger , hatred , are complex , com // prising much which is simply intellectual , and in no way einotional . Thus the perception of the loveliness or desirableness of the *object loved , the selfish desire to enjoy or possess it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all these are commonly joined together with what is properly called emotion , and the whole complex state of the mind is termed love . When the intellectual element has been eliminated , what remains may truly be called emotion , but in this emotion itself there must be distinguished two elements , one excited by the senses , by the sight or hearing of the object loved , a physical emotion , and the other aroused by the intellectual perception of excellence of character , or congeniality of tastes , or other lovable qualities . There is a valid distinction between sense-perception and intellectual perception , or thought . By the first I may see a man ; by the other I may perceive some abstract relation in which he stands ,  --  as , he is responsible for his actions , or , he is a member of the Church . In like manner , emotions may be divided into sense-emotions and intellectual emotions . A man who sees a stone falling down upon his head is filled with fear , perhaps utterly paralyzed by it . But this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing to do with it , as is shown by the fact that a brute is affected in the same way . One who hears of an act of injustice or cruelty is filled with indignation , but with this feeling the physical organism has nothing to do ; it is purely intellectual . Using here the beautiful distinction between soul and spirit , we may say that each of the senses fills a donble office ; in one it is the servant of the spirit , in the other it is a direct avenue to the soul , a means by which the latter is subjected to emotional exltement . The spirit can not come into direct contact with matter , but must have its royal messengers , its servants , whose reports are expressed in language , and being passed upon by the judgment , may be accepted or rejected . But the soul is open to direct impression , and has no choice but to be excited by that emotion whose appropriate cause is placed berore the senses . According to the ordinary usage of language , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by the sight of beauty , or by sublimity . But if there is any truth in the above suggestions , it would be more in accordance with the true philosophy of // the subject to speak of the emotion of the ear , and that of the eye , or , of the auricular emotion and the ocular emotion . Music has a powerful influence upon the mind , so powerful that perhaps those who are susceptible to its power are incapable of analyzing it , just as an angry man is prevented by the heat of his passion from observing the phenonena of his anger , so as to describe them afterwards . But perhaps something may be found out by inquiring what experience any one susceptible to emotion of music passes through on being subjected to its influence . Its plaintive melodies and minor chords seem to fill his very soul with the deepest melancholy . Despair and despondency settle down upon his mind . A flood of sadness seems to enter at every avenue of his soul . His head droops , and the tears gather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his efforts . But let the air or the harmonies change , let a quick movement begin , let rich chords and stirring combinations of instruments be introduced , and his sadness and despair vanish as quickly as they came , and a singular exaltation succeeds . The susceptible hearer seems to feel the music permeating every tissue of his brain . His eyes flash , his head rises and sways to and fro , keeping time with the music . It is not joy , not delight ; it is ecstacy . Now these are evidently the two opposite poles of the same emotion . One is depression of the nerves , the other is exaltation ; and the rapidity and certainty of the change from one to the other show , even if consciousness did not give the same verdict , that it is not the immortal spirit which is excited to joy , fear , sorrow , courage , or despair , but that these feelings are due to the depression or exaltation of the brain and nervous system through the ear , by means of music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that it is the soul , the principle of animal life , which is affected by music , and not the spirit . It is also important to notice in this connection the fact that the partitions between these different forms of musical emotion are extremely thin ; how thin , is best known by those who feel them most vividly . At the Boston Peace Jubilee , when the immense orchestra and vast chorus burst suddenly into the triumphant notes of Luther 's grand choral hymn , a man seated in a prominent position in the gallery was observed to break into an uncontrollable agony of tears . Many // persons have experienced the same feeling , if they have not so yielded to it . An accomplished musician of our acquaintance was once challenged by a distinguished theological professor to make him weep , by the power of music . He soon brought tears to the professor 's eyes by a performance upon the piano , which consisted , in reality , of Yankee Doodle in slow time* Beyond this mere impression upon the nerves , most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not from the music itself . The liveliest national air is solemn enough to the exile . The plaintive wailing of the bag-pipes excites the Scot to a martial ardor and courage . Yankee Doodle , though a British burlesque , excites rio anger , and , though an utterly trivial air , excites no contempt , in any American bosom ; but long association has made it stirring and patriotic . " America , " originally a Jacobite tune , excites our patriotic ardor now , quite as well as though it had not been composed to honor the exiled tyrant James . The Marseillaise hymn means nothing to us ; to the Frenchman it is a frenzied excitement . These facts show that the principle of association must be carefully eliminated , if we would rightly understand musical emotion . Another indication that there is but one emotion of music , is found in the fact that all who are susceptible to music at all are affected by it in the same way , allowance being made for whatever is the result of association . All are here on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degree . The person of finely attuned and delicate ear and thorough musical culturc is moved to tears or rapture , while the one of less subtle and delicate auricular mechanism , or less culture , is simply deeply moved . His spirits rise or fall as the character of the music changes ; the same strange depressions the same divine-seeming exaltation , the same exquisite pleasure , are felt by both persons . If one feels music at all , it must be in the same way , with difference only in degree , according to nature or education . Moreover , those whose susceptibility has been improved by education , are conscious that their experiences in hearing music are the same in kind as when their perceptions were childish or uneducated . They have gained in the power , but more especially in the definiteness of the impressions which music makes upon them . If it be true that music excites in the mind different // emotions and different combinations of them , surely the infinite varieties of temperament and intellect ought to render the effects various beyond all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one man to anger and another to grief , according to the nature of his mind , or his momentary previous feeling . But if there is only one emotion of music , it - would exist in various degrees of force , delicacy , and cultivation , but the same in kind in all ,  --  which we find in fact to be the case . And , if this is the true theory , we should expect to find some persons deprived altogether of this emotion , through some physical defect , or some missing link in the mysterious chain which binds body and soul together . And this too is actually the case . Many persons " have no ear for music . ' It is hard to believe that such persons are created with all the emotions of their fellow men , but deprived of susceptibility to that mode of exciting them which is at once the most powerful , pleasureable , and beautiful . There may be some who never love , some who never hate , some who are not revengeful , but none are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some capability of being excited by external causes . Far simpler and more analogous with other phenomena is the supposition that the emotions which depend upon the senses form a class by themselves , and while each sense has its own peculiar emotion , one or more may be defective in its physical or psychical machinery , so that one man may listen unmoved to the most exquisite harmonies , and another may take in with his eye all the beauties and sublimities of earthly scenery with knowing it . There are some interesting facts connected with the execution and composition of music which are in point here . The wonderful mechanical mastery displayed by some performers over their instruments , comes within the province of that cnnous principle of the co&amp;rdination of motions , which is one of the most remarkable discoveries of modern physiology . For example , when a man walks , there come into play a large number of independent muscles . But the man does not will the alternate fiexion and contraction of each of these muscles ; he wills to walk , and this volition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muscle . This peculiar power , // called the codrdination of motions , is said by physiologists to reside in a particular part of the brain , the cerebellum , and it lies at the basis of all improvement in mechanical skill of every kind . Of course , this same cerebellum presides over the mechanical part , the execution , in short the art of music . Without this no amount of practice would give skill , no brilliancy of talents could avail to produce anything more than the rudest music . The immortal part of man , then , seems to have nothing to do with the execution of music , as such . The composition of music suggests a similar conclusion , though leading us into a higher region . For music as a science is strictly mathematical , that is , mechanical . Its precise division of time and its profound calculation of harmonies employ high mathematical talents . Precision in the performance and pleasure in the hearing , as well as facility and success in the composition of the higher class of music , depend upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often been men of the most splendid talents , nor can we doubt that in the composition of their sublimer works their vast talents have found the fullest scope . The world is fall of mysteries . The most common and simple operations of nature display forces beyond the ken of human science . Equally incomprehensible is the link which connects the soul with the body which it inhabits . It is impossible to explain how the will has power over the bodily organism , and in like manner we can never expect to understand how it is that certain sounds or sights fill the soul with emotion , without regard to association or expectation . In the case of spoken and written language we instinctively feel that its arbitrary signs are interpreted only by the intellect , the personal reason , and that whatever emotional or passional excitement arises thence is a very different thing from the emotions excited through the senses , and results from , if indeed it does not consist in , a deep and absorbing perception of the relations , causes and consequences of the facts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Far otherwise is it in the case of music . No operations of the reasoning powers intervene , no arbitrary signs require interpretation , no volition and no imagination has anything to do with its effect . Through // the air and the physical system it reaches at once the seat of passion and feeling . No induction , no deduction , no reasoning , no conception , has anything to do with it . Music , subjectively considered , is purely sensuous . Plato says that " harmony , melody , and rhythm , combined in music , flow from a corresponding state of the mind , and hence music tends to reproduce this state . " This harmony of mind , this music of the spirit , is the end and ideal of Plato 's philosophy ,  --  as , indeed , is it not also of Christianity ? And so , according to Plato , the perception of harmony and relation of sounds must fit the soul for perceiving the higher harmonies of the spiritual world , and excite its desire for them , thus elevating and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resemblance to that ecstasy or intoxication which we call the excitemcnt of the emotion of music . Yet it need not be demanded that in music , or in anything else , all pleasures of the senses should be despised and denied , and the highest speculative uses should be alone pursued . Pleasure is a good thing . The highest good is not stoical indifference . But let men understand that pleasure , even in the refined and elevated form of music , does not involve the exercise of the highest faculties , that emotion of this kind is not the noblest power with which we are endowed . This pleasure of the senses should be considered as recreation , and is not worthy to be pursued as an end in life . For it is a fact conveying a useful lesson , and also confirmatory of our theory , that there are some who are consumed by what might be called the lust of the ear , corresponding to the lust of the eye which the Apostle Paul condemned . There are some who seem almost to live for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They know nothing of the spiritual uses found by Plato in music , for indeed Platonic souls are rare . They care nothing for the tender or lofty associations connected with the strains they worship ,  --  they live for the titilation of the ear , as epicures for the pleasures of taste . They are music-mad . Music is to them both religion and culture , home , friends , and country . And while love and patriotism and duty and all higher seutiments are thus swallowed up in one absorbing pursuit and passion , they often contrive to believe // that their course is the very one which raises them up to a spiritual elevation far above other men . Moreover , it is fashionable to imitate their raptures , and there is a cant in this worship , as in all others . One of these imitators , who had really but slight knowledge or taste in music , once said in our hearing , j ust after listening to a symphony of Beethoven : " Such music a that lifts me right up above this world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and purifies and benefits me more than a thousand of your Calvinistic sermons about everlasting punishment . " He was doubtless correct in supposing that his mind was not in a fit state to understand Calvinism or any other system of theology . And doubtless , too , he was guilty both of cant and bigotry . Plato utters another important fact when he says that even a strong and vigorous mind becomes enervated , stupified , and weakened by exclusive cultivation in this direction . And how emphatically is this true now , when the new , modern art of music has been carried to so great perfection . The fact is , no one power of the human constitution can be exercised beyond measure without causing a deformity . Over indulgence of the imagination weakens the judgment . Perception being unduly cultivated , the exercise of the speculative reason becomes irksome and difficult . The astronomer s acuteness of eye is not likely to co-exist with the musician 's accuracy of ear . The susceptibilities are not safe without the intellect . The man who lives in a world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not rise to any height of moral grandeur , will not meet boldly a great crisis in his fate , or resist nobly and successfully when assailed by temptation . While we admit that music has important intellectual and spiritual uses , we ought not to forget that its undue cultivation , as art , or science , or emotion , is unfavorable alike to intellect and to morals . But we need not on this account banish and condemn music , because others abuse or worship it . No ! delightful music , companion of solitude , alleviation of sorrow , which gives expression to our joys , accompanies and assists our worship , shall be our recreation and a worthy attendant upon our festivities and religious services , but not itself worship , nor an object of worship . // The application of the above theory of the nature of music to its use in religions services is almost too obvious to be mentioned here . If music is entirely sensuous , its performance can not be an act of worship . When we assemble in the house of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serve to turn our minds away from every-day pursuits by soothing our weary brains with their sweetness . But let not the lascivious strains of the opera recall the most trivial pursuits at the most sacred hour , nor let the marvels of difficult execution and the display of perfect training excite astonishment and vulgar curiosity where only reverence or gratitude or contrition have any proper place . This is profanation of the house of God . Let music , too , enliven our social gatherings , but let it not be cultivated by those who care not for it , for mere purposes of display . This is profanation of a noble art , by vanity and foolish ambition .
