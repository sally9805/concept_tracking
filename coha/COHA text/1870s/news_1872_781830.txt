txt When a body of men dub themselves " Reformers , " and ask the people to believe that their political ascendency is all that as needed to bring about an era of purity and efficiency in every branch of the public service , their pretensions naturally invite ' the most searching scrutiny , alike into their past record and into the methods - which they employ to carry their " principles " to a successful issue . Men whose entire political capital consists in their claims to act from higher and purer motives than their neighbors , ought to be above reproach . In a political canvass we expect to see them guided by the most scrupulous regard for truth and honesty , else bow are we to expect a display of such qualities from them when they are intrusted with the affairs of the nation . lf , in seeking for success . they say one thing and mean another , if their associations belie their professions , and if , while secretly detesting or distrusting the candidates under whose banner they fight , they yet continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they need hardly complain if the unsophisticated common-sense of the nation should rate their ' cause " as a mere pretense , and themselves as arrant humbugs . Yet this is precisely what men like Senator Scutum and the " Reformers " who support Mr. GRERLRY have been lately doing . They did not seek to conceal their deep disappointment and chagrin at the Cincinnati nominations . They were " humiliated , " " bowed down , " and a great many other things , too well known to need . recapitulation . So lately as Thursday last these same " Reformers " indulged in some very hard . speaking at the expense of the Tammany candidate . According to the Evening Pod , a competent authority on this matter , the speakers at the " Conference " of Thursday " were unanimous in the expression of their dislike of Mr. GREELEY , we might almost say their loathing of him . " Further , says the Peat of yesterday : " Of these Democrats who were the advocates of the Greeley nomination . not one of them . it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than those of the most marked contempt , almost of loathing . for that much they evidently . felt was due to their own self-respect and sense of decency . " For a crusade in favor of party and administrative reform , this is rather a peculiar beginning . HORACE GREELEY , say the " Reformers . " is everything that we do n't want and represents everything that we abhor , but , for certain personal ends of cur own , we desire to make him President . A position hke this involves a deliberate insult to the popular understanding . which the people are very likely to resent . A pretty set of men are these to give us a reign of political purity , whose very first act is to indorse one of the most corrupt and shameless political bargains that the record of any party can show ! It affords a truly encouraging prospect for civil service reform and administrative purity generally , to find some of their noisiest advocates engaged in the attempt to prove that , though honest convictions may be very desirable things up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they must give way to the . superior considerations of self-mterest . It is possible to accord a certain amount , of respect to the position of the little band . of uncompromising bolters who have tendered a Presidential nomination to Mr. GROESBECK . They at least have placed on record their opinion , that the service of Reform is quite incompatible with a sustained effort to act a lie . The men who have allowed FE/craw to lead them by the nose , can pointtono such display of manliness . " A sense of self-respect " prompts the one section of " Reformers " to abuse the Tammany candidate in private , while publicly inviting people to support him . The other and more reputable members of the malcontent Conference have given a moil ) intelligible evidence of the value they place upon their own self-respect , by repudiating the Fenton-GreeleyHainan alliance altogether . We need hardly say which side has the greater claim upon the respect of the public .                    @
