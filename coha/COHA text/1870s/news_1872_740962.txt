txt The Democratic Party has never cared much for the opinion of the country with reference to its morality . If it has developed an innate tendency to sordid views of public questions , and to the employment of suspicious methods , it has also shown a cynical frankness in justifying them . The party which originated both in theory and practice the remarkable rule , " To the victors belong the spoils , " will be acknowledged to have some hardihood in withstanding the aversion of the better class of the community . Yet it will require more fortitude than even Democracy has lately been called upon to exhibit , to bear np against the odium sure to be courted by the now apparently inevitable nomination of GREELEY at Baltimore . In every light in which the transaction can be regarded , it is disgraceful to both parties . To the Democrats it is especially so . They surrender everything that was creditable to them , and gain nothing but what they should be ashamed of . Whatever there was of honesty and sincerity in their purposes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adhering to Mr. GREELEY . They have been known from the days of JEFFERSON as opponents to centralization . He has been an ardent and extreme advocate of it . in every form it has taken before the American people . They have chanced to be , substantially , free-traders . He has been always a bitter protectionist . They have honored the men whom he has lampooned . They have enlisted the classes of voters whom be has most angrily assailed . All their sympathies have been his antipathies , all their hates his loves . How can they support him without abdicating selfrespect I It may be said that he is a convert to their views . If so . he can not be a sincere one . for every element in his experience and nature that may be supposed to influence his mental operations makes it impossible . And if he be an insincere convert , " crooking the pregnant hinges of the knee that thrift may follow fawning , " his conversion is as disgraceful to the newly-chosen political church that places him at its head as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impossible , and apostacy is the utmost he can achieve . The circumstances under which this mere apostacy is presented as a elaim to Democratic admiration , are in themselves as revolting to an honest man as the apostacy itself . It is the result of a disgraceful bargain between the most dishonored clique of politicians that ever ruined a party and the most conspicuous opponent of that party . Democrats are not merely asked to degrade themselves by following their most violent and bitter enemy , but they are asked to take him from the hands of TWEED and SWEENY . In the act of acceptance they condone the sins of Tammany. and restore it to its old footing . Mr. GREELEY 'S candidacy is an affair of the Ring . He is openly in their hands . They will allow him to go nowhere where they can not accompany or precede him . If he is nominated at Baltimore . the party in this State , at least , is turned over to the Tammany managers . If by any " Midsummer maduess , " he could be elected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Is it too much to declare that the task before the Democracy is one from which every Democrat with a lingering respect for the good opinion of his fellowcitizens must instinctively shrink ?
