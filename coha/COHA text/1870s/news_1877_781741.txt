txt Mortifying as has been the result , thus far , of Gen. HOWARD 'S Summer campaign , that officer at least ought not to be made the scapegoat for faults not his own . Jaded by his long jog after JOSEPH , HOWARD ventured the other day to hint that he would like help  --  a suggestion which seems to have brought from Gen. SHERMAN a retort . Yet thus far HOWARD 'S fellow department commanders have apparently looked with much composure upon his pitiable task of pursuit , and have not succeeded in affording him the slightest assistance . He wandered out of his own Department of Columbia into that of Gon . TERRI , and back again , without getting any aid . JOSEPH 'S band rode across the entire width of Idaho , from Oregon into Montana , giving , one would suppose , some Opportunity to head him off , and in fact , HOWARD telegraphed eastward the particulars of JOSEPH 'S trail . But so feeble and unskillful were the preparations made ahead to moot him , that JOSEPH , on coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trail , dodged one side through a mountain pass , and was gone . This was just before GIBBON 'S fight at Big Hole . Very likely the other department commanders had no animals or troops to spare ; at any rate , HOWARD got little help from them . . Since then , JOSEPH has taken the precaution to occasionally cut the wires , and news of him and of HOWARD comes rarely . The volunteers have been also of little use to HowARD 's column . Some of them have ridden to his camp , occasionally with great flourish , but have disappeared again whenever they could not have their own way , or did not like the prospect ahead . They seem to have been volunteers in the extreme sense of the word , limiting their extent of service to their own fancy , whether a day or a week or a fortnight . Finally , if we note the difference between the Indians and our forces in the matter of horses , we shall see one reason why the pursuit is so fruitless . Our cavalry is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Indians closely , the infantry and artillery being usually behind , and only catching up at a long halt . The Indians can safely halt in defensible positions , and defy attack from our advance ' mai the main forces are up , by which time they have had their rest and can push on . They never have anything in their front or on their flanks , and have only had their rear to guard . Still inure noticeable is the fact that the Indians , by raiding on the ranches of settlers , can supply themselves with fresh horses , while our forces having no privilege of either buying or stealing , have had to use the same mounts that they started with . JOSEPH got fresh horses for his band all around in Montana , and has plenty of change horses with him , to use in case of any giving out , or of his being pressed by our cavalry to greater speed . The animals used by our forces are the same wearied ones that they started with . We must say that , despite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it strange that , in a solitary and aided chase like his , the Indians . should have been able thus far to outride him .
