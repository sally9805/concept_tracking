txt The Tribune has for several weeks past been dragging the name of our journal into its vulgar puffs and advertisements , coupled with the statement that its circulation is 50,000 a day-greater than that of TUE TIMES and Wod combined . How far a man may be permitted to tell lies about the business of another man may be a nice point to decide ; at any rate , we allowed this particular falsehood to go on for some weeks , under a feeling of disinclination to enter into a controversy with a paper which may now safely be said to be dishonored before the public . We now , however , repeat what we stated on Thursday last-that when the Tribun3 touts for advertisements on the ground that it has a circulation of 50,000 a day , it is guilty of endeavoring to obtain money under false pretenses . It perpetrates a distinct fraud , as much as if a man in any other business sold an article at a certainprico which was entirely spurious , and not worth half the money . For it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nor of 40,000 , nor even of 35,000 ; and this wo undertake to prove if its books are laid open to the inspection of accountants , or failing so to do , we will pay over $16,000 to any charity in the City . We will pay the further sum . of $5,000 if we do not prove that the circulation of THE TIMES is , and has been for a year past , taking it day by day , larger than that of the Tribune . The terms of this offer we repeat as we gave them on Thursday : " We undertake to pay over any or all of the following sums to a suitable charity on the conditions given : 61,000 that the Tribune has note circulation of 50,000 deleted table The Tribune to pay the difference between the circulation which it claims and that which it really has . Thus , it it has 34.000 , it shall pay over $16,000 to the Chanty to be hereafter agreed upon , representing the difference between 34,000 and 50,000 copies . The investigation shall cover the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth . A committee of three shall be appointed to examine the books-ono to be named by THE Tutu. one by the Tribune , and one by the first two . This committee must have free access to every record and book . and not be put off with alleged ' abstracts , ' as was done by the Tribune when Messrs . PETTExon and Bunn issued , on the evidence of garbled documents , a false certificate as to its circulation . This wail the dodge played off upon Messrs . ASTOR , TAYLOR , and others by the Tammany Ring . and defended at the time by the Tribune . It now carries it out for its own benefit , but it must not be repe.tted in the investigation winch we now demand . The becks therreelves must be given up to the Investigating Committee . " It will not do for the Tribune to pretend that it has not hoard of this reply to its malicious and totally unprovoked attack upon us . It is not beneath its " dignity " to ' publish fraudulent statements about THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for those statements . When a man is accused of grave offenses , he may try to shelter himself behind a " policy of silence , " but the public will soon perceive that ho adopts that policy merely because ho knows himself to be guilty of the offenses chargedthat he has no defense to offer . For no man with a proper sense of honor , or of decent regard for his character , would submit to such an accusation as that which we deliberately bring against WrirrELAW REID , nominal editor of the New-York Tribune . What we say is , that he is guilty Of the daily attempt to obtain money under false pretenses ; that when he says his paper circulates 50,000 a day , he utters a gross falsehood with the intention of deceiving the public . And to pretend to be deaf to this charge , or to run like a coward from it , will not save him , for unless he withdraws his untrue and malicious assertions about THE TIMES , we will advertise him in all the chief newspapers of the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likes to put up with that in silence , he is welcome to do so .
