ART . V. - THE CURRENCY DEBATE OF 1873 - 74 . IN his speech at the bar of the House of Lords on the impeachment of Warren Hastings , Sheridan , to the great delight of the historian who was himself among the audience , took occasion to refer to the " luminous page of Gibbon . " The adjective was certainly not inappropriate ; but when the brilliant orator was shortly after called to account for using it , the temptation proved too great for the wit , and he is said to have defended himself by insisting that he did not say " luminous , ** but " voluminous . " The page of Gibbon is undeniably voluminous , but in it at least are garnered up the ripe fruits of twenty years of constant thought and conscientious labor spent in recounting the story of human civilization through fifteen eventful centuries . During the autumn of 1873 the United States was visited by one of those fii*ancial storms , incident to the modern highpressure system of conducting business , and which are common to all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fury of the tempest had subsided the national Congress met , and took the subject into consideration . Through nearly five mortal months the process of incubation was protracted , finally resulting in a measure which in due time was reproduced by the press of foreign lands as a legislative curl- - // osity , and which was promptly vetoed by the President . The mouse , if was true , was a very ridiculous mouse ; and , indeed , never struggled into a real existence ; but the amount of groaning on the part of the mountain which preceded its still-born genesis was truly portentous . It covered about seventeen hundred columns of the Congressional Record , containing upon a close computation considerably more printed matter than the entire work of the voluminous Gibbon ; a mass of reading sufficient , indeed , to fill about seventeen numbers of this Review , and equal to the twelve volumes of the works of Edmund Burke . Such are the proportions of a modern Congressional debate . Yet Methuselah and his contemporaries have long since passed away ! This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allotted to the reviewer no longer approach unto a thousand , but barely to a poor threescore and ten . And yet , in but a portion of one brief session , the national Sanhedrim dumps upon him between three and four thousand octavo pages on a single topic . In view of such an infliction , Gibbon is no longer the " voluminous , " nor can the perusal of his work be regarded otherwise than in the light of a holiday 's reading . The financial debate of the first session of the Forty-third Congress may be said to have begun on December 1 , 1873 , - the day upon which that body assembled . History will probably show that both session and debate ended , as they began , together . Meanwhile on the 1st of December , almost as soon as the Senate was called to order , two resolves relating to the financial condition of the country were introduced , respectively by Messrs . Morrill of Maine , and Ferry of Michigan , and were laid upon the table : that of Mr. Morrill looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Ferry to an increase of the existing volume of irredeemable and depreciated paper-money . Other measures speedily followed , emanating from different senators and expressive of their views ; generally emphasized by a speech of greater or less length . All this was , however , but the dropping fire of the skirmish lines ; the forces were not yet in battle array ; the tug of war was to come . At length , upon the 111th of December , Mr. Sherman of Ohio , as chairman of the Committee on Finance , introduced // into the Senate certain resolutions , in the form of instructions to the committee of which he was the head , calculated to draw forth from the Senate some expression of opinion as to the nature of the measure finally to be submitted to it . Immediately two other members of the committee , Mr. Ferry of Michigan and Mr. Bayard of Delaware , submitted other and substitute propositions , and upon these the debate began its interminable progress . The whole proceeding was , it would seem , unparliameiitary in the last degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , with the least possible result . The committee , instead of doing its preliminary work in the committee-room , and submitting on behalf of the majority and the minority of its members concrete and well-digested measures to be considered , debated , attacked , defended , and passed or rejected , and there an end , abdicated its functions and called upon the Senate to go into a loose and aimless discussion of abstract principles . As would naturally have been anticipated , that body thereupon proceeded to resolve itself into a national debating club , and its members began to relieve their minds at the rate of about ten columns of printed matter per diem . Meanwhile the committees of the house of Representatives were busy in their several rooms , while the Saturdays , given up to speech-making de omnibus rebus et ceteris aijis , afforded a safety-valve to the more eager and surcharged members . On these occasions , Mr. Kelley of Pennsylvania more particularly held forth week after week in reference to his own pet panacea , warranted to solve every difficulty , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abundant money . The months of December , of January , and nearly half of February wore away in this harmless discussion . It was rapidly losing all interest , when , in the Senate , Mr. Sherman infused new life into it by introducing another feeler for instructions in regard to a bill regulating the distribution of bank currency . The debate upon this measure assumed a somewhat sectional character , which lent a certain interest to it ; but it , too , was rapidly languishing away when it was broken in upon by the death of Mr. Sumner . At last , when the days of monrning were over , both houses settled themselves down to their work . Into each bills were introduced by the proper commit // tees , and the two bodies devoted themselves to their consideration . In the House a bill increasing the authorized volume of legal-tender notes from $356,000,000 to $400,000,000 was reported by the Committee on Ways and Means , and was passed on the 23d of March by a vote of 168 to 77 ; every amendment proposed to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the increase and distribution of bank currency , under what is known as a system of Free Banking , was proposed by Mr. Maynard of Tennessee , from the Committee on Banks and Banking , and , after a long and sharp debate , was passed on the 14th of April by a vote of 129 to 116 . Meanwhile , on the 24th of March , Mr. Sherman in the Senate had called up for final action a carefully prepared measure , which had previously been reported by him on behalf of the Finance Committee . Upon this the final debate was begun and continued until the 9th of April . In the course of it the bill was changed through the process of amendment , or , in parliamentary phraseology , " perfected , " until its whole original character was " perfected " out of it ; when it was finally passed , by a vote of 29 to 24 , and sent to the House for concurrence . As originally reported this measure was a timid effort at compromise , going to the extreme limit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issued by Mr. Richardson , and made them a part of the permanent circulation ; it did not touch the great question of resumption , but fixed the 1st of January , 1876 , as a date after which United States notes might , on the demand of any holder , be converted into five-per-cent bonds ; it made provision for an increase of the national banks , but provided that seventy per cent of the amount of additional bank currency issued should be retired in United States notes ; finally , it contained a futile clause looking to the increase of the stock of gold in the country by compelling the banks to hoard one quarter part of the interest they received on their United States bonds pledged in the Treasury as security for their circulation . It is not here proposed to criticise this measure ; but , mild as it was , it by no means met the views of the " moderate expansionists , " and in the course of debate was stigmatized by one of their number // as being " nothing but a contraction scheme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was certainly nothing ' but an inflation scheme " any way " ; though , unfortunately , after its passage , it was discovered that it would not inflate . As passed , it simply provided for the permanent reissue of the $44,000,000 of United States notes withdrawn from circulation and cancelled by Mr. McCulloch , and for an increase of $46,000,000 of the national bank currency . Round numbers have always a fascination for theorists ; and the " moderate expansionists " now agreed to fix the needs of the country at $800,000,000 of paper-money , leaving the yet rounder and more fascinating sum of $1,000,000,000 as an argument in some future debate . This bill was taken up as soon as possible after it reached the House , and , after a short debate , was passed on the 16th of April ; all amendments were voted down , and the final majority for the bill was 38 , there being 140 yeas to 102 nays . It then went to the President for his signature . By him it was held under advisement until the 22d , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ message . Upon the 28th that body proceeded to the consideration of the veto , and , after a very singular running debate lasting through several hours , in which nothing whatever was said of the veto and a great deal about Mr. Sumner 's displacement some years before from the chairmanship of the Committee on Foreign Relations , a final vote was reached , and the abortive measure which , poor as it was , represented the result of four months ' consideration , failed to pass . Sixty-four members of the Senate were present and voting ; 43 votes were required to make up the requisite two thirds ; 34 voted in the affirmative and 30 in the negative , so that the passage of the bill would have required a change of nine votes from the minority to the majority . That a measure looking to a direct inflation of an irredeemable and depreciated legal-tender paper-money by further issues of similar paper-money , to be forced into circulation in a time of profound peace and abundant material prosperity , should , after months of the fullest ' discussion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the year 1874 , be prevented from becoming a law only by the interposition of the executive veto , is sufficiently extraordinary . It admits of neither excuse nor // palliation . It is and must remain a lasting stigma upon the honesty and good faith of the American people , both casting and authorizing the gravest doubts on their much-vaunted capacity for self-government . No amount of rhetoric or sophistry or blustering can in the slightest degree alter or extenuate the fact . It is now matter of history . It can not be obliterated ; it will not be forgotten . A free , self-governing people , continually boasting of their liberty , their wealth , their superior intelligence , and the inexhaustible resources of that country of which they are so proud , - this people , not stricken by plague , pestilence , or famine , unvexed by any war , in the midst of plenty , decided , in the full light of the nineteenth century , and after months of deliberation , to do that which no monarch or despot has for more than two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the sternest of duress , - they decided wantonly and arbitrarily to tamper with and debase the national standard of values . And yet there are certain circumstances in connection with this proceeding which should not be forgotten . Under the most favorable conditions , the honesty , intelligence , and virtue of a country so prosperous as America has , in the struggle of political life , a heavy load to carry . The delights of Capua do not incite to eternal vigilance ; and , as a rule , with nations no more than with individuals are fortunate times pure times . At present , it so happens that a more thaix usually heavy load is imposed upon the better political elements of this country . We are now beginning to taste the bitter after-fruits of the late Civil War . As the necessary and inevitable result of that struggle , we destroyed , or irretrievably shattered , the whole industrial and political organization of at least nine States of the Union . From Virginia , all along the Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico to Louisiana , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war in a condition of exhaustion , from which they passed into one of chaos . Meanwhile the national government thought to create , through some patent legislative enactments , a living political organization to replace that which had been destroyed . The broken pieces were gathered together , strung upon wires , and cemented with Congressional glue ; and so we " reconstructed " the South . The // work , when completed , made up a ragged and incongruous whole , in which it was hard to say whether , in the expressive political nomenclature of the day , the Northern " carpetbagger , " the Southern " scallawag , " or the enfranchised African shone as the more conspicuous and least creditable element . But completed the work was ; and the Southern States at last staggered to their feet , and stood , galvanized into life , like the creation of another Frankenstein , - a ghastly satire on the republican form of government . Unlike Frankenstein , who fled in horror from the hideous result of his labors , Congress looked upon the erring but reconstructed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so straightway the living organizations of the loyal North were wedded to the galvanized corpses of the rebellious South , - to Alabama , to Louisiana , to Arkansas , to South Carolina . For years to come they must remain a dead weight , which the honesty , vigor , and life of the country has got to carry . They had to carry it in the financial debate , and it turned the scale against them . And why should the South be blamed ? The political combination of barbarism and corruption which our reconstruction measures placed in assured control of those States has reduced them already to utter bankruptcy and inevitable repudiation . Why should the intelligent elements of the South , embittered by a sense of outrage and crushed under negro legislation , care to maintain those standards of value which represent only ruin to themselves ? Must they not , on the contrary , feel a sweet sense of elation in the thought that they may yet drag us down into the pit we dug for them ? Throughout the financial debate they were a unit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Outside of the reconstructed States , Messrs . Bayard and Salisbury of Delaware , and Hamilton of Maryland , well represented the best type of Southern public men of the past . From those States there were a few men , like Townsend of Virginia , and Lamar of Mississippi , who represented the better political elements ; but it is greatly to be feared that it will be long before the great law of the survivorship of the strongest so far asserts itself as to materially enlarge their numbers . Meanwhile , on the decisive vote in the present debate , the six New England States were more than counterbalanced // by the nine Gulf and cotton States , excluding Texas . The latter were an affirmative unit ; the former , with the exception of Mr. Sprague of Rhode Island , were a negative unit . Had the issue been left to the representatives of those States , the systems of which had not been disorganized by war , - the healthy , intelligent , solvent communities of the Union , - the result would not have been for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar crisis fifty years ago , Great Britain occupied a wholly different position . With the exception of Ireland , the influence of which part of the empire was comparatively small , she contained within her system no foreign element of inherent weakness . Her position then was much more as that of New England now . The intelligence and honesty of Great Britain were not handicapped with dead weights of bankruptcy and barbarism of their own creation . As compared with ours , their task was an easy one . In passing through the crisis of 1815 - 20 , Great Britain , also , enjoyed the incalculable advantage of a decisive , vigorous lead on the part of those responsible for the government . It was Mr. Peel , afterwards Sir Robert , who from the Treasury benches , and with the whole strength of the government behind him , brought in and carried through the specie-resumption act of 1817 . The friends of a sound financial policy had something to rally on , - a standard to follow . Parliament was not a mob of noisy talkers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to extract instructions as to a policy . Throughout the recent financial debate , however , no lead or indication of a lead was afforded to Congress by the administration . The message of the President at the commencement of the session was vague and uncertain in tone , and in its loose expressions in regard to specie payments , the balance of trade , and the sufficiency of the currency , indicated rather an utter failure to grasp the elementary principles of the question at issue , than any intention to pursue a definite line of action in regard to it . Had he earlier , and through the proper official channels , caused the views contained in his veto message , or , yet more , those of his subsequent " Memorandum " of June 4 , to be understood as the views of the government , the whole course of events would have been other than it was . // Not improbably , however , the opinions of the message were imbibed from one source , and those of the " memorandum " from another . At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the message as plainly partook of its pale , colorless influence , as did the later documents of the strong , sanguine views of Senator Jones of Nevada , through whom the unofficial manifesto was finally made public . However this may be , and whatever unexplained causes may have induced the startling change between the official utterances of December and the individual manifesto of May , one thing is indisputable , the veto message was a surprise to every one , and during the whole course of the debate which preceded it the executive views were unknown , and its influence unfelt ; the most important question of the day was not a party question . The government had no policy . Its friends - those who in Congress were looked to as the especial exponents of its views - were divided in opinion . In the Senate Chamber Messrs . Conkling and Chandler found themselves sharply arrayed against Messrs . Morton and Cameron ; while in the House of Representatives , General Butler , the actual administration leader , was upon one side , and Mr. Pawes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is unnecessary to say that such a course of action was wholly inconsistent with the traditions of the government , and incompatible with its successful operation . It is very well for the administration to have no policy to maintain in opposition to , and defiance of , the legally expressed will of the country . That is the principle at the base of all parliamentary government . No party can , however , without becoming contemptible , remain in control of the government and yet abdicate responsibility . It is very well to increase to the utmost the number of open questions ; it is far from desirable that the executive should make its influence felt on all the petty issues of the day . But , in the present case , it may safely be asserted that the worst features of that confusion on the currency question in which the public mind is now involved are due to the uncertain and changing tone of the administration , and to the utter disregard of those usages which custom has established to regulate the intercourse between it and the legislative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to heads of departments at the commencement of a session , not to casual visitors at its close . Through four months of debate , valueless except for its crystallizing effect on public opinion , the head of the government jealously reserved his opinions , only to make them public when they produced , amid the murky darkness which had settled down upon Congress and the country , rather the effect of a thunderbolt than a beacon . What would have been the fate of our finances in the early days of the Republic had Washington first expressed his policy in a veto , and had Mr. Richardson occupied the chair of Hamilton ! As a consequence of this absence of lead , the debate throughout its course indicated the utter breaking up of party lines . Both in discussion and when it came to the votes , the old organizations were fairly reft in twain ; the two wings of each coalesced with the similar wings of the opposing organization on an entirely new division . So much was this the case , that in each house a majority of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ united against the two minorities of the same parties , acting together in perfect sympathy . It is not proposed in the present paper to enter into any general review of the debate , or of the several speeches made on one side or the other in the course of it . Of these there were more than one hundred and twenty-five ; in which number is included only the set speeches . Many of them were characterized by very decided ability ; and , indeed , the record bristled with salient points and episodes of interest . Three efforts only , however , attracted any great degree of public notice , or marked turningpoints in the discussion . These three were the speeches of Mr. Schurz on February 25th , and of Mr. Jones of Nevada , on April 1st , in the Senate ; and that of Mr. Mitchell of Wisconsin , on March 27th , in the House . Throughout , the attitude of Mr. Schurz was , probably , more creditable to himself individually than that of any other man . Outside of all party lines , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Western State , in which he was believed in the detestable Congressional jargon to " antagonize " public opinion on the question at issue , he yet unhesitatingly flung himself into the struggle , in obedience to his convictions , and boldly risked his political // future on a faith in his principles . He triumphantly bore the brunt of the debate in the Senate , and his collisions with the inflationist leaders were not infrequently so sharp as to infringe on the limits of parliamentary courtesy . He represented , on his side , the student , the theorist , the accomplished parliamentary debater ; ready , witty , armed at all points , he was never found wanting , was never despondent , and his record will even bear comparison with that of Canning in the English debate on the Bullion Report . Mr. Jones of Nevada made but two brief speeches , the first of which , however , stamped him at once as a debater of very decided power . It was marked throughout by a practical , incisive tone which stands out in agreeable relief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , vigorous , formidable in retort , he went to the gist of the subject as did no one else . There was a certain epigrammatic bluntness in the way in which he almost blurted out the ugly truths at issue which was most refreshing ; and the vigor and directness of thrust with which he unhorsed Mr. Morton , when that gentleman more than once undertook to meddle with him , must have given his unfortunate adversary a most realizing sense of the expediency of greater caution in the future . If any inference may be drawn from the maiden efforts of Mr. Jones , the Senate has secured in him a veritable acquisition during the remainder of his official term . Mr. Mitchell 's speech in the House was of the best class which ever comes from the purely business man in public life . It was , apparently , a written essay , and formed no part of legitimate debate , as did the effort of Mr. Jones . It was , however , clear , unpretentious , direct , - the utterance of a practical man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but who had done what so few of that class ever do , studied its theory and detected its formulas . Of the other speeches on the same side of the question it is not proposed to say anything . They are already forever buried in the columns of the Record . Upon the side of the inflationists Messrs . Morton , Ferry , and Logan were most conspicuous in the Senate , and Messrs . Kelley and Butler in the House . The efforts of none of these gentlemen were , in themselves , worthy of any particular notice . // Mr. Morton , of Indiana , was the real leader on his side of the question . A vigorous , ready , and formidable debater , his position throughout this discussion was one of peculiar difficulty . He was oppressed by the utterances of other days . One after another , his opponents - first Sherman , then Schurz , then Thurman - appealed to what Disraeli has called " the irrevocable pages of Hansard , " and brought him face to face with his diametrically opposite opinions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before . So frequently and elaborately was this process gone through with , - with such a cruel gusto and enjoyment on the part of his tormentors , that he must quite have grown to enjoy it himself at last . At least it seemed to occasion him no embarrassment . lie never tried to explain away the discrepancy ; contenting himself always with the same old standard repartees , that " only dead men and idiots never changed " ; or that he was glad at last to recognize the sources from which his opponents drew their arguments , and to see them masquerading in his cast-off clothes . Mr. Morton 's record in this debate certainly does not commend him . He is said to be an aspirant for presidential honors . If such is the case it is safe to predict disappointment in store for him in that respect . No man with such a voluminous and varied record could hope to run the terrible gauntlet which hedges the way to the White House . Mr. Morton has the misfortune of combining to a degree quite inconsistent with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a political weathercock . Of Messrs . Ferry and Logan little need be said . The first is a fair specimen of the active and practical business man , half educated , and long accustomed to dealing with the outside of things , but now attempting the role of the financial statesman . In his view a complete collapse of credit is a mere currency derangement ; a system radically unsound may at any moment be made sound by amending its by-laws . A courteous political tinker , with a sublime confidence in the efficacy of legislation , he contributed little to the *iiscussion beyond much earnestness , a profuse display of rhetoric , and a great deal of rather thin sophistry . Mr. Logan developed in great perfection all the characteristics of the vex et rrceterea ni // Lii statesman . Talking more than any one else , he opened his share in this debate with a deliciously naV claim for consideration on the ground that he had formed his opinions only after devoting his whole leisure time " during the past two weeks , when not engaged in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ science of finance , including researches into all the leading authorities ! Unfortunately , however , to the very end , he evinced a lamentable incapacity to grasp the distinction between accumulated wealth and a medium of exchange . In his mouth wealth was money , and so was currency ; currency , therefore , was wealth . He accordingly always enjoyed the great advantage over his adversaries of answering their arguments at great length , and to his own perfect satisfaction , without in the remotest degree understanding them . He further contributed to the debate several very marked displays of extremely bad temper and worse manners , and a few dismal efforts at humor . During its last stages , however , this man either put himself forward or was put forward as the recognized parliamentary leader of a majority of the Senate of the United States . In the House of Representatives Mr. Kelley , of Pennsylvania , was the most prominent talker on either side , and is deserving of a moment 's consideration . Referring to himself endearingly in the course of the debate as " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoroughgoing protectionist of the Philadelphia school , and as such regards Mr. Henry C. Carey as " the most profound and philosophic student of social science the world has yet produced . " As well as one can judge , a very honest man , his self-appreciation is something inconceivable , and , on paper and at a distance , most amusing . Of very limited capacity , irritable , and often arrogant in debate , absolutely sure in his own conclusions and never tracing any result beyond a proximate and apparent cause , delighting as the protectionist must in the post hoc ergo propter hoc argument , there is yet more individuality about him more of which to compose a study of amusing foibles for a character in a novel , a sort of Rt . Hon. Nicholas Rigby - than in almost any other man on the floor of Congress , excepting perhaps General Butler . There is something humorously // simple in his lofty estimates of himself and his friends , which he does not hesitate openly to avow , but which he also allows to crop out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was his reply to Mr. Beck of Kentucky , who had made some allusion to him in debate which called forth a warm rejoinder ; when Mr. Kelley had finished , Mr. Beck politely inquired if he had got through . " Yes , " rejoined the leonine Kelley , " unless you arouse me again . " On another occasion , after upsetting and casting to the winds with scorn the whole long list of financial and economical authorities of other lands , lie fortified himself by a reference to " Henry C. Carey , John A. Thompson of Summit Point , West Virginia , and Charles Sears of Navasink , New Jersey , three as original and profound thinkers as God ever blessed our country with . " Mr. Kelley would hardly deserve so long a notice in this paper , were it not for the singular fact that he was , throughout the discussion , the recognized exponent and the most earnest advocate of what has been adverted to as the single novel financial expedient suggested in it , - the 3.65 per cent interconvertible bond scheme. * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but , certainly , with this exception , there was not in the whole course of the well nigh interminable debate a single idea which had not often before been proposed , discussed , and put in practice , in other times and other lands ; there was not a sophistry which had not over and over again been refuted and exposed in treatise and debate ; there was not a reply which could not be found in almost the same words , mutatis mutandis , in the records of many languages . To the student in financial discussion this monotony of repetition in the full confidence of original thought is wearisome to a degree . John Locke and John Law , Vansittart and Canning , Ricardo and Bosanquet , have left scant gleanings behind them ; though its members know it not , the art of financiering so as " to make one into two " is so far exhausted as to make it very difficult for Congress to give to its discussion the interest of novelty . None the less , if the 3.65 convertible-bond scheme , though not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American Currency , " p. 326. // has indeed the merit of novelty , it and its leading exponent are upon that score alone deserving of some consideration . Not that Mr. Kelley , or eveii Mr. Henry C. Carey , or those other " original and profound thinkers , " Jones of Summit Point , and Sears of Navasink , can severally or collectively assert a copyright to this financial invention . On the contrary , that distinction is disputed with all the world by no less a person than General B. F. Butler of Massachusetts . That distinguished financial authority plumes himself especially on the parentage of this plan , for on the 27th of March he said : " I believe that in 1869 I was the first to propose in an elaborate speech in this House the 3.65 bonds " ; and again , on Apri1* , 1874 , he declared , that he had " elaborated " that scheme " with more care and with more thought than I ever bestowed upon any proposition , whether of law , finance , or politics . " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Essex statesman , - whilom " the grim soldier of New Orleans , " - indorsed by " the most profound student of ' social science the world has yet produced , " as well as by an array of " the most original thinkers God has ever blessed our country with , " - such a measure , championed by " Old Pig-Iron " himself , could not but prove a quarry tempting even to a reviewer of what Mr. Logan would describe as " a depreciated intellect . " But some consideration is due to a long-suffering community . Three thousand pages of solid financial discussion in one halfyear is sufficient to stay the appetite of the veriest cormorant . Enough is proverbially as good as a feast , and it is not now proposed to supplement so plentiful a repast . And indeed the space allotted to this article can better be devoted to the one truly salient feature in the Congressional debate , - its innumerable crudities , absurdities , and sophistries . With these it was most plentifully larded . Indeed , a well-culled selection of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which would be interesting now and curious forever . That such vile sophistries should during the latter half of the nineteenth century be clothed in yet viler rhetoric and uttered in any deliberative body outside of a debating club in a lunatic asylum ought to constitute matter for special wonder to ourselves , and doubtless will to all future generations . // It will be necessary to begin at the beginning and follow the thread of the debate . The cause of the crisis and consequent panic of 1873 would seem to have been obvious enough . For twelve years the country had been steadily running in debt , - borrowing on almost any terms , of whoever was willing to lend . The rate of interest to be paid was hardly matter for discussion ; and when the interest on such loans as were effected came due , more loans were negotiated with which to pay it . It seemed confidently to be believed that this process need never stop . It became a mania with States , with cities , with towns , with corporations , and with individuals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incontrovertibly showed that investments in this class of property averaged an annual return of barely six per cent ; yet loans were freely negotiated at ten , at fifteen , at twenty per cent , and bonds and stock on gayly printed paper were poured out in reckless profusion . It is noteworthy that not a single speaker in the whole debate attempted to deal exhaustively with this subject . Many touched upon it ; not one laboriously collected the statistics and exhibited to the country the hard , cruel figures in which its folly should stand confessed . Estimates , more or less careful , of the amount of the indebtedness thus incurred were giv*n by three speakers , - Messrs . Fenton of the Senate , and Townsend and Comingo of the House . In each case they were carelessly made and amounted to little more than guesses ; but they sustained each other . By Mr. Fenton our indebtedness was placed at $12,000,000,000 , upon which an annual interest account of $720,000,000 had to be met . Mr. Townsend estimated the total at $ 10,000,000,000 , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result . If a business man effects a loan , and then borrows money to meet the interest upon it ; and then borrows again to pay interest on interest , beside increasing the loan , his affairs generally after a time culminate in a crisis ; that is , when he gets to a point where he can borrow no more , he collapses . It was to just that point that the business system of the United States arrived in the summer of 1873 . To the matter-of-fact observer this all seemed simple enough ; the Congressional mind despises " theory , " but is not " matter-of-fact . " // Thackeray , somewhere in his writings , criticises severely the well-worn adage that " money is the root of all evil , " and emphatically declares that in his experience it was not in money , but in the want of money that the difficulty lay . This view of the case strongly commended itself to the average Congressional mind , and was stated in many forms with much point and earnestness . For instance , Mr. Logan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cooke &amp; Co. , and at the same time administering one of his inimitably happy and humorous slaps at two of his opponents : - " A large portion - yes , a very large portion - of the railroad bonds thrown into the market , to carry on the larger railroad schemes of this country , has been taken in Europe . And why taken in Europe ? Because there they have money and we have not " Let us take one example : the Northern Pacific Railroad scheme claimed to be wholly on a gold basis , as I understand We all know the sequel . Was this one of the sins of the greenbacks ? I am rather inclined to believe it was for the lack of greenbacks , and not on account of their being in excess of the business wants of the country . No , sir ; it was want of faith in the enterprise on which the bonds were predicated which caused them not to be taken in sufficient amounts to carry the enterprise through , and Jay Cooke not being enabled to procure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country to be procured , that caused the explosion of the scheme . But perhaps I have not looked far enough into the Senator 's ( Mr. Scharz ) model authorities , " Marco Polo " and " Amasa Walker , " to see the connection between the cause and effect . " - Record . No. 79 , March 21 , 1874 . To the same effect , Mr. Hunter of Indiana , also referring to the Jay Cooke problem : - " It was then for want of money , and not on account of too much of it , to meet his obligations , that he failed The injury in every instance can be traced to the want of money , and not to a superabundance of it . " - Record , No. 86 , March 29 , 1874 . In the Senate , Mr. Bogy of Missouri became poetic over this chronic difficulty : - " The Senate and the country may see and understand how and why it is that , however hard our farmers arA pI*nters may work and toil , however genial and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and refreshing the rains may have fallen on the fruitful soil of the West and of the South , prosperity for the want of money was , and is to-day , an impossibility . " - Record , No. 16 , January 6 , 1874 . And finally , Mr. Whitehead , of Virginia , recurred to the same obvious truth : " Sir . there seems to be a great deal of difficulty here as to what caused the panic , and gentlemen persist in saying that it was too much paper-money . Well , I do not pretend to controvert their sources of information ; but one thing I say , that we were perfectly satisfied in my section of the country that what caused the panic was a scarcity of money . " - Record , No. 95 , April 1 9 , 1874 .

Such a proposition seems incredible , yet this is what Mr. Cameron , the senior Senator , a life-long banker , had to say upon it : - " I believe that the moment you do anything here which restores confidence to the people , you will have the manufactories started again . Confidence is the one thing that they need . They want currency when they get into operation . The cry was constantly - I know it myself from my intimate acquaintance with the large manufacturers and the small manufacturers too - that every one of them needed more currency than they had . They had capital , but could not get that which enabled them to pay off their hands The manufacturers of the country need a currency which will enable them to pay their weekly and daily debts . " - Record , No. 93 , Apr11 7,1874 . Considering his antecedents , by the way , the role played by Mr. Cameron throughout this debate was an exceedingly offensive one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the " good old man , " of the Senate , the venerable political Turveydrop , in fact , scattering about unctuous flowers of rhetorical cant , which , considering the detestable political morality of the man , are odorous in the extreme . Here are some specimens : - " Then again , the Senator said , what I do not believe is true , that // it costs something to be honest . My teaching has always been that honesty is the best policy . In my judgment , it is always profitable to be honest . The man who only looks for pecuniary profit is a fool , because he always suffers . Just and honest acts of individuals , and wise and just acts of legislators , always produce benefits , not only for those for whom they legislate , but for themselves . The man in this Senate who will protect the laborer and the producer will always receive honor and profit . He will derive no loss from that . " - Record , No. 93 , April 7,1874 .

There is too much good sense in this body to vote for anything that would at all tend to the destruction of the country . Every man here wants to do right . " - Record , No. 93 , April 7 , 1874 . But to return to the great theory of a credit collapse because of an insufficient supply of tickets of exchange . Example after example of this singular hallucination might be cited . Senators and members vied with each other in declaring that , " owing to the remarkable scarcity of the article , " the business men of the country had to stop , because they could not " get the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an excess of irredeemable money was " absurd " ; such phrases as dearth , " " famine , " " grinding contraction , ** " criminal contraction , " were inadequate to express the dire pangs of those , a-hungering for " more paper-money . " It would be useless to multiply quotations to this effect ; especially as this diagnosis of the disorder was not satisfactory to all the authorities . Mr. Boutwell , of Massachusetts , for instance , as was befitting an ex-Secretary of the Treasury and the inventor of " the greenback-reserve " panacea , took a closer view of the question , and declined to concur in the heresy which sought foi the root of all evil in the dire impecuniosity of the time . He looked for it elsewhere ; and at last his search was grandly rewarded by discovering it in the deposit of out-of-town balances during the summer-vacation period in the banks of Wall Street ; then he delivered himself as follows : - // " I attribute the panic to the inflation of the currency locally ; and when you speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a paper currency or a metallic currency , it is always local Durinc the last season there was no inflation of the currency of this country appertaining to the whole country , but there was inflation of the currency limited to the city of New York " The processes by which the currency of the city of New York was inflated are generally well understood . The statistics show that the deposits of the banks of the city of New York , including the national banks and the banks established under the laws of the State , were increased $50,000,000 between the month of April and the month of September The presence of this vast sum of money in New York , accumulated by unnatural processes , brought upon that city , and then upon the whole country secondarily , the evils which we are now called upon to consider . " - Record , No. 36 , January 29 , 1874 . Mr. Boutwell is a financial light . This discovery of the cause of the crisis of 1873 deserves to rank with his other discovery , made while Secretary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do our ocean carrying-trade was " a direct drain upon the resources of the country of just so much money , and equal to casting it into the sea , so far as the nation is concerned . " Nor is it behind this startling economic proposition , which all future theorists on the science of wealth had best take note of as the ripe conclusion of a " practical observer " - " The wealth of London is so great , that if her four million people were to suspend labor , and the income of the investments which have been made were to continue unimpaired and to be equally distributed for the support of the inhabitants , they , and the generations that are to follow them , could live on idleness and in comfort . This is the wealth of which I speak , - the accumulated wealth of generations . " - Record , No. 37 , January 29 , 1874 . Leaving Mr. Boutwell , however , let us pass from the cause of the crisis to its obvious remedy . As " want of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the root of all evil , it plainly followed that its removal lay in the creation of more money ; or , as Mr. Morton , of Indiana , beautifully expressed it : " The people want a little more currency . They believe it will be good for them , and I believe it . I believe it will // revive business all over this nation . I believe that business will spring up under the influence of a promise like that , just as the grass and the flowers will grow under the spring showers . " While the same high authority had already announced in language equally happy that " vague declamation about the beauties of resumption is like the notes of the mocking-bird , which please only by their delusions . " As government held a monopoly in the printing of currency business , it at once became not only its right , but a duty , and indeed one of its necessary functions , to supply that " little more " which the people wanted . The following are a few fair specimens of the absurdities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth is , the Constitution does not make anything money , either gold or silver or anything else ; hut leaves this question with the legislative department of the government , imposing no restraint or limitations upon its discretion , and assuming that it would he governed by the general principles of expediency and common-sense .

Which , then , ought to be the favored class , and which shall it be I Shall we adopt that policy which will add to the burdens of the debtor and increase the wealth of the creditor class , or shall we , as far as lies in our power , endeavor to lift the burden from the former and impose it in a measure upon the latter To these questions I have but one answer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far as is in our power , try to relieve the unfortunate debtor class , and afford them an opportunity to overcome the adverse fortune by which they have been overtaken ; and at the same time do what we may and can to prevent unnecessary sacrifices by those who have been more highly favored and have escaped the horrors of financial embarrassment . " - MR . CoMINGo , OF MISSOURI . Record , No. 122 , May 10 , 1874 . But perhaps as comical an argument as any advanced in the whole debate was that of Mr. Boutwell , when he undertook to show how , through ingenious financial expedients , the terrible fall in the value of legal-tender notes , which succeeded the Treasury suspension in 1861 , had wrought no harm to the creditors of that period . This proposition deserves to be quoted at length : - " I ask what excuse , except the sternest necessity , can be offered to the country upon the moral question if you add to the volume of currency and enable debtors to pay their debts with less value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the debts were contracted I In the war we had an excuse ; it was a valid excuse . The country was in peril ; every interest was in jeopardy . Individual rights under such circumstances are comparatively unimportant . Necessity , stern necessity , is the excuse ; it is the defence . But the injustice of the proceeding was considered . We offered to the creditors of the country who held notes without interest the opportunity to exchange those notes for bonds bearing interest ; and by the policy of the government and the purposes of the people those bonds have become as valuable as coin . Therefore the creditor class that // was at first compelled to receive in payment of debts currency less valuable than that which existed when the debts were contracted , by investing the moneys which they thus received in the securities of the government , transferred the loss first imposed upon themselves to the country as a whole ; therefore , considering the creditor class of the years 1862 , 1863 , and 1864 together , they suffered nothing by the transaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , No. 36 , January 29 , 1874 . In other words , there was in 1862 , 1863 , and 1864 , a class in the community which lived on fixed incomes , - on salaries , rents derived from leases , interest on bonds and mortgages , and on annuities . With the money so received they paid their rents and taxes , bought their food and clothes , and educated their children . The government during those three years debased the measure of value from 100 to 36 , and rent , food , clothes , and education went up in price proportionately . This large class received their incomes , contracted in gold , in legal-tender notes ; but , says the ex-Secretary , no wrong was done them " as a class , " for had they not seen fit to pay rent , to buy food and clothes , and to educate their children , they might have invested their incomes in government bonds , which , by good fortune , have risen to par ! As a " plain , " " practical , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your " theorists " or " doctrinaires , " but a hard-headed retail shopkeeper , - Mr. Boutwell should have closed this disquisition on financial ethics and clinched his argument with the ancient and homely adage , that the creditor class , " as a class , " can not expect " to eat its cake , and have it too . " But Mr. Boutwell 's great discovery in the course of this debate was that the depreciated legal.tender notes of the United States were neither " dishonored rags " nor " printed lies . " In view of the promise printed on the face of each of them , both of these facts had been roundly stated by the " bullionists , " as their opponents delighted to call the advocates of specie payment , at a very early stage in the debate . This excited the patriotic indignation of many gentlemen , and , among others , of Mr. Boutwell , who announced " that he had yet to learn how the public credit is improved or the character of the country increased by the statement that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are few things , except signing their // names , in connection with the proper ordering of national finances , which Mr. Boutwell and his protege and successor in the United States Treasury Department have not , apparently , " yet to learn " ; but it would seem to be quite elementary that a pompous silence in relation to one 's protested notes , however impressive it may be , is , after all , a poor substitute for cash ; to the theoretic mind the discredit seems to be in the failure to pay , not in the plainness of speech thereon . But Mr. Boutwell argued that the legal-tender notes were not discredited , because , though they promised to pay " dollars , " they did not specify when they would be paid - " Whoever will look at a United States note will see that there is no obligation expressed - and I think none implied - in what is written upon the note , that it is to be paid at a particular time . It is redeemable at the pleasure of the government , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spirit of the law . Such , I think , has been the view of the Treasury Department As regards the United States notes , they are redeemable at any time , but they are payable only at the pleasure of the government ; that is to say , the government will consult its own convenience ,  --  the ideas that prevail as to a wise public policy . I only make these remarks that I may put an end , so far as an expression of opinion can put an end , to the opinion prevailing in the community that the government has for a moment been discredited in reference to the redemption of these notes . . . . . I suppose the courts would enforce the payment of a similar private pbligation after the demand was made , considering the circumstances , whether they were reasonable or not ; but the rule does not apply to the government . There is no power of making the demand . " . . " MR . MORRILL , of Vermont . I am quite ready to admit that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it does not destroy the moral obligation . " - Record , No. 20 , January 10 , 18r4 . But Mr. Morrill got nothing by his reply , as the ex-Secretary triumphantly declared that " the equity and morality of the proceeding are to be sought for in the hearts and purposes of the people . " This question of the redeemable character of legal-tender notes excited in the course of the debate no little discussion , both metaphysical and legal . On the metaphysical side of the // question several conundrums were propounded by various gentlemen , all indicating an opinion that the legal-tenders were already " redeemable . " As , for instance , in reply to Mr. G. F. Hoar , who asked him if he did not consider " the faith of the government pledged to the redemption of the greenbacks in coin , " Mr. Kelley characteristically and enigmatically responded as follows - " MR . KELLEY . I say I think the faith of the government is pledged to the redemption of the greenback ; but I have no time to go into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some day I shall he glad to have the gentleman make an hour 's speech and let me puzzle him with a few questions , such as whether a thing is not redeemed when it buys its full value . " - Record , No. 27 , January 18 , 1874 . The unfortunate Mr. Mellish of New York , who , almost before the debate was over , lost his mind and died , philosophized to much the same effect : - " Inasmuch as our currency under the proposed plan would represent the dollar and its multiples , the critic or hypercritic will ask , What is a dollar ? Answer : It is the name conventionally adopted as a unit of value . But what is it worth , and what do you measure a dollar by ? Answer : By the same method as with the silver and gold dollar under the specie system , - by another dollar of the same kind . But what is it worth ? says the critic . It is worth as much wheat , or cloth , or leather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as you can buy with it . And that is all that can be said of a gold or silver dollar . " - Record , No. 86 , March 29 , 1874 . But Mr. B. F. Butler , as usual , settled the question so as to obviate the necessity of its further discussion forever : - " I hear a great deal said about an irredeemable paper currency . ' What is currency ? It is an instrument of exchange , an instrument to work with , to use , to measure values , to carry on transactions . Why does not somebody get up here and make us an argument about an irredeemable yardstick , or an irredeemable quart-pot , or an irredeemable bushel-measure , or an irredeemable Fairbanks scale ? Why should we want to redeem this instrument of exchange , this measure of value ? We want to use it all the time . " - Record , No. 93 , April 7,1874 . It so happens , however , that the first law passed under the administration of President Grant was an act to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , among other things , " solemnly pledged " the national faith " to make provision at the earliest practicable period for the redemption of United States notes in coin . " Five years had passed away and not one step in the direction indicated had yet been taken . And now the inflation leaders dealt with this act in two ways : by one section of them it was roundly denounced , while by the other it was gently interpreted away . Mr. Kelley was the leading exponent of the first class , as Mr. Boutwell was of the second . The former gentleman was peculiarly explicit : - " Ma . KELLEY . I will accommodate the order of my remarks to the gentleman 's question , although I would have preferred that he had allowed me to reach it at another point . Sir , the resolution of 1869 , to which the gentleman refers , was passed in order that it might be said that the first act signed by General Grant was a declaration in support of the public credit . It originated in the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hit of buncombe by which opposition members were to be compelled to vote to sustain the public credit . " A MEMBER . And you voted for it . " - Record , No. 27 , January 18 , 1874 . " Where did one Congress get the power to bind its successors forever by an ordinary act of legislation l 0 , yes ! It is all right to amend the act of 1862 by the act of 1869 , after the bonds were issued , and add $ 200,000,000 to their value ; but of course legislation that would relieve labor and save to the producers of our wealth , the patient toilers in the field and the mine and the shop , $21,240,000 a year , would be a violation of public faith ! What an argument in a republic ! " - MR . HOLMAN , OF INDIANA . Record , No. 95 , April 9,1874 . " It is known to every gentleman that you passed an act in 1869 saying you would redeem this debt in gold . Suppose you did . It did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a legislative act and bound nobody , but simply authorized the government officer to pay in gold . *Thenever you repeal it , it is at an end . It is not like the law of the Medes and Persians . " - Mn . BRIGHT , or INDIANA . Record , No. 87 , March 31 , 1874 . " I think it would be quite justifiable in any future Congress to regard such legislation as null and void . It is not fair to assume that all wisdom will die with this Congress , or that we know better how many greenbacks will be necessary in 1880 than will the then representatives of the people . Of course this principle will apply to // the farce of a solemn pledge'in regard to limiting the volume of greenbacks passed some years ago , and about which has been let oft so much of touching , not to say maudlin , eloquence . Even the Constitution fixes nothing in perpetuity ; how absurd , then , to claim a greater scope for an enactment of Congress , which may be passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a solemn provision of the Constitution itself . " - MR . MELLISH , OF NEW YORK . Record , No. 86 , March 29 , 1874 . Mr. Boutwell 's ingenious method of referring those curious as to the significance of this act to " the hearts and purposes of the people " for information on that point has already been referred to . This simple method of disposing of an ugly point strongly commended itself to the Congressional mind , and brought out numerous marginal glosses on the words " earliest practicable period " - " The word practicable'in the law of 1869 is not synonymous with possible . ' It does not mean at every sacrifice , or at all hazards , but when the government is in a condition to do it , and it can be done without injury to the general prosperity and the business of the country . Upon the greenback circulation there can be no technical default by the government . It is not a private but a public obligation , part of a general system of finance and administration issued for purposes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . The greenbacks were issued as a substitute for coin , the day of payment left indefinite and dependent upon the future condition and business of the country . " - SENATOR MORTON , OF INDIANA . Record , No. 79 , March 24 , 1874 . " I therefore say that the Senator 's idea that the government can only maintain her honor by paying out a dollar in gold for each dollar in greenbacks is erroneous . She will pay every- dollar of it when it can be done without detriment to the treasury or injury to her citizens ; and that is what is meant by as soon as practicable on her part , ' which the Senator from Ohio Mr. Sherman dwells on so much . " - SENATOR LOGAN , OF ILLINOIS . Record , No. 29 , January 31 , 1874 . " Congress , in 1869 , after the hue and cry of the Western Democrats for repudiation had somewhat subsided , passed an act to strengthen the public credit . This act binds the government to redeem the greenbacks at the earliest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is not even possible . The people , who own the greenbacks , and who are the sole judges of the question of practicability , do not demand it now . The greenback // is more popular than ever before , and it holds its value unimpaired amid all the clamors of all its detractors. " - Mn . SHERWOOD , OF OHIO . Record , No. 89 , April 2 , 1874 . Mr. Ferry , however , laid down the broad general principle that , with individuals as well as with governments , willingness to pay*one 's notes was the one conclusive proof of the ability to do so , and that the examination into " the hearts and purposes of the people " should go no further ; unwillingness to pay was sufficient evidence of inability to pay , and conclusive on the " earliest practical period " point ; consequently " the government , when able conveniently to pay , will pay . " The colloquy setting forth this startling theory of commercial faith is too long to quote . ( Record , No. 77 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the discussion brought up the whole " greenback " question , and the eagle fairly screamed in his wrath at the opprobium cast upon such a noble legacy of our martial glories . The logic here becomes so absurd and the rhetoric so detestable , that the temptation to quote is not easily resisted . But a single specimen of each style of argumentation must suffice . We may as well begin with the good old post ergo propter , and Senator Cameron , of Pennsylvania , may state it : - " He Mr. Stewart of Nevada said that our currency was the reproach of the country . I wanted to know from the Senator where was the reproach . Was the issuing of our greenbacks , and afterward the establishment of our national banks , a reproach when it saved the country from the hand of the spoiler ? Was it a reproach when this government of ours , which I and other men believe the most beneficent government in the world , was saved from destruction and the country from dismemberment ? Was that a reproach I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our greenbacks , we should have been severed long ago . The great consummation of the war , which destroyed so much capita and so many valuable lives , was saved to us and to the world and to future generations by the currency which the wisdom of Congress gav* to the people . I think there was no reproach in that . " - Record , No. 56 , February 21 , 1874 . Next , Mr. Ferry , with the reductio ad absurdurn - " I ask your attention to the two ways of measuring the value of this currency . What are they ? Go into the markets ; question // Wall Sfreet ; and the answer made in the midst of the panic was , that the value of this currency was only six per cent discount , - ninety-four cents to the dollar in gold . I ask the Senator from Wisconsin Mr. Howe whether that be stuff , ' whether that be counterfeit money ' 3 And I ask the Senator from Vermont Mr. Morrill if such is an engraved falsehood ' 3 If in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was worth ninety-four cents , and to-day , I believe , is worth ninety cents in coin , then strictly , according to the epithets and estimates of these Senators , it would be ten cents lie and ninety cents truth . " - Record , No. 14 , December 19 , 1873 . Then Mr. Morton argued that the people accepted the legaltender notes , not because the courts compelled them to accept them or nothing , but because they loved them and preferred them to gold ; technically the argumentum ab amore viridistergi - " The issue of greenbacks solved the financial question of the war , and from that time forward there was little trouble or doubt about the means for carrying on the conflict . The greenbacks grew steadily in popular favor , and , notwit.hstanding the premium on gold , became , and are to-day , the most popular currency the country has ever had . The idea that they were a forced loan never occurred to the people . They took them without force , would part from them with reluctance . " - Record , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an argument from the inexpediency of waste ; - money is wealth , currency is money , " greenbacks " are currency , therefore " greenbacks " are wealth : - " When you tell me that you will repeal the legal-tender act and burn up the legal-tender notes , I tell you you will burn up $ 382,000,000 values in this country , and you reduce to that extent , by $ 382,000,000 of values , the property of the people of the United States of America . That is exactly the result and I tell you , gentlemen , when they go before this country with propositions like this they will find a voicc coming from the hard-fisted yeo . manry of this land , that will make them shake and tremble in their boots . " - MR . LOGAN , OF ILLINOIS . Record , No. 149 , June 12 , 1874 . Next comes the argumentum ab amore patrice - " And right here rests the true basis of all our currency . While the people cheerfully and readily pay taxes , the currency can never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mockery , repu // diation , and shame ; thus doing more to blast the reputation of their country and befoul its fair name than they could by any device of wickedness short of rebellion and treason . " - MR . COBURN , or INDIANA . Record , No. 95 , April 9 , 1874 . Then we have a new species of argument drawn from the joy of the manumitted African , - a species of argumentum ab arnore Nigrorum - " We must remember that these people had seldom seen gold ; that the greenback was the first thing they ever earned they could call their own , the first thing , save our flag , that stood before them a syml ) ol of their freedom . XYith it they soon learned a power to gather together long-broken families into a common happy home .

And now , at last , we come to an old , familiar friend , - the " blood-sealed greenback , " - and no single excerpt will suffice for the glories of the argumenturn a pueris in cwruleo yestiti8 - " Sir , you might have sent friend after friend down upon the bloody battle-fields , and each blue-coated boy there might have put his wife and children into that friend 's care , and said to him , When you go home , take care of them and see that they do not suffer . ' Yet there would have been a lingering doubt in the mind of that soldier that , because of other duties , those friends would not perform that mission .

Record , No. 55 , February 20 , 1874 . But according to these authorities , the greenback is not only good and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ payment is secured as is that of no other paper , however " giltedged . " Mr. Havens , of Missouri , in his enthusiasm declared that " every dollar of property in  --  the country is pledged for its redemption " ; and Mr. Aibright , of Pennsylvania , announced that a " government note is a mortgage upon every farm and every workshop in the country . " This proposition was very frequently advanced , and , at last , when put forward by Mr. Wilson of Indiana , led to the propounding of an obvious question , which brought forth a very characteristic reply from General Butler : - " All the property of the nation , all the wealth of the nation , all there is of this government , was saved by the greenback ; and behind the greenback is a pledge for its redemption in the taxes of the country , in the property of the country , and not alone in the gold of the country , which we of New En0land may have a little more of than some of the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

The process of foreclosure on some particular " farm or workshop , " by virtue of this pledge , might chance to be intricate ; but , after all this nonsense , it is refreshing to see a bubble pricked , as was this one , by Mr. Kasson of Iowa - " There is a short argument on this question . Suppose I owe to the most prominent unredeemable inflationist on this floor ten dollars .

Naturally , " greenbacks " approaching so very closely to that perfection which is never wholly attained , the use of specie came in for a suitable expression of contempt . The idea of specie payments was " a snare , ** " a * " a fallacy " ; a " fanaticism " which Mr. Morton , for instance , had suffered under pretty badly once , though " experience and the lapse of time had abated the violence of it in his case very materially .

" - Record , No. 89 , April 2 , 1874 . " Standing as we do , Mr. Speaker , on the eve of our centennial celebration , with a history and an experience peculiar and significant , it is not becoming in us to bend in humble adoration before the brazen god of gold This colossal idol , like the golden calf of old , must be shattered before we reach our Canaan .

Record , No. 55 , April 20 , 1874 . This idolatry of gold on the part of the minority finally became so scandalous that Mr. Logan felt obliged to remind the Senate , with great dignity , that " the people of this country do not worship gold , they worship their God , but they do use gold as a medium of exchange . " ( Record , No. 149 , June 12 , 1874 . ) It is sincerely to be hoped that the first half of this proposition is more correct than the last , but of its propriety and elevation of tone there can be no difference of opinion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Senator from Illinois is " perhaps as remarkable a man as any in our country . " Some profound comments were also elicited on the absurd value conventionally put upon gold , or , as Mr. Small of New Hampshire expressed it : - " What is gold ? In and of itself it is the most worthless of all the metals . " ( Record , No. 51 , // February 15 , 1874 . ) Nor did he stand alone in this estimate - " It is a popular error to suppose that gold is worth intrinsically anything like the value that is placed upon it conventionally by legal enactments and the consent of trading nations . In truth , intrinsically , gold is one of the least valuable of the metals . Conventionally , it is the most valuable . Take from it that conventional value placed upon it in use among men , and its value is very low in the scale of metals . Steel and zinc and tin and some of the other metals are intrinsically more valuable . " - MR . MELLISH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ January 11 , 1874 . " Is there any doubt that gold , as far as regards intrinsic value , is among the least valuable of all metals , being put to the fewest uses , except for the purpose of ornament l The Spartan was right when he made iron the currency on its intrinsic value . The only trouble was , it took a great deal to carry on the business ; and it would take a great deal in weight of gold to carry on business . We can not carry on even the business of this country in gold without an amount of gold greater than that which exists in the world . " - MR . BUTLER , OF MASSACHUSETTS . Record , No. 93 , April 7 , 1874 . And this idea of insufficiency was enforced in many quarters ; especially by Mr. Merriam of New York , who , in the same paragraph , charged it with the apparently inconsistent sins of insufficiency and redundance - " There is not gold enough in the world to transact the business of modern commerce ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gold has been the great inflationist , and unless we can shut up our mines , pouring a hundred millions annually into the lap of mankind , it will continue the great inflator ; and hateful as has been the word expansion , ' it will continue the great expansionist . ' Record , No. 85 , March 28 , 1874 . But the crimes of gold were not yet all enumerated . It was reserved for Mr. Sprague , of Rhode Island , to complete the list . The business firm of which that gentleman was a member had become insolvent during the crisis , and , like most men of broken fortune , Mr. Sprague took liberal views on all points of financial ethics . Wholly betraying the constituency which had the misfortune to be represented by him , in dogged , shame-faced silence he contented himself with a silent vote for any and // every measure looking to the national dishonor . In cruel compliment Mr. Ferry , of Michigan , had alluded to him as the one exception to the solid New England vote , and attributed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a " wise forecast , " the result of " mammoth business enterprises , " which led him to support " expansion . " ( Record , No. 70 , March 11 , 1874 . ) But at last Mr. Sprague broke through his wise rule of silence , and made , so far as the record shows , his single contribution to the long debate in these remarkable words : " Gold is the basis of monopoly . " ( Record , No. 150 , June 13 , 1874 , p. 54 . ) Truly , with Mr. Sprague silence was better than speech ! This line of reasoning as regards gold would have been incomplete had the selection of a universal measure of value on which to conduct the exchanges of the world not come in for its share of ridicule . " The money of the world " was thoroughly exposed . Mr. Bundy of Ohio had a friend who went to the exposition at Vienna ; in that city he found a community making use of a legal-tender currency even more depreciated than that of the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - " Another thing . They had a world 's fair and exposition over there in Vienna last summer . And they had a world 's currency ' there , too .

" - Record , No. 34 , January 27 , 1874. // But even before this lucid exposition Mr. Field of Michigan had struck these " foundations of eternal truth , " and given the coup de grace to the " money of the world " in the following " profound and original " reflections - " Some ignorant persons have a notion that money should be redeemed , and they call ours irredeemable currency ' and false promises to pay . ' Now , the power of transferring a debt from one to another is the true and only function of money . Who ever heard of English sovereigns or American eagles being redeemed in any other sense 3 Our greenbacks are in fact redeemed every day in effecting exchanges and in the payment of debts . Again , others , still more ignorant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world , - they never specify what world , nor do they describe the kind of money wanted , nor how Congress is to exercise its express powers to provide lawful money for other nations . If they mean gold coin , then what shall he done for China and the East Indies , containing probably one third of the whole population of the globe , and whose money consists solely of copper and silver 3 Our sentimental writers on finance should know that the lawful money of one nation becomes merchandise , like corn and pork , in another ; our gold coins , when shipped abroad , leave the country like other of our raw products , and bankers draw for the avails at sight . Such persons should also know that Congress can only provide money for the New World ; and that our national credit - the greenback - is the best lawful money for the people of the United States . " - Record , No. 21 , January 11 , 1874 . Of course , gold being so valueless , fluctuating , insufficient , superabundant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was inexplicable that it should in common opinion be valued more highly than a currency so infinitely preferable to it as " greenbacks . " This was attributed by all the authorities , from the versatile Morton to the unfortunate Mellish , to the fact that the government exacted its duties on imports , and paid the interest on its debt , in gold . The majority of Congress failed to grasp the idea that gold was a commodity in universal demand , and that however little we used it among ourselves , buy it we must with what we did use , if we did not propose to cease our dealings with the world . But let them speak for themselves ; according to them , all that was needed to destroy the market for gold was for the United States government wholly to ignore it : - // " The interest upon the public debt must be paid in coin , and , to procure that , duties upon imports are made payable in coin . If we had no public debt , or if the interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be collected in greenbacks ; and there can be no doubt that they would be of the full value of gold . But while importers must procure about one hundred and seventy millions of gold annually with which to pay duties , there will be a strong demand for it in the market , and gold will be at a premium . " - SENATOR MORTON , OF INDIANA . Record , No. 79 , March 24 , 1874 . " My view is , if the government would put an end to the traffic in gold by no longer employing many thousands of merchants in New York and elsewhere to supply through customs the gold that is necessary for the government wants , and let the government issue its paper a full legal tender , and then , as sole purchaser of coin , provide itself for public necessities , there would then be so little demand for coin and no competition in the market , the premium would disappear . " - SENATOR FERRY , or MiCHIGAN . Record , No. 77 , March 11 , 1874 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strike from the laws the words except duties on imports , ' and make government money receivable for all dues to government and to individuals alike . Do you desire to see the currency at par with gold l You will not see it as long as the government dishonors its own currency , by making it a legal tender to the citizens , and refusing it for dues to itself Relieve the merchants of the necessity of buying gold to pay duties , and that day the occupation of the Wall Street gold kings , like Othello 's , is gone . Gold , being no longer needed for individual purposes , or by government save to pay interest , would cease to be in demand , and the whole coin of the country would be upon the market without buyers . It must of necessity therefore fall to par , and if we continue this course , would remain so forever . The amount of coin needed to pay interest would be largely supplied by the mines and receipts from abroad . If more were needed , let it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the merciless claws of the speculators and the burden of high interest , and their exports will soon take care of foreign balances . " Mr. President , the day we take the step I have indicated , that day we shall proclaim a new Declaration of Independence , - a declaration of the independence of our industries from the effects of our own money-changers and combiners , ' and of foreign intermeddlers with our currency . Let a dollar mean a dollar , and not a promise to pay a dollar . " - SENATOR GORDON , OF GEORGIA . Record , No. 32 , January 24 , 1874. // " The way to return to specie payments , that is , to make a paper dollar equivalent in purchasing power to a dollar in gold , - a consummation most devoutly to be wished , is to make gold an article that is not sought for .

The time is in the near future when we shall be imperial in every respect . " - MR . MELLiSH , OF Nxw YORK . Record , No. 62 , March 1,1874 . There were , however , two points throughout this debate which gave the majority infinite trouble : the one was that all* human experience was against them ; the other , that all human authority was against them . Their method of dealing with these difficulties had the full flavor of the debate , and its daring patriotism can not but excite the admiration of a distant posterity . Take the lessons of history first , and deal with them chronologically . In the course of his speech of 25th February , Mr. Schurz had made a very happy quotation from Marco Polo , showing the use and abuse of paper-money far back in the centuries . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself to thus hoist the engineer with his own petard : - " I do not go to Chinese classics for my theory of currency ; I do not desire to adopt their theory , nor does any one else that I know of ; and if the Chinese , as he asserts , tried paper-money a thousand years ago and then returned to specie , and specie alone , without having any other circulating medium but that , we have in their present condition an evidence of the result . What is it l Isolated from the world , idolaters , semi-barbarous , governed by superstition , less enlightened and less advanced to-day than they were in the days of Confucius , their only ambition when they come into enlightened nations being to wash clothes and become menial servants to others . If the credulous old Venetian is correct , then the example is against the theory of the Senator from Missouri and not in support of it . But will he compare the money of China in the thirteenth century , based on nothing but the will of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best government in the world 1 lie may do // it , sir ; but the people will not agree with him . " - Record , No. 79 , March 21 , 1874 . Next came the " South Sea Bubble , " which Mr. Merriam of New York closed out of the case thus peremptorily : - " Is it in sincerity and honesty that intelligent men point us to the South Sea Bubble , ' and tell us to beware , when the great power of our currency is based upon a necessity for its use and in the mutual confidence of honorable men , without which there is no possibility of extended commerce , which is one of the master glories of civilization ? " - Record , No. 85 , March 28 , 1874 . Then came the French assignats which Messrs . Bundy and Mellish exposed with much historical acumen : - " Gentlemen have also referred to the French assignats . But they were founded upon what ? Upon nothing , as it turned out . They had no government support , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the property of the Church and the property of the emigrant nobles . Not only that , but the government that issued those obligations undertook to confiscate man of his immortality , the universe of its God . " Here the hammer fell. - Record , No. 95 , April 9 , 1874 . " The French assignats are thrust into the argument by the bullionists , apparently in ignorance of their real nature and the anomalous circumstances under which they were created ; as though there was any resemblance between the condition and government of our country now and of France at the time they were issued I In point of fact there was no sovereignty in France competent to sell and convey title to the property they had covered with assignats . If the power that issued them had acquired authority , the property could and probably would have been sold , and the asdgnats , that were a lien upon it , might have been good . But the assignats failed to have any value , because the government that issued them failed to have any power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1874 . Upon which last extracts , as indeed upon much of this discussion , a somewhat instructive light is thrown by this excerpt from one of Mirabeau 's speeches in the French Assembly , which was quoted by Mr. Mitchell of Wisconsin : - " It is vain to assimilate assignats secured on the solid basis of these domains to an ordinary paper currency possessing a forced circulation . They represent real property , the most secure of all pos // sessions , the land on which we tread . Why is a metallic circulation solid 3 Because it is based on subjects of real and durable value as is the land which is directly or indirectly the source of all wealth . Paper-money we are told will become superabundant ; it will drive the metallic out of circulation : Of what paper do you speak 3 If of paper without a solid basis , undoubtedly ; if of one based on the firm foundation of landed property , never . There can not be a greater error than the terrors so generally prevalent as to the over issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your debts , pay your troops , advance the revolution . Reabsorbed progressively in the purchase of the national domains , this paper-money can never become redundant any more than the humidity of the atmosphere can become excessive which descends in rills , finds the river , and is at length lost in the mighty ocean . ' It must apparently be confessed that , so far as security was concerned , as compared with " greenbacks , " the a8signats had the best of it . Finally the experience of the Confederate States money was one day referred ' to by Mr. Chandler of Michigan . This was too much for the patriotism of Mr. Logan , and the bird of liberty fairly danced and yelled . It will be noticed that Mr. Logan 's wrath was too much for his English , and at the close of his remarks he slightly confused the attributes of his mind with those of an irredeemable paper-money - " Mr. LOGAN . I must say that I am very much surprised to see the war Senator , as he was termed not many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the faith of this nation had been tried and the people tested it , to-day comparing our notes with Confederate notes . Does he suppose that he can palm off any such sophistry as that upon an intelligent people 3 Does he not know that the Confederate money was based upon a prospective government , and the moment the government was on the decline the money must decline , - the very moment the government collapsed the money could not be worth the paper it was written on 3 Does he not know that ; and does he stand here to-day in the presence of an intelligent community to compare the notes of a collapsed government and their depreciation with those of a competent , stable government like ours , whose notes have hot been depreciated on account of want of faith in the government 3 Great heavens ! if we have come to this kind of argumentation on the side of the bullionists , or the side of the contractionists , on the side // of the rich against the muscle and energy of the country , that they must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pride of the world , against the notes of a confederate collapsed government , I am ashamed of my country if such stuff as this should be received by even a man that was depreciated in intellect . " - Record , No. 55 , February 20 , 1874 . Having thus disposed of all human experience , it only remained for the infiationists to dispose of all human authority . In this field they only can do justice to themselves , - their ravings were simply incredible : " An attempt is made to hind up and fetter its this country 's expanding energies and prospects with Old World theories and methods . As well attempt to put baby-clothes upon the statue of Hercules . Such men judge our country by the Old World standards . Sitting upon the steps of our national Capitol , they look up the stream of time , study the inscriptions upon the Pyramids , and the financial theories of China , and call it learning But some nations still stand out and cling to gold and silver as the only safe and respectable medium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ path of time generally far in the rear of their more enlightened , wealthy , and prosperous neighbors. " - SENATOR MORTON , or INDIANA . Record , No. 79 , March 24 , 1874 . " Mr. President , an abundance of money , plenty of money , does produce enterprise , prosperity , and progress . There is no sort of doubt about that . Now , I put aside all these old theories .

I know he can do that . But after he has stated all these commonplaces of the books , these platitudes of finance , has given us the metaphysics of finance , there is no vitality in them .

Record , No. 26 , January 17 , 1874 . " I believe that the great error of the present moment is the tendency of men to rely upon what are declared or have been declared to be principles with reference to other countries and other conditions of peoples , not applicable at this time to ourselves . I should like to borrow , as an illustration or example of what I have in mind , one of // the greatest questions ever put to mankind , by Colburn , in his First Lessons of Intellectual Arithmetic , ' to the child : How many thumbs have you on your right hand l " - SENATOR BOUTWELL , OF MAssAcHUSETTS .

This last censure was , however , a little too sweeping for Mr. Kelley , who could not help calling to the speaker : " You ought to except Henry C. Carey 's work on Political Economy " ; which Mr. Bundy forthwith proceeded to do . The late Sydney Smith was one day alluded to , but he was incontinently stigmatized as an " old Englishman , " an " English Tory , " who had gone over the " argument to depreciate American institutions , " and was incontinently hustled out of doors . But they had not done with Englishmen ; Mr. Sherwood , of Ohio , next took them in hand : - " Our own country , in war and peace , for the past ten years has been conducted in defiance of every principle of military strategy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after ten years of substantial and healthful growth in invention , in manufactures , in material wealth , in population , in moral grandeur , what do all the books of all the Englishmen amount to I " The Declaration of Independence was not written in accordance with English precedent ; and when the young Republic was started , as a feeble contribution to a new system of political economy , there was no celebrated Englishman to give it a send-off , or a godsend , with a book . And to-day , with nearly a century of successful history behind us , - a century born the year Adam Smith sent into the world his Wealth of Nations , ' - how marvellous it is that not one Englishman has fortified the Republic with a book . And yet we have not seriously felt the loss // " Daring the progress of this debate all history has been ransacked by contractionists for evidence to fortify their positions .

But Mr. Coburn , of Indiana , alone dealt with this subject of authorities with any true genius . He did not destroy them ; he did better , he appropriated - them . He thus pre-empted Mr. Webster - " The world does move and change , but those who quote Webster and the old statesmen v*ho died before these astounding steps of progress do the grossest injustice in their attempts to apply their mere arguments as to the policy of their times to ours . The Webster of to-day would not be found among the pinching and grinding contractionists ; his grand soul would have risen to the height of the great argument for progressive financial management .

He was laid in his honored grave before the great events I have named had their inception . " - Record , No. 95 , April 7,1874 . But the tricks the inflationist gentlemen played with history were not confined to assertions of what might have been . They tampered as freely with facts , as they proposed to do with contracts . Take the following examples : " The Bank of England suspended specie payment for twenty-four years following her continental wars , and issued bank-notes , which were accepted as lawful monoy and a legal tender for public and private purposes . " - SENATOR FERRY , OF MIcmGAN . Record , No. 4 , December 5 , 1873 . The battle of Waterloo closed the continental wars in June , 1815 ; in August , 1819 , the Bank of England notes were at par with gold , and have remained so from that time to this . General B. F. Butler , also , asserted that " since 1843 , and after breaking all the merchants , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ payments , - in 1848 , in 1857 , and in 1866 . " This statement was not , it is true , made in the debate , but for ignorance and recklessness was worthy of it . The following , however , is a startling bit of information for the benefit of all future writers on British finance - " Great Britain did what the men who control the affairs of this nation seem incapable of doing . Her statesmen , in grappling with a great debt , the fruit of nearly half a century of war , did not hesitate to reduce the interest on her public debt when that debt was found oppressive to her people . Capitalists had driven her to hard bargains in the hour of her extremity . She had issued bonds at as high as six per cent , and she reduced the interest to an average of three per cent , and her consols ( consolidated annuities ) to this day express the views of her statesmen as to what a nation should do when the question was presented of dividing the burdens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - MR . HOLMAN , OF INDIANA . Record , No. 95 , April 9 , 1874 . This article must , however , be brought to a close , leaving by much the larger portion of the material gathered for it wholly unused and forever buried in the Congressional Record . As one final example , - as an acme of cant , ignorance , bad logic , and worse taste , - as an illustration of that which has made our Congressional oratory a byword and a laughing-stock , - it may be well to close with this truly patriotic effusion of the most active and earnest of all the friends of " cheap money , - Senator Ferry , of Michigan . Herein the depths are sounded : - " We know that wages are lower in Europe than in America . We know that more men are compelled there to work for low wages than are here employed .

That this mass of toilers are poorly paid and provided for by weekly , monthly , or yearly stipend , with no thought but work and pay , and the supply of both provided by the // credit of employers , who are the financial centres of those laboring retinues , and use vastly less money than credit , is also well known .
