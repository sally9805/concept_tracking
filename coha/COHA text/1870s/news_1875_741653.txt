txt Our Democratic friends are forecasting the future with considerable hopefulness , and they find no difficulty iu figuring for themselves a clear majority m the Electoral College next year , and a popular majority which will astonish the oldest political inhabitant . We concede that they have excellent groun d for encouragement . They won a signal victory along nearly the whole lino last Autumn . They carried twenty-three out of the then thirty-seven states , and Colorado , which has since been made a State . On a total vote reaching within less than one hundred thousand of the Presidential vote in l872 , they managed to get a popular majority of 372,000 . They secured a large working majority in the House of Representatives . They have , therefore , the prestige of success , which promises a good deal in uncertain times , and they have , what would be the most valuable acquisition possible to a party of real strength and sound principles ? an opportunity to show the country that they are worthy of its confidence . We are not at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that they should count on seeing the country do as much for them next year as it did last . But they may , nevertheless , be disappointed ; and we no more consider the Republican Party given ovi ? . to its boastful opponents than we consider its future a proper subject for foolish security . Iu many regards the Democratic Party is in a worse condition , and the Republican Party in a better one , than a year since , and the chances are that the Republican prospects will improve , and the Democratic prospects grow less encouraging . Some of the keenest observers among the Democratic leaders have placed themselves on record as regarding the victory of last year as a chance one . In fact , they admit that though it was a defeat for the Republican Party , it was not a Democratic triumph . In other words the Democratic majorities were obtained by the votes of men who opposed the Republican Party temporarily , and who are as likely to return to that party as to continue to act with the Democrats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the causes which estranged them from their Republican associates are removed , and how far their new associations are made attractive to them . It is not a difficult task to seo what the tendency of events has been with reference to these contingencies . Whatever was calculated to alienate or discontent sincere Republicans a year ago exists now in a far less degree . We do not need to go into the details of the causes of alienation . Some were of a general , some of a specific character ; some related to the actual policy of the party , some to personal influences within it . But of whatever variety they may have been , no candid politician will deny that they have been greatly diminished . The feeling in regard to a possible third term for the President , for instance , was unquestionably a potent source of disaffection  --  unnecessarily so no doubt , but actual nevertheless . It no longer exists . With a fidelity to its , convictions , and a candor which reminds all Republicans of its palmjest days , the Republican Party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President instantly embraced the opportunity to set all doubts concerning it at rest . The Democrats are making desperate efforts to keep alive the discussion which they had found so profitable . But it is of no use . They will gain no more votes on that score , and they had hotter turn , if they can , to more substantial means of promoting their fortunes . Other questions , not unlike that of the third term , and involving prominent members of the party councils , have been as completely disposed of . It is clear that to any Republican , having the purposes and principles of the party at heart , the alternative of leaving the party no longer presents itself . More good can be done in the party than out of it now . There is no room for doubt on that point . But while obstructions to the cordial cooperation of Republicans with their party have been taken away , how is it with the Democratic Party ? Is its fold any more inviting now than it was a year ago I Is it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it likely to be in this regard a year from now I Tho answers to these questions are not far to seek . The Democratic Party is in ? by no means so good a position to retain its momentary recruits as it was . It laid hold on power with a velvet glove , but the rapacious iron hand has shown itself very Ireqeently during the past nine months . It has done nothing to show its fitness for the work of national . reform , and much to awaken distrust . The character of some of its most conspicuous selections for the United . States Senate and its conduct of several of the most important State Governments , of which it has hind the administration , have told heavily against it . And the more closely it approaches a national canvass , the more evident it appears that on one question of supreme interest  --  that of finance ? it is hopelessly divided , with many chances of predominance in laver of the repudiationists and inflationists . The situation , so far as the Republican Party is concerned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ require their best efforts to win , and with their best efforts they call win . They have made a good beginning- in Pennsylvania and Ohio . But much of flue most necessary work is not to be done in State conventions . It must be done in th ? minor branches of the party organization . It must bo done by the careful development of the local associations , opening them to the active co-operation of all members of the party , and by the conduct of local nominations enlisting the confidence of the community where it is most actively concerned . That is - the plain work of the coming canvass , and it ' it is properly done it will go tar toward making the Republican Party a compact , powerful , and resistless organization next year . The general aims of the party are now well determined ; its position with reference to national and general State issues is sound and advantageous ; good faith and good judgment in its local organization will assure it success .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
