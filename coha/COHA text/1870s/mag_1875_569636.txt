ARTICLE 111. - THE PARDONING POWER . IT is sometimes a comforting thought that in all the actions of our daily lives we are working out the laws of nature . We seem obliged to act on settled principles , whether we have any or not . We may be , and perhaps generally are , quite blind to the nature of our acts ; we may even refuse to think what we are doing ; and yet we are all the time fulfilling the divine plan . It is even possible for people to deny the existence of the very principle that their deeds ilustrate and make plain to everybody else . No one would maintain that it was possible to have sunshine without having shadow ; but many persons seem disposed to maintain an equally absurd proposition , that there should be no such thing as punishment , although their every-day experience might have taught them better . The whole world has borne punishment in childhood ; the greater part are or will be parents and inflict punishment . And in the exercise of the inalienable right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of punishment will present itself . Whatever may be the theories of the parent or the teacher , they will alike find that punishment in some form is not to be separated from government . It may be nothing but negative punishment , the withholding of reward or praise , nothing even but a frown or a grieved look ; but it is punishment , if it is meant to cause certain acts to be followed by more pain or less pleasure than others ; the result being , of *urse , that the motives for avoiding such acts become more powerful . The real hardship and practical difficulty of punishment is that it is painful not only to the guilty but to the innocent . This is the ground of the common confusion of thought on this matter , and the explanation of that sentimental tenderness of heart , which is , as Mill says , " little better than a timid shrinking from the infliction of anything like pain , next neighbor to the cowardice which shrinks from necessary endurance of it . " Doubtless there is much scepticism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his teacher , as he inflicts chastisement , " I // do it for your good ; " " You will live to thank me for this flogging ; " " I tell you every blow gives me more pain than it does you . " But the teacher is right after all . At least he should feel as he says he does ; although it is very true that many , perhaps most of those who inflict punishment , do it hastily . Too often with parents as well as teachers it is a word and a blow . It is little more than a gratification of anger or revenge . Probably in our own experience we have found how hard it is to refrain from punishing when we are indignant at an offense ; and how hard it is to punish when our wrath has cooled . But it must be maintained , in opposition to blind fury on the one hand and to morbid sensitiveness on the other , that it is wrong to punish in anger when it is easy , and it is right and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is , however , a silver lining to this dark cloud . The disagreeable duty of punishment may be often relieved by the exercise of pardon ; and the relief is great to both parties . Every one can recollect how when a child he was burdened with a sense of guilt , often with a fear of punishment added , and how his heart was in a moment lightened as he saw the frown on his father 's face give place to a forgiving smile . Perhaps no pleasure since then has been so keen or so pure . And on the father 's part the relief is even greater , for to inflict punishment on his child is to inflict pain on himself for no ill desert of his own . His anger is gone , the offender is his child and dear to him , a thousand extenuating circumstances occur to him , there is the penitent face , the pleading eye , and it seems not only pleasant but noble to pardon . " The quality of mercy is not strained ; " It droppeth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beneath : it is twice blessed ; " It blesseth him that gives and him that takes . " T is mightiest in the mightiest ; it becomes " The throned monarch better than his crown ; " His sceptre shows the force of temporal power , " The attribute to awe and majesty , " Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings ; " But mercy is above this sceptred sway ; " It is enthroned in the hearts of kings ; " It is an attribute to God himself " And earthly power doth then show likest God 's , " When mercy seasons justice . " Merchant of Venice , Act IV , Sc . // Now it seems the most natural thing in the world to transfer this generous feeling about pardon to other cases than those which have been mentioned as examples . About Christmas time , when we think of God 's forgiving love toward us , when our hearts are warmed with love toward all men , when we have , in short , a general overflow of good feeling , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actual virtue of the Governor 's pardon graciously extended to some deserving convict . We read the account of the uniform good conduct of the prisoner , of the long years he has spent in jail , of his surprise as he hears his name called out , his utter astonishment as he sees the formal document produced ; we see him overwhelmed and broken down by sudden joy as the thought of freedom , home , friends , flashes upon him ; we follow him in thought to his meeting with the aged mother , whose gray hairs shall now go down with gladness instead of sorrow to the grave ; with the wife , just now worse than widowed , and the children , worse than fatherless , now all restored and united in happiness ; and we are hard-hearted indeed if our lips do not tremble a little , and our eyes for a moment grow dim . Surely if one pardon can cause so much happiness , it were a pity that there are not more . Yet if we reflect sufficiently , we must be reluctantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from being a blessing , is a curse . As most of us have learned in our first experience with the poor , the charitable deeds that filled us with pleasure as we performed them were often an injury to those whom we meant to benefit , and a cause of subsequent grief to ourselves . Where we thought to relieve suffering we increased laziness , when we had sent away one full , we were visited by a dozen empty , when we had given what we could spare to those who did not deserve it , we were obliged to let the worthy suffer unrelieved . It is a fact none the less true because it is painful , horrible as it may seem to the sentimental view , that our good impulses must be checked and held under by reason , or they will certainly cause more suffering than good , not only to others but to ourselves . We shall find , if we have patience to listen to reason , that our feelings , by their impetuosity , have hurried us over an important // line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought of the child and the good results of pardoning him , and we leaped at once to the conclusion that the same good results might be expected from pardoning the criminal . The one has broken the commands of his father , the other has broken the commands of the State ; nothing is more natural than to say that like treatment will lead to like results , the cases being similar . rrhe cases , however , are not similar , and it is of the utmost importance that the difference between them be clearly understood . First , the relations of the offense to the offender . The father knows the disposition of the child . He is able to see when punishment should be inflicted and when it would do more harm than good . He can tell when it has endured long enough to accomplish its purpose . He can so explain the nature of the offense to the child , that punishment may be replaced by pardon , with the full assurance that the offense will not be repeated . Secondly , as to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( Where other persons are involved , the case comes to resemble that of the State and the criminal , and the difficulty of remitting punishment is seriously increased . ) Here the father can explain to the injured ones the penitence of the offender , and assure them that they will have no cause to regret leniency ; and can at the same time explain to all , the nature of the wrong done and its consequences , so that the thought of pardon will not lessen their resistance to temptation . In all these cases the justification of the pardon is of course the fact that punishment has really in some way been inflicted ; the painful consequences of the offense have been made clear . In not one of these conditions can the State occupy the place of a father . It does not know the disposition of the criminal ; it can not see when the character would be more benefited by pardon than by punishment ; it can not tell when penitence has been secured ; it can not be sure that pardon will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this as too sweeping an assertion , at least it can not be denied that the knowledge of the State in these respects must be extremely imperfect . But it would make no difference if the State were able to judge in the first class of relations as clearly as the father ; in the second class , the relations of the offense to the community , it is in the // nature of the case impossible . A family of a dozen persons may be regulated by one parent , but the thorough knowledge which he possesses , through personal acquaintance with the character of every member , can not be possessed by the State , or by any number of officers of the State , under any concewable circumstances . This is the fundamental difference in the two cases . The object of the State in punishing is to a very small extent the good of the individual ; it is the good of the whole community . It is well that the criminal himself should be convinced that the consequences of his crime are painful and the crime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is of far greater importance that all men who may be tempted to commit that crime should have clear ideas of the pain which they will be likely to suffer . Now to hope to explain to that unknown multitude , the future criminal offenders , a large part of *rhom can not read  --  to hope to explain to this class the grounds of pardon , in such a way that they will be more inclined than before to shun the crime , is to indulge a hope discouraged by experience as well as reason . Of course , it is not meant to assert that the State does not , in the opinion of many , occupy the place of parent toward its subjects . After many centuries of tribulation , the idea has been beaten into the heads of most men , that the religious beliefs of its subjects can not be regulated by the State with much sviccess ; and that however abominable heresy may be , the inquisition is a worse evil . Still there is quite a number of persons , it appears , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amended so as to provide for the existence of God . It would be foolish to suppose that we have fully grasped the magnitude of the differeuce between democratical and monarchical government . If we may reason from the pride our wealthy fellow citizens seem to take in displaying helmets and coronets upon their coach panels , ( a pride that took on an air of burlesque when Mr. Tweed ornamented his property with the Tweeddale arms , ) there is still a good deal of reverence felt for antiquity . The thought of being descended from persons who really existed three or four hundred years ago , is still enough to dazzle many an upright and clear-headed luau ; and few of the sternest democrats can behold for the first time a real , // genuine king , the titled representative of ages of royalty , without having to struggle against the feeling that there is in him something more than in ordinary flesh and blood . " Not all the water in the rough , rude sea " Can wash the balm from an anointed king . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elected by the Lord ; " For every man that Bolingbroke hath pressed , " To lift shrewed steel against our golden crown , " God for his Richard hath in heavenly pay " A glorious angel we thought ourselves thy lawful king ; " And if we be , how dare thy joints forget " To pay their awful duty to our presence ? " If we be not , show us the hand of God " That hath dismissed us from our stewardship ; " For well we know , no hand of blood or bone " Can gripe the sacred handle of our sceptre , " Unless he do profane , steal , or usurp. " my Master , God omnipotent , " Is mustering in his clouds , on our behalf , " Armies of pestilence ; and they shall strike " Your children yet unborn , and unbegot , " That lift your vassal hands against my head , And threat the glory of my precious crown. ** - King Richard II , Act III , Sc . 2 and 3 . It is only by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tear from our minds this inveterate tradition that rulers are superior beings , and state clearly to ourselves the fact , that in this country , however it may elsewhere be , the State is nothing but the people , who have agreed upon certain rules as necessary to protect themselves against the selfishness of the evildisposed among mankind ; and the government nothing but the men chosen by the people to see that such new rules are made as are necessary and to enforce whatever rules are made . Perhaps to a people as sensible of the humorous as the Yankees are , the real difference between a monarchy and a democracy is brought out clearly enough , when we compare the ideas excited by the royal pardon as we imagine it conferred by the chivalric princes that figure in Scott 's novels , and those aroused by the spectacle of Andy Johnson , in the exercise of his sovereign pre . roc*ittive , dispensing free grace to all counterfeiters , or President // Grant forgiving those sweet offenders , the introducers of obscene articles into girls ' schools . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the idea of a governor of Louisiana pardoning a plunderer of the public treasury , or a governor of Georgia pardoning a forger of railroad bonds , it will be hard not to admit that this " gracious prerogative " belongs to a different age and a different theory of government from our own . But if we abandon the paternal theory of government , and look on the State as a mere business organization of the people to secure protection in pursuits not injurious to the common welfare , does it follow that the pardoning power must also be abandoned ? On this theory there is no room for sentiment . It is the business of the State to accomplish its purpose in the most efficient manner . Of course , no wrong act is to be committed under the pretence of good ends , but also no act that may not seem wrong is to be done unless it conduce to the ends for which the State exists . Now it is useless for human beings to try to give to actions their proper reward . However prone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authority , either in reason or revelation , for supposing that we are competent to the task . We are all sinners and unfit to sit in judgment ; that is the prerogative of the Searcher of Hearts and of Him alone . But what men can and must do , if they would preserve their lives , is to say of certain acts , they shall not be done . If they are done , we will make it so unpleasant for the doer that he will not be likely to do them again ; and we will let this be so widely known that all other men , when tempted to these acts , will be likely to be discouraged from doing them by thinking of the disagreeable consequences . In short , we must recur to the idea with which we started , and regard punishment inflicted by the State as whatever consequence appointed by law to an act tends to deter men from committing that act . If it were found that men were more effectually than in any other way kept from crime , by giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothing them in broadcloth rather than in parti-colored gar. ments , and lodging them in dwellings of brown stone and plate glass in place of granite and iron , it would not only be allowable , but right to so treat them ; the experiment , however , has // been recently tried in New York City and has been abandoned as a failure . In order , therefore , to find out whether it is the business of the State to grant pardons , we have only to answer the question : " Does the granting of pardons tend to encourage crime , or to deter from crime ? Does the remission of punishment increase the good effects of punishment , or does it lessen those effects ? " These questions may be answered in two ways ; by showing the necessary conditions of effective punishment , and by observing the effect of pardon on those conditions . The first condition is that the penalty be suited to the offense , or , to speak precisely , that the offender have no reasonable ground for thinking himself unjustly treated ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This suggests the answer to a question that may arise : " If the end of punishment is simply to deter , and not to reward men for their acts according to abstract justice , why not employ torture and hanging for every crime ? " According to tradition , Draco , an early law-giver of Athens , attempted to inflict punishment in this manner , but without success . Certain acts cause far more suffering and injury than others and it is therefore necessary to discourage them by severer penalties . Whether men regard punishment as the proper reward of crime in itself , or as meant to deter from crime , they will feel the inequity of making all penalties equal . When one man commits a murder with the grossest cruelty and is hung for it , and another man is hung for entering a house and stealing five shillings , it is clear that the latter can have no good opinion of the law . His own outraged feelings would not be of so much importance , as he is to be hung and will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are to be considered . In England , within fifty years there were nearly thirty offenses punishable with death , and the natural result was a hatred of the law and a general sympathy among the lower classes with criminals . Not having attained to the height of seeing that all sin is equally blameworthy , men reasoned : * Here is murder , a great crime , punished with death , and stealing , a little crime , pnnished with death . So then this power that makes the laws does not see any difference between murder and stealing . If that is justice , I 'll none of it . " All men , // however low , have reason and conscience , and no man commits a crime without in some way jnstifying himself . No really bad man believes himself to be thoroughly bad ; as soon as he does he is on the way to be a good man . He will allow that he did wrong , that he committed a crime , but he will invariably point to some justification of his act . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in secret , or else he is penitent and no longer thoroughly bad . Now whatever justification the man may find , it should be nothing in the laws . If the laws are not just , the criminal at once becomes a martyr . If any man or class of men feel oppressed by the law , all the real power of the law is gone . All the punishment in the world will then produce nothing but anger and bitterness , and the ferocious spirit of revenge that has been so strikingly displayed in Ireland , supposed in England to be due to the ineradicable savageness of the Irish race , until improved laws caused the disappearance of the evil . In a word , where punishment seems unjust to the offender , the thought of it , instead of deterring him from crime , has the opposite effect ; it exasperates him and drives him desperate . The " dangerous classes " are not really dangerous until they come to believe that the laws are directed against them and not against all offenders of whatever rank ; then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as hostile , and the natural instinct of self-defense drives them to revenge . In general , there must be the same relation in the popular mind between penalties as between offenses . If one crime is commonly looked on as twice as bad as another , the punishment should be twice as severe , so near as can be estimated . Of course , there may be cases where the laws are ahead of the people , or more often where the people are ahead of the laws , but these are only the unavoidable errors belonging to a state of progress . A second and still more important condition of the efficacy of punishment is certainty . Frequent changes in the punishment of the same offense have a most pernicious effect ; in fact , the very same effect as is produced by the meddling of Congress with the standard of value , a spirit of speculation . The law is to the common mind a standard of right and wrong , and right and wrong are reverenced as eternal principles . But if the law can and does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time and at another letting it go unpunished , the foundations of morality are shaken . The criminal will reason with himself that if an act is not always punished it can not be always wrong , and he will very logically go further and say that some acts that are now punished probably do not deserve punishment . If the law is guided by no fixed standard , then it is no guide for him . He can not understand the special reasons that may seem good ground for making an exception in a particular case . All he knows is that one man was punished and another who did the same thing was pardoned ; and so there is a chance for him to escape , if he violates the law . Offer an inveterate drunkard a glass of liquor . At the sight of it his fearful thirst rises like a giant . Say to him , " Do you not know that this liquor means certain death to you ? " He will reply , " Yes , I know that if I do not stop drinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I must drink . " " You can not help it ? " " No , I can not , the appetite is too strong . " But pour a dose of strychnine into the liquor and offer it to him . The case is altered . He says no longer , " I can not help drinking it , " but , " I can not drink it . " Certain death was to be the result in both cases , but clearly the conviction of certainty was stronger in the latter case . And just this conviction of the certainty of punishment it is of the highest impurtance to establish in the mind of every one tempted to crime . It is not enough that there be a very high degree of probability of the execution of the law , for men will run almost any risk if there is a chance of escape . There is a very high degree of probability that no lottery ticket will draw a prize , but the gambling spirit is so strong in men that even churches , disregarding the laws of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ income ; while some governments establish lotteries as a judicious mode of taxing their subjects . If there is but one chance in a hundred of escape , men will go through fire and water and perform prodigies of valor ; but if there is absolutely no chance , it is not every day that a Marcus Curtius or an Arnold Winkelried will be found . Now there will always be crimes , because there will always be more or less chance of escape from detection and punishment . But for the State to do or allow anything that tends to make punishment more uncertain than it unavoidably // is , is to deliberately tie its own hands , to lay obstacles in its own path , to handicap itself for the race . There are other conditions of effective punishment besides these two , equal treatment of criminals and certainty , but these are the necessary conditions . It is plain that an irresponsible pardoning power , acting under no law but the pleasure of an individual , is not a part of either of these conditions . We may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these conditions , and others that may incidentally present themselves , in a more specific manner ; and to examine the arguments that are employed to justify the existence of this power . Let us begin by taking the opinions of Beccaria , of Blackstone , and of Kent , n the order in which they were given . Beccaria says : " As punishment becomes more mild , clemency and pardon are less necessary . Happy the nation in which they will be considered as dangerous . " " Clemency , which has often been deemed a sufficient substitute for every other virtue in sovereigns , should be excluded in perfect legislation , where punishments are mild and the proceedings in criminal cases regular and expeditious . This truth will seem cruel to those who live in countries where , from the absurdity of the laws and the severity of punishments , pardons and the clemency of the prince are necessary . It is indeed one of the noblest prerogatives of the throne , but at the same time a tacit disapprobation of the laws . Clemency is a virtue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the laws ; a virtue which ought to shine in the code and not in private judgment . To show mankind that crimes are sometimes pardoned , and punishment is not the necessary consequence , is to nourish the flattering hope of impunity and is the cause of their considering every punishment inflicted as an act of inj ustice and oppression . The prince , in pardoning , gives np the public security in favor of an individual and by his illjudged benevolence proclaims a public act of impunity . Let the executors of the laws be inexorable , but let the legislator be tender , indulgent , and humane A small crime is sometimes pardoned , if the person offended chooses to forgive the offender . This may be an act of good nature and humanity , but it is contrary to the good of the public ; for although a private citizen may dispense with satisfaction for the injury he // has received , he can not remove the necessity of example . The right of punishing belongs n ) t to any individual in particular but to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ renounce his own portion of this right , but can not give up that of others . " Blackstone 's comments on this subject are as follows : - - . The last and surest resort is in the king 's most gracious pardon ; the granting of which is the most amiable prerogative of the crown . Laws ( says an able writer ) can not be founded on principles of compassion to guilt ; yet justice , by the constitution of England , is bound to be administered in mercy ; this is promised by the king in his coronation oath , and it is that act of his government which is the most personal and most entirely his own . The king himself condemns no man ; that rugged task he leaves to his courts of justice ; the great operation of his sceptre is mercy This is indeed one of the great advantages of monarchy in general above any other form of government ; that there is a magistrate who has it in his power to extend mercy wherever he thinks it is deserved ; holding a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rigor of the general law in such criminal cases as merit an exemption from punishment Pardons , according to some theorists ( Beccaria ) , should be excluded in perfect legislation , where punishments are mild but certain ; for that the clemency of the prince seems a tacit disapprobation of the laws . But the exclusion of pardons must necessarily introduce a very dangerous power in the judge or jury , that of construing the criminal law by the spirit instead of the latter ; or else it must be holden , what no man will seriously allow , that the situation and circumstances of the offender ( though they alter not the essence of the crime ) ought to make no distinction in the punishment . In democracies , however , this power of pardon can never subsist ; for there nothing higher is acknowledged than the magistrate who administers the laws ; and it would be impolitic for the power of judging and of pardoning to centre in one and the same person . This ( as the prudent Montesquieu observes ) would oblige him very often to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it would tend to confound all ideas of right among the mass of the people ; as they would find it // difficult to tell whether a prisoner were discharged by his innocence or obtained a pardon through favor . In Holland , therefore , if there be no stadtholder there is no power of pardoning lodged in any other member of the State . But in monarchies the king acts in a superior sphere ; and though he regulates the whole government as the first mover , yet he does not appear in any of the disagreeable or invidious parts of it . Whenever the nation see him personally engaged , it is only in works of legislature , magnificence , or compassion . To him , therefore , the people look up as the fountain of nothing but bounty and grace ; and these repeated acts of goodness coming immediately from his own hand endear the sovereign to his subjects and contribute more than anything to root in their hearts that filial affection and personal loyalty which are the sure establishment of a prince . " The prevailing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beccaria has contended that the power of pardon does not exist under a perfect administration of law , and that the admission of the power is a tacit acknowledgment of the infirmity of the course of justice . And where is the administration of justice , it may be asked , that is free from infirmity ? Were it possible in every instance to maintain a just proportion between the crime and the penalty , and were the rules of testimony and the mode of trial so perfect as to preclude every possibility of mistake or injustice , there would be some color for the admission of this plausible theory . But even in that case , policy would sometimes require a remission of punishment strictly due for a crime certainly ascertained . The very notion of mercy implies the accuracy of the claims of justice . An inexorable government , says Mr. Yorke in his considerations on the law of forfeiture , will not only carry justice in some instances to the height of injury , but with respect to itself it will be dangerously just . The clemency of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in not inflicting a single capital punishment , contributed by the judicious manner in which its clemency was applied , to the more firm establishment of their government . And this power of pardon will appear to be more essential when we consider that under the most correct administration of the law men will sometimes fall a // prey to the vindictiveness of accusers , the inaccuracy of testimony , and the fallibility of jurors . Notwithstanding this power is clearly supported on principles of policy if not of justice , English lawyers of the first class and highest reputation have strangely concluded that it can not exist in a repubic. because nothing higher is acknowledged than the magistrate . Instead of falling into such an erroneous conclusion , it might fairly be insisted that the power may exist with greater safety in free States than in any other forms of government ; because abuses of the discretion unavoidably confided to the magistrate in granting pardons are much better guarded against by the sense of the responsibility under which he acts . " Blackstone seems to have the same appreciation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Duke of Vienna : " Friar . It rested in your grace " To unloose this tied-up justice when you pleased : " And it in you more dreadful would have seemed , " Than in lord Angelo . " Duke . I do fear , too dreadful : " Sith t was my fault to give the people scope , " T would he my tyranny to strike , and gall them " For what I bid them do ; for we bid this be done , " When evil deeds have their permissive pass , " And not the punishment . Therefore , indeed , my father , " I have on Angelo imposed the office* " Who may , in the ambush of my name , strike home , " And yet my nature never in the sight , " To do it slander . " - Measure for Measure , Act 1 , Sc . IV . Of course , the views of Blackstone when he talks of the king as " holding a court of equity in his own breast , " - that he " acts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disagreeable or invidious parts , " have no particular weight with men of modern times , who believe that kings are made of flesh and blood like other people , and who are not in the habit of looking up to that fellow citizen whom they have chosen for a time to administer their laws , as a " f&gt;nntain of nothing but bounty and grace . " " Filial affection " and " personal loyalty " towards the governors of our States , are sentiments that are a trifle out of date . // The only argument adduced by Blackstone is this : the exelusion of pardons must necessarily introduce a very dangerous power in the judge or jury , that of construing the criminal law by the spirit instead of the letter ; or else it must be holden that the situation and circumstances of the offender ought to make no distinction in the punishment . It is hard to understand the force of this unless we consider the bloodthirstiness of the English criminal code at that time , when some relaxation of its severity may well have seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where crimes are classified according to " the situation and circumstances of the offender* ' and where the judge has the further power of sentencing to varions degrees of punishment in his discretion , and where juries refuse to convict if they think the probable punishment too severe , there is certainly no ground for saying there is no distinction between punishments . In fact , Blackstone himself , led away by his loyalty , gives the most effective answer to the advocates of a pardoning power . In a democracy7 he thinks , " it would tend to confound all ideas of right among the mass of the people ; as they would find it difficult to tell whether a prisoner were discharged by his innocence or obtained a pardon through favor . " We do sometimes find this difficulty in our democracy , but if Blackstone had cast the beam of monarchy out of his own eye , he might have seen more clearly that the real mote was not in the form of government but in the pardoning power itself Unless , indeed , he supposed that in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the executive . His reference to Montesquieu favors this view , although Kent does not allude to it in his reply . The views of Kent are certainly stated in a far more judicious way than those of Blackstone , and undoubtedly express the common opinion . There are , l*o*vever , two fallacies underlying his arguments . In the first place , he does not deny that the pardoning power has no place in a perfect administration of law , but contents himself with saying there is no perfect administration . It seems strange that it should have escaped his notice that this argument would check at the outset all change whatsoever , and stop the march of progress . Stated briefly , it is this : no system of government , education , or anything // else is perfect ; therefore devices for remedying imperfection are necessary ; therefore they must never be done away with . It is true enough our administration of law is defective , and it is equally true that if the defects can not be removed it will never be any better . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really at the bottom of all the feeling in favor of the existence of this power , is this : the president or governor is better able to decide whether a prisoner deserves punishment , and how much he desci-ves , than the judge and jury that tried and sentenced him . In this simple form probably few of those who practically admit the doctrine would accept it ; but a close examination will detect this principle as underlying most of the arguments that are employed to defend this " amiable prerogative . " " Were it possible , " says Kent , " to maintain a just proportion between the crime and the penalty , " ( implying that the executive can tell better how to maintain this proportion than the judge and jury that have heard the evidence ) , " and were the rules of testimony and the modes of trial so perfect as to preclude every possibility of mistake or injustice , " ( implying also that the executive can tell better about the testimony and mode of trial than the judge and jury ) , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plausible theory . " Think of the governor of the State of New York considering fifteen hundred ( 1,500 ) applications for pardon in a single year , and whether in every case there was a due proportion between the crime and the penalty ; examining , of course , all the evidence on both sides ; reviewing the testimony and mode of trial in every case , a task requiring great legal knowledge as well as a thorough perusal of the reports . IReflect that he hears evidence only on one side , that there is no prosecuting officer to expose false testimony , and that pardons are asked as personal favors . Consider that all this is but a small part of the duties of a governor , and consider , on the other hand , how long a time the decision of these cases would take a judge and jury sitting constantly and having no other business to attend to , and decide whether it is likely that justice is furthered by such means . It would be quite safe to assert that punishment will // be neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not necessary to depend on a priori reasoning . We can cite the testimony of Governor Llartranft of Pennsylvania in his last message . He says : " A year 's experience in the pardoning power has confirmed me in the opinion , expressed in my inaugural , that it is unwise and unjust to impose this responsibility upon a single individual . The importunities of distressed relatives , the personal appeals of men of character and reputation , the inconsiderate and indiscriminate manner in which petitions are signed by responsible parties , the absence of protests in almost every case , and disproportion between the offense and the penalties frequently imposed , are all calculated to embarrass and prevent a right conclusion . When it is considered , also , that the Executive , in any application , is forbidden to enlist his sympathies , while his discretion is presumed to be proof against ingenuity and falsehood , the perplexity of his situation can readily be conceived . " Add to this the single fact that in some States this power has been so exercised that on an average the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shorter time in prison than the one sentenced for ten years , and only a little longer time than the one sentenced for five years . It does not take a high degree of intelligence in a criminal to enable him to draw the inference that it is for his interest to commit a crime that will give him a long sentence ; the effect on public safety need not be explained . But it may be well to draw the sympathy of the tender-b earted to the case of the poor wretch that spends five years in jail for some drunken excess , when he sees murderers and burglars pardoned out before him . It may , however , be admitted that these abuses are deplorable , and yet it may be maintained that they can not be avoided . After all , it will be urged , there is and always must be a great deal of imperfection and injustice in the course of law , and some higher power is needed to step in and remedy cases of obvious and gross injustice . It is no doubt to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would be still more unfortunate for those who deserve pardon not to obtain it . It is an old and sound maxim of law that it is better that ten guilty men should escape rather than one innocent man should be punished . It is probable that this feeling still remains in the minds of most readers . Although the principles already explained , if strictly applied , would do away with it , it may be perhaps more effectively removed by a careful study // of the cases in which it is thought necessary that pardon be granted . In some States the governor sends to the legislature a list of all those whom he has pardoned , stating the crime , sentence , time stricken oW and the *ronnds of pardon in every case . An examination of these reports for a term of years may be fairly expected to show all the usual grounds for pardon , and to show or suggest most of the possible grounds . It will be unavoidably tedious , but in no other way can a conclusion be reached that will command @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defending an institution or an abuse by a resort to vague generalities , that method of defense will always be employed ; not with any wrong intent in many cases , but simply because no one is able to give up a cherished belief or prejudice at once , and when unable to find specific arguments , the use of indefinite terms serves to conceal the awkwardness of the truth that one is really but defending a position because he has determined to defend it ; one simply can not admit that he is in the wrong without going through a long process of argument , for self-love will not allow it . But when all specific arguments that are adduced have been rebutted , it may be fairly claimed that a cause is lost that is driven to defend itself by vague expressions and abstractions . " The interests of justice would not be furthered by the punishment of this prisoner , ** is not a statement that can have any influence unless it be explained how the interests of justice are affected . And if it be clearly shown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pardon will not promote the interests of justice , then we may safely conclude , in defiance of generalities , that the pardoning power should not exist . It is to be feared , however , if we contrast the indignation that stirred the blood of our ancestors at the very name of general warrant or bill of attainder , with the meekness with which we have borne the customs-laws of the present day , that there is sad reason to believe that many things questionable in themselves will now be overlooked if they are done in " the interests of justice . ' Let us consider some of the more striking cases first . At the request of the Russian minister , a man convicted of rape and sentenced to twenty years imprisonment was pardoned after serving three years , with the understanding that he was to // leave the country , which he did . What is the lesson to be learnt from this ? Apparently that our laws are not made for foreigners , and that they may violate them with comparative impunity . Or else , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penalties remitted , which would be a good rule if it did not work both ways , as other countries would soon make clear to us . In fact , criminals often manifest a great desire to leave the scene of their crime , and are only brought back after a long chase and a great expenditure of labor and money . Shall we say to them : " Wait and be convicted , when if you are willing to run away a pardon shall be granted you . " This would beyond all question be an extremely popular mode of punishment and far cheaper than imprisonment . But on the other hand , would the crime of rape be discouraged ? This is not a slight offense but a serious crime , almost as serious as murder . But if it is to be pardoned at the intercession of a foreign minister provided the criminal leave the country , this should be clearly understood , and should be embodied in the law on this subject ; otherwise the crime might be committed under a misunderstanding , and the unfortunate offender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might languish out the full term of his sentence . We have already seen that the first requisite of effectual punishment is equal treatment of all by the law . Now if the conditions which are here assigned as grounds of pardon are legitimate grounds , then they are legitimate grounds in all other cases where the circumstances are similar . Then they should be stated in the law , as an act of justice . Or if they are not legitimate in other cases , they are not in this . In any event there is no need of a pardoning power for such cases . Another case was that of a man also convicted of rape ( this crime for some reason is generally treated with great tenderness by the pardoning power ) , and sentenced for fifteen years , who was pardoned after serving two months . The grounds assigned here are certainly far more reasonable than in the previous case , the prisoner having saved a building from destruction by fire and having protected the life of a keeper against an assault by convicts . These are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crime because they interpose to save // life and property ? Shall we say to men , if you will save the life of a keeper you may commit a rape with impunity ? Is it to be a general rule that anyone who protects a keeper shall be pardoned ? If not , why is an exception made in this case ? If it is to be the general practice , it should be a part of the law that pardon in such cases is to be granted , otherwise the principle of equal justice is violated . But in that case there is no need of the pardoning power . This case is an excellent example of the vicious ethics of the " Jim Bludsoe " school . Since this character lost his life in trying to save the lives of his passengers , it is inferred that bigamy or murder , or whatever previous eccentricity he may have been guilty of , will be pardoned by God ; hence it would be only right , if he had lived , that he should not have been punished by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urged that such conduct as that of this convict must be encouraged in order to promote good discipline in the prison . If this be true , a liberal reward in money might be offered : but the principle is a wrong one . Assaults on keepers should be checked by severe penalties , not by pardons to those who take the keeper 's part . This latter method may be consistently employed when the State pays rewards to members of the community outside of jail who act as peacemakers ; no longer punishing the man that assaults another , but paying the man that hinders the assault from being fatal . There follow a large number of cases that may , to save time , be grouped together . The grounds of pardon are here : many recommendations ; the prisoner to leave the State , to enter business , to settle an estate ; youth ; ignorance ; previous good character ; the prisoner led into crime by others ; mitigating circumstances ; inability to pay fine ; weakness of prisoners intellect . It may be said in general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criminals from punishment . Recommendations are obviously to be obtained according to the station in life of the prisoner and the political and social influence that he can command . But it is just as important that a person of high position that commits a crime should be punished , as that one of low degree should be , perhaps even more important , for the // lower classes , as already pointed out , are on the watch for any partiality in the execution of the laws , as a justification for breaking them . So the fact that a criminal will leave the State , points to the fact that criminals thus pardoned will enter the State . It is certainly a disregard of the comity that should prevail between communities . So a chance to enter business is of course very much to be desired for a criminal when his term of punishment has expired , but it does not appear reasonable that punishment should be remitted on this account . And the fact that a prisoner is needed to settle the estate of his father can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punishment . So with youth , ignorance , good character , and other mitigating circumstances ; these are all taken into account by the law , and have been weighed by the judge and jury , and yet sentence has been pronounced . They should not be again brought forward to do away with the sentence that was given in view of them . The fact that the prisoner was led into crime by others does not acquit him of blame . The fact that he is unable to pay his fine should not relieve him from punishment ; unless the fine was additional to imprisonment , when it becomes a debt , and freedom from imprisonment for debt should be provided by law . And the fact that the prisoner is of unsound mind is a fact to be settled by the jury at the time of trial . It is of course impossible to follow out the argument in detail in all these cases , but they may be safely tested in this way . Are the grounds alleged for pardon such that they could have been considered by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If so , it is more likely that the judge and jury have arrived at a right conclusion by devoting their time to a fair hearing of the evidence on both sides , than that the governor should arrive at a right conclusion by an unavoidably hasty consideration of the entreaties and witnesses on one side only . It must not be lost sight of that the governor of a large State can , in the nature of the case , devote but a small portion of his time to this department of his duties . If he have to consider fifteen hundred applications during the year , that would suppose that he can consider five every day , to do which with any regard to justice would certainly occupy most of his waking // hours . If governors nowadays were statesmen of the type of the framers of our constitution , this dangerous power might be with safety left in their hands ; but fidelity to duty in opposition to the dictates of policy is not the distinguishing feature of our public functionaries. * In the cases we have now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ends of justice ; both because it is impossible that the executive should have a better knowledge of the facts than the courts , and because if the grounds assigned for pardon are proper in one case , it is partial and unjust that they should not be established by law rather than * Extract from the Life of John Jay , vol. 1 , page 396 . " The petitions for pardon were numerous and they were frequently presented under circumstances which required great firmness to resist them . In two instances the governors of neighboring States applied to him hy letter , soliciting the pardon of convicts from their States , who happened to he respectably connected . In another case the clergy , magistrates , and inhabitants of a town in Connecticut . united in a petition in behalf of a fellow-townsman . But perhaps in no instance did the governor find it more difficult to withstand the solicitations of his friends , and the impulses of his own feelings , as in one which excited a general and painful interest . The son of a worthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public service , had been convicted of forgery and sentenced to imprisonment for life . The aged and broken-hearted parent repaired from a distant part of the State to the capital to invoke in person the clemency of the executive , bringing with him from the towns through which he passed petitions urging his suit ; while the governor 's most confidential friends , and the great officers of State , solicited him in private , to liberate the prisoner in consideration of the father . But all was in vain . " The following letter seems to have been written on this occasion , to General Williams . Sin : -I have been favored with yours of the - , mentioning that the friends of - are anxious for his release from prison , and that the people appear to be satisfied with the punishment he has received . How far these circumstances afford proper reasons and principles whereon to found a pardon , is a question which after due consideration will not , I presume , appear very difficult to decide . The power of pardoning is committed hy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the wishes or feelings of the governor . If it was committed to the latter very few convicts would he long imprisoned . I believe it to be my duty to pardon all who in my judgment ought to he pardoned , and to refuse pardons to all who on principles of sound policy and justice ought not to have them . To pardon or not to pardon does not depend on my will , but on my judgment ; and for the impartial and discreet exercise of this authority I am and ought to be highly responsible . I am , sir , your most obedient servant , JOHN JAY . " // by the caprice of successive governors . There remains a more important class of cases where justice is sometimes obviously outraged by the infliction of punishment , and where some such expedient as the pardoning power may well be regarded as indispensable . In a number of cases the law has been changed since sentence was pronounced ; a criminal , for example , was sentenced for ten years for an offense afterwards made punishable by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have the benefit of this change . Ex post facto laws are prohibited because it it unjust that a man be punished for an act that was not punishable at the time it was committed . A rigid application of this principle would require that a man suffer the penalty attached to his offense when he committed it . He had the consequences of his act in view , he knew what he had to expect if convicted , and if his trial was fair he has no ground for complaint . The fact that the penalty has been changed since his act was committed could have had no influence on his action . But it is not necessary to press this principle to an extreme . The law-making power could have easily inserted in the changed law a provision that o*enders under the old law should be set free after they had served the shortened term . If the old law was regarded as unjust , a common regard for justice would require that this be done . The fact that no such provision was made , must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new law should be retro-active . In a matter so plainly within the ken and power of the le*islature , the intrusion of the pardoning power is to be regretted . But a study of the Parable of the Laborers in the Vineyard will show that the injustice in these cases is apparent only and not real . In a few cases the ground assigned for pardon is the belief of the prison keepers that the convict is reformed . This is a legitimate reason for relaxing the severity of punishment , and is , by a very wise provision in some States , allowed to shoi-ten the term of confinement ; or strictly speaking , good behavior is allowed this encouragement . Bitt to pardon a man when his keepers believe he is reformed is to constitute them a coui-t of justice , with no security that jnstice will be regarded . Or if this be legitimate , then it should be so stated in the law , that all may have equal treatment . // The practice of pardoning offenders who are at the point of death or incurably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of home , must be held to be humane , and with proper safeguards unobjectionable . But there is no need of employing the governor to decide in such cases . It is plain that he has not the time at his command , and it must often occur that painful injustice is done by his inability to attend at once to cases that demand instant action . In fact , it is several times reported that the pardon reached the prison after the death of the prisoner . The certificate of the attending physician might be made by law as efficacious as the governor 's pardon . There would doubtless be abuses , but it is to be remembered that the governor now acts on the advice of the physician , and the abuses would be perhaps fewer if one person were responsible rather than two . In any case , the matter should be regulated by law , not by the chance of the governor 's being able to act in time . A prisoner is sometimes pardoned in order to bear witness against a more serious offender . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will the fact that he has been pardoned make it worthy ? If there are legal technicalities in the way of using such testimony , they are founded in wisdom or they are not . If they are , they should be respected , and if they are not , they should not be evaded , but the law should be improved . The remaining cases may be briefly summed up as cases where it is held that the punishment is too severe for the offense , where there is doubt as to the guilt of the prisoner , or where there is clear proof of his innocence . As to the first we must enquire as before , whether it is likely that the governor is better able to arrive at the truth than a court of justice . If there is no new evidence in the case the answer must be in the negative . If there is new evidence , then , as well as where there is doubt of guilt or proof of innocence , punishment should certainly not be inflicted . But it by no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is in many instances no remedy for the injustice done . If a man has been pronounced guilty of a crime of which he is innocent , the injustice can only be repaired by a full and fair acquittal in a court of justice . Pardons // are granted for too many other reasons to answer as a proof of innocence . That provision of law which forbids a judge to grant relief after sentence has been pronounced , even though it then appears that the prisoner is innocent , must result in injustice . A new trial should be granted whenever satisfactory proof is offered that evidence likely to change the verdict can be produced ; provided , of course , it be new evidence , such as could not have been offered at the first trial . On the presentation of satisfactory reasons , to be determined by law , the court of errors or appeals might be empowered to order another trial , or itself to re-open the case . Or a court might be constituted for the sole purpose of hearing appeals in criminal cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law and not left to the discretion of the court . As it is now , the governor is really a court of appeals . But how can justice be done by a court of one judge , with little time in any case to devote to a duty for which all of his time would not be enough ; exposed to influences of all kinds , and hearing whatever appeals , groundless or otherwise , any one may choose to present ; a court that owes its existence to the favors of politicians and that must treat their requests with deference ; a court where only the piteous side of justice is presented by the friends of the criminal , while the interests of the community have no advocate to plead their cause ! Such a court has all the faults that a court can have . It may , however , be urged that until the necessary alterations in law have been made , the pardoning power should remain . This is really the fallacy pointed out in the remarks of Kent It may safely be said that as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carelessness and ignorance , the careless and ignorant will not trouble themselves to improve . If the legislature will vote a deficiency bill for every excess of expenditure over appropriation , the appropriations will always be exceeded . And if the executive will repair the damage done by bad laws , the legislature will not mend them . President Grant pointed out the true principle in his first message , though he may have since forgotten it . He said that the proper way to secure good laws was to rigidly enforce the bad ones . Let the governor decline to pardon , but let him report to the // legislature the cases where injustice is worked by the laws , and leave them their proper responsibility of making laws that will not work injustice . The governor now reports cases where the judge and jury seem to have thought that it made little difference what their verdict and sentence was , for the governor would rectify it if it was unjust . Were they altogether wrong in this view ? Is not this the natural consequence of a system where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because he thinks the offense was done in a drunken frolic , or the result of carelessness rather than criminal intent , or the prisoner should have had better counsel , or the evil consequences of the crime were not very serious , after all ? A searching critic may still say : " Granted all this , hut with changing circumstances there must ever arise new and unforeseen contingencies , that would not fall under the conditions legally specified as necessary for granting an appeal . Here without the pardoning power there would inevitably result gross injustice . " This is in the main correct , but the remedy should be in the power of reprieve , not of pardon . Punishment should be suspended until after the next session of the legislature ; when if they chose to take no action in the matter after their attention had been called to the inj ustice of their laws , theresponsibility would rest with them . Such a power of reprieve is ( or has been ) granted to the governor , in certain cases , by the State of Vermont @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the different States , that in New Jersey there is a court of pardons , and that the governor has no powers in this matter except as a member of this court . Here then we might expect to find a more perfect administration of justice and less crime than in other States . But in point of fact there are more pardons granted in New Jersey than in most States , the number pardoned from the State prison having exceeded 130 in a single year of late , ( one-sixth part of the whole number of convicts , ) while the amount of crime , if measured by the number of convictions , is very great . This does not look very hopeful for the proposed court of pardons . But the explanation of this state of affairs is not far to seek . New Jersey lies between New York and Philadelphia , and whatever her laws , must be // exposed to the incursions of hosts of the criminal class . This will explain the large amount of crime . The number of pardons is to be explained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for pardon or the granting them , but everything is left to the discretion of the court . Of course , this method of constituting a court of pardons is better than to leave everything in the hands of the governor . But it is better only in this respect , that the number of judges may cause more fairness in decision . The judges ( the governor , lieutenant governor , and six judges of the court of appeals constitute the court ) are still overworked , and are not in any proper sense of the word , a court , for they have no laws to guide them . They at once make the law by which pardons are bestowed , decide whether a prisoner is to come within that law , and execute their own sentence ; a union of the three functions of government that is universally condemned . In justice to this court of New Jersey , it should be added that of late years the number of occupants of the State prison has been twice , and almost three times the number for which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well have felt that common decency required that such overcrowding should not be perpetrated in the name of the State . It must still be maintained , however , that the providing of prisons for those who are sentenced to confinement by their laws , is the proper business of the legislature , and that they will attend to this matter much more quickly if the court of pardons will not repair the consequences of their neglect . In the State of Connecticut pardons are granted by the legislature . In consequence of the publicity thus ensured the number of applications for pardon is not more than thirty or forty a year , while the number granted is only six to ten . And it is only fair to allow that this fact may have a considerable influence in causing the comparative immunity from crime enjoyed by this State . Although there are many obvious reasons against endowing the legislature with this power , it yet seems remarkable that the inspectors of the State prison should recommend , as they recently did , that pardons should be granted by the governor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoped that any change that is made , may be in a different direction . // It may be well to remind the reader that it is not the aim of this argument to secure greater severity in punishment . It may well be that the deterrent effect of imprisonment will not be lessened by shortening the term . This question can only be settled by experiment But no satisfactory result can be reached unless the fundamental conditions , equality and certainty of punishment , be regarded . The true aim of punishment is mercy . Not the blind , cruel mercy that sees only the wretched criminal , but the more enlightened mercy that sees also the sufferings he has caused . Sympathy belongs not only to the murderer but to the victim of murder , and to his family and friends . As we enlarge our view it becomes more and more clear that the pardon of a criminal is but a refinement of cruelty to those who are tempted to crime , teaching them that they may hope to avert those consequences of their acts that the very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lesson that men are only too ready to learn . Sooner or later , a misguided leniency will bring its sure result in an increase of crime ; and then follows the injustice of a sudden access of severity in the execution of the laws . First , mcii are told that they may hope for milder punishment than the laws provide ; then , when they have learned the lesson and act accordingly , faith is broken with them and the full penalty of the law is inflicted . When men can hope for favor they will cease to fear justice . The main points of this somewhat prolonged argument may be with advantage briefly summed up in conclusion . We saw that punishment in some form is an unavoidable evil ; that unless the absurdity be committed of maintaining that all acts must be followed by the same consequences , those acts which are injurious to the community must be followed by more unpleasant consequences than others ; and that these unpleasant consequences constitute punishment , because they tend to deter from the acts which they attend . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doers of the obnoxious acts , but to others . The infliction of punishment is painful to the innocent as well as the guilty . And while justice requires that punishment should not be inflicted during the heat of indignation that follows the crime , yet when this // indignation is allowed to cool , the motive to punish has in great part disappeared . Hence arises the disposition to do away with punishment , wholly or partly , that is , to pardon . It was seen that this might be safely done in the family , because the nature of wrong acts could be there explained , so that the relief from punishment need not result in increase of wrong-doing . And it is easy to suppose that the State stands to its subjects rn the relation of a father to his children . The mistake soon appears . We find that it is hopeless for the State to attain such acquaintance with all its offending subjects as to be able to judge when punishment may be remitted to their advantage . And even if this were not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to explain to that ignorant multitude that will grow up into habits of crime , the grounds on which pardons are granted , so that they will not look on them as reasons for hoping that they may escape punishment . It was admitted , however , that this belief in the parental functions of the State is still widely prevalent , owing perhaps to the poetic glamour that surrounds the office of king , and the slowly dying belief in his divine authority . Abandoning this view and adopting the theory that the State is merely the people governing by the choice oU some of their number to execute the laws which the whole people have agreed upon , the question arose whether the pardoning power of the executive should not be retained . The business of the State is to enforce its laws in the most effective way consistent with justice . It is impossible to reward acts according to their real merits . But crime can be repressed ; and the question then is whether pardoning criminals tends to essen enme , for if so the State should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the conditions of effective punishment . These were found to be two : the first , equality , that is that like offences done under like circumstances should receive like punishment . This forbids excessively severe punishments , for these must be reserved for the most heinous crimes . And the cause of the necessity of equality was seen to lie in the disposition of men to justify themselves by any partiality shown in the treatment of others , a disposition which it is of the highest importance to modern society should find no justification in
