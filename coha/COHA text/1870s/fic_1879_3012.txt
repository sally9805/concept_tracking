NICK BABA 'S LAST DRINK . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small country town was ablaze . Extra lights were glowing in all the little shops ; yet all this illumination served only to make more apparent the untidy condition of the six-by-nine window panes , as well as the goods therein . Men and women were hastening homeward with well-filled baskets which they had provided for the festive morrow . All the ragged , dirty urchins of the village were gathered about the dingy shop windows admiring , with distended eyes and gaping mouths , the several displays of toys and sweetmeats . Their arms buried quite to their elbows in capacious but empty pockets , they cast longing looks and wondered , as they had no stockings , where Santa Claus could put their presents when he had brought them . To all this show and preparation there was one exception : one place shrouded in total darkness -- it was the shop of Nick Baba , the village shoemaker . That was for the time deserted ; left to its dust , its collection of worn-out soles , its curtains of cobwebs , and its compound of bad , unwholesome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , and give place to a glimmer of light . Nick now came hurrying in and , quickly striking a light , placed between himself and a flickering oil lamp a small glass globe filled with water . He sat down upon his bench and commenced work in earnest on an unfinished pair of shoes . He hammered , and pulled , and stretched , and pegged , and sewed , and all this time , had there been any one present , they might have observed that , though Nick worked so diligently , he was unhappy , and a prey to the bitterest reflections . All in the village had commenced their merry-making , while he sat there alone , forgotten , and in despair . His neighbors had plenty -- he was penniless , and could take nothing to his home but regrets for the past . The rickety old door now creaked on its rusty , worn-out hinges , and admitted a creature as strange looking as it was unexpected . It moved straight toward Nick , and perched itself upon a three-legged stool close beside him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and yet it was as unlike anything human as is possible to imagine . It was more like some fantastic figure seen in a dream -- the creation of a disordered brain . It may be that it was a goblin -- Nick thought it one . It was only about two feet high ; a mass of dark-brown hair streamed down its back , partially concealing a great hump , and thence flowed down to its heels . Its head was round as a ball and topped out by a velvet cap of curious shape and workmanship , with a broad projecting front which shaded a pair of lustrous red eyes , set far back beneath the forehead -- almost lost there . Its breast was sunken , and the head settled down between the shoulders , created an impression of weakness , as if , for example , it should speak , that a small piping voice would come struggling up from below . Baba looked up with alarm , but the goblin greeted him with a smile , and said , " Merry Christmas , Nick , " in a deep , strong and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from its parted lips . " How do you know my name ? " inquired the cobbler , " and why do you mock me by such a greeting ? " " Baba , my friend , " replied the Goblin , " I was just thinking that if all the acts of your life had been as good and as humane as your mechanical skill is perfect , you would not now be floundering in the meshes of vice and dissipation . You are making a good pair of shoes there . " The shoemaker worked away without raising his head , but responded spitefully , " Where is the use of making them good ?  - -  I get no pay for them . " " Why , who , " inquired the occupant of the three-legged stool , " is so ungenerous as to want such shoes without paying for them ? " " They are , " answered the busy workman , " for the owner of this miserable shanty , and he complains because I am only six months behind with my rent -- a most unreasonable man . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn me out ; I must have some place to work , and so am forced to do the bidding of this grasping landlord . " " Ah , it is you who are unreasoning , " exclaimed Baba 's visitor , sorrowfully ; " it is you who are in fault . If you would but remain away from the tavern and the vile associates whom you meet there , all would be well with you , you might redeem yourself . " Nick felt this rebuke so very keenly that he turned savagely toward the one who had dared to tell him so plainly of his degradation , and demanded . " Who are you , and why have you disturbed the quiet of this mean hovel to insult me in my misery ? " " Because I wish to serve you , " answered it of the waving brown hair . " You can not serve me . I will drive you out , " threatened the now infuriated cobbler ; " I will throw you from the window -- I will kill you . " The red eyes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merry , careless laugh came bubbling forth as it answered , " I will not leave your shop , nor will you throw me from the window , nor yet kill me , Nick Baba . Why , you silly fellow , the sharpest tool on your bench can not draw blood from me , and that blackened lapstone , if driven with all the force of your great arm through my seeming substance , would leave me sitting here still , not to mock , but to try and save you . " The baffled and stricken shoemaker looked up and muttered . " Then you are not human , you are a demon . But , after all , " added Nick , softening , " whether you are of this world or of some other , you are right in what you say . " The Goblin made no reply , and Nick continued , " I have sunk very low , indeed , but I can not shake this habit ; it clings to me so firmly , that I have not only forfeited the regard of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Why not make an effort , Nick ? You can if you will . " " Yes , yes , " responded Nick , " it is easy enough to say give it up , but you have never felt this accursed appetite for strong drink ; this constant craving for more ; this inward sinking sensation , as if the parts of the body were about to separate , impelling the victim on in a career of sin and shame . You know nothing of all this . " " No , I confess I do not , " acknowledged the Goblin , " but I think any man may resist it , if he will make the trial . " " Ah , you might as soon expect , " pursued Nick , " to see the starving man cast bread from him , as to hope for the drunkard to resist liquor when the frenzy of this appetite is on him . " " But you have not tried , Nick . " " Yes , I have tried and failed , and tried again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said velvet cap . " A glass of liquor , " resumed Baba , " is a trifling thing , and it is very easy , you think , to cast it into the gutter . But I tell you , whoever and whatever you are , that this sparkling and seductive drink is the pygmy that binds the giant to the post with a thread , and lashes him with thongs of fire . " Try again , " urged the Goblin , " I am sure you can regain all that you have lost . " " No , no , " moaned Nick , " I am too low down ; I am an absolute slave to rum . " " Baba , " commanded the Goblin , " take up the shoe you have nearly finished , look into the sole and tell me what you see there . It is a mirror of the past . " Nick took the shoe from the floor and gazed at it intently for a few seconds . He was agitated , and his powerful breast heaved as only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you see ? Speak ! " said his tormentor . " I see , " responded Nick , mechanically , " a scene of seven years ago . It is the image of a fair-haired , blue-eyed girl before the altar in her wedding garments . I am there also , vowing to protect her ; to stand up and battle with the world for her ; to be a barrier between her and want . But I have not done it -- I have been recreant to every principle of honor or manhood , God help me . " " Now , Nick , " said the conjuror , persuasively , " pick up the other shoe and tell me what you see there . That is a mirror of the present . " " I see , " groaned Nick , " in place of that fair-haired girl at the church , then all happiness , a prematurely old woman , faded and disheartened . Three ragged children cling to her scanty clothing . They beg of her mere bread to keep off hunger . She has none to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her emaciated arms , kisses them . She gives them all she has -- a mother 's love . " " What more do you see , " demanded the magician : " tell it all . " " Oh ! maddening sight , " sobbed Nick ; " I see myself staggering from the ale-house and reeling into what should be a home , where gaunt starvation stalks the floor ; where the hearth is fireless , and where a starving family die upon a pallet of straw . " " You have seen it all , " said the wizard . " It is bad . " " Yes , and the picture is as true as it is terrible . What demon prompted you to come here to-night with your diabolical machinery , to show me to myself so much blacker than I thought I was ? " Nick 's queer little companion peered through the misty , uncertain light of the cobbler 's workshop with his sharp restless red eyes , but remained quiet . Nick , his head in a whirl of excitement , then placed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon his knees , looked down at the floor covered with scraps of soiled leather . Soon these scraps commenced to move and assume weird shapes . They changed to hundreds of little red , blue and green devils , no more than a few inches high , which capered over the floor in troops . They ran up Nick 's back , and hiding in the mass of black hair , twisted and knotted it until their victim winced , and then with hilarious shouts dropped to the floor and went clattering away . Returning , they played hide and seek in and out of the old worn boots and shoes which littered the floor . Then the tub wherein the shoemaker wet his leather , burst its hoops and the water ran out over the floor in streams of fire . The light was out and darkness enveloped Nick and his companion . The wind went howling by , and flung gusts of hail against the cracked and broken windows . Baba , shivering from the cold , straightened himself up and looked for his patron . He could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fire close to him -- the red eyes were still upon him . Nick was thankful even for this , as any companionship at that moment was better than none . The silence was at length broken by the Goblin remarking , " You must have passed a fearful ordeal during the last few moments . " " Has the time been so short ? " inquired Nick ; " it seemed almost an age to me . This is not the first occasion , however , that I have passed through it , and I fear the time may come when nature will break down , and then I shall either do myself an injury or harm some one else -- I know it . " " I hope not , " said the wizard . " Good-bye , I must go . " " Do not leave , " implored the half-frightened Baba , " but remain with me until I have quite finished my work . I believe I am growing to be a coward , for I dare not be alone to-night . You are such an odd-looking manikin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me , that I am beginning to like you . Do stay . " " Well , " consented the Goblin , " I will remain as long as you wish ; my time is of no value ; beside , if I can persuade you to reform and be a sober man , it will be worth an eternity of waiting . " Nick said , " Thank you , I will try , " and went on with his work . Neither spoke for some time , when Baba suddenly exclaimed , " There , they are finished at last , and are as good a pair of shoes as man ever trod in . I suppose now that I may occupy this den for a while longer . " " Baba , my good man , " solicited Nick 's friend , " as we are about to part , will you give me your promise never to drink rum again ? You will then be happy , I am sure . " Hesitatingly the cobbler agreed that he would not taste the accursed stuff again ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accompany him as far as where he lived in such wretchedness . " I have no objection , " replied the Goblin , " if you will not walk too fast , for I can not keep pace with you . " " Why , I will carry you , " said the grateful Nick , and seizing the little conjuror in his arms , walked off with him easily . When they had proceeded about half the length of the street , at the other end of which Nick lived , they came to the village dram-shop . Forgetting all that had passed , the willing shoemaker stopped and listened . He could hear the clinking sound of glasses ringing on the night air , mingled with the maudlin shouts and songs of his boon companions . The old feeling returned ; he grew weak in his resolution , and , turning to the Goblin , said , " Just come in and have one drink with me -- the last one . " Immediately the imprudent Nick was thrown violently to the ground , the houses trembled , and their shutters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into ruins . Nick was startled into wakefulness , and a sweet , cheery voice called , " Nick , Nick , are you going to lie in bed all day ? It is a bright Christmas morning and the children are half frantic to show you the presents Santa Claus has brought them . " " My dear , are you sure I am Nick Baba , the village shoemaker , and that you are his wife ? " " Certainly . Why ask such a question ? " " Then I have had a frightfully vivid dream , " explained he to his wife , " for I seemed to have fallen back into my old habits of intemperance and to have dragged you down with me , where I had hoped never to see you again . " " Nick , dear , it was but a dream . Remember you took your last drink just three years ago ; do you feel strong enough yet to resist it ? " " Yes , I do ; and now that I am sure it was only the nightmare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at breakfast . " * * * * * A TRIP TO CURRITUCK . On a Monday , in the month of November , we started on our annual trip to the marshes of North Carolina . We left Washington armed and equipped , and met , at Norfolk , four of our party who had left New York the previous week . They had been spending a few days in Princess Anne County , quail shooting , where they had labored hard with no success to speak of -- the birds were few , the ground heavy , and they quit that locality , perfectly willing never to return to it . They arrived in Norfolk heartily sick of that excursion . We got the traps all together and made a start for our favorite sporting grounds ; where the merest tyro may do satisfactory execution , and come in at night with a keen appetite for the next day 's sport . While waiting for the quail party to return , we strolled through the old city of Norfolk , with its quaint houses and curiously-winding streets , and wandered into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Illustration : ST . PAUL 'S CHURCH , 1739 . This is one of the oldest places of worship in the United States ; it was erected before the Revolution , and is built of imported brick , laid alternately , red and black . The figures , giving the date of erection , 1739 , are rudely worked into the wall -- projecting far enough to make the design perfectly plain . When the town was burnt by the British , 1775 , only the walls of this sacred edifice were left standing . The enemy relieved it of a very fine marble baptismal font , and also of the communion plate , which were carried to Scotland . On the gable end of the building , still fast in the wall , may be seen a cannon ball which was fired from the British ship , Liverpool . The church stands in the customary grave yard of those days , and contains the remains of persons interred as early as 1700 . Near the door stands the tomb-stone of Col. Samuel Boush , who gave the land on which this house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . Some of the stones , marking places of interment , are covered with mosses and creeping plants ; the inscriptions on others are almost obliterated by the ravages of time ; still others have fallen or been broken , and now lean in every direction over the last earthly resting-place of those who thought to tell coming generations who reposed beneath . This is one of the weaknesses of mankind , but it is vain . Let them pile up costly and lofty monuments -- reaching heavenward ; let the artist cut their names and virtues deep into the enduring granite ; let the mechanic , with all his skill , set the foundations , yet the lettering will perish and the stone will crumble . Parasitic plants will fasten upon them ; beneath their destroying grasp names and dates will disappear , and generations yet to come will be unable to tell whether they look upon the grave of a prince or upon that of a peddler -- the narrow house of him who retired to the straw pallet of poverty , will not then be known from that of him who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all ranks , And lays the shepherd 's crook beside the sceptre . " Illustration : ST . PAUL 'S CHURCH , 1878 . " On it , time his mark has hung ; On it , hostile bells have rung ; On it , green old moss has clung ; On it , winds their dirge have sung ; Let us still adore thy walls , Sacred temple , Old St. Paul 's . " Our party assemble , and we find the little steamer Cygnet at her wharf , looking as neat and trim as the graceful bird after which she is named . Newly painted , she was about to start on the first trip of the season . Half-past six was the hour of departure , but a heavy wet fog hung over this city by the sea , and we were obliged to await its disappearance . At length the sun struggled through the clouds , and the mist cleared rapidly away . We hauled out and steamed slowly up the Elizabeth River , then past the Navy Yard , with its tall smoking chimneys , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its neat and trim little square , domineered over by a lordly flag-staff , whose base is guarded by cannon captured from the enemies of the Republic , and its dismantled ships -- relics of past naval architecture . As we pass , the shrill cry of the boat-swain 's whistle is heard on ship-board , piping all hands to breakfast , mingled with the music of the busy clinking hammers forging chains and anchors . A few miles above this naval station human habitations cease , scarcely a living thing greets the eye -- we are in almost entire solitude . The eagle is seen grandly floating on the air , or poised ready to strike a defenceless animal or crippled bird . The buzzard , of loathsome aspect , perched upon a blasted tree , waits for his gorged appetite to sharpen , that he may descend and fatten upon some putrid carcass . The river , narrow and tortuous , rolls its black waters between low and marshy banks , flat , and running back to thin growths of stunted pines and other badly nourished trees . As we go on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sight of a clump of pines , which have persisted in growing tall and straight , with tufts of bright green foliage waving gracefully in the wind . For many miles this is about the description of country we pass through . At Great Bridge we enter the locks of the Chesapeake and Albemarle Canal . A battle was fought here in 1775 and the British defeated . Here are the Company 's houses , well constructed and neatly painted -- a credit to the corporation as well as to the guiding spirit . The substantial locks and well kept dwellings and offices , like the gilded signs over the doors of the haunts of vice , are pleasant to look upon , but they do not tell of that which is within . If the passage up the river is dismal , what shall we say of the journey through this canal . It is a dreary sameness cut right through a great swamp , merely wide enough to admit the passage of two vessels , with only a dull damp settlement here and there -- a country store and the inevitable porch , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : COUNTRY STORE . The country store and post-office is the same everywhere : it belongs to every clime and nationality -- it is a human device and speaks an universal language . It is generally overflowing with all sorts of commodities , from a hand-saw to a toothpick -- is well stocked with calico and molasses , rum and candles , straw hats and sugar , bacon and coal oil , and gun-powder and beeswax . It is the rallying point for all the mischief-making gossips to collect , for the settlement of the affairs of the nation , and , failing in that , to set the neighbors by the ears . Leaving the canal , we go out into another river : a bright spot breaks upon us -- a lumber station with new , fresh-looking piles of sawed lumber . The banks of this stream are just as low , marshy and uninteresting as the one we have passed through , and more crooked . There are perhaps a few more trees -- some oaks , and we observed a tree with its crimson and yellow autumn foliage , backed by a clump of pines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illumining a gloomy spot . After winding through the channel for a few hours , we enter Currituck Sound . This shallow sea takes its name from a tribe of Indians which once owned the adjacent lands . It is quite a large sheet of water , though not deep , about fifty miles long , and nearly ten at the widest part . It is dotted with small , low , sedgy islands , marshes and swamps . After enduring the approaches to it , quite an enlivening scene is presented . Persons are seen on the shore of the mainland , and boats are moving about in various directions . Huge groaning windmills , with tattered sails , guard the shore and torture the Indian corn into bread-stuff . Now for the first time the traveler begins to realize what it is to see wild fowl . The water seems black with ducks and geese , and dazzling white with the graceful swans . The latter sit in great flocks on the shoals , for miles in length . As the steamer approaches , they arise in such vast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound like the coming tornado . Arriving as near our destination as the vessel can take us , we disembark , landing on a strong platform built far out from the shore . For a half hour we are busy getting our traps from the bait -- guns , dogs , ammunition , boxes , bags , bales , bundles , baskets and barrels . We had left nothing unpurchased which could contribute to the comfort of the inner or outer man -- especially the former . Now we transfer everything to a small boat , sent from the beach miles away , to meet and convey us to our journey 's end -- our home for a few weeks , where we must conform to the customs of the natives as near as possible . We do not reach the Hall until the twilight has faded into darkness . The water is too shallow to allow even this small craft to approach the shore near enough to enable us to land , so carts are driven out to it , and the baggage and provisions piled therein . The teams being loaded , us city folks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the backs of our amiable and hospitable friends . They have a contempt for dry places , water being their element . Proceeding to the house , we are welcomed in the warmest possible manner by our host and his ever busy and pleasant daughter Nora . We are installed as a part of the family , for we have been there before -- we are not strangers . Nora and her sable assistants had prepared an abundant and inviting meal for us , and we enjoyed it with an appetite quickened by the sail across the Sound . Illustration : GOING ASHORE . Illustration : RAYMOND HALL . After supper we made our arrangements for the first day 's shooting , and then retired -- sinking into beds so downy as to induce sleep in a few moments -- and we do sleep just as soundly as if we had always been wise and good and happy . The club house , " Raymond Hall , " is an ordinary frame one , situated on the shore of the Sound , a few rods from the sea . It is surrounded by a tolerable growth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at night is as silent as the halls of death -- not a sound being heard except the bark of the watchful house-dogs . The wind murmurs about the angles of the house , and through the branches of the trees , in dreary harmony with the roar of the ocean . It is somewhat startling , for a few nights , to us denizens of cities , to notice the entire absence of all precautions against depredators -- there are neither locks nor bolts . Life is primitive here ; all honor the head of the family , and bow to his will . The people , young and old , are universally kind and respectful to those strangers who sojourn among them , meeting them in a spirit of frankness and exacting the same . We shoot whenever the weather is suitable , and amuse ourselves at other times in various ways -- repairing boats , rigging decoys , cleaning guns , loading shell , and making ready for a good day when it does come . We breakfast between eight and nine o'clock , then , donning our shooting attire , including rubber boots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Wading out to our boats , laden with all the implements of destruction , we depart for the day 's sport . A small fleet of five sail starts in a bunch like a flock of white-winged birds ; the swiftest of them shoot ahead , fading out in the distance ; others disappear behind the islands or into some of the numerous creeks , and for that day we are lost to each other . Illustration : " PHELY . " We meet again at night , however , and compare notes . The number of birds each has secured , the good and bad shots , with other events of the day , are all pleasant topics at supper . After the evening meal , we plan the next day 's business , and then , wearied , we seek our feather beds and sleep too soundly even to dream . So we pass the days in a sort of luxurious vagabondism . How very pleasant it is to be a vagabond , when one may return to starched linen and the trammels of civilization whenever one wishes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ H. Charles , Rory Theodoric , Jas . O'Kelly , Geo . H. Crege , H. H. Josephus and Geo . G. Paullo . Two servants accompanied the party -- Steve and Jacob , Steve is a rattling , roaring fellow , who had never before been without the sound of the breakers of his native Long Island , and was ready to perform any act for his friends , from pitch-and-toss to manslaughter . Jacob , the companion of Steve , is the very opposite in all things ; is a genteel fellow , wears a clerical necktie of immaculate whiteness , and has the appearance of having studied for the ministry , and graduated as a cook . His table is a marvel of neatness , and his culinary experience has enabled him to set many a tempting dish before us . Illustration : JACOB . Illustration : BLIND . During our stay on the beach many amusing incidents occurred ; we will try and give some of them as they return to our memory . It may not be uninteresting to know how and where we shoot , and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the choice ; each selects the point , or island , or strait , which , in his judgment will afford the best shooting for the day , and there builds a blind . This blind is made by breaking down the tall reeds , leaving a fence in front , next the water , to secrete the gunner from the game . Behind this screen a sort of nest is formed by matting down the reeds and marsh grass . It is rendered more comfortable by spreading a rubber blanket , upon which are arranged for use , guns , ammunition , lunch and a bottle -- of water . The decoys are placed out in long range , in such a manner as to make them appear as natural looking as possible , and then we are ready for business . Now here they come -- a flock of seven geese , plump down among the stool , but get up again with equal haste . Two of them are knocked down with the breech-loader , one dead , the other only wounded -- a third stopped by the muzzle-loader . Theodoric was dreamily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bunch of sprig-tail swooped dawn , hovering above the stool . He picked his bird , and dropped two with the first barrel , and another responded to the discharge of the second . They came tumbling down into the water -- dead . One could not easily imagine a duck 's head capable of expression , but when they come lively , alight among the dummies , and hear no quack of recognition , they soon discover the fraud , and the frightened haste with which they gather themselves up and attempt to make off , is expression all over . Crege , who is one of the best amateur shots on Long Island , as a medal now in his possession will attest , had taken his number twelve , and walked the marshes for snipe . So far as the ducks were concerned , he had missed the sport , but he brought in a bunch of forty-five English snipe , which compared favorably with the success of the others . Crege is a superior marksman , but he shoots much better when the boys gather about the table at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their shots over again , and trot their horses at impossible speed . O'Kelly is one of the constitutionally chosen Senators for the great State of New York , is a prime shot , an enthusiastic sportsman , and one of the most genial of our friends . He had located on a distant island , and expended powder and shot with his usual prowess -- returning laden with game . This was decidedly the best day we had had , and the score was as follows : Charles , nineteen canvas-back , eleven teal , three geese and twelve red-head , mallard and black duck ; Theodoric brought in sixty-five birds -- canvas-back , red-head , sprig-tail and black-head ; O'Kelly , who had had surprising luck , counted fifty canvas-back , and twenty-five common ducks . It was a good count , and the game was hung up in the boat house with the other birds . Illustration : SNIPE SHOOTING . Illustration : FIVE AT A SHOT . Many of the natives are professional gunners , and haunt the marshes day and night , shooting for market , and thus making a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resort to these people and purchase a boat load . It is , however , a reprehensible practice . There is no tide in the Sound except that which is caused by the wind , and as high water and a stiff breeze are essential to good sport , it is not possible to have good shooting every day . When the wind comes from the right quarter it makes a full tide , and drives the fowl nearer the shore and up into the creeks where they may feed . It was getting toward the end of our sojourn ; we had experienced several quiet balmy days -- no wind , low water , general listlessness . " Should we have any more fun ? " we asked , and went to bed . About midnight the wind came howling through the trees , the weather became cold , and the rattling windows responded to the hope of a good day to-morrow . Getting our breakfast early , we selected our points and hastened to the boats . Dark clouds , flying over a dull wintry sky , denoted a steady blow -- it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decoys thrown out . Only a few birds were flying , the fitful wind becoming higher and higher and then dying out entirely . The clouds , however , soon drifted away , the sun appeared as bright and beautiful as summer -- almost persuading us to take off our coats . Disheartened at the coquettish nature of the weather , we gave it up . Not a bird to be seen -- we took our bottles , and throwing our heads back on our shoulders , tried to look through the bottoms of them -- they in turn gave out a gurgling sound of complaining emptiness . We fell into a refreshing sleep ; the hours passed away unheeded , until we were awakened by the rustling of the reeds bending in the breeze , whispering of the coveted blow . Heavy black clouds were gathering , and soon old Boreas came cracking out from the right point of the compass . This aroused the ducks in the open water to flight , and they came in , seeking the shelter of the shore -- a fatal protection . Charles , the original explorer of the Sound as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hall " Club , did some good work -- taking them , right and left , with each barrel , and dropping single blue-winged teal with unerring aim . Theodoric is the most amiable , patient friend imaginable ; can conduct a bank equal to any man in New York ; and we all esteem him very much . He labors under the mild hallucination , however , that he must be constantly doing something , and nearly all this is expended in cleaning his gun . Morning and evening it undergoes this polishing process , and on Sunday he rests himself by giving it another wipe . " It 's a little leaded , you know , George , " he remarks , and at it he goes . Human nature may stand this , but guns wo n't . On one occasion when he tried to jam a cleaning rod through it , larger than the bore , it refused to go . Illustration : " I KNEW IT WOULD COME OUT . " " You wo n't , wo n't you , " said he , as he raised it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the floor . It went in ; but the gun bulged just as any good gun will do , and the eruption yet stands on the barrel , a monument of his determination . Steve was called in , and a pulling match ensued . Steve had hold of the gun and Thee firmly clenched the rod . The gun could stand the combined strength of two powerful men no better than it could resist the jamming of the rod , and they parted . Steve went backwards over Mary Rogers , a dog , and took a moist seat in a tub of warm water , which had been prepared for cleaning guns . Steve said the water was hot , while our fastidious friend looked bland , gathered himself up from out a pile of empty shells , mixed with scraps of red flannel and oil-rags , and said " I knew it would come out .

After getting his line arranged to his satisfaction , he took firm hold of it a few feet above the squid ; we all looked admiringly on . By a series of dexterous gyrations about his head he sent it flying a hundred feet out into the water -- it was beautifully done . Skillfully he hauled it in , hand over hand . The squid followed , as bright and shining as when he had cast it out , but no fish . He made ready again , and with that nonchalant air of a man who feels perfectly sure that he can do just what he wants to , he gave it that preparatory whirling motion again , and away it went .

Paullo is a good shot -- with a knife and fork -- and can look on at others who are doing hard work , with more nerve and complacency than any man who visits the Sound . He had been persuaded to go to a certain pond where ducks were abundant and easy to shoot . This was good ; he put his decoys out and waited . A bird was coming down -- it went among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feathered tribe , with a bill like a crow . In some places it is known as a crow duck , but the proper local name here is " blue-peter . " Blue-peter seemed to have no fear , but sported around and among the dummies , and tossed the bright drops of water from its shining plumage . With the true feelings of a sportsman , Paullo wanted the bird to have a fair chance , and so tossed bunches of marsh grass at it -- it would not fly . Picking up his gun he fired , wounding several decoys . Illustration : BATTLE WITH BLUE-PETER . The battle raged all that day and the next , blue-peter diving at the flash of the gun , and defiantly coming up and wailing for it to be reloaded . Illustration : STRUCK IT WITH A CLUB .

We remained on the beach four weeks , and had many pleasant days .

If two birds fall , with almost human intelligence he gets both . Taking the farthest first , stopping on his way in to pick up the other , he comes in with one swinging on each side of his great shaggy head . They tell of him that he has been caught stealing sheep . We do not believe it -- it is a mistake ; he may have been in bad company , that is all .

" A jolly place , " said he , " in times of old , But something ails it now ; the place is curst . " Far up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hundreds of small islands which dot the river in that picturesque region , is one which has the reputation of being haunted . It is but a few miles above the ferry at the Point of Rocks , and is unknown to the thousands of persons who are whirled past there every year in the railroad trains . This island is about fifty acres in extent , and is bordered with stately oaks to the very river 's edge -- whose waters lave their roots ; its margin is paved with pearly pebbles , while the drooping branches of the trees , festooned with tangled vines of every hue , hang down in glorious clusters , toying with the blue stream which runs beneath . The scenery here is truly enchanting . Islands of every size seem floating in a charmed atmosphere ; to pass one pleasing spot is but to disclose another more beautiful than the last . Some are covered with a forest growth ; others cultivated , and waving in the summer breeze with yellow ripening grain ; and yet others are overgrown with varied shrubs , filled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been fishing -- had fished the river from the ferry up above and around the island . I was well satisfied with the day 's sport , and was sitting in the stern of the boat in a sort of day dream . Jasper , my boatman , was gently guiding the little vessel to keep it from striking the many projecting rocks , as well as to prevent it from gliding too rapidly down the current . The river , changed to a dark green color , from the reflected foliage , ran now deep and sluggish against the huge boulders which stand defiantly up : now over shallow places , shining with silver sand , fretting itself into white foam and flinging up jets of spray as if in anger . Waking from my reverie , I said : " Jasper , that is a tranquil-looking island ; to whom does it belong ? " Jasper shook his woolly head as if he were puzzled , and with the air of a person about to impart some awful secret , replied : " Dat do n't belong to nobody ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is impossible . There are no such things as haunted places . " " Well , massa , " he replied , his faith still unshaken , " dat 's what I was tole long , long years ago when I was a chile . Ye could hear noises comin ' fum da like distress , and dem sounds war jined wid de talkin ' ob men . " " Very likely , but such sounds came from persons on the island , and they were living , just as you and I are . " " Dar war sounds , " answered my boatman , " but da war n't no people on dat island . Dem sounds war n't ob dis world . " Such an opinion could not be weakened , for my dusky companion had been raised in this local superstition and it was as firmly rooted as was his faith in future forgiveness , and so I merely inquired : " Is there a house there , Jasper ? " " Yes sar , " said he , promptly , " da am a big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We must go and see what it looks like , and try to learn where those sounds came from . " " S'cuse me , massa , dis chile do n't set he foot on dat lan ' , kase ef he do , he neber leabe it agin . " " Then if you are afraid , " said I , tauntingly , " I will go alone ; you wait until I return . " " Massa , " implored the frightened negro , " do n't go ; you neber kum back ; you is lost . " " Take me as near the shore as you dare go , and leave me there . " " Good-bye , massa ; you is lost foreber . " Jasper took up the oar and pushed as near the shore as the shallow water would permit ; the keel of the boat grated on the sandy shore . I stepped over the side of the boat and waded close up under the overhanging branches , and forced my way through the dense growth which shut this mysterious place from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the centre of the island stood the remains of a large stone mansion , surrounded by what had once been a well-kept lawn . The grass was growing green and rank , mingled with weeds , and both were struggling for the mastery . Broken statues of costly marble and workmanship were lying scattered about ; great flower vases , shattered , and green with the mould and moss of years , were covered with weak and flowerless creepers . The house is a two-story one with windows on every side , or rather openings which had been windows at some former period . The dangling remains of a heavy porch hung over the doorway , ready to fall and crush the first careless intruder , while the massive oak doors stood wide open as if to invite the victim within . The cornice was dropping to pieces , and the woodwork had only the appearance of solidity -- it needed but the pressure of a hand to crumble into dust . The walls were yet perfect , for they had been built of irregular sized stones , laid up in cement , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costly structure . Inside the great doors was a wide hall of about twenty feet , and its floors of hard wood had stood the test of time remarkably . On one side of the hall was a room the whole depth of the house ; the ceiling was lofty , but the plaster had long since fallen and become mere powder . It was empty ; patches of mould had fastened upon the walls , and a damp decaying odor pervaded the air ; insects and loathsome reptiles crept over the floor . On the opposite side of the hall were two apartments , but not enough of either remained to divine what had been their uses . In a small back room there yet was to be seen a great open fire-place capacious enough to roll in a good-sized tree ; a swinging crane was bolted to the corner of the chimney , supporting hanging hooks , blackened by soot ; it had doubtless been the kitchen . Having fully explored the lower part , I proceeded to the upper story . As I mounted the stairs , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to enable me to complete the task I had undertaken . The upper floor was divided into four large chambers . Three of them were given up to decay , and desolation peered from every corner and crevice . Bats had made their nests in and about the broken places , and hung in bunches from the ceiling ; the twitter of the young swallows could be heard plainly from the chimneys . I passed on to the fourth room ; that was not vacant . Although the sash had long since dropped in pieces , and fragments of glass yet littered the floor , this chamber was occupied ; not indeed by any living thing , but by the inanimate remains of a once proudly furnished mansion , and also by yet one other object , which though not living had the power of movement . In one corner stood an old fashioned high-post bedstead , of the finest curled maple , curiously carved and ornamented . A sort of frame held the tops of the posts together , from which still hung threads of costly curtains intertwined with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There were no chairs , no tables , but in another corner of the apartment stood an antique writing-desk , with metal handles to the drawers , and brass feet fashioned after the claws of the lion , older than the bedstead which occupied the other corner . Its polish and usefulness had passed away with the grandeur of this silent habitation . Between two of the windows was a space of six feet in width , reaching from the floor to the cornice . This was all occupied by a life-size portrait of a female , which looked as fresh and fair as the day it left the hands of the artist . All else about this solemn place was weird and death-like ; there she stood in her loveliness , as if just attired for some merry-making ; her rosy lips seemed ready to break out into song and laughter and shout , to startle this ghostly scene . " What could this mean ? " I asked myself . " Why had all the work of man perished , crumbled into dust , and this lovely image not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could stand here untouched amid this ruin -- defying time ? Was it the semblance of the mistress of this once rich abode ? Had she loved with more ardor than reason ? Was she waiting for some one to enter this doomed edifice that we might tell her story and fulfill her destiny ? " I asked myself all these questions over again , as I stood spell-bound , gazing at this beautiful vision . She was symmetry itself ; her hair was golden-hued , and flowed in sunny profusion down over her beauteous neck and shoulders ; the painter 's art had not exaggerated her natural grace and dignity -- she was beauty unadorned . The dress was of white satin , with the puffed sleeves and short waist of the last century . A broad pink sash , fastened in front at the waist , reached down to a pair of tiny feet , clothed in rich embroidered slippers . I felt as if I was in the presence of a living human being , and that she might at any moment chide me for breaking the silence of this desolate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which runneth in the blood of man , I shuddered , grew weak and faint ; great drops of cold perspiration started out from my forehead , and I turned to see if some supernatural mechanism had not closed the door and entombed me with the lovely phantom . It was still open ; its rust-eaten hinges had long since ceased to act . I was free to go , but , with the infatuation of curiosity , I could not move ; I stood in my tracks and ventured to look again . A sound of rustling drapery startled me . Great heavens ! this image , which seemed a moment before but a part of the solid wall , had moved and stood in the centre of the room . Slowly she raised her right arm , and with extended finger pointed to the old and faded escritoire . Mechanically my eyes took the direction toward which she pointed . I saw the doors of the cabinet tumble from their fastenings and fall to the floor with a startling crash , while her attitude commanded me , imperatively , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buried secret . I did so . In it was nothing except a small time-stained memorandum-book , the edges fastened by a silver clasp . I took it up . It contained the following strange story of the Haunted Island . Here it is : " MARRIED.  - -  On the 27th of May , 1794 , at Rock Creek church , in the territory of Columbia , by the Rev. Mr. Rolf , John Othard to Marie Othard . " " John Othard and myself were cousins ; we had been brought up beneath the same roof , and been schoolmates and constant companions from childhood . He was my boyish lover and protector . He had grown to manhood , I was a few years younger , and we had vowed eternal constancy to each other . When , however , too late , our parents discovered our fondness for each other , and knew that we were betrothed , they interposed objections ; and after exhausting all mild means , they threatened us with their displeasure , said they would disown and disinherit us ; that if we persevered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paternal roof forever ; that the union would be unlawful and wicked . The tie of blood , they said , was too close , and could be fruitful only of misery and ruin -- an unhappy , sinful match . We had been walking , John and I , and talking as usual over our doleful fate and prospects , and what seemed to us the absurd notions of our parents . He had been trying to persuade me to disregard what he termed the obstinacy of the old folks , and said impatiently : " ' Come , Marie , when will you consent to be mine ? We are old enough to judge of our own affairs . If our families are determined on driving us out with scorn , let us be equally so to convince them how very harmlessly it will fall . I can support you ; they may keep their money , and bestow their curses . ' " ' No , not yet , John ; let this cloud which now hangs over us pass away first ; it may , ere long , be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very happy we shall be to know that we did not court the anger of our relatives . Let us not act hastily . ' " ' Ah ! my dear Marie , women do not understand these matters quite as well as men . I really think you share their idle superstitions . Do you not ? ' " ' You may call them superstitions if you will , but my sense of propriety tells me that we should wait . We could not be happy with their malediction pending over us . ' " ' That is prattle . Notwithstanding these fears , we may be as prosperous and happy as though we had come from the opposite sides of the earth , and if you consent , they will be compelled to acknowledge it . " ' Our marriage , when solemnized by the proper authorities , will be as far above their idle prejudices as the heavens are above us all . ' " ' Still , John , we must wait . ' " ' Yes , and wait . Who ever taught us , until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in sin -- if it is sin ? " ' Why did they permit the seed of our childish friendship to ripen into the full flower of love , and then blast it with the frost of parental authority ? ' " ' Dear John , do not lose your temper . I think you are right in that , but let us be brave , and not set aside , too lightly , our duty to those whose only solicitude can be that we do no wrong . ' " ' I was a little impatient , to be sure . I will respect your wish , Marie . I will wait , but it must not be here . " ' I will go out into the busy world for a year or two , and then return to claim you . If I do not come back to you rich , I will at least have enough to give us a good start in the world . ' " ' John , ' I said , placing my hand in his , ' I shall miss you very much , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you do not bring with you a wife , to give us a practical demonstration that your love was a mere fancy . ' " ' Not I , dearest ; I will remain as true to you , through every vicissitude , as I now think you to be true . " ' But you , who knows but I may live to find that you have obviated the trouble by marrying a man who is not your cousin , just to make the theory of certain persons good ? ' " ' Trust me ; I am worthy of your love ; and now , good bye . God bless and care for you . ' " ' May He bless and protect you , Marie . ' " ' He went off that same day . For the first few months his letters to me were frequent , and always filled with sentiments of love and constancy . Then the intervals became longer , and longer , then ceased altogether . ' He is in a large city , I thought , and in the whirl of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , perhaps , has taken my place ; his heart has another idol . No , I reasoned with myself ; that can not be , he has become very poor and has married for money , thinking I would never relent . ' " ' Months passed rapidly away , faded into years , and yet no tidings came . This silence and uncertainty were wearing tear channels down my cheeks . I waited on ; and though pained and sickened , like a true woman I never allowed my tongue to disclose the anguish I suffered . The wolf was gnawing at my heart ; if the lines I felt growing more marked on my features did not tell the story , it was my secret , and I kept it . ' " ' One morning , after an absence of three years , John suddenly made his appearance -- without a note of warning . He seemed somewhat older , and his face had lost that impetuous look of boyhood . But he was handsome ever , and just the same loving fellow . ' " ' I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been thinking of you constantly , Marie . ' " ' Why , then , have you been absent so long , and why for two years have you not written to me -- not even a line ? ' " ' I have been fighting in a great , crowded city for a competency . The battle was fierce and long ; sometimes I was lost in the busy , swaying multitude ; but I have gained it , and I am here to know if you will go and share it with me . " " ' Yes , I am ready and willing to go , though I am sure we shall be driven out and away from the family fold ; be branded as wantons , outcasts , by all we love most dear . ' " ' Leave your fears outside the church door , my darling , for we can defy them so far as money is the question . I have enough . We will build ourselves a home in some retired spot , and be so happy that they will seek us , and be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ erred . ' " I could not resist such persuasion from the only man I had ever loved . I consented at once , and the next day we were married . In accord with my own desire , we bought this embowered island , and built this spacious home . It had everything in and about it that taste could fancy and wealth purchase . It was quite a heaven for me . We were so happy , and he never left me . We sat beneath the grand old trees and talked of our future prospects , read our favorite books , and I loved those best which we had read together . It seemed too much happiness to last long ; sometimes I felt as if the shadow of sorrow was threatening our home . Yet all was serene , and I dismissed my fears . It had not yet come ; but it was coming though , as slowly yet as surely as the distant muttering of thunder portends the approaching storm . An indefinable dread of something impending clung to me . I could not rid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from home . He had business in this city , and then in that one ; his journeys became more frequent and of longer duration . After one of these visits he returned wearied and not at all like himself ; care was on his brow , and his manner betokened some great grief . I said : " ' John , dear , it is two weeks since you left me , and you promised to return the same day . What is the matter ? are you in trouble ? You must be , for your face has that pinched look which nothing but extreme anxiety can produce . Confide in me . ' " ' Nothing very serious , my dear child , ' he replied , ' it will soon be over ; only a temporary embarrassment ; some unlucky speculations . ' Then he gave me a kiss , smiled as he used to do , and said I was a baby . " ' Ah , John , your words buoy me up and make me feel almost happy again . ' " ' Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have my business all in shape again , I will never leave you , but remain here , where , if you can not see me every moment , you can hear me . ' " ' Oh , that will be such joy for me . But do you know , John , that while I have waited , and waited , to hear the splash of the oars as you crossed from the shore , I have conjured up all sorts of things ? Sometimes I have thought that perhaps --  ' " ' Perhaps what ? ' " ' That the chains of Cupid had been woven around you during your first absence , and that you might have returned to her who --  ' " ' Just what a foolish woman always supposes . Why I have been as true to you as the waters of the glorious river , which sweeps past our island home , have been constant in their tendency toward the sea . ' " ' I believe it , and now you will pardon me , will you , not ? ' " ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , had I been as faithful to myself as I have been loyal to you , I would not now be suffering the woe you have so plainly seen on my face . ' " ' Tell me , dear , for I can guide you out of it -- I know I can . ' " ' No , not now , ' he answered ; then he kissed me and walked away . " Something terrible was coming -- I knew it . The curses which had been heaped upon us for disobedience were about to bear fruit . Now , strange , rough-looking men came to see my husband -- persons whom I had not seen before . They seemed familiar with him ; it was evident , however , that their presence was distasteful to him ; he tried to keep them at a distance , he shrank from them . I said I did not like these acquaintances ; he replied that they were commercial friends , and must be treated with respect . They had long and mysterious conversations together . They would go to the other shore and return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night the dip of oars was heard , and as the boat was run upon the pebbly shore , four men stepped briskly out , and laboriously lifted and carried a large , heavy , oblong box , and placed it in the cellar . John said it was merchandise , and must be stored ; it was unsalable now , and it was best to keep it until there was a market for it . " ' But , John , why can it not be stored in the city , where it would be at hand when the demand arises for it , and why do these uncouth-looking men bring it at the dead of night ? It would have been easier , and certainly more pleasant , to have brought it in the daylight . ' " ' My dear little sweetheart , ' he turned and said abruptly , ' women know nothing of business matters , and you would not understand me if I explained it all . ' " ' You are deceiving me ; for it does not require a business education to enable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a midnight transaction such as this . ' " He deigned no explanation , but answered half kindly , half sarcastically , ' Good night ; ask no more of your puzzling questions . Take this kiss ; you are a little nervous and disturbed in temper , you need rest -- go to bed . ' " He dismissed me with another kiss , as he had often done before . It was the first to have a tinge of bitterness to it . I was far from satisfied . What could this occupation be , that required him to remain away so long and gather about him such associates ? He had been gone a whole month . Oh , what a weary , unhappy , dreary month that was for me !  - -  I thought it would never end . Why could not the fates let loose their wrath all at once ? Why was not all revealed ? I wept myself asleep , and was frightened into wakefulness by some horrid dream . I took up the newspaper and tried to read it ; the letters all ran together . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1798 . Instinctively my eyes caught the following notice : " Counterfeit Dollars . The public are requested to be on their guard with respect to a number of counterfeit dollars of the United States , now passing in this city . They are made of block-tin and pewter , and , if not quite new , may be detected on sight . They are well cast , and , therefore , the impression is exact ; but the milling around the edge is nothing like the true dollar , thereby may be easily known . They are about four penny-weights too light . " " The paper fell from my hands . Why I could not tell , and yet the reading of that paragraph seemed connected with my life . Had that box merchandise in it ? Had my husband become one of a gang of base money coiners ? He could not have fallen so low ; he was too good and too honest . That mysterious box was always present , turn which way I would . I felt impelled to go to the cellar and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking ; it would ease my troubled brain . I took the lantern and stealthily groped my way down into the damp earthy atmosphere . It was silent as death there ; the dim light revealed nothing but the box . I held the lantern up over it , and the uncertain flickering of its rays fell upon the lid . There was no denying the ownership , it was marked in large bold letters , ' John Othard . ' Now , I must know what it contained ; I could wait no longer ; a sort of determined malice took possession of me to connect it with the newspaper , and with my husband -- fiendish thought . I did not desire to prove him other than the pure and noble man I had loved ; but I was not myself -- I would do it just to still my excited suspicions . Putting the lamp down over the name , as if that could blot it out , I went up the creaking steps , and hastened back with the axe firmly clenched in both hands , as if I feared a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hesitated whether to strike or not -- the blow was to reveal joy or eternal misery to me . To leave the fatal box to itself , and go to my chamber , was to be racked with horrible doubts . I seized again the axe , and with repeated blows splintered the cover ; then , with bleeding hands I ripped it off and hurled it from me . Yes , there , wrapped in rolls , shining with damnable brilliancy , was my husband 's secret . I was first stunned then frantic ; cursed myself and him ; wished I had been unable to read ; that I had been blind , dead , rather than find him whom I had enshrined in my heart of hearts as a god , so unworthy . He would go to a felon 's cell -- perhaps to an ignominious death -- and me , where could I go ? I left the dreadful thing uncovered ; as I backed away from it toward the stairway , those glittering witnesses grinned at me . I walked the floor all night -- I could not rest . The angel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my frame , and the angel of death was spreading his baneful wings over me . " Dawn surprised with its unwelcome light , and found me a shivering , crouching wretch . That incestuous love with which we had defied the fates , had now borne its full fruit . " About mid-day John came home . Despair had cooled me . I handed him the paper and pointed to the notice . I watched his eager face while he read it . He flushed and paled , and raising his eyes to meet mine , asked if I knew all . " ' Yes , I do know all . The box contains base coin . I have seen them . They are there , and will consign you to a prison and me to my grave ; that is , if there lives one single , pitying human being , who will take the trouble to heap the sod over a friendless , homeless wretch , as I now am . ' " ' Calm yourself , darling ; they can not connect me with it . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and they dare not tell . ' " He went to the cellar . I could hear him working away and talking excitedly to himself . I approached the steps and listened . He had ceased for a moment , I could hear his heavy breathing . I stepped down a few steps ; he turned toward me , coat off ; his face grimed with perspiration and dirt , he glared upon me . ' Aha , you come too late ; I have concealed it , I am not the owner of it ; you can not prove me guilty . ' His mind was wandering ; he imagined the officers were come to take him . I moved toward him ; a pistol shot , a heavy fall , and he had escaped -- so far as human penalty was concerned . Here I was , alone , on this accursed island ; even the servants had fled in terror , and left me with the dead body of my husband . His blood ran from the wound , and formed in little pools , which the thirsty black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I strong with frenzy ; the method of madness was on me ; I seized the tools , which the suicide had left , and commenced to dig what must now be a grave -- wider , and deeper , and longer I dug it ; then settled the body into it ; and covering it up , heaped and rounded it . I did not mind the work ; it was excitement and kept me from dying . I went out into the open air -- it was not yet light -- the peaceful heavens gave no sign of wrath , and the bright twinkling stars looked down upon this scene of crime , and madness , and suicide , as serenely as they had before the island was changed from a domestic paradise to a pandemonium . I hear him calling , as if from the river ; it is a stifled cry for assistance . I must go to him . I can save him , and I --  " The newspaper of that period contained the following : " The body of a female was found floating in the river at the Great Falls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FAIRIES OF WARM SPRING MOUNTAIN .

There the wild deer roams in solitude and security , and there the daring of man has never penetrated . Grim old sentinels , clothed with verdure to their very summits , frown down upon coeval valleys which they protect , and through which they send their bower-born springs with gurgling music to the smiling plains , and onward , broadening into majestic rivers . The valleys , as if conscious of and grateful for the protection , run up to meet and embrace their gigantic guardians , with offerings of wild flowers and many-hued foliage .

A bald spot -- rock -- whose face has borne the violence of the storm for ages , yet defiantly stands there , inviting the fury of its ancient enemy . The clouds , broken into fantastic forms , cast gossamer shadows , which go floating phantom-like , away , as unreal as spirits and as tranquil as the promised land . Jutting crags , piled up in grotesque confusion , capped by monstrous rocky platforms , overhang the leafy depths . The rail track , like a glistening serpent , winds its way along the narrow shore , and over bridges light and fanciful , mere webs , spun by human spiders , spanning streams which foam their anger through narrow passes . Beneath , in a distant valley , the river , like a shining thread , flows on through tangled thickets , past populous towns and lowly huts . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone by , when the world first began , they were peopled by a race of fairies . These little creatures lived and reveled in these grand old forests , and made them joyous with their merry shouts and sports . They knew no care , and nightly gathered beneath the spreading branches , sporting until the gray of morning drove them to their hiding places . They wantoned in the cool streams and swung in the pendant flowering vines , while the moon sent her silvery light down through the trembling leaves to light them on their way . The daylight was hateful to them , and all day long they passed the time in secret bowers and mossy recesses , away from the light , and only left them when the starry heavens bade them forth again to their nightly revels . Thus , these happy little people lived , and far and near through all the woods , yielded willing allegiance to a queen , majestic , lovely , and beloved by her tribes . Her sway was mild , for mutual kindness was the bond between them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noticed that her sweet face wore a troubled look ; that she had not as usual joined in their pleasures , nor even approved of them . They felt that some dreadful secret filled her heart and clouded her brow , yet what it was none dared to ask , and she herself remained silent . They would willingly have died to free her from this sorrow , but they knew not what to do . They surrounded her and said : " Beloved sovereign , may we not share thy grief ? " " It may be , soon , " she replied . " Have we caused you pain ? Have we not been dutiful ? " " My sorrow , dear people , is not of your creation ; you have ever been loving , faithful subjects . " " What , then , can we do to show our devotion to you ? " " Our season of enjoyment , my subjects , is almost gone , and soon we must hide ourselves to escape the cold . When the spring returns again you shall learn it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The winter was dead and passed away , and the genial breath of spring wafted silently over his grave , evoking glowing treasures from the ruin he had left . The earth , alive again , put forth its most beautiful creations , and tempted once more the fairies of the mountains to appear . The queen , true to her promise , sent swift messengers to her remotest people ; she summoned them all to her presence . They came in troops , and filled the mountain tops and sides , and reached down into the valleys . She welcomed them as they approached her . In majesty she was seated upon a summer throne . It was formed of the finest woods of the forest , and quaintly fashioned by the little work-people . It was cushioned with the most delicate mosses , and wild vines had been trained up and over and around it , blending charmingly with the rustic woodwork . Above her tiny head spread a canopy of delicate twigs , twisted into fantastic shapes by skillful hands , and roofed with the glittering wings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not even a drop of dew could penetrate . It was right royal , and she was worthy of it . Near the queen 's pavilion were ranged the principal leaders of the various tribes , together with her most favored advisers . Her eyes , sad and mournful , wandered over this vast assemblage of devoted friends . " My people , " she commenced , " as I promised , I have called you from your sylvan abodes to impart what I have too long concealed . It has been known to myself alone that the period for our allotted stay upon earth has almost expired . In a short time we must go , forever , from these scenes of pleasure -- from these woody retreats where we have known so many joys . Our places will soon be taken by the sons of men . It is our fate that when they come we must disappear . Through all our lives we have done nothing but waste our time in pursuit of mere pleasure , hastening the time of our banishment and doing good to no one . Like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will have sipped the sweets of life and left no mark that we ever existed . It is my wish ere we go , that we do something by which we may be remembered . " Let us bestow upon mankind a gift so great that it shall last them forever , and which they may enjoy and bless us for to the end of time . Such a gift is within our reach , but we have never sought it for ourselves . " With one voice they said --  " What shall it be ? The will of our queen is our pleasure . " " I was sure of it , " she said . " Now listen : It is known to us all that within this very mountain the purest waters are imprisoned . But we can release them ; these crystal streams must be set free from their subterranean channels and brought sparkling to the surface . " They all bowed obedience , and asked when this great task should be commenced . " Let the preparation for this arduous undertaking go forward , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Waste not the time ; let our whole people be employed in making instruments suitable for breaking the crust which confines the treasure we are going to bring forth for the benefit of mankind . We must hasten to our work and be diligent . I dismiss you , but assemble again when next the dreary winter is past and the genial sun warms the buds into leaflets -- when the upland rills have found their voices once more , and come leaping from their hidden birthplaces . " The gentle summer had passed , the winter had again come and gone , and the troops were gathering in response to the command of their mistress . They had been industrious . Each came armed with a stout staff , made from the toughest wood and shod with the hardest flint . In myriads they arrived -- whole armies of them -- and eagerly awaited the command to go forward . They moved in column , headed by captains , down the steep declivities . They toiled with a will . Many died of fatigue , but their places were soon filled by other eager workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bright and beautiful waters gushed forth in great fountains . The fairies have long since disappeared , but the waters still flow and fill the little valley with sweet , health-giving streams .
