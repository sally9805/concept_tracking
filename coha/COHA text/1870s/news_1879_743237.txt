I first looked on Hooker in the midst of the battle of the 5th of May , 1801 , and remember , with a thrill , the words with which he inspired his men to the last victorious charge . I remember him since the war . He was a patriot . He was for his country first , last , and always . In battle he had a charmed life . He stood untouched amid the missiles of treason , but now he lies low before us . He is not dead ; his name will always live in the history of his country . On the day of his death I received a letter from him . It was about the unveiling of the equestrian statue of Gen. George H. Thomas , at Washington , on the 20th inst .

I want it to stand there in the white clouds of a peaceful Summer sky after the storms have passed . " Turning to the casket , he continued , " Farewell , farewell , Gen. Hooker , responds in many a sad heart to-day . Thy spirit inspired us when our country was in danger . The inspiration of thy character led them to scale the sides of Lookout Hill .
