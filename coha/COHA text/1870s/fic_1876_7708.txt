Trowbridge , J. T. ( John Townsend ) , 1827-1916 : MEMPHIS . from Memphis 1876-1879 At last he seemed to lose it altogether Upon the Mississippi ; where he stayed His course at Memphis , undecided whether He should go back or forward . Here he strayed One afternoon along the esplanade And high bluff of the river-fronting town , To watch the boats and see the sun go down . The lyric fit had left him ; but the sight Of the strong river sweeping vast and slow , Gleaming far off , a flood of crimson light ; And , darkly hung between it and the glow Of a most lovely sunset sky , the low , Interminable forests of Arkansas , Might have inspired some very pretty stanzas . The esplanade looks down upon the landing , A broadly shelving bank , well trodden and bare , Called by a singular misunderstanding The levee ,  --  while there is no levee there ; The famous landing at New Orleans , where There is one , having fixed the name forever For that and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cotton-bales , And bales of hay , awaiting transportation ; Ploughs , household goods , and kegs of rum or nails , Endless supplies for village and plantation , Enclosed a scene of wondrous animation , Of outcry and apparent wild confusion Contrasting with the sunset 's soft illusion ;  --  The steamers lying broadside to the stream , With delicately pillared decks , the clang Of bells , the uproar of escaping steam ; There , tugging at some heavy rope , the gang Of slaves that all together swayed and sang , Their voices rising in a wild , rich chime , To which lithe forms and lithe black arms kept time ; The shouts of negro-drivers , droves of mules , Driven in their turn by madly yelling blacks ; Chairs , tables , kitchen-ware and farming-tools , Carts , wagons , barrels , boxes , bales , and sacks , Pushed , hauled , rolled , tumbled , tossed , or borne on backs Of files of men , across the ways of plank Between the loading steamers and the bank ! Then as the sunlight faded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air , The waves were lighted by the lurid gleam Of flamebeaux that began to smoke and flare , And cast a picturesque and ruddy glare On shore and boats and men of every hue .
