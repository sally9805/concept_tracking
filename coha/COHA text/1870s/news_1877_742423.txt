txt When I was last in Constantinople I was asked to bear here the dispatches which conferred upon Mr. John E. Gueschoff , a naturalized British subject , resident in this town , the office of Vice  --  Consul of the United States . Tho passage of letters through the Turkish post has always been attended with a good deal of risk in divers ways . The curiosity of officials , or the carelessness of messengers , or the suspicion of the authorities might at any time cause the loss or the intentional destruction of any ' packet intrusted to them , and Mr. Gucshoff had requested that his beret and the official document from the State Department might ho forwarded by a safe hand , and not by the ordinary official channel . The Consul-General therefore took advantage of my passage through Philippopolis to forward those papers . Stopping at Adrianople I was strongly tempted by the events which were going forward to linger for a day or two , but there were inducements to press on to the front , and I accordingly spent but one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very fortunate thing for Mr. Gueschoff that I did so , for when I reached Philippupolis I learned from Mr. Calvert , the English Vice-Consul , that the gentleman whose appointment I bore was arrested , and that his early execution was expected . He himself knowing Mr. Gueschoff to have resided for many years in England , and knowing also that he had there taken out papers of naturalization , had made a claim on the Turkish authorities for his release . It turned out , however , that the papers were incomplete or inft anal , and the Turks refused to recognize them . They claimed Mr. Gueschoff as a Turkish subject , and asserted their right to deal with their own as they pleased . It appeared that a Bulgarian called Hadji Dimitri had been sentenced to death here for treason-felony , and that in the hope to save himself ho had professed to be acquainted with all the members of the Insurrectionary Committee , and had offered to denounce them . His execution being stayed for a day , he supplied the authorities with a list in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found . All the people whose names ? were thus given were arrested , . and the unhappy and unworthy wretch whose fears had driven him to this dastardly act was immediately afterward hanged . Mr. Gueschoff studied at Owens College , Manchester , and was to all intents and purposes an English gentleman . He was a frequent correspondent of the London Times . and has been regarded with great dislike on that account ever since the beginning of the war . I can not learn , however , that ho has ever expressed any opinions against Turkish rule other than those which in countries under civilized rule come within the bounds of authorized free speech , and I am instructed that no charge of writing in an insurrectionary fashion can for a moment be sustained against him . Mr. Fawcett , the English Consul-General in Turkey , was with Mr. Calvert when I called upon him , and it was his opinion that if the date of the beret of the Porte should prove to be anterior to Mr. Gueschoff 's arrest , that gentleman was already do facto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Porto had issued the beret after the arrest without knowledge of Mr. Gueschoff 's imprisonment . This was a question which was only capable of solution by the opening of the packet . I opened it in Mr. Fawcett 's presence , and that of several other gentlemen . We found the formal letter of Mr. Eugene Schuyler , Consul-General of the United States , to be dated two days prior to the arrest , and it spoke of thoinclosure of the beret . Tho papers from Washington were dated as far back as m November of last year . It unfortunately luvaeued that although . many of the party spoke Turkish , none of them were able to read it , and it was now proposed that I should go to Mutassariff , accompanied by my dragoman , should show him the document , ascertain its date , and demand that it should at once be placed in Mr. Gueschoff 's hands . On this suggestion I at once acted . The Governor received me with great politeness , and having read the beret , requested that it should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I explained that I wished to discover the gentleman whose official position it recognized , but of him or his whereabouts the Civil Governor said ho knew absolutely nothing . I told hint I had heard that ho had been arrested by the military authorities ; ? that he was already , at the time of his arrest , virtual and actual Vico-Consul for the United States , and that it was my duty to demand his immediate release . That , the Governor replied , was not at all his business . Tho beret ought to have been forwarded some time since , from its date , and all he could do as the matter then stood was to refer me to Ibrahim Pasha , who had just come from Constantinople to take charge of the military trials here . I went next in pursuit of this authority , and found that he had taken the house of one of the wealthier Bulgarian citizens as his official residence . After a delay of an hour I succeeded in obtaining an interview . The Pasha spoke French , and communication with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case having been explained and the beret shown , he told tat o that the document was null and void . It ought to have been presented long since , and could not now , being offered after the arrest of the prisoner , be accepted . I told him that all I wanted to do was to discharge the office with which I had been intrusted , and deliver the papers into Mr. Gueschoff 's hands . To this he gave an angry and imperative refusal . I pointed out that the document had never been rescinded by the Porte , and called his attention to the Sultan 's monogram at its head and to its other signs of authenticity . He replied that he had no doubt of its authenticity . That was not the question . The document came too late , and ho refused to acknowledge it . I then told him that I should at once write to the American Minister , and requested that my message might be allowed to pass . He promised that it should go through without delay or alteration , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until it arrived , beyond sending to his superior authority at the capital for instructions . On leaving him I dispatched the following message to Mr. Horace Maynard , the American Minister at Constantinople : " The gentleman whose appointment as American Vice Consul I carried has been arrested , with his cousin , by military order . Gueschoff is a natural . ized British subject . Please communicate with Messrs . Layard and Schuyler , and demand the remo ? al of both cousins to Constantinople . " On the 1st of September , atter an interval of one whole day , I again called upon the Pasha , when he told me to make myself quite easy Mut the matter . He had received no answer at present , but would not lose a moment in communicating to me the nature of his instructions when they arrived : There the matter rests for the present . There is little or no danger now that the Turkish authorities will venture to proceed to extremities after the representations which have been made to them , but the relatives of the prisoners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the older is in great fear of the result of a transfer of the prisoners to Constantinople , suspecting that a repetition of the old game may be attempted , and his son and nephew disposed of en route , for a pretended attempt to escape . This would be too suspicious , however ; and we may now probably count that the business is satisfactorily settled , so far as the lives and liberty of the two gentlemen are concerned . The elder Gueschoff offered me his hospitality during my stay in Philippopols , but to accept it would have prejudiced both him and myself . LONDON , Sept. ** Derby has informed the signers of the memorials in favor of the Gueschoffs that he has telegraphed Minister Layard to use his best efforts with the Turkish Government in behalf of the Queschoffs unless he has very strong reasens against doing so .
