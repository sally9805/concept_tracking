txt The speech which Senator BLAINE addressed to the Chamber of Commerce , on Tuesday evening , was of a kind which has been plentiful enough for the last dozen years , and which the merchants of New York , however good-naturedly they may sometimes applaud them , can hardly regard as very profitable . It is not a difficult matter for a gentleman like Mr. BLAINE to make a speech of this character at a moment 's notice . He has a large quantity , if not a great variety , of them , which he has prepared from time to time for use in Congress , and it is only a question of measuring off any required amount , adorning it with a few timely allusions , touching it with the necessary dashes of after-dinner pleasantry , and serving it to a tolerant audience . But whatever may be the momentary success of such oratory , it is of a type which , coming from a prominent member of the upper house of Congress , does not promise very much for the judicious and effectual treatment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'S speech belongs to that imposing body of eloquence which , curiously enough , owes its origin largely to the excursions which various corporations have made to Washington to obtain aid from the National Treasury in the foundation or maintenance of steam-ship lines . Very naturally , it has for its basis ? so far as it has a basis ? the theory that the carrying trade of the country can be revived or promoted only by liberal support , direct or indirect , from the National Government . Its authors delight in statistics of the respective shares of American and foreign ship-owners in the business of transportation to and from American ports . They bring a long array of figures , generally loosely put together , and often very fallaciously applied , to show that this business is almost entirely in the hands of foreigners ; they then assume , contrary to the facts , as it has happened of late , that it is very profitable , and they invariably suggest , if they do not assert , that in order to turn this Pactolian stream into American pockets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of American steam-ship lines to a sufficient number of foreign ports . Not infrequently arguments of this sort are embellished by patriotic allusions to the merchant marine as the nursery of sailors , and the claims of the subsidy-seekers are reinforced by appeals to the pride with which the nation remembers the exploits of JOHN PAUL JONES and Commodore PERRY . But the main reliance of the speakers is on the reasoning that an enormously profitable carrying . trade can be secured for the United States by judicious and generous appropriations from the National Treasury . It has been frequently suggested by practical business men , who are accustomed to deal with questions of profit and loss from the well-defined stand-point of personal experience , that if Congress would acknowledge in citizens of the ' United States the right to buy ships where they can buy them cheapest , they would soon wrest from foreign competitors all the profit that could be got out of the carrying trade , and that without any tax , direct or indirect , upon the community at large . But this solution of the problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paternal school . They insist upon the intervention of the Government to protect the interests of each ' class at the expense of others . If it is argued that subsidies are only a form of taxation , and that the burden is more justly distributed by paying freights to foreign vessels than by paying subsidies to American ship-owners , the reply is that ships can be built more cheaply in America than anywhere else . If this be the case , it would seem to be perfectly safe to leave American ships to compete in open market with foreign ships . Ship-buyers will not go abroad to get at a high price the vessels which they can get at a low one at home . Perfect freedom for the purchaser would soon decide so simple a point as this . If , as Mr. BLAINE thinks , $110,000,000 a year clear profit is to be made from the carrying trade , and American shippers were allowed to get ships wherever they could find them as cheaply as the Englishmen , the Germans , and the Swedes , whom Mr. BLAINE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commerce , we may trust Yankee enterprise , courage , foresight , and skill to get their fair share of it . But the reply to this common-sense suggestion is , that while it is eminently desirable that our citizens should enjoy the profits of the carrying trade , it is equally desirable that they should monopolize the profits of ship-building . " Free ships , " according to the gentlemen who insist on regulating commercial interests from Washington , instead of leaving them to regulate themselves by the higher law of untrammeled competition , would deprive the American ship-builder of his inalienable right to the home market . Such an argument applied within the range of ordinary business operations would be treated very summarily by any practical business man . If he were told that he must buy his bricks in New-York instead of in New-Jersey , if he wished to build a house , and was assured that in doing so he would suffer no loss , he would answer that he could judge better of that than any one else , and that the only sensible way of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If , at the same time , he were asked to contribute to a fund to maintain the brick-makiug business in his own State , he would instantly see that the whole system of regulating his affairs by statute was a mistaken one , and that its different parts were absolutely inconsistent with each other . Yet our merchants are apparently contented to listen with patience , year after year , on the subject of foreign commerce to statesmen whose theories and arguments are inconsistent with the plainest teachings of ordinary experience . Methods which they would recognize as in the highest degree foolish , arbitrary , unjust , and impracticable , if applied to the affairs of any one city or State , they tolerate when advocated as applicable - to the affairs and interests of our country in its relations with others . By its extent , the community we call the nation becomes an indefinite and confused conception in their minds , and they are fain to imagine that it possesses some mysterious quality which enables it to defy the laws that compel respect from smaller communities , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school appeal to sustain their schemes .
