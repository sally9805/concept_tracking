txt Yesterday Mr. MILLER , Superintendent of Insurance , called two gentlemen connected with the management of this paper before the Committee now inquiring into the charges against him . His object in doing this was not very clear to those gentlemen when they received the subpconas , for they know of nothing which they could testify in Mr. MILLER 'S behalf . It subsequently appeared that they were called in order that they might be asked to disclose the authorities for the information published in these columns . We have no desire to make any . harsh criticism upon Mr. MILLER for adopting this course . A8 he said yesterday , he is an accused man , and . if he honestly desires to get face to face with his accusers , we respect hint very much more for that than we are able to respect those of his accusers who keep carefully out of the way . In all such matters as these the conductors of newspapers , as will instantly be seen by any one who thinks over it , are placed in a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information on subjects in which they are more or less directly interested . Careful inquiry is made as to their fitness for dealing with these subjects , their knowledge of the facts , their good faith , and similar points . The information , probably , comes from many different sources ; its accuracy is vouched for by persons who seem thoroughly worthy to be trusted . If the subject is one of considerable public importance  --  involving , perhaps , a grave abuse or scandal ? an editor can scarcely turn a deaf ear to the appeals made to him . Especially does this appear to be the case when au editor has no personal interest in the subject . Now this was our situation in regard to Mr. MILLER . Until yesterday , none of the conductors of this paper ever saw his face , and they have always been entirely free from ill will toward him . They are not interested in insurance business . They simply receive numerous complaints from various sources about Mr. Mtr.r .. Eit 's dealings with the insurance companies , and they do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But we must say ( as Mr. MILLER was told yesterday by one of the gentlemen referred to ) that when a newspaper is the means of bringing about the investigation so eagerly demanded by its informants , it is the duty of those informants to see that the evidence which they have given to the newspaper is produced before the investigating Committee . It is the same difficulty that occurs in reference to the corrupt Judges . For years past we have been besieged by lawyers and others complaining of these Judges , and asking us to " expose " them . We have exposed them . Our part is done . Are our informants doing their part ? We hope so , but have grave doubts about it . But were these persons much more remiss than we fear they are , it would afford no justification for our betraying the confidence which is reposed in us . We can not give un their names . We are obliged to take the consequences of any misstatements we make , and . do not seek to shuffle off that responsibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wanton and malicious libel had been uttered , in which it would . be right to reveal our sources of information ; but we can not admit that Mr. MILLER 'S is a case of that kind . It seems to us that the evidence brought out ( defective as it is , compared with what we know it might be , ) is very strong . On this point , however , we will not dwell today . Mr. MILLEa 's great mistake consists in his supposing that our attacks upon him have been inspired by one or two interested persons . They have been based upon information flowing into the office from many channels . We do not think we have been misled on any material point . But if Mr. MILLER can vindicate himself , we shall be the first to announce the fact . And in the meantime , the statement made by him , which he handed to us yesterday , shall receive careful attention .                    @
