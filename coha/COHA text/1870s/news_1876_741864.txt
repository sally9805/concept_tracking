txt Mr. BLAINE hinted at a very important fact in our financial history , iu his recent speech , when he said that be thought that " we began at the wrong end when we made special exertion to raise the price of our bonds , and left the legal tender to take care of itself . " This peculiarity in our financial policy may , we believe , be credited mainly to Mr. BOUTWELL , whose favorite notion it was that we could " grow up " to specie payments , and that the principal thing to be done was to.increase the market value of our interest-bearing obligations , and pave the way for refunding . This certainly was an inversion of all ordinary business principles , and a method which no sound merchant or banker would have thought of employing . It is only when absurd notions creep regarding the capacity and duty of a Government to furnish a " circulating medium , " that its position becomes dangerous and difficult . If our Government had continued to regard the legal-tender notes as demand obligations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the way as soon as possible , things would have been in a very different condition from what they now are . The theory which took the opposite ground , and gave all attention to the bonded debt , was , as we have said , one with which Secretary BormvEr.r. had much to do . But it would be idle to lay the responsibility for pursuing that theory , on the shoulders of this gentleman only . No Secretary of the Treasury , under our Government , can carry his own views very far , if ho is alone in holding them . The fate of Mr. McCur.Loca was proof enough of that fact . He had a policy eminently sound in principle , which was approved by the great body of prudent business men throughout the country , and to which Congress had given a sweeping indorsement . But , when The operation of this policy created an amount of discontent in the country which made Congressmen sensible of its existence , Mr. iNloCur.Locit 's course was promptly checked ; his policy was abandoned , and ho @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no more direct and substantial influence over . the financial policy of the country than one of his own assistants . There is u odoubt that if Mr. BouTwELL 's ideas had had no more strength iu Congress and with the people than Mr. McCuLLocu 's had , they would have shared the same fortune . But those ideas wore of precisely an opposite character . The Secretary believed in letting things alone , and the entire speculative class , including all those whose expenditures had increased with the advance of fictitious values , was in symyathy with this notion . It was generally felt that the Prosperity which everyone thought we were enjoying was duo to the paper money . In a sense , this was true . The appearance of prosperity was due to paper money . Why ' I Because that money concealed an evidence of loss and debt under a simulation of value . What could be invented more calculated to make a man feel rich than a process which . caused his debts to appear like assets The legal-tender notes are really au obligation to pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either expended for materials of war that were destroyed , or for the pay of troops who wore engaged , not in production , but iu destruction . We all believe that the work was necessary to be done , and well worth the sacrifice . But the sacrifice was just as real , and the notes of the Government represented nothing but its cost . Yet for more than a dozen years , the country has gone on the theory , not clearly expressed , but fully acted upon , that these notes were money . Mr. BOUTWELL 'S notion accorded exactly . with this absurdity . It allowed every one to go on spending and borrowing and running risks , in the happy conceit that some time or other this heedless course would make the nation " grow up " to specie payments  --  that is , would enable it to pay its debts without any saving or other sacrifice . It is not strange that the public was willing to let the Secretary spend his surplus revenue in buying up five-twenties , and iu preparing for the refunding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true that we had " begun at the wrong end , " and that the claims of the demand notes must sooner or later present themselves . They are very urgent iv ? . There is no putting them off . The fabric of national credit has always rested upon them , and our reputation has risen in proportion as we have shown a disposition to treat them honestly and prudently . ' There is still a pretty strong party inclined to push the legal tenders aside  --  to provide for them by some gentle , gradual , intangible method , that shall cause them to cease from troubling us without our exactly knowing how it is dom . But this method will not be discovered . There is no alchemy in finance . The only way to dispose of the notes is to either pay them and destroy them , or fund them and destroy them . As we can not do the former , the sooner we do the latter the better .                 @ @ @ @
