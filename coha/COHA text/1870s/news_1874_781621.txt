txt The Fall meeting of the American Jockey Club at Jerome Park opens to-morrow , with an unusually good promise of exciting sport . A programme embracing five and six races a day , and extending over five days , beginning with Saturday , the 3d , and ending with Saturday , the 17th inst. , could hardly fail , under any circumstances , to possess great attractions for the public interested in horseracing . But it happens this year that the extent and variety of the programme is supplemented by , perhaps , the most magnificent field of horses ever brought together on an American race-course . Of late years the race meetings of the Fall have presented to the public a large proportion of events in which the chances of winning were practically confined to very few horses . Long Branch and . Saratoga had settled the relative merits of the three-year olds of the year , audit was even possible to select with some degree of confidence several two-year olds among whom most of the winners at the Fall meetings would be found . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the interest and excitement of the coming contests at Jerome Park . In the great Jerome Stake to-morrow probably a dozen three-year olds will face the starter , nearly every one of which has won a stake or purse this year , and all whose chances of winning this stake are close enough to make the race one of the very finest of this or any other year . A contest whose result will go far to decide the rival claims of horses like Madge , Reform , Aaron Pennington , Acrobat , Brigand , Regardless , Saxon , and Grinstead , can not be other than a marked event in the annals of the turf . The two-year olds likely to run for the Nursery States comprise a similarly wide range of fine horses of tolerably equal achievements and nearly level chances of winning . The Manhattan Handicap , which is also part of to-morrow 's programme , will bring out mature horses of such fame as Mate , Fadladeen , Gray Planet , Fellowcraft , and Lizzie Lucas . Among the three-year olds entered for this race are that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dublin . Add to these three great events , an opening dash of three-quarters of a mile , and a closing one of a mile and a quarter , and it will be seen that the opening day at Jerome Park offers a prospect of sport which it would be difficult to match in the record of any two days of the late Summer meetings , exciting as many of them were . The second day of the meeting has for its chief event the Hunter Stakes for threeyear-old fillies . That race will bring into the field such closely-matched contestants as Vandalite , Bonaveniure , Madge , Beatrice , and Regardless , with half a dozen callers of hardly inferior fame . The breaking down of Tom Bowling has this element of compensation , that it will render the race for the Maturity Stakes a good deal less of a certainty than it w ould otherwise have been . Some of the most promising nominations for this stake have broken down , but enough remain to make the three-mile test of speed and endurance which it affords a highly interesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popular and exciting sport a steeple-chase . The remaining days of the meeting present such attractive races as the Grand National Handicap Sweepstakes , with fifteen acceptances , including some of the best horses on the turf , the Champagne Stakes for two-year olds , a mile-heat race , a handicap steeple-chase , and a handicap hurdle-race , the Members ' Cup-race , and half a dozen minor contests . Altogether , the programme of the Jerome Park Fall Meeting is equally suggestive of the rapid increase in the numbers of American race-horses and of the very high degree of excellence to which the quality of that stock has attained . The attendance of the public will no doubt attest the fact that the popularity of the sport increases as rapidly as its quality improves . It would be difficult to unite more of the elements of a day 's thorough enjoyment than can be done by the drive , in weather like this , to and from Jerome Park , by the pleasant surroundings and associations , and all the exciting incidents provided in and about the course .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
