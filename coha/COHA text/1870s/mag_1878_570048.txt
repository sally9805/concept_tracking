Judicial Decisions and Executive Documents relating to Pact/ic Railroads . THE first movements for a Railroad to the Pacific were made as early as 1846 by M. Asa Whitney , who by lectures and writings awakened the public attention and created a general interest in the subject . His idea was that the Government should build the road , and the probable cost was estimated by him at about one hundred millions of dollars . After the discovery of gold in California a new interest was aroused , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially by the enormous migration thither at a frightful cost of money and of life . In February , 1849 , Senator Benton had already introduced a bill in Congress to provide for preliminary surveys of three different routes , the Northern , Middle , and Southern . The bill was passed and the surveys were completed by 1856 . All the routes were found to be feasible , and each had its own strenuous advocates . The great cost of the undertaking , however , and the extreme improbability that such a road running for nearly 2,000 miles through desolate regions of desert and mountain , wonid ever pay even running expenses , deterred the Government and far more private parties from the thought of // undertaking its construction ; especially after the completion of the Panama Railroad had rendered travel and transportation between the East and California comparatively convenient and expeditious . The civil war , however , developed a new and pressing necessity for direct and rapid overland communication between the Missouri River and the Pacific coast . Travel by sea was liable to interruption , in fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of war then seriously threatened with foreign powers , might become entirely unavailable . The situation of California and of Oregon , therefore , as part of our territory was precarious . If war should occur with England or France , they were liable to be wrested from ns without possibility of prevention . It was even feared that the great distance and comparatively isolated position and interests of the Pacific coast might awaken among its then unsettled and excitable population the desire of independence as a Western Empire , commanding the commerce of the Pacific and the East . Nor was this an imaginary danger . The Californian representatives in Congress demanded a railroad as a political and commercial necessityessential to the prosperity , if not to the loyalty of that new State . In a military aspect it was an object of primary importance , not merely for the safety of the Pacific coast , but in order to control the Indians of the Plains , and the Mormons , at that time the avowed enemies of the United States , and who had already waged against it a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tranquillity , the transportation of troops and the mails was costing from seven to eight millions annually , and was extremely tedious and difficult . All these considerations weighed heavily on the public mind , and before the civil war had continued for a year , the necessity for a railroad had become manifest to all , and speedy and energetic action was demanded on all sides to carry out the enterprise which in times of peace might have lingered long and fruitlessly in the halls of Congress . But there were difficulties in the very inception . For the Government to build and operate a costly railroad was obviously impracticable . The work must be done and the road 0 // gested any desire or willingness to undertake it . The time too was unpropitious for inviting private attention to the enterprise . It was in 1862 when gold and prices were whirling upward every day-when taxes were rapidly growing to enormous proportions-when the future existence of the nation was trembling in the balance , and in case of separation the division line across the continent was uncertain . Millions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ construct a road of 1,500 miles in length across an unknown wilderness , overrun by hostile savages , destitute of stone , of timber , of water even , and of supplies of every kind . Unknown years must be expended in the mere work of construction , and it was believed that under the most favorable circumstances many more must elapse before the business of the road would pay even its running expenses . Not a very brilliant prospectus this to set before the capitalists whose aid was wanted for the work ! Nevertheless Congress determined to make the attempt , and by the act of July 1 , 1862 , created a corporation under the name of the Union Pacific Railway Company , to construct a railroad and telegraph to the Pacific coast . It is a striking illustration of the absence of any private confidence or interest in the work , that the corporation was chartered before the coiporators were selected . After the terms of the charter were settled , the names of 150 persons were suggested at random in Congress by States , without previous notice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would accept the l ) osition . The corporators were selected with reference to known capital , ability , and enterprise , and provision was made for calling the first meeting at Chicago . By the terms of the act the capital of the corporation was fixed at $100,000,000 , but it might commence business when $2,000,000 were subscribed , and $200,000 paid in . To aid in the construction of the road and telegraph , a subsidy of government bonds was voted to the company , to be issued as each forty miles of road was completed , at the rate of $16,000 per mile from the Missouri River to the Rocky Mountains , $32,000 per mile from that point to the Sierra Madre , and // 640 acres each per mile . The government bonds were , however , to constitute a first mortgage on the road , and to be repaid with interest at maturity , i. e. , in thirty years . The first meeting of the corporation was held in the fall of 1862 . Of the one hundred and fifty corporators named a considerable proportion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From those who did accept , the necessary subscription of two millions , and the payment of ten per cent . thereon , was not obtained until October , 1863 , and only with great exertion and difficulty . The construction of the road had not then been commenced , and the prospect was far from encouraging . During 1863 the war had grown in dimensions , and the political situation was still extremely critical . Gold and prices had reached a fabulous figure . The army had drawn off laborers until there were not enough left to till the fields . The financial sky was troubled and gloomy , and capitalists were more unwilling than even in 1862 to make large contracts and great expenditures with reference to distant and uncertain returns . Early in the session of 1863-4 , the Special Committee on the Pacific Railroads informed the House of Representatives that after full and careful inquiry during the recess , they were convinced that the necessary capital to build the road could not be had without a greater assistance from the Government than was granted by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that purpose , which passed with little opposition , and is now known as the act of 1864 . By this act the government bonds were made a second mortgage on the road and telegraph line , instead of a first mortgage , as before , and the corporation was authorized to issue its own first mortgage bonds to an equal amount  --  the land grant was also doubled , by giving twenty alternate sections 12,800 acres instead of ten per mile of road . An examination of the debates over this measure shows strongly the great anxiety of Congress to secure the building of the road and its fear that after all the enterprise would faiL Mr. Wilson ( afterwards Vice-President ) was " ready to vote fifty millions or one hundred millions out and out , " if that would ensure its construction . Mr. Washburn , who opposed the grant ( and others on the same side ) , did so on the ground that the corporation would // pocket all the money it could get , and never complete the work . President Lincoln , in private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was left to him he would give the government bonds outright and a great deal more . On all sides it was agreed that the work was one of the highest importance to the country and the Government , but that its construction was doubtful , and its success as a profitable pecuniary enterprise not to be expected . As this act of 1864 , enlarging the original government grants to the roads has been again and again referred to in public debates and writings , as " unparalleled in the history of legislation " in the way of generous and lavish gifts to a private enterprise , it will be well to inspect it for a moment before proceeding farther . If it was regarded at the time as a bonanza of wealth to the corporation , it is singular , to say the least , that for nearly three years after the passage of the act , all the prominent capitalists of the country and thousands of others were besieged in vain to take stock in the enterprise Possibly this may not appear so singular after examination of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right of way ) were of two kinds ; government thirty-year bonds and alternate sections of land . The government bonds were well understood to be entirely insufficient to build the road and telegraph , as is shown by the authority given to the corporation to issue its own first mortgage bonds to an equal amount , and the obligation imposed upon it to subscribe and pay for stock enough to complete the work . Owing to the exceptional circumstances already referred to , the cost of the work was expected to be enormously greater than of ordinary roads in ordinary times , and nobody could predict how much . The government bonds too being currency bonds , must be sold at a great depreciation , so that the cash realized would be much less than their face , while they must be paid in thirty years , principal and interest , at their face value . As the construction of the work was expected to take from ten to twelve years ( twelve years was the time allowed ) , there would remain after the road was in operation only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , more or less , which would be needed to take up the first // mortgage and government bonds , besides paying the annual interest of two or three millions or more on the funded debt . As it was doubtful whether the road would even pay operating expenses , where was the inducement to subscribe for the stock ? Not in the land grant , for although some of the land was known to be good and likely to be marketable after the road was opened , yet there were also vast regions of alkali deserts and mountain ranges , where it was utterly worthless , and what proportion the good land bore to the bad no one knew . Moreover the lands could not be held for a future rise in value , for by the terms of the grant , in three years after the road was completed , all lands not sold or disposed of , were to be subject to preemption at $1.25 per acre . Besides these drawbacks to the offers held out by the Government for stock subscriptions , there were conditions imposed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the railroad should be constructed in all respects as a first-class road , with all necessary drains , eulverts , viaducts , crossings , sidings , bridges , turnouts , watering places , depots , equipments , furniture , and all other appurtenances , the rails and all other iron used in its construction and equipment to be American manufacture , of the best quality . It provided that the road should be built in sections of twenty miles each and that each section should be approved by three govern . ment commissioners , before the bonds for it should be issued , or the land patents be gWen . Twelve years and no more were allowed for the completion of the road and telegraph , and in case of failure even for a day , beyond that period , the whole vast property , with all its rights and franchises , and estate *. , f every name and nature was to be forfeited to the Government . For unreasonable delay in the work its income could be confiscated . One-half of the Government dues for transportation services was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cent . of the whole net earnings of the road was to be annually paid over to it in addition . In case dividends of ten per cent . on the stock should ever be reached , Congress reserved the right to interfere with the rates of freight and fare . And finally , if the corporation should fail to pay to the Government at the maturity of its thirty-year bonds ( that is to say , as we have already seen , in some twenty years after the opening of // the road ) , the whole amount then due on the government bonds , principal and interest , then also the road , with all its property and privileges , by such default was to become the property of the United States , and was to be taken possession of at once by the Secretary of the Treasury ; supposing , indeed , that it had not already been appropriated by its first mortgage bondholders , which seemed extremely probable . In estimating the liberality and generosity of the Government , therefore , in its grants to the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expecting to receive for them tenfold more than their value , and was also securing itself , to no insignificant extent , against even a pecuniary loss . The road , if built , would be of infinitely more value to the Government than the grants , even if it never repaid a dollar . But the enhanced valuation of the government lands and its saving in cost of transportation , were sure , of themselves , to indemnify it , and there was its second mortgage lien besides . It could not possibly lose , therefore , and must inevitably be an enormous gainer by the construction of the road , while the stockholders , who had only pecuniary profits to entice them , would run enormous risks of losing every penny of their investment . The changes made in the charter by the act of 1864 nevertheless inspired confidence in some of the stockholders already secured , notwithstanding the risks incurred , to go on with the work . The great majority , however , still feared to venture . It was owing largely , if not mainly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individuals. * at this time and for months afterward that the work went on . From three to four millions cash was needed to meet the expenses of preliminary surveys , organizing and commencing the work , and to raise this sum and to carry on the construction these persons with others put forth the most arduous efforts , pledging their own credit to its utmost and appealing to more prudent capitalists , mostly in vain . Up to the end of 1864 very little progress had been made , and the enterprise seemed in danger of abandonment . Many subscribers to the stock refused payment of the second installment . More efforts were put forth to bring in capitalists in New York and elsewhere in vain . In 1865 the Credit * T. C. Durant and C. S. Bushnell . // Mobiler was organized and some new parties were brought in , and by " superb iiman efforts " of all the parties in interest enough more money was raised to carry on the work to the end of 1866 . At that time the road had been built from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work bad been so far carried on with great difficulty and at a heavy loss notwithstanding the government subsidies . The public confidence in the enterprise was so small that the company had not been able to sell a dollar of its first mortgage bonds up to 1867 . The funds had again given out and the stockholders were discouraged . Again a desperate effort was put forth to get new subscribers ; not to the Union Pacific Company directly , but indirectly through subscription to the Credit Mobilier ( which held the contract of construction ) , the stock of which was offered to every one who was thought likely to take it at almost any price from ninety up to par . In this way funds enough were obtained in 1867 to carry the work along . iDuring this year 245 miles were built , and now came a great and sudden turn of affairs  --  a new route had been found over the Black Hills where the hardest part of the work had been expected , and for which the largest appropriations had been made . By the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a cost no greater than over the plains , and now it began to be evident that the profits on this part of the work would be large . Henceforth there was no difficulty about money and the construction went on with abundant means and at a rapid rate . In the mean time the Central Pacific Company , aided by a special subsidy of over a million of dollars from the State of California and the newly applied Chinese labor , was pushing rapidly forward from the western end , and - now began a rivalry between the two companies , each striving to obtain the greatest length of line , and their emulation and marvellous activity attracted the attention of the whole world . The cost of this rapid construction was enormous , and it was embarrassed besides by the special difficulties which attended nearly the whole building of the roads . Hostile Indians had to be fought off without the aid of troops . Every pound of corn , hay and grain had to be carried from 100 to 600 miles . Even the drinking water and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wood cost $26 per cord . Iron rails $160 per ton . Ties from $2 to $5 a piece . Locomotives ( costing now $7,000 ) cost $35,000 . Such had been the prices even when their bonds were selling with difficulty at from 60 to 80 per cent . and gold was at 222 . But these extravagant burdens ( arising from the baste to complete the work ) had their compensation . By that haste the time of construction was shortened seven years , so that instead of opening the roads for transportation in July , 1876 , they were actually opened May 9 , 1869 . This great saving of time reduced the interest account on their funded indebtedness . Had the whole twelve years been taken the companies would have been ruined by the burden of their interest . Had not the new route over the Black Hills been unexpectedly discovered the Union Pacific Company would have been bankrupt long before the work was completed , and , but for the unexpected resource of Chinese cheap labor , a similar disaster would have overtakeu the Central Pacific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrow chances , for which they were in no way indebted to the Government , did these corporations save their investments from ruin and their property from forfeiture and confiscation . During the construction of the roads the relations of the companies with the Government and its agents were for the most part harmonious ; nevertheless the Union Pacific Company complained of an act of Congress passed in 1866 , in the midst of their embarrassments , which very seriously impaired their prospects for business , and created a formidable competitor in a rival and parallel road . By the acts of 1862 and 1864 there was chartered as the southerly feeder of the Union Pacific Road , a railroad under the name of the Union Pacific Railroad Eastern Division , to start from Kansas City and to run northwestwardly some 270 miles , until it united with the Union Pacific Road at the 100th meridian . The same subsidies in lands and bonds were allowed to this feeder as to the main line . The construction of this road was commenced by a separate company ; which , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pacific feeder and to run their road westwardly parallel with the Union Pacific Road to Denver , a distance of 638 miles . // In 1866 they succeeded , against the remonstrances of the Union Pacific Company , in obtaining the sanction of Congress to this diversion and took the new name of the Kansas Pacific Road . The Union Pacific Company protested that this Congressional charter to a rival road was ill-timed and not in good faith to their interests , an ( l that it would cause a loss to themselves of a million of dollars a year , and such has proved to be the case . In this Kansas Pacific Road the Government invested over six millions of government bonds and six million acres of land . The whole road cost about thirty-four millions of dollars . it has never paid expenses or barely paid them , and in 1873 owing to the continued refusal of the Government to pay its dues for transportation the company defaulted its interest . It finally went into the hands of a receiver in November , 1876 , and will doubtless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act of Congress in setting up this rival road while it diminished the ability of the Union Pacific to repay the government interest and advances by a million of dollars a year , resulted in a bankrupt company and the entire loss to the Government of ten or twelve millions in bonds and lands , besides creating sources of controversy and vexation , to be referred to hereafter . In 1869 , as the roads approached completion and it was known that large profits were being realized , blackmail politicians and officials began to swarm around them and to levy their various forms of tribute , and among these gentry appeared an occasional government commissioner , whose duty it was to inspect and report upon each section of completed road before the government subsidies on that section could be realized . Shortly before Jan. 1 , 1869 , when eighty miles had been completed , and some two and a half millions of government bonds were earned and needed to meet the coming January interest , one of these government commissioners refused to make any report until he was paid $25,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be had or the interest defaulted , and the general superintendent at Omaha actually paid the money , without consulting the directors , who subsequently disapproved the act and for a time held him responsible for the amount . Another government commissioner demanded $50,000 // for accepting a portion of the road , and threatened that if it were not paid " he would give them hell in his report " -a threat which ten years ago was considered serious . The money was not paid , and the commissioner fully justified his threat . In an elaborate report , which was published in all the newspapers of the country , he denounced the Union Pacific road as a fraud and a sham . With that amiable tendency to believe evil reports which characterizes human nature , these statements were everywhere accepted as truth , and for a year or more after the opening of the road the country rang with charges that the Union Pacific road was a fraud on the Government and the public . That it was unsafe for travel , that its bridges were flimsy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ log culverts falling in , its embankments rapidly washing away , and that for the purpose of increasing the amount of the government subsidies wide detours and frequent curves had been fraudulently introduced . A great part of the odium and ill repute which has clung to the Union Pacific Road to this day , had its origin in these assertions , constantly made and widely believed . So much impression was created by them that the Government delayed its final acceptance of the roads and withheld the patents for about three-fourths of the land grants . Congress took action in the matter and a special commission , with Hon. Benj . F. Wade at its head , was appointed to make a thorough examination of the roads throughout their entire length and report on their condition . The examination was carefully made during the year 1870 , and the report was a complete vindication of the companies in all substantial particulars . Yery few deficiencies were found in the condition of the roads as first-class structures . A few short curves were recommended to be straightened ; in one or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some other minor details were suggested . It was stated , however , in the report , that most of the changes recommended had been originally contemplated by the company and only deferred till the completion of the road , and that some were already in progress . As travelers have sometimes remarked upon the occasional curves in the Union Pacitic road where it might have seemingly been shortened to advantage by cuts , it may be added that in many places // where cuts were made in the orieinal construction of the road , they have since been filled up and curves over open ground introduced , experience having shown that in winter such excavations fill up with frozen snow and become impassable . The Government required these changes to be made before it would accept the road as a completed road and issue patents for the lands . The changes were made , but the final acceptance was still postponed . The Government required a higher standard for a first-class road than the companies acknowledged , and several successive commissions were appointed to establish the proper standard . Finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the roads were fully up to the proper standard of a first-class road . President Grant accepted the report and thus at last the Government recognized and accepted the road as complete , according to the requirements of its charter . Subsequently , in 1875 , a rumor found currency that the Pacific iRailroads had been fraudulently overmeasured by the companies , and that bonds had been drawu from the government for miles of road that never were built . The companies were not public favorites at the time , and an act was speedily passed by Congress for the re-measurement of the roads , with an appropriation of $10,000 for the purpose . The re-measurement was carefully made by army officers , and a mistake of two or three miles was discovered , but it was a mistake of under measarement , and the net result to the Governrnent was the $10,000 expense of re-measuring , and an additional indebtedness to the Union Pacific IRoad of over $100,000 in subsidy bonds and the corresponding land grant besides . From the day the roads were opened for travel ( in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report of Mr. Wade 's committee that they were built and equipped in all respects as first-class roads . Their operation , notwithstanding the special difficulties arising from snow both on the mountains and on the plains , has been regular and almost uninterrupted . There has been a remarkable fi-cedom from accidents of every kind , and especially such as result from careless or fraudulent construction . The benefits which they have conferred upon commerce , industry , and the traveling public have been of course almost unparalleled in the history of public works , but // scarcely greater than the immense and immediate advantages , political and pecuniary , which have been derived from them by the Government . The whole Pacific slope , a vast and almost independent empire , was at once thoroughly absorbed into our federal system , and the commerce and control of the Pacific ocean was made secure . A great tide of migration to the territories along their line brought the government lands at once into market . Mining towns , counties and States sprang into existence among the mountains which , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mystery , and began like so many inexhaustible fountains to pour forth those streams of wealth which have since revolutionized values and made ninety cents worth a hundred . Indian wars , before so troublesome and expensive , were ended in that portion of our territory forever . The Mormon problem was solved and all farther political danger from that source averted . In fact it is impossible even to enumerate the beneficent results to our political system which have ensued within these past nine years from the completion of the Pacific Roads . There is no sane man who would for an instant consider that two hundred or five hundred millions of dollars would compensate the Government for the loss of those roads to-day . Not one who would not heartily endorse as wise and sound the words of Henry Wilson in 1862 : " If I could get the road by voting fifty millions or one hundred millions to it as a * I would do it most cheerfully and consider that I was doing a great thing for my country . " From 1869 through 1870 the business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sufficient to show that their ultimate success as a pecuniary investment was certain . The Union Pacific bonds were selling below par , and its stock at from twenty-five to thirty . The amount that it was entitled to receive from the Government for transportation services ( which by the terms of the charter was one-half of the whole amount earned , the other half being retained by the Government ) was very important to it as affording the means of meeting its quarterly interest . Just at this critical time ( in November , 1870 ) the Secretary of the Treasury announced to the companies that thenceforward the Government would retain the // whole amount of its transportation dues instead of paying over one-half as had been regularly done theretofore . The Secretary based this determination on a legal construction of the charter , approved by the Attorney-General , but then for the first time suggested , and which he arrived at by comparing the act of 1862 with that of 1864 . The act of 1862 provided that " all compensation for services rendered to the Government shall be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until the whole amount is fully paid . " The act of 1864 amended this provision by enacting " that only one-half of the compensation earned by services to the Government shall be required to be applied to the payment of the bonds issued by the Government in aid of the construction of the road . " From 1864 down to September , 1870 , no one had doubted that the amendment was co-extensive with the clause amended , and the uniform practice of the Secretary of the Treasury had been to pay over to the roads in cash , one-half of the amounts due them for government service , retaining the balance in the Treasury . By the new interpretation , however , one-half was to be retained under the act of 1864 for payment of the bonds , and the other half by the act of 1862 for payment of the interest . When this decision was made public , fortitied by the opinion of Mr. Akerman , the Attorney-General , the effect was most disastrous to the Union Pacific securities . The first mortgage bonds fell from 95 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , income bonds from 82 to 35 , and the stock from 25 to 9 . The matter was brought at once before Congress , and the Senate Judiciary Committee ( of which Mr. Thurman was then a member ) unanimously reported that the action of the Secretary was in violation of the contract on the part of the Government . In March , 1871 , Congress directed the Secretary of the Treasury , in accordance with the act of 1864 , to pay over in money to the Pacific Railroad Companies one-half of the compensation provided by law for such services heretofore or hereafter rendered . " Subsequently , in 1873 , under the influence of the Credit Mobilier excitement , Congress set aside its own deliberate construction of this clause and directed the Secretary of the Treasury to withhold all payments for government transporta // tion to the amount of the interest on the government bonds ; providing , however , that the companies might bring suit in the Court of Claims to recover the price of such freight and transportation , under their charter , with fhe right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In pursuance of this legislation the government payments were again withheld and the Union Pacific Company brought their suit in the Court of Claims . The case was fully argued and the Court pronounced its decision unequivocally in favor of the company with judgment for $512,632.50 . From this decision the Government appealed to the Supreme Court , which sustained the Court of Claims by a final judgment in October , 1875 . In their opinions rendered in this case , both Courts comment with some severity upon the position of the Government as unreasonable and unjust . The Court of Claims says : " In con* templation of law , the wrong and injury of which the Government complains are entirely of its own choosing . * * * Jf an ordinary party were to come into another Court with such a complaint he would be told , " Either you have wilfully withheld this employment from the other contractor , or you have been unable to furnish it to him . If the former supposition is the fact , then the fault is your own , and you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has always been willing to repay you in the manner your agreement prescribes : If the latter is the fact then because the sources of payment which you provided disappoint you and because the payment in kind which you elected to take gives you more of the transportation service than you really require , you are trying to shift your loss to other shoulders than your own . " The Supreme Court uses language not less emphatic . After recounting the great necessity to the Government that the roads should be constructed and its anxious but barely sufficient offers and pledges as inducements to enlist private capital and enterprise , and the enormous hazards assumed by those who built the roads , they add : " Of necessity there were risks to be taken in aiding with money or bonds an enterprise unparalleled in the history of any free people , which if completed at all would require , as was supposed , twelve years in which to do it . But these risks were common to both parties , and Congress was obliged // to assume its share and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road were a success , in addition to the benefit it would be to the United States , the corporation would be in a situation to repay advances for interest and pay the principal when due . If on the contrary the investment proved to be a failure , subjecting the private persons who embarked their capital in it to a total loss , there was left for the Government the entire property of the corporation of which immediate possession could be taken on a declaration of forfeiture . " The Court then , after a full examination of the Government 's claim , declare it inconsistent with its agreement and obligations under the acts of 1862 and 1804 , and add that the companies " could not in the nature of things have accepted those acts with the understanding that any such effect should be given them . " They , therefore , unanimously affirmed the decision of the Court of Claims and rendered judgment in favor of the corporations for the full amount demanded . ( United States vs . U. P. R. IR . Co. , 1 Otto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ payment of one half of the government dues has never been resumed . During the pendency of the litigation another question had arisen relative to the obligations of the companies under another clause of their charter to pay over annually to the Government " five per cent . of their net earnings , " to be applied on the government bonds . Prior to 1873 , inasmuch as the roads had barely earned their operating expenses and the interest on their funded debts , it was not claimed that they had made any " net earnings " within the terms of this requirement After that period , however , the Government set up a new construction of the phrase , insisting that by " net earnings " was intended all income above operating expense.s without regard to interest or other obligations , and that as the roads had failed to account to the Government on this principle they were in arrears to an amount much greater than the retained transportation dues , and under this new claim has continued to hold back the latter to the present time . This continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Union Pacific and Central roads , but to all the other roads which were aided by the Acts of 1862 and 1864 , // and originally designed to be feeders of the main line , viz : the Kansas Pacific , the Sioux City and Pacific , and the Central Branch Union Pacific , none of which have ever made any net earnings except under the above construction . The effect of this continued retention has been fatal to at least one of these companies , the Kansas Pacific , which as already stated , has in consequence been forced into the hands of a receiver . The other roads named have also been seriously crippled by the same cause , and should they follow the fate of the Kansas Pacific , the Government as second mortgagee in all of them , will lose its entire investment , amounting to many millions in bonds and land grants . The great Credit Mobilier excitement arose during the session of Congress in the years 1872-3 , and originated in some imputations respecting Mr. Blame , then Speaker , which first appeared in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the floor of the House . The intimation was that he had received stock in the Credit Mobilier and the Union Pacific companies , while a member of Congress , as a gift , in order to influence his votes with reference to the roads . Mr. Blame called the matter up and demanded that the charges be investigated . Other members of Congress were implicated in the same charges and by general consent committees were appointed to inquire into these matters as well as the whole history of the Credit Mobilier and its relations to the Union Pacific Company . By these committees testimony was taken in relation to every matter directly or remotely bearing on the subject . A Presidential contest had just occurred , and the excitement , intensified by political feeling , was fanned to a frenzy which filled the country . In such a period there was little chance for a candid and rational consideration of the facts ascertained or the questions involved . When once a cry of " fraud bribery , and corruption " has been fully raised it generally bears down all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a perverted moral sense , and it is as useless to appeal to actual facts as it was for Galileo to reason with the Holy Inquisition . It would be hard to find a better illustration of this truth than the congressional debates over these investigations , and the public sentiment during the past five years with regard to the Credit Mobilier. // Nothing is more fully and generally believed at this day than that the Credit Mobilier was an organized robbery whose victims were the stockholders of the Union Pacific Company and the Government . That it was composed of a ring of Directors and other managers of the Union Pacific Company , who voted extravagant contracts to themselves in fraud of the other stockholders whose interests they represented and were bound to protect , and thus absorbed as members of the Credit Mobilier , the profits which ought rightfully to have gone into the pockets of their Union Pacific associates . That this same ring also cheated the Government by makihg the road under cover of these fraudulent contracts appear to cost vastly more than they were entitled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Company and the Government of enormous sums of money . The imputed crime of attempting to bribe members of Congress is also attached in the common mind as a stigma to the Credit Mobilier ; although the Company was in no way identified with the acts referred to . We are under a strong temptation to review this subject by itself , in the light of the subsequent judicial decision to which we shall hereafter refer and which has overthrown a principal ground for the imputation of a corrupt motive in those transactions . We would like to discuss the dangerous stretch of prerogative by which the House of Representatives assumed jurisdiction over acts of members committed four years before they were elected , and imposed punishment therefor in a vote of " absolute condemnation . " It would be interesting to consider the moral force of such a condemnation for the crime of inducing other members of Congress to invest in the stock of an open corporation , by Honorable Representatives who had secured their elections by trades and bargains if nothing worse , and whose pockets were stuffed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there been as much compunction about " casting the first stone " as there was in a somewhat similar case mentioned in Scripture there would have been few indeed to answer to the call of yeas and nays when the vote of censure was reached . But these themes are foreign to our present purpose which is merely to consider the Credit* Mobilier as an organization connected with the Union Pacific // Railroad Company and to explain those relations alone . Yet we will express a confidence in passing , whatever odium may attach to the declaration , that time will bring a more dispassionate revision of the facts referred to , and a more just and generous estimate of the acts and motives of the principal actor in them than they have yet received . Under the charter of the Union Pacific Company as contained in the Act of 1862 , its capital stock was fixed at one hundred millions of dollars . The company might organize , however , and commence business as soon as $2,000,000 should be subscribed , and $200,000 paid in . As has been already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretiminary subscription . In October , 1863 , barely the necessary number of shares had been subscribed and there was no prospect of any considerable increase . If the enterprise was undertaken and carried forward at all then , it must be by a few bold and resolute pioneers who should invest every dollar of their own , and all that they could borrow in the work , and settle at their own risk the question of profit or loss . The Act of 1864 required that the books of the Company should be kept open , until the whole amount of $100,000,000 should be subscribed , and this provision operated to destroy all the inducements offered by the charter to parties who should build the road . It was in vain to beg capitalists to take all the risks and burdens of the work by urging the profits that would probably be made . The answer was that if the attempt should fail the whole investment would be forfeited , and if any profits should accrue , all these would go into the corporation treasury , and could be shared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in afterwards and subscribe to the stock . Obviously this was unjust and could not have been the intention of Congress . The design was that those who took the risks of furnishing the road should reap the profits if any were made . It was in order to meet this difficulty and to secure this object that the Credit Mobilier was availed of . This was simply a new corporation formed of the then stockholders of the Union Pacific Company and of all others who should aid in constructing the road . There was no ring , no inside manipulations , no exclusive contracts , or privileges , or profits . Every stockholder in the Union Pacific Company took stock in like proportion in // the Credit Mobilier , and those who declined were bought out . It was a fundamental rule and principle of action that there should be no Union Pacific stockholders outside of the Credit Mobilier , so that each and all might take their one share in the burdens and receive their due proportion of the benefits . Upon whom then was the alleged fraud in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for the arrangement was with themselves and for their mutual protection and advantage . More for protection certainly than advantage in 1864 , for the profits to be derived from the building of the road were then so dubious that subscriptions to the Credit Mobilier stock were obtained with the greatest difficulty , and even in the Spring of 1867 , when it became necessary to add 50 per cent . to its capital , many of the old stockholders declined to subscribe farther , although a bonus was offered of first mortgage Union Pacific bonds equal to the amount of each stock subscription . So doubtful even then were the prospects of the enterprise and so low the value of the best Union Pacific securities ! The Committees of the House of Representatives which had charge of investigating the history of the Credit Mobilier Company and its relations to the Union Pacific , denounced it as a scheme for defrauding the Government on the ground that the contracts with the Credit Mobilier covered the whole amount of the government subsidy , while only a part was actually needed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bonds and lands to the Union Pacific Company were in trust merely to use only so much of them as might be actually required . The Wilson Committee say : " The Committee can not doubt that the proceeds of these lands and bonds as well as of the first mortgage bonds which the Government has provided to secure by a lien prior to its own , are held as an express trust by this company and applicable alone to said declared purposes of the acts viz : to aid in the construction of a railroad , &amp;c . Any distribution of the proceeds of either of these funds , as profits or dividends to stockholders is illegal as violative of the declared purposes of the trust , " &amp;c . And this in face of the fact that the act of 1862 provides for the preemption of lands not sold within three years after the completion of the road ! The same Committee in their report speak of the " bounty of // the Government " and " the munificent grant of lands and loan of government credit to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government intended that the builders of the road should receive from it as a loan bonds worth only 74 or 75 in the market to be repaid in full at maturity , and should add enough of their own money to meet the cost of building the road without profit , and in case of any default should forfeit their whole investment . Nevertheless in the full possession of this idea , an act recommended by the Committee was immediately passed , directing the Attorney General " to commence a suit against the Union Pacific Company , and against every person who might have wrongfully and unlawfully received as dividends or profits , under contracts for constructing the road , bonds , money , or lands which ought to be accounted for either to the railroad corporation , or to the United States , and to compel the restoration of such property or its value , to the railroad company , or to the United States , whichever might be equitably entitled thereto . " The suits were brought by the Attorney-General as directed , in the U. S. Circuit Court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  a most remarkable litigation in its character ; one hundred and seventy-one different actions against as many different defendants , some of them dead , some of them executors or administrators , and others heirs of such deceased defendants , very many of them purchasers of Union Pacific securities in the market , and never connected with the Credit Mobilier ,  --  these defendants being scattered all over the country from Maine to California , and each being required to appear in Connecticut and answer , or suffer a judgment by default , which might be pecuniary ruin . Very many failed to appear . By some of the leading defendants , including the Union Pacific Iii . II . Co. , answers were put in the nature of a demurrer denying the legality of the proceeding on varions grounds , and especially denying the doctrine on which it was based , viz : that the government grants of lands and bonds to aid in the construction of the roads were trust funds in any sense , but insisting that they were subsidies received on no other trust or condition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manner specified in its charter . The case was fully argued on both sides and the // decision of the court ( Judges Hunt and Shipman presiding ) was adverse to all the positions of the Government . As to the claim that the government grants were trust property , the court was very full and explicit , and used the following language : " In the sense that all men are bound to deal honestly and justly in the discharge of their duties , and that whoever receives benefits or advantages from the public which are expected or intended to produce an advantage to some portion of the people of the country , assumes a trust to effect that advantage , the plaintiffs ' claim is true . It is not , however , accurate in a legal sense to say of a bank incorporated for banking purposes , or of an insurance company , or of any similar institution , that it is a trustee of the Government to effect the desired result ; or that its property is impressed with a trust for that purpose which can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private benefit as well as public advantage and is legally bound to administer its affairs for the public advantage only to the extent that it does not violate the provisions of its charter or the law of the land . MTith this limitation such corporations are authorized to manage their own affairs for their own benefit and such is the understanding of the Government which grants a charter , and of the individuals who accept it . " " This railroad company is not a chai-itable corporation , nor were the grants for a charitable use . The grants of land and the issuing of bonds are to be considered as gifts , gratuities , voluntary contributions to aid in the construction of works which it was supposed would develop the resources of the country , advance its civilization and improvement , and upon which the mails and munitions of war could be transported . When given and accepted the power of the donor is at an end and the absolute ownership is in the corporations . The position of the Government is that of a donor and not that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is distinctly specified . " The bill was accordingly dismissed. - ( tl Blatchford Rep. , 385. ) - By this judicial decision , therefore , it was established after a full hearing that the Credit Mobilier was not a fraud upon the Government , and that the profits which it made by its appropriation of the government subsidies in full as compensation for // building the road were not illegitimate but fully in accord with the original purpose of Congress . " It is apparent to the most superficial reader of the Statutes , " say the Court , " that the great object of Congress was to bestow advantages and from time to time to increase gratuities to a corporation which should undertake the completion of a railroad to the Pacific . " " No authority is cited to sustain the argument that gifts or gratuities to a business corporation are in the nature of a trust and I have found none . " And yet it was largely upon this assumption that the Poland Committee charged Oakes Ames with corruption in selling Credit Mobilier stock to other members of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was upon this assumption that the press , the platforms , and the pulpits of the country rang at the time with denunciations of the " shameful frauds of that corrupt organization , " and it is upon this assumption that even to this day the " frauds and robberies of the Credit Mobilier " are constantly alluded to as a part of the accepted history of the time . So difficult is it for truth and reason to overtake and conquer prejudice , and so slow are men to be convinced of their mistake in believing that others are not as honest as themselves . That errors and acts worse than errors were not committed by two or three individuals in connection with the Credit Mobilier , we do not affirm , but we do insist that there was nothing in the nature and purposes of the organization , or in its relations or transactions with respect to the Union Pacific Company or the Government which can justify the stigma which has been attached to it . Among its stockholders are found the names of men of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ names suggestive of anything but of rings and combinations to cheat their nssociates , or to rob the Government , or steal trust funds . And since by the solemn judgment of a high judicial tribunal selected by the Government itself , the corporation has been exonerated from the imputations of robbery and fraud so freely cast upon it by the popular cry , would it not be just for well-informed and candid men to cease reiterating those imputations as if they had been fully sustained ? The positions assumed by the Congressional Committees in // their reports on the Credit Mobilier contracts and the action of Congress thereon are extremely significant , when compared with the later Goverment claims and the legislation which we shall hereafter consider . In 1873 the complaint was that the Government had been defrauded and subjected to risk and probable loss to the amount of those bonds which had been unnecessarily called for in the construction of the roads , unless the excess thus wrongfully absorbed could be recovered back in an action at law . This charge , of course , implies that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means of obtaining repayment of the principal and interest advanced than those provided in the charter of the roads and that these were probably inadequate . If , however , the charter could be altered to any extent by Congress at its pleasure , it would be easy so to change the conditions and terms of the loans , and to insert such new and stringent requirements with respect to their repayment , as to make the government absolutely secure . No such idea seems to have occurred to any one . The Wilson Committee declare that " they have given much consideration to the question of remedy . " But they have none to suggest except a judicial proceeding to forfeit the charter , or its absolute repeal ( both of which were in the nature of punishments , not security ) , or a suit to recover back " the trust funds** assumed to have been illegally appropriated . The last was the course adopted and we have already seen that it failed in the Courts . In our next Article we shall review the subsequent enactments which sprang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powers over the contract with the companies , and which form a new and remarkable chapter in the annals of legislation with respect to government contracts and chartered corporate rights .
