IT is common to see paragraphs going the rounds of the press , that such a group of men represent so much money , no reference being made to their representing anything else . The highest note of eulogy is reached when they are pronounced rich . . This is the crown of . virtue . The list of what are called self-made mei* published in newspapers and books , accompanied with their portraits , tells of the remarkable cleverness of each in amassing money . They are held up on all sides as examplea to the youth of the country for emulation . The story is generally the same : they went into a certain , town with a dollar in their pocket , and by turning and twisting and driving all noble thoughts out of their mind , they succeeded in ovcrreaching their fellows and became rich . Such accounts are demoralizing to the young . It incites them to the pursuit of m*oney only , and in the eagerness thus engendered turns many into rogues ; for they who are determined to have money will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , instead of being told for imitation , should be stigmatized as immoral and unlovely , to every man beginning life . Such teaching has borne fruit in at least a portion of the corruption which has within the last few years been so wildly disseminated throughout the country . The majority of money-getters take oredit to themselves for the untiring energy with which they pursue the dollar , and men 's principles are so much a matter of education , that occasionally men of fair intelligence are found who prostrate themselves before the golden-calf with the idea that they are fulfitling a sacred duty . They are exact at the hour of business , pursue it diligently during the day , and retire to their homes of an evening with a feeling of having done well by themselves and their families ; they take pleasure in being rigid through the hours of toil , to expand at night , if there be any expansion in their character . Little objection can be urged against such an existence , if it be pursued without giving umbrage to others ; but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rules and figures is a severe critic , and to him every man who does not follow a practical calling-i. e. , making money - is to be condemned as a tree which does not bear fruit . This is so impressed on the minds of the young , that the same rule of life often goes from generation to generation , until it gets into the blood . The man trained in such a school has his rule for measuring other people 's motives and duties , and the , system of measurement is money value . This system , however essential in commerce , is mischievous in the world of art , both as regards the artist and his work . The artist , judged in this way , is driven to reprisals , and he in turn makes a false estimate of him who bar . ters . He who goes through his daily round of work in the marts of trade and in the counting-house , with the regularity of a clock , performing the same act every day with unfailing promptitude for six days , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sermon from the corner of the same pew , year in and year out , cait hardly be brought to understand that such a mode of life is not as good and necessary for a man of another mental organization as it is for him . He who passes days in dreams which fructify into work at irregular times and seasons , and who is so governed by his imagination that at times the monotony of material life becomes abhorrent , can hardly comprehend , let alone follow , the existence organized into a sys // desk may not neglect his business to indulge the imagination ; the poet may not write an epic poem to order , to be delivered at a certain hour , like a bale of goods . It is the inalienable right of the man of business to follow an avocation requiring the use of a lower range of faculties than that of the poet , if such be the bent of his mind . In other words , if he find that a chrome picture is better than one of Meissonnior 's genre paintings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he insists that his favorite picture is superior and should be preferred , he becomes offensive to public taste and an obstruction in the way of civilization . There was a time in our history . when a man who made of art a profession was looked upon with distrust , and it is not long ago . Society now likes , or affects to like , a certain degree of gilded Bohemianism , and this is the work of women , the men of trade accepting this element but half-hearted ly . The women were the first to discover that the discussion concerning the price of a sack of coffee left something to be desired ; the first to introduce the talk about pictures , statues , books , and music . Next came acquaintance with the men who made thc work of which they talked-authors , painters , journalists , composers , and musicians  --  and thus the man of business and the artist do not stand as far apart as they once did , although they continue to regard each other askant . Our civilization hardly seems te @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them with profitable employment in science and art . Most of them continue in the money-getting of their fathers with the hope of adding to the fortune left them or of eclipsing their neighbors in ostentation . Those not thus occupied are apt to be idle club men who pass their time in card-playing , driving swift horses , and general dissipation . Elsewhere a riper civilization seems to draw such men into departments of intem like a machine . The man of the tellectual life devoted to painting , drawing , music , politics , and natural science . Fcw of our young men of fortune can speak a foreign language with a good accent , play with expression on the piano , and still fewer who can handle a brush or pencil with grace and intelligence . They do not study the science of governmont , as most Englishmen do who inherit fortunes , and they will have nothing to do with politics because of the bad character of many of the politicians-an excuse that can hardly be accepted ; for if the people acted 6n it , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rogues . The vacuity of a life made up entirely of this kind of trivial personal amusement appears evident to most minds . To play an occasional game at cards may be pleasant , and to drive out to the park behind a lively horse in the afternoon is refreshing ; but to be absorbed by them all the time am pears to the looker-on as so:nething wearisome . If the rich young man has no capacity for any other kind of enjoyment than that which the club and the stable afford , it only shows the defect in our system of education , by which the resources of work and pleasure are narrowed down to a small corner of what a well developed system of training ought to be . It is the same want of capacity for any other occupation which keeps many men in ceinmerec , for happily all business men do not follow their pursuit from a strictly sordid desire of gain . They accomplish the object for which men usually embark in trade , the accumulation of a fortune , and having done this they discover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and they are too old to learn new modes of enjoyment , and they continue to barter until the end . There is , besides , the desire of overcoming obstacles which must present a certain attraction to men of a combative temperament . The waste in vulgar ostentation is great . Crude ornamentation of the // character of a New York omnibus or of a palace sleeping car is scen in every direction where money has been accumulated . Show precedes comfort and utility . Houses are full of paint and glass . Men are not unfrequently seen with a magnificent solitaire diamond on a soiled shirt bosom , and women with the same precious stone on fingers whose nails are in mourning . This is not a great way from the Indian who covers himself with feathers and brightly colored beads , and knows nothing of a bath and the other personal necessities of the civilized man . The display of a diamond stud on a soiled background is often the first dim conception of beauty as well as the most signal expression of uncultured vanity . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nasal tone and ungrammatical speech , are the natural attributes of the personality . This man has perhaps the revenues of a lord of the manor , which are spent for a meagre return . The Italian who turns the organ for a few cents before the windows of his pretentious house , could probably spend them more profitably to the soul as well as the body . The man with the solitaire shining out from the surroundings which belong to it has his admirers , for he is the type of a class of men who would all like to wear the same effulgent ornament , and who look on it as ' the French officer does on the red ribbon of the Legion of Honor . This is the outer crust of a crude civilization ; the first step of the infant which essays to walk . That these men should be so numerous in the midst of enlightened institutions is naturally owing to the sudden acquisition of money . They have not had time to grow to their new position , for civilization is a plant of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to attain to maturity . The facility for getting money in the United Statep has been unequalled in any other country , up to within the last few years , and the man who has been determined to get it , regardless of moral considerations , has generally succeeded . One of the first effects of the possession of the new wealth is to regard it as the only standard by which all men and things are judged , and consequently to look upon men who remain poor with commiseration , not unmixed with contempt . in short , the disk of the dollar is so close to the eye that it shuts out all other objects . Brag is still a characteristic of our people , and another development of suddenly acquired wealth . It has been somewhat temper9d in political and Fourth of July orations , but it appears in other forms . The . driving of a silver spike at the termination of the building of one of the Western railways , the signing of the Centennial bill by the President with a quill from the wing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ridicule has not silenced the Bird of Freedom . It still screams , and in high places . On the occasion referred to , the goose quill which the head of the nation usually employs in writing was abandoned as unworthy , and nothing short of a plume from the pinion of the emblematic bird would answer ; and the success of this coup de th&amp;itre when it was wired over the country is evidence of the streak of buncombe which pervades us all . Had the signer draped himself with the stars and stripes in performing the act , it would doubtless have still further added to the effect in moving the national heart . Another instance of vulgar display is furnished of a Bonanza banquet in California of which an admiring journalist gave a description , telling how much money each diner was worth , and adding up the total before his readers as if he expected them to be smitten with admiration and reverence for the magnificent sum and those to whom it belonged . " Each gentleman seated areund the festive board found near his napkin a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silver , gotten up in artistic style , at a post of $40 each . " The profusion and variet*r of viands may be inferred from // the unique bill of fare . In view of the fact that these wealthy conaves had made their fortunes with their own hands , were accustomed to hard work and rough fare , it is probable that in their hearts they would have preferred a well cooked mess of pork and beans to all the finical dishes of this gorgeous repast . But they were not dining for themselves , but for the effect on the public mind-in other words , for brag . Side by side with brag , in those engaged in money-getting , is smart- . American smart ; a legitimate offspring of trade . Its manifestations are seen in winks , nods , and smiles of coinplacency . At every turn of life one meets the fearfully cute man , who is always taking in his neighbors in some way or other , and who rejoices in giving the details of each act of decuption . He prides himself on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is written in each lineament of his cunning face - in the conscious smile of being too much for his fellows in every kind of barter . He has a large following , in part because we are a nation of traders and in part because the teaching of the young men has led them in this direction . It is rather the fruit of commerce and false ideas of commercial morality , for the tendency is less marked ( although it still exists ) in agricultural pursuits and liberal professions . The smart man exists and dies in the delusion that he has lived . From youth to death he follows the narrow and tortuous lane of guile and getting in which he is walled in from end to end by what he considers his extraordinary sagacity . After this arid nature , complacent in sterility and selfishness , it is refreshing to meet the man who is not smarter than his neighbors , and who knows nothing of sharp dealing . The eye that looks into our own without winking and without shrewdness becomes by comparison wholesome to contemplate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of excuse or apology was felt to be necessary for the possession of unusual wealth , for it implied that its owner had been gaining without giving . Now the man is apt to be taken to task if he remains poor , and the admiration for wealth has grown beyond that for honesty . Indeed , it has grown so much that it is believed as a matter of course that the feeling must be shared by people in other lands , and when the " distinguished stranger " comes to our shores a dozen of the richest men , each estimated according to his wealth , are selected to entertain him at dinner , as the right and proper way of extending welcome . If the opinion of the honored guest could be obtained concerning such an entertainment when he is not of their guild , and they were made acquainted with it , the probability is that they would be a body of surprised convives . If he be a painter , say , absorbed with form and coldr , and they are occupied with the question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much a yard , it is clear that they can not have much to tell each other . The entertainers hardly enter into the question of broad lights and high lights with enthusiasm , nor can the entertained regard the margin in calico with a palpitating interest . The " distinguished stranger " came to us a while ago possessed of two features particularly attractive to many people of the metropolis : he was a lord and very rich . His reception could not have been more brilliant if he had directed the destinies of nations . The usual collection of moneybags were brought together to eat with him and beguile him with their animated sallies concerning the fall of stocks , the resumption of specie payment , the prospects of the cotton cfop , and kindred themes . He responded feebly , for he had not made his money , but inherited it . His life had been devoted to literature and politics . He was not abreast of the conversation , and the inspiriting remarks concerning // corners in pork , and puts and calls on Pacific Mail , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought conspicuously into view some of the traits of one side of the metropolitan character . He was sought for on all occasions , to shed a lustre over each separate household into which he was introduced . His pockets were full of invitations to all kinds of reunions ; they pervaded his lodgings . In marriages old friends were thrust aside to make way for the stranger . He was *skcd to be godfather by people whom he had nevcr met . It is probable that he was requested to be pall-bearer to the dead whom he had never known in life . It has become proverbial that the Englishman loves a lord ; but the stay of this one in New York proves that he can not love him more than some Americans do . To the eager desire to make money may be traced the general corruption found in our politics and in th' administration of justice . Peculation is so frequent that the people are becoming familiar with it , *and at the same time tolerant of it . It has been said that through newspapers more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowing for this , it will still b* found that it is much in excess of crime in other countries occupying the same grade of civilization which we assume-that is , unconvicted and unsentenced crime . The difference between the United States and other nations is not great in the proportionate number of those who suffer from the penalty of the law , but it is in those whom justice can not reach owing to the corrupt officers of the law . Laws are often made by legislators . who reach their places by means which no honest man would employ , and who are possessed neither of the wisdom nor the attainments necess*ry in a lawmaker , and when the laws are made thay are administered by men who have obtained their right to do so through the same election trickery as the legislators . Bungling and vague as the law may be , if it were interpreted and enforced according to the letter and the spirit , an approximative result might be reached ; but the enforcement is feeble . There is so little faith in it that when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not unfrequently break into a prison and hang the supposed criminal* to a tree or a lamp-post . They who thus take the law into their own hands are not brought to trial , whicW must be taken as a confession by justice of its own weakness . There is so little faith in the protection of the law for the individual that he arms himself throughout the West and the South with knife and pistol . If a robber steals his horse , he gets some of his neighbors together and follows in pursuit , but does not think of applying to the inert agent of the law to assist him . If a burglar steals from the inhabitant of the city , half the time the detective , an independent policeman , is the middle* man between the robbed and . the robber . Lynching is a rude commentary on our execution of the law , but its existence shows that the sense of justice , half savage though it be , is greater in the citizen than in the judge ; in other words , the citizen occupies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one hopeful sign that there may be remedy hereafter , for at bottom the unlawful acfhon is prompted by a desire to see justice done . Corruption in many quarters has hewn the tree of public virtue to the ground , but the roots , wide and deep-spread , still abide in the people . If this were not so , the future would be melamcholy to contemplate . In political morality the comparison between ourselves and England and prance is not to our advantage . The development of crime , exhibited by Cengress and State functionaries during the last few years would be unpossible in the two countries named . The germ* would have been eradicated long before it reached the sturdypro // portions s*hich it has attained with us , as revealed in Congressional investigat*ons . It is true administrative corruption has caused a reaction in public sentiment , but it remains to be seen whether it is sufficiently vigorous to inaugurate anything like a radical and permanent reform . Already the men of the past begin to be pardoned for their political sins , when compared with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much worse than errors of judgment . The almost impeached President , Andrew Johnson , combative and obstinate though he was , comes to be regarded by the lovers of honesty as something of a hero by reason of his sterling , unflinching int3grity while in the exercise of official power . Christianity should be the most important agent in counteracting the avidity of the pursuit of riches , but it seems to be nearly powerless . Indeed , Christianity seems to have fallen into the general movement , as exhibited in the lives of many of its spiritual representatives who are on the lookout for " higher culls , " and playing the ecclesiastical comedy of consulting their Maker with much prayer as to whether they shall stay where they are , or go elsewhere for a better salary . When the Divine will is consulted by these prayerful pastors , it is generally pretty well known what the result will be ; namely , to go wherever there is the most money to be had . " Entering on a larger field of usefuln*ss " is their way of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any other profession . They speak only of laying up treasures for themselves in heaven and of spuming those belonging to earth . Theoretically they are in sackcloth and ashes , walking through a vale of tears . As may be observed , a considerable distance separates these followers of Christ from those who lived on the shores of Galilee and in the hills of Juden . One of the chief causes of the want of vitality in their churches is the difficulty of reconciling doctrine with practice , and it is hard to restrain a smile when a wcalth* pastor of this class tells his bearers that in order to follow the Lord one 's riches must be given to the poor ; in other words , he does not mean what he says . On the other hand , it is difficult to award too much praise to the great majority of clergymen in the poor districts , who devote their lives to the cause for next to nothing . Such pastors look for their wages in another world . The fashionable clergyman with a " granular pharyngitis " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emasculated by the wealth which surrounds him . If he preaches on some vital question concerning man 's daily experience , half the time it - is only to expose his want of knowledge . He does not possess that virility of understanding which comes from friction with men , and many of them *regard him as a sort of person between a man and a woman , whose statements concerning the practical affairs of life require corroboration . But generally salary . he avoids grappling with a prevalent qwq rupt once , twice , or thrice , each time compromising with creditors by paying but a small portion of what they owed , and keeping back property in the name of the wife . Here was a fine field for the exercise of pastoral duty , because these men were so hardened in this particular kind of swindling that they could no longer realize its turpitude , and if they there and then had been told that in one of the most highly civilized countries of Europe for the offences of which they had been guilty they would be inmates of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cushioned pew of a fashionable temple , they would have probably experienced much surprise . " Thou shalt not steal " would have been an appropriate text , for it was the principal root from which the sins of the congregation grew . The preacher went to one of the branches-a twig-of this outgrowth and plucked at it in a feeble way . In listening to the pale platitudes , one longed mightily for a man of the pattern of Paul , who would have pulled up this tree by the roots without respect for the rich and powerful who sat before him . An effort would probably have been made to cast the man of Tarsus out ; but the prospect of such a result we know would only have made him the more aggressive . Had they pushed him out of the pulpit , he would have cried out to them from the vestibule ; had they ejected him thence , he would have called them to repentance from the curbstone . The great moral question of its day was the abolition of slavery , and now it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public mind is so accustomed to theft that if committed even by the highest functionaries of the State , it does not produce a shock corresponding to the proportions of the crime . It is a dark cloud , reaching from the Lakes to the Gulf and from ocean to ocean , blighting in its shadow municipal , State , and Federal government . No enlightened nation in the world shows the corruption which infests almost every branch of the American Government its parallel can only be found in the semi-civilization of Mexico . The foundation on which this nation was raised was probably as solid in virtue as that of most other nations ; and if the country has gone astray , the cause must be sought rather in society than in the form of government . Were it true that corruption is the effect of our institutions , they should be changed , though they teok the form of an iron despotism , if honesty might thereby become the first requisite in government administration . But the fault is not there ; it is the desire of getting money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not driven to stealing through the temptation of hoarding money , or the primary wants of life , so much as in spending it to maintain a false position in society . In society everywhere caste is an important question , and it is perhaps more so in America , where there is no well defined sign of aristocracy which belongs to rank and birth of other countries . Hence is there much contending to belong to the branch of society which is or affects to be superior , and as the principal sign of such position comes fromihe exhibition of wealth , the ostentation is general . To show superiority by the exhibition of riches is rather a vulgar notion of an aristocracy , but there is scarcely any other . Social aspirations all tend in this direction ; all desire to be Brahmins , and in their fight to become so the sinews of war are stretched to the snapping point , and then dishonest means are resorted to to hang out the sign of apparent wealth . A m*n is born a nobleman in England , and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impregnable . But here , as there is no distinctive , unmistakable characteristic of aristocracy , those who belong or affect to belong to it have a general understanding as regards the little barriers which they set up to defend themselves from the // encroachments of those who are not in fellowship with them . He who sells a yard of calico , for instance , is interdicted , but he who sells a bale of it is eligible , the distinction between the two , as will be observed , being very fine . The man who sells a bag of peanuts may cross the threshold into the circle of the elect , but our Italia4 friend on the corner who buys them from him to sell in small quantities may never catch a glimpse of it except from the basement . Their business is the samethe purchase and sale of peanuts-yet there is a social gulf between them . Thus the difference between this aristocracy and what it considers its inferiors is the difference between the handful and the sack , the pint and the barrel , the pound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mercantile view of an aristocracy , and the contemplation of it to a person not in trade , and therefore likely to be impartial , is not without amusement . Those who inherit their fortune from a grandfather take their seats near the altar in the temple of the aristocracy ; those who hold their possessions from a father occupy places in the body of it ; and those who make their own fortune are obliged to content themselves in the vestibule . Here is shown the desire to build a family on the reputation of an ancestor , of which the basis is money , since there is no title to transmit . There has been a great deal of theological evasion about the passage that it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven , but it is consistent with all that the Bible teaches on the subject of wealth . Without going so far as to accept Proudhon 's maxim , that " Property is Robbery , " it is yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fraud , and selfishness , which are naturally in flagrant opposition to all the rules for man 's guidance in the Old and New Testaments . To love thy neighbor as thyself is an injunction difficult , nay , almost impos sible to obey , for it is against nature . But it is comparatively easy for all honest men to respect the rights of neighbors and strangers ; and if this is done , the probabilities are that they do not become rich , and this , it may be inferred , is why the way to heaven is beset with such difficulty . Rich men who are known to give are much beset for money by clergymen , both in the pulpit and out of it , in the name of the Lord , and it is to be feared that the sums thus obtained are often used for purposes which are not sanctioned by Him whose name is invoked for them . To relieve misery and suffering , to spread truths calculated to elevate and make happy , are objects to which money obtained in this way may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not so clear that the same may be said of that used in the construction of magnificent churches and the maintenance of some foreign missions . It is as plainly the duty of the giver to place his gift where it will be of most advantage in a charitable way as it is to give it . To know that many people in the most populous quarters of the cities are suffering for the want of food and medical treatment , and in the face of this knowledge to give a handsome sum to a fashionable clergyman to build an ostentatious and costly church , indicates a singular idea of Christian duty . To maintain an expensive mission at the ends of the earth , for the purpose of proselyting people whose morality at least is equal to our own ( and this is one of the best tests of a religion ) , while the majority of our own people remain in ignorance of the Biblc , furnishes another instance of a peculiar idea of duty . Many preachers convince the rich men of their congregations that the best way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organ , put up a new spire , construct a new edifice to worship in , or send missionaries to Palestine to lead the Jews from the errors of their ways  --  a people , be it said in passing , who , according to the statistics of civ- // qwq who never answers back . He never Bays no to any argument , however poor , and he is pummelled every Sunday within an inch of his diabolical life . This victory over an enemy who does not return the blows given him has a tendency to make the preacher satisfied with his performance , however poor it may be , for he knows in advance that the evil one will only meet with disgrace and defeat . There is an absence of that mental friction which comes of a more palpable antagonism . Where there is a monopoly in any department of business , there must be a decline of excellence , and if Mephistopheles could really be made to appear in the flesh to reply , it would have the same effect on the preacher 's mental faculties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for charitable purposes is the continuous chorus heard from the pulpit , which is certainly an important part of the preacher 's duty . That charity covers many sins is generally conceded , and the practice of it is worthy of hearty commendation ; but there is another feature of ethics which is hardly dwelt on as it should be , and that is a proper appreciation of the principle of justice . It is comparatively easy to be charitable , but it is hard to be just . Donations for charity are often made from the momentary impulse of an emotional nature , and justice is to be meted out only according to the calm and wellconsidered plan of a noble head united to a noble heart . One is often the affair of a few minutes , the other is the enduring and logical principle of a lifetime . Gamblers and abandoned women are often generous givers , their gifts being made as an offset to their ill doing , with the idea of propitiating Providence . The unindictable swindler , whose pockets are well filled with plunder , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into respectable society in this way , for after the commission of the crime there is the natural craving for all the props which the church and society can give 42 toward sustaining or creating a moral character for the criminal . A just man can not be guilty of any vice calculated to injure his fellow creatures , and one such , in the progress of civilization , is worth a dozen men who are simply irreflectively charitable . The emotional man of charity is often guilty of reprehensible acts in getting money , and his defence is that he gives to the poor . The evil which he practises more than effaces the good , for the right and wrong get so mixed in the public mind that it leads to demoralization . Benjamin Franklin was not lacking in charity , but that which most entitles him to our esteem was his preeminent sense of justice . Such an example of honesty should be continually held before the people by their spiritual and other teachers , for common honesty is just now the wanting and consequently the most necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benignant man , of unflinching rectitude , has been blamed by some for the lessons of close economy taught in " Poor Richard , " under the plea that they are narrow and ungenerous . They who make such a criticism probably belong to those who contract debts without any idea of how they are to be paid , and live lavishly on other people 's moneynot forgetting even to make charitable donations . Such people are not in the habit of denying themselves any pleasure in order that others may enjoy their rights , and their moral conceptions render them incapable of understanding the character of the philosopher who would starve his body and clothe it in old garments rather than defraud a fellow being out of a dollar . Were he with us now in public life his influence and example would be worth more than all the gold which California has ever produced . The idea can hardly be too much dwelt upon , that man 's road to independence is rather through simplicity than in the accumulation of riches . Disasters may at any time take away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
