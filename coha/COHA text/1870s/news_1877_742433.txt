txt In one of the scattered towns of Nevada a suit was recently brought before a minor court . for the recovery of $500 , the amount of a promissory note held by a mining speculator who had been reputed rich , but who had suddenly come to financial grief . The maker of the note , and defendant in the case , seems , from the local chronicles , to be a broken tradesman who had . had a hard time until he married . a Sacramento heiress , a widow , and . was thus introduced to a degree of prosperity hitherto unknown . The giver and the owner of the note had been friends , it appears , before the defendant 's marriage ; but that event , as so often happens , had severed their relations . The plaintiff had . frequently endeavored to get the $500 , and had at last resorted to legal means for securing what he held to be a just debt that the defendant was abundantly able to discharge . Ho had widely advertised his possession of the uncollectable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' husband by portraying his dishonesty and meanness to a former friend , now in straitened circumstances . So much appeared on the face of the case . For subsequent enlightenment wo must depend on the harangues of the counselors , one of whom was a Colonel , acting for the plaintiff , and the other a Major , acting for the defendant . The defendant admitted the note to be genuine , but averred that it had been given to the plaintiff , not in the regular way of business , but in consideration of his securing the consent of a young woman , a resident of Carson City , to be the defendant 's wife . Had he secured her consent , the money would have been promptly paid . But ho disgusted the lady by the manner in which ho performed the part of mediator . He proved treacherous ' to his employer ; he slandered him vilely ; he basely tried to supplant the honorable lover in his mistress ' affections . Such was the language of the eloquent Major , though why a man engaging an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be called an " honorable lover , " is not at all clear to a dispassionate mind . Peoplelivingnear and beyond the " Rockies " have a high-colored form of expression which needs to be considerably seduced in sober translation . " The result was , " continued the Major , " that the lady would hold no communication with my client , and ordered the perfidious agent out of the house . Still , lie has had the audacity to demand payment of a note given him for service which ho has not only never rendered , but which ho has stained with the blackest ingratitude . " The counsel then entered into denunciation of a man who would be willing to take money for furthering a marriage , and inquired pathetically how such a man could expect to be considered " high-toned . " Sundry attempts at interruption had been made by the opposing counsel , who at last got a hearing . Ho pronounced the recital about the Carson City woman a prodigious fabrication , devised to defeat the ends of justice ; that the present consort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tact , management , and address of the plaintiff , who had been sordidly refused $500 after he had gained for his employer real estate , stocks , and bonds worth at a low estimate at least $250,000 . He repelled the charge that his client had degraded himself by consenting to gain a wife vicariously . His client had done nothing more than other men of dignity and respectability do . " In New-York and other Eastern cities , " said the Colonel , r " matrimonial brokerage is a regular and entirely legitimate business . Many gentlemen are engaged in it , and . nobody thinks of criticising them on account of their occupation . Matrimonial brokerage is a branch of industry demanding talent , delicacy , and . energy , and to affect to despise it is snobbish and cantankerous . " The Major , on the other side , asseverated , with many gestures and . much expectoration , that the defendant 's wife had had no personal acquaintance . with the plaintiff before or since her nuptials ; that his client had conducted his own wooing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a week 's time from his first introduction to her he had " stood at the altar with the one woman of all the world he truly and devotedly loved . " To corroborate his statement ho asked leave of the court to send for her and place her on the witness-stand . Leave was granted , and she arrived so quickly as to render it probable that she had been awaiting a slum-lions . She is described as handsome and interesting , though , remembering Western gallantry and hyperbole , she may not have been either . She assuredly was not very refined , judging from her reported speech . She denied in terms more energetic than polite any knowledge of the plaintiff beyond a general understanding that he was " a wretched dead-beat and capable of the cussedest sort of meanness . " His assumption of having been instrumental in enlisting her affections for another man she characterized as " a white-livered lie , " the Judge granting her the largest freedom , as much no doubt from the amusement she furnished as from his chivalrous regard for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to . make a speech , concluding with the remark that she did n't need " any galoot to boss her jobs ; " that she did her own courting and her own marrying , and did n't employ any clerks when she was " on that lay . " The ease seemed plain enough . If the plaintiff had . a genuine note of the defendant , ( and his counsel admitted it to be such , ) it matters not whether itwas given for a horse or a wife . But the Judge , manifestly influenced by the charms and chatter of the woman  --  gallantry is an illustrious weakness in the far West  --  reserved his decision , and dismissed the court , to obtain an opportunity to flirt with the California heiress , rich , at least , in choice expletives and Pacific slope phraseology . It might be supposed that the principals in the case would have terminated the chapter by emptying their revolvers on one another . But they did not  --  probably because one being German and the other English , they wisely preferred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
