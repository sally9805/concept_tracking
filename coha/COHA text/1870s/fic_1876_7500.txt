Field , Eugene , 1850-1895 : " SLUG 14 . " A Doggerel Rhyme ( Detailing the Fate of a " Rat " Who Spaced Nonpareil with Brevier ) . Read by Eugene Field , Esq. , at the Printer 's Banquet , January 1st , 1876 , at St. Joseph , Missouri . from " Slug 14. " 1876 None knew where he came from or where he was born , But he entered the " news-room " quite early one morn ; The foreman was busy discussing his lunch And the " comps " were all sorting their " dupes , " in a bunch . The strange man peered in with mysterious air . And regarded the group with a curious stare . Imagine a person all tatters and rags , Whose pants hung about him like , loose gunny bags , With coat soiled and grimy , and minus a shirt With boots full of holes and covered with dirt . With a thing on his head that resembled a mat That someone had tramped on  --  he called it a hat  --  : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have an idea of whom I now write . But he might have been poor , and had no good clo'es . Or perhaps was eccentric  --  nobody knows . But one thing was certain  --  we never had guessed That one could have features as that man possessed . His body was crooked , his feet were turned in And his face wore a wicked half cynical grin , Such a queer , hooked-up nose was ne'er before seen , And his eyes ! Lord , what eyes  --  they were lit'rally green ! His cheek-bones were high , his eyebrows uncouth . Like a yawning abyss stretched his wonderful mouth , A scrubby red beard ran to waste on his jaws . While his ears  --  well  --  they  --  no . I really must pause In this their description  --  I fain will confess No language of mine their wonders express . They assumed just such shapes as their strange master willed . As he worked them as deftly as if he were skilled In the arts of the devil . Sometimes they were pointed . Sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the sails of a boat : and again They appeared the same shape as the ears of most men . His hair was as red as a quick-tempered girl 's . And lay on his conical head , in short curls ; But they raised and stood straight as we " comps " eyed their master As if they expected some direful disaster . " Well , what do you want ? " Slug 13 soon cried . " I want to get work , " the strange being replied . " Work ? " cried we in chorus , " can you hammer lead ? " " I 'm bad at that bus'ness , " the strange being said . Well , somehow or other , despite his vile look  --  For the stranger we all of us some pity took . And when he unfolded his piteous tale , And when we remembered the fierce wintry gale That was blowing without , we declared , to a man , " We 'll help the poor devil as much as we can ! " So we gave him a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laid him down with apparent delight . " Old Frank " did n't like him  --  the dog knew full well The tramp printer had n't the good printer smell ! The Cap'n , our foreman , has got a big heart , As big as six oxen hitched to a dirt cart . And when he observed the stranger 's sad face An ' his rags , he determined to find him a place , And , with Tufts ' permission , he gave him a " case . " Well , by God ! In our office from that fated day  --  Excuse my plain language , all hell was to pay ! Of all the damned " blacksmithing " under the sun . The damnedest by that self same party was done ! Why , sir , when there came in a wedding report , You ought to have seen that " lead-pounder " cavort ! He got so confused , and so reckless besides , That for " kissing " he set " the groom pissed on the bride ! " An ' when Deacon Burke wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hoary . " Slug 14 inserted a " w. " when An " h " would have suited all good " Union men . " And so it went in " ads " and " eds "  --  he seemed To take delight in botching . No one dreamed Of having copy set " O. K. " by him . Unless , perchance , he took a sudden whim To set no more than fifteen hundred " m 's " a night , And then he managed to get matters nearly right . One time , we all remember very well He " pied " a " market galley " all to hell . Again , spaced " agate " out with " nonpareil . " Lord ! how the Cap'n raved ! But first says he In gentle accents " Who set up four C ? " Slug 14 answered up , in accents clear , As all good " typos " answer , " Here ! " Then Cap'n leaned back on the stone and swore ; " By Jesus Christ ! as I 've remarked before And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Brevier ' wo n't ' justify ' with ' nonpareil ! ' " These and such scenes were often frequent , till The good Macloon had more than got his fill . One night , the last night of Slug 14 's life , In our " composing room " report was rife , That in a solemn conclave held that day , ' T had been decreed to " fire " him sans delay . But then , as if to fill the cup of mis'ry up . And cooly dash the mis'ry and the cup , Slug 14 carried on as ne'er before . He " pied " a " galley , " tipped his " cases " o'er , An ' brought an uncorrected " market galley " down . And set it on the big " imposing stone . " Then , to complete , he stepped on little Sweeny 's tail ! And Sweeny , bless his heart ! set up a wail . Out rushed E. Field , with wildly flashing eye , Followed by Burke , while Dutton stood hard by  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local " cried . E. Field looked volumes at Cap . H. Macloon . Said he , " My friend , the end ca n't come too soon ! " " No , " said the Cap'n , " Here , you man ! Come here as quickly as you can ! I have long doubted whence you came  --  Present your ' card ' ! Divulge your name ! " " Card ? What d'ye mean ? " the gaping idiot cried . " Your ' Union card ! ' " the foreman then replied . " I ai n't no Union man ! " " Good Lord ! what 's that ? " The " comps " all shrieked  --  " No , I 'm a ' Rat ! ' " He spoke his doom , in awful silence all Those thirteen " comps " marched slowly down the hall , And from the closet dragged a cannon grim  --  Slug 14 felt that death awaited him . Yet , like a rat , despairing , full of hate . Baffled he stood and mocked approaching fate . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viewed the scene with pallid face . They poured the powder in , pound after poun ' . Then with the " shooting-stick " and " mallet " rammed it down . " Bring on the victim ! ' Fire ' him out of here ! " Pale was the Cap'n 's face , but not a tear Of sorrow or regret ! They seize the wretch . And now upon the cold imposing stone they stretch His struggling body , bind him fast with rope . Quiet he lies , devoid of every hope . His body in the fatal cannon then they force , Shouting erstwhile in accents madly hoarse , " Death to all ' Rats ' ! "  --  the fatal match is struck . The cannon pointed upwards  --  then kerchuck ! Fix ! snap ! ker-boom ! Slug 14 's grotesque form Sails out to ride a race upon the storm . Up through the roof , and up into the sky  --  As if he sought for " cases " up on high , Till like a rocket , or like one who 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! This is no romance , friends  --  it 's solemn truth . Heed it , ye vet'rans , ye ambitious youth , Or , if ye doubt , consult with any one Who worked with me when this fell deed was done ; Or ask Macloon , and you will shortly hear Of him who " spaced out agate " with " brevier.
