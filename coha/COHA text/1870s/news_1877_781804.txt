txt The formation of State Boards of Charity throughout the Union is one of the marked steps of improvement in our pauper administration during the past generation . These associations have aided much in removing the one great defect of the American Poor law  --  which has come down by inheritance even from the times of HENRY VIII. ? a too great localizing of the charge of the poor and dependent classes . They have helped to withdraw the insane , the deaf and dumb , the blind and defective , from small county institutions , whore they suffered necessarily untold abuses , and have gradually placed them in larger State asylums , where the resources of science and a more liberal treatment have made a vast improvement in their condition . These boards have also unified the laws in regard to tramps and non-resident paupers , and have thrown the burdens for their support whore they rightfully belong . But best of they have , iu many States , sought to remove the class of helpless children from the degrading influences of alms-house life , and have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the community . These children have either been placed in State institutions or have been scattered in families . In Massachusetts the State Board has been encouraged to make most valuable investigations , and in all the States they have thrown a flood of light on the dark and intricate questions relating to pauperism and the treatment of the dependent classes . For some inscrutable reason our own State Board has never received half the encouragement from the Legislature which its sister boards have in other States . The appropriation to it has always been meagre , and its efforts much crippled by want of funds . It has , however , succeeded in carrying out some most important reforms , and has been Much assisted in these by an association of private individuals throughout the State , called the State Charities Aid Society , who inspect the public institutions . The extent of our State charities may bo judged from a fow statistics contained in the recent report of Dr. Herr , the Secretary of the State Board . There are in the State , it appears , 56 county @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 12,614 pauper inmates , of whom only 339 are colored . The sexes are about equally divided-6,334 males to 6,230 females . hi these various houses are yet , unfortunately , 2,179 children under 16 years of age . Nearly halt ' ( 45 per cent. ) were born in this country , and about one-third ( 34.31 per cent. ) in Ireland . Of the parents , about 62 per cent . were of foreign birth . From the whole number , over 21 per cent. , or 2,656 persons , became paupers before they were 20 years old . . The average tinge of dependence for each pauper is 4.88 years , As might be expected , the ratio of ignorance is large , 31 per cent. , or 3,106 persons , being unable to read or write , and 1,449 being able to read only . Intemperance , of course , prevails , UN per cent , of the males being intemperate , and 41.97 per cont. of the females . It is generally supposed that in our various alms-houses there are many persons who have " seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show this . But few arc found who have ever owned real estate or any considerable property , only 1.88 per cent . having been commercial persons , and 1.11 per cent . members of the professions . In the rural counties the tendency of pauperism is to be transmitted by families . It was discovered in ' our alms-honses that 2,153 of the paupers wore grouped in families . In theso families , there were known to have bees dependent on public alms , during three gemirations , 14,901 persons ; the total number of insane in the same families was 4,968 ; the total number of idiots , 844 , and the total number of drunkards ; 8,863 . This brief array of figures will show how important is the charge of our State Board of Charity , and how much remains to be done to rid the State of thre causes of pauperism . The board has yet to remove hundreds of children from the pauperizing influences of alms-houses ; and the community has still a great task in breaking the line . of criminal or pauper inheritance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall prevent the formation o : paupers.
