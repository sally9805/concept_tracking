ARTICLE 1. - PRESIDENT FAIRCHILD 'S MORAL PHILOSOPHY . Jforal Philosophy ; or , the Science of Obligation . By JAMES H. FAIRCHILD , President of Oberlin College . MORAL PHILOSOPHY is a branch of science upon which many books have already been written , and still there is room for improvement . No two writers are entirely agreed except in the more prominent principles of the science ; yet they agree much more nearly in ideas than in forms of statement . In proseenting this most important branch of study , one which ocenpies no secondary place , we need a text book which shall be an improvement on those hitherto in use ; and one that shall , if possible , harmonize the differing views of Philosophers . This book professes to be especially adapted to the use of pupils in schools and colleges . As such we hail its appearance // 550 with great satisfaction . It certainly is an improvement upon most text books heretofore used . The author has adapted it very well to its end ,  --  in size , arrangement , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small book , but we can not help regretting that he did not give some extended explanations and illustrations on several important subjects , even at the risk of enlarging the book . We think that this might have been done without any enlargement , by condensing some portions of less importance and by leaving out repetitions of the same or similar ideas . We are much pleased with the catch words placed in the margin of each page , designating the leading ideas treated of . On the whole the arrangement and manner of treating the subjects are such as will assist instructors in imparting , and pupils in acquiring a knowledge of the truths developed . The principles of psychology and of moral philosophy which the author adopts and makes the foundation of his reasoning , are mainly correct ; indeed we think that scarcely any erroneoas principles can be found among them . This is saying considerable of any writer on moral philosophy . We do not think , however , that these true principles are as clearly stated and as fully and correctly carried out as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much easier to find defects than to correct them , we shall proceed to point out as clearly as we can , what we regard as defects or failures in the development of these true principles of the science ,  --  not all that might be stated , but only the more important ones . The psychological principles stated in this book are very few-hardly sufficient we think to give a full and solid foundation on which to rear the science of moral philosophy . What the moral facnlties are , and how known , we think should have been a little more fully illustrated . Conscience , the great moral faculty of the soul , is in no sense treated psychological ly . The authority of its acts , as well as its operations and limnitations , are very fully and ably discussed ; but we think its exi8teflCe and our knowledge of it should have been carefully considered , as the great distinctive faculty of moral agency . The three-fold division of the faculties of the soul into " intellect , sensibility , and free will , " which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , feeling , and willing , is adopted very correctly by the author as the tine division . The faculty of free-will is described as the " power of choosing or refusing , " that is , of choosing any given object or its opposite . The possession of this faculty he affirms " is implied in the very idea of obligation , " and " is an essential attribute of personality . " The faculty of feeling is described as " the suceptibility to pleasure or pain , " good or evil . This idea of good or evil , revealed in the sensibility , is declared to be " the necessary antecedent of that of obligation . " Here the author states very clearly to o of the necessary conditions of obligation , viz , freewill or freedom , and a " good " in the sensibility . If he had added to these " a good as an end , " that is , a good seen or known by the moral agent to be within his power to choose , he would have given all of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On page 2*th , he says , " well-being1 satisfaction , happiness then is the true good  --  the sumnutin bonum , , not merely in the sense of the highest good , but of the final , ultimate , absolute good , that in which all other goods terminate and find their value . " " iRelative good on the other hand is good , that is valued for its uses . " Again he says , " the term happiness is used in this treatise , not in the low , restricted sense given it by some writers , but as comprehensive of all satisfaction , blessedness , wellbeing , from the lowest forms of animal pleasure to the highest joys which dwell in the bosom of God . " " In this sense , it is absolute good and the only absolute good . " Here we have happiness the good , the only good that is absolute , and all other things good only as uses : *s tending to promote happiness . The opposite of happiness is misery , pain , or suffering . The only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tending to produce misery or to destroy happiness . This should have been added as a first truth . These are all simple ideas , primary , fundamental , and uni*ersal . They might and we think ought to have been laid down as axioms in morals in the very commencement of our author 's work . They are axioms which form the necessary // basis of any moral reasoning , and through which every one cognizes his own being as moral and responsible . Now with these moral axioms , evidently regarded as such by our author , where is obligation found ? and how does it originate ? The author answers this question fully , thus , " In the presence or thought of this good ( absolute good ) obligation is perceived . The intelligence sees the good to be an object of value , and with that perception arises the idea of obligation. ** With this clear statement of the origin of the idea , it is marvellous that in his opening chapter the author should have affirmed that " obligation , the theme of ethical philosophy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The idea is a simple one incapable of analysis . " Can that be a simple idea which originates from several other ideas as antecedent and necessary conditions as the author affirms the idea of obligation does ? Such a concept admits of a definition . It can not , with any reason , be disposed of by the niere synonyms , ought , duty , right , and the like words , which equally demand explanation . The idea of obligation is , indeed , a universal idea , though not simple . Had the author put his own ideas concerning it as expressed in various forms and places , into a full definition , it would have stood thus : Moral obligation is the binding force or influence of the highest good , seen and known by the moral being at the time to be within his power to choose . Here are all the conditions of obligation , viz , a free agent , a person , a good to be chosen , seen to be the highest good , and within his power to choose as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , obligation , as Dr. I-lopkins says , is necessarily affirmed . On these conditions existing for the first time the feeling of obligation is produced in the sensibility and the idea is originated-makes its first appearance and is cognized by the moral being . What then is it that originates the feeling of obligation , first brings it into the field of every one 's consciousness ? Only one answer can reasonably be given to this question , which is the answer given by this author . He says , " In the presence of this good is obligation perceived , and the idea of obligation arises . " It is the good , the absolute good , blessedness , happiness , that which is valuable in itself in some mode presented , that always gives the idea ; // and if it gives or originates the idea , it certainly imposes the obligation . This is the thing that influences-binds with its own inherent force to the required choice . It is nsnally , perhaps always , some specific good in the first instance-some good , embodied in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i. e. : specific obligation . We shall reach the same result if we proceed to examine the origin of the generic obligation . This is an obligation to choose the good , happiness , or well-being distinct from any partienlar object , being , or action in which the good may be found . Our author describes this generic good in the following language . " Well-being , satisfaction , happiness is good independently of ny desire which may fasten upon it , and of any relation whatever . " This is good in the generic sense . Happiness , blessedness , or well-being , stands thus on its own independent merits of inherent value ; deriving none of its value from any thing beside . But when our author describes it as a good , independent of any desire or relation , he evidently means any speciflc desire or any specific relation . He certainly does not mean to deny that it stands related to the moral being or any and every moral being as an object to be chosen , and chosen for itself ; for he repeatedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by declaring that it awakens no movement in the sensibility , nor tends to do so ; but that happiness or well-being is a good . This is the generic good which our author tells n* the intelligence sees to be an object of value . Now as this good is generic , so must the obligation also be generic , lie describes the obligation to be " The duty to respect it , to treat it as good , to will it to all sentient beings , to stand ready to promote it . " Here is a state of mind that is purely generic . Not a specific volition fastening upon any specific good , or object of good , which passes out of the mind as soon as it is formed ; but a generic state of mind  --  a " willinc* to all sentient beings * " not to any one in particular . " " It is a standing ready to promote the good as occasion or opportunity arise3 , " the choice of a good which is always present and one which never can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tower with a will ready to act with energy , looking out for the coming of this generic good in some specific form . It // President Ihircidid 's Moral Philosophy . Oct. , is a will or purpose to direct the powers of being to the production of good . This is seen to be a continuous state of mind , covering time , not originated to-day and as quickly abandoned to-morrow , but as our anthor says , existing " entirely independent of the relation ( specific ) of the good to ourselves or to any other particular being . " Covering even the time when " the being whose good is contemplated may be wholly beyond our reach , the ob*gation to choose the good is still the same . " Though it may be impossible or even improper that any thing should be done to promote that good ; tk t is , no way be seen at the time by which it can be done , " this does not affcct the obligation to will the good , " that is , in this generic sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . here , then , is described fully and minutely the generic obligation to choose the generic good . It is in point here to inquire when does this generic obligation originate , and what imposes it ? Our author answers in the following language : " Thence to every moral being the only condition of obligation is the perception of the good , " meaning this generic good . Here the only condition to any and every moral being is the perception of his generic goodthe good of being in general . It is seen by the moral being . It is always within his power to choose it  --  to will it in the highest degree of which he is capable . These things being true our author says this generic obligation arises . But what originates it ? The perception , as he says , is the conditionthe only condition . And what is more , it is nothing but a condition . The only thing which brings upon the moral being this generic obligation is the good , this generic good , the " blessedness or happiness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farce-this influences-this imposes obligation by its own inherent value . This is the one idea or truth which more than any other pervades the whole of this author 's reasoning . The truth that happiness is the ultimate good  --  the absolute good , the only thing valuable in itself-that which gives to government its right to be and invests the ruler of every name , both divine and human , with his only right to rule . All individual rights have their basis in susceptibilities , or capacities to enjoy  --  and all duties iu capabilities of producing blessedness. // Surely no one can fail to see that in the view of this author happiness is the one broad foundation on which all obligation rests . This being so , it is one grand failure in this work that the author did not in the commencement of it give to moral obligation a distinct definition instead of asserting that it could not be defined . He should have clearly and fully announced that the foundation of moral obligation is happiness , i.e. , generic obligation is imposed by the general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6bligation by willing the highest good of being in general , is , according to our author , right action . This is benevolence . In this alone resides right moral character or goodness , while the opposite , a refusal to meet this generic obligation is sinful action wrong moral character . To one or the other of these two opposing states of will , every specific moral act is to be traced , and derives its character from it . The term henevolei*ce is here used in a broader sense than is ommonly given to it . It is perhaps more generally applied to denote the choice by a moral being of the highest good ot others than himself , excluding his own highest well being ; but in this treatise it includes both the highest good of the individual and that of all others . Thus developed it is a universal law . It is applicable to all moral beings ; both to the creator and to creatures . It makes happiness the ultimate good ; the end for all , giving the character for goodness to all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , finite and ignorant , it needs some distinct embodiment , some directing force , by which the created and the finite who can not be supposed to have a perfect knowledge of duty depending on the seen tendencies and relations of things may be guided . Such a directing force is the being and will of God . He is infinite in knowledge , goodness , and power , and has all resources of good treasured up in his own being . He alone is able to instruct , and guide , as well as bless . His will , ascertained , becomes the highest , yea , the infallible evidence of what will secure the highest good to each and to all . This generic principle of benevolence directs at once to the choice of Tilin as the supreme good foi all created intelligences , and his will as their sure guide to the // complete realization of the end of their being . Thus the law of love to God becomes the law of benevolent action for all creatures . If the author had illustrated this relation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of love to God , it would have added much value to his work . This principle is the same as Dr. Hopkins 's Lau* of Love . This most generic principle divides itself into two distinct forms ; one the choice of one 's own highest good ; and the other the choice of the highest good of others , as required by the law of God . These two obligations are perfectly distinct , and yet sustaining to each other the most important relations . We think the author has failed to draw out fully this distinction , and to illustrate their relations . He admits that the generic obligation of benevolence embraces our own good , as he says on page 27 : " Our own good is included in this absolute good ; the good of being , and hence is a proper object of our regard . It is as valuable as that of our neighbor , and no more valuable . It lies within our reach as no other good does , and hence a special obligation to promote it . " But what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are its relations to the obligation to promote the well being of others than myself ? What is its extent and limitations ? Are these two obligations ever in conflict ? If so , which must yield ? These are points on which the author has failed to furnish us any light except what we may gather from his general discussions . Here are two distinct obligations , one to promote my own highest well being , the other the highest well being of others . Each of them are only branches of the generic obligation of benevolence as defined by the author ; yet each is a generic obligation in itself . To choose my highest good is to choose the highest happiness of which my being is capable ; not as it is found in any specific object or course of action , but in any and every possible way in which my faculties can secure it to myself . This is evidently a generic choice . Equally so is the choice to promote to the extent of my abilities the welfare of others . Each is the choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these choices , though generic , must exist in the mind at the same time . They may and will extend over the whole of my im mortal existence , unless they conflict one with the other , so // that one must yield to the other . But this can never be , for they are both imposed upon every moral being by the Creator and by the absolute good of each dependent on choice . But how can they both be met ? Will not specific objects of good to my neighbor and to myself often come in conflict ? Most assnredly they will . What then ? Is there any necessary conflict in these generic obligations ? Never . The preponderating evidence for the highest good must always decide the choice whether it be my own good or my neighbor 's . The highest good always has in it binding force , it imposes obligation . Bat suppose there is no clearly perceived preponderance of evidence ? Instead of it , let there be doubt , or a known equality of good in the specific objects to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and only one can be secnred by me  --  but either may . What , then , shall decide ? Manifestly the divine principle of self denial for the good of my neighbor in accordance with the Apostolic declaration , " that it is more blessed to give than to receive . " My neighbor receives the good , and I an increased amount . This self-denial this doing* ood to others , is the highest source of blessedness known to moral beings . It is the universal moral law-that by which God regulates his own being and fills himself with blessedness . To seek to fill my being with blessedness by doing good to others has no drawback in it , either to myself or to my neighbor . There is no selfishness here . It meets the highest obligation resting on me , and secures the end of my being . On this principle will the awards of the last judgment proceed , as we are informed in IRomans ii. , 6 , 7 , " Who will render unto every one according to his deeds  --  to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for glory , and honor , and immortality , " eternal life . One 's highest blessedness , not simply taking it because it ca n't be helped ; but seeking it by well doing , is rewarded by the judge with eternal life . So , too , it is affirmed of the Saviour , that he endured the cross , despising the shame for the joy that was set before him , i.e. , his own highest blessedness secured by suffering to save the world . Thus these two generic obligations are perfectly consistent , and never in conflict . The same road must be traveled over to reach either of them , and both at the same time . What if my highest blessedness // is reached oniy through the way of blessedness to others ? Their blessedness is not simply a means . It is absolute good , as well as my own  --  and both are ends to be chosen - ultimate ends . In failing to state and illustrate the generic obligation to secure one 's highest happiness , the author seems to us to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the source of all wrong moral character . H e does not indeed an v where say that this choice of one 's highest happiness is selfishness ; and yet , in some statements , he leaves the impression that he so regards it , or something akin to it . The two things in many minds are confounded ; which would seem to have required a clear definition of selfishness . On page 52 , he says : " Selfishness , as special vice , is subjection of the will to the desire of good , involving an over estimate of one*s own importance and a disregard to the equal rights of others . " This definition is too indefinite to give us a clear idea of the author 's meaning . Is the choice of good , or any object of good in each and every instance , where there is any desire for it , selfishness ? If so , then to choose one 's highest happiness under any circumstances must be selfishness ; for no one can secure his highest blessedness without desiring it . Indeed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of others , without desiring it ? Can good or happiness in any form be presented to any moral being without some movement of the susceptibility i.e. , without awakening some desire , even though it may not be within the compass of his power at present to secure it ? Good , perceived , moves susceptibility ; creates obligation , as the author often affirms . What , then , is the subjection of the will to the desire of good , which is selfishness ? Is it a choice of some good , as the author s . ys , zhich involves " a disregard of the equal rights of others ? " If this , and this only , is the meaning , then the definition is correct and intelligible . It is a subjection of the will to the desire for a good which conflicts with the highest good , and is the true and commonly received idea of selfishness . iBut is this state of the will , in view of our author , permanent and abiding , a generic state , or is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and temporary ? // On page 52 he says : " Theological writers often use the term as expressing the opposite of benevolence , or the essence of all sin ; an unfortunate use of the word , as we 4*ave seen , and implying a state of facts which does not exist . " Page 33 the author says ,  --  " In sinful action we find no general , comprehensive end , which is the object of pursuit in all forms of evil doing , corresponding with the good of being in right or benevolent action . " This seems a rejection of the coinmonly received doctrine that selfishness is a permanent , controlling state of mind  --  a generic state of the will to use the faculties of being to minister to self-gratification  --  to bring good to self irrespective of the highest good of being in general and in conflict with it . And yet , notwithstanding this language and some other expressions like it , we do not believe that the author really rejects the commonly received idea of 3elflshness ; for he often uses language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 50 , " It lies in the refusal to regard the well being of all , and in this respect , it is as it should be , the contradictory of benevolence , " the very language which he says , when used by theological writers , " implies a state of facts which does not exist . " Again on page 30 , " Wrong or sinful action is a refusal to meet obligation or duty , a refusal to be benevolent . " But this unreasonable action must have a motive . This is found in the impulse of the desires and passions . The form of the sinful action depends upon the ruling desire . In general , these desires change . In all these eases the sinful element is the same , the neglect of good ; the refusal to be benevolent . " Apart fronY this element there is no sin in yielding to desire . It is right for moral beings to gratit* desire when the gratification is not in conflict with benevolence . " As opposed to benevolence , on page 259 , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and on page 291 , " a life of self-indulgence , nursing of one 's own ease or comfort or pleasure . " , here we have the fact clearly stated that sin does not consist in yielding to desire merely , but in that state of mind which refuses to be benevolent ; and for this unreasonable action there must be some motive , and that this motive is some object of good awakening desire , and that this desire is a ruling one , so completely as to be called " a life of self-pleasing ; " " a life // of self-indulgence ; " a life fixed , settled , and growing ; but not so completely controlling that one object of desire may not be changed for so me other , and this again for another still ; and beneath all these changing desires is the refusal to be benevolent , which is called the life of self-pleasing , self-indulgence . And what is this but a generic state of mind  --  the source of all specific sin ? It has ruled out one controlling desire for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conflict with the generic obligation to be benevolent , and must of necessity be itself generic  --  the exact counterpart of benevolence . It matters little what this generic state of mind is called . The author in discussing the subject on pages 34 , 35 , 36 , and 37 , may say , as he does , that it is not properly called self-gratification-not supreme regard for self ; not selfishness . Still the facts remain admitted by him that this generic state is fundamental sinthe sum and substance of all wrong doing  --  the whole of sinful character . But the author 's real views are , perhaps , more fully disclosed in his discussion of the question " Where is found the moral element ? " This will be found on page 16-and onward . He says " it is not found in the outward act * " it is not in the intelligence ; " " it is not in the sensibility ; " " but it is found in the act of the will alone . " He traces it thus : " But voluntary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ element of morality attach to all these forms ? " Nearest to our observation are the series of vohitions which cause the outward act ; but these volitions do not reveal character , because they do not involve it . The good and the bad alike put forth their volitions . Back of these volitions we find a more general purpose from which the volitions spring  --  the purpose to secure an education ( in the case of a student ) , or still further back , the purpose to gain influence and power , to which education is a means . But in these more general purposes , although voluntary states , we find no revelation of moral character . The good and the bad alike cherish the same general purposes , and pursue them by the same means-sit side by side in the same class . We find in one a voluntary choice of the proper end or object of life ; that end which the intelligence approves . us other purposes and volitions are all subordinate to this ultimate choice , and are executive of it . Another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freely declines it . Some other scheme or impulse of desire or passion occupies him ; and with reference to this unworthy end , he forms his purposes and puts forth his volitions . Here we have the key to the character of the action and of the agent ; and in this . ultimate choice of the right end , or refusal to choose it , which is still a choice , we necessarily locate the moral element . In this respect the two agents and their actions morally differ , while in their subordinate purposes and executive volitions and outward actions , they may be alike . One conforms to obligation and the other does not . Two kinds of moral actions , and only two are possible . The agent may accept the right end of life , and thus his action become right , virtuous , or he may reject that end , and thus his action becomes wrong , sinful. " 1 have quoted thus largely to show that in the view of this author these two opposite states of will are permanent and controlling and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be sought or found . According to his description they control subordL nate purposes , and very general purposes , such as extend over many years of life , if not over the whole of it . They are called ends ; one the right end , and the other the unworthy end . They are described as ends chosen , in every sense voluntary , and directly opposite the one to the other . In these ends , or the choice of them , resides all moral character . One by the author is called Benevolence ; the other incidentally he calls a " life of self-pleasing , " or a life of " self-indulgence . " Facts teach us that the " self-pleasing " is the more vigorous , persistent , and energetic of the two . We have often witnessed its permanent , persistent , controlling nature when it fixes on wealth , power , or some other generic worldly good . We think the author would have done essential service if he had more distinctly and fully drawn out this generic principle of wrong doing and given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that with these views he could declare that selfishness was not this appropriate name . The author 's discussion of the various th*ories of obligation in two chapters is both the strongest and the weakest pc rt of his work . It is the strongest in ably refuting the theories of those who make the foundation of obliga // tion solely in the will of God in various forms-in worthiness of being , in goodness , and in abstract right as an ultimate and necessary idea . But it is the weakest in his attempts to answer those who make happiness the ultimate good , and , in his opinion , stamp their system with the degrading idea of utilitarianism , lie fails to comprehend their views or to state them correctly , and draws from them unwarrantable inferences . In a difference between himself and them , he is forced into the necessity of affirmin that on his own theory , obligation is founded solely in the nature of things , when his whole reasoninb shows that it is founded in happiness-the ultimate and absolute good . lie is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has no tendency to produce good , and that the idea of its tendency does not enter into the obligation ; and yet to be consistent he can not well avoid admitting this truth . It would seem that the matter of the tendency of the benevolent choice could be settled in a very few words . rihe most surprising thing about it is , that it should cv ci ' have been called in question . The author often ascribes such a tendency to executive acts or volitions . On page 66 , he says : " That action which tends to promote the good is right action , and will be performed by virtuous , intelligent men . " So on page 70 , he says : " That and that only must be done , which , on the whole , seems profitable ; that is , conducive to general good . " On page 40 , he calls this benevolent choice the " controlling principle , " out of which particudar right acts proceed ; so on page 64 , it is called the " ultimate governing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and control except these executive volitions , which he says proceed from it ? But if these executive acts or volitions have a tendency to promote the highest good , certainly the executive governinq power , which brings them into being , must have in it such a tendency . Again on page 81 , the author declares " these " executive acts having a tendency to secure the absolute good , " are but outeroppings of the principle of benevolence which constitute the right character . " Then surely the very heart and body of which these executive volitions are only the hands and the feet that do its bidding , must have such a tendency . On page // 112 , the writer says : " This choice puts one in the attitude to promote the good  --  a readiness for the work  --  but it precedes all purpose , " meaning , as lie has said , particular purpose . Here is described the peculiar nature of this generic choice . It is not the choice of any particular good or object of good , but of good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by an executive act whenever an opportunity presents . The benevolent choice respects mainly the use which is to be made of the faculties to this end . It is a determination firmly settled and permanent to hold the faculties , as the author says , in the proper attitude to promote the good , to keep them in readiness for the work . And has not the generic choice , this central power , which places and holds these faculties in the proper attitude , and keeps them ever ready to perform the work of promoting the good , any tendency to secure it  --  to reach the end of the choice by executive acts ? It is perfectly ab*nrd to exclude all tendency from this generic choice , and yet admit it its executive acts . Again ; the nature of the obligation itself unfolds this tendency . The thing which imposes the obligation is the absolute good . Hence the author says on page 112 , " This benevolent choice is grounded in the value of the good ; not in any tendency in the action whatever , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any other being . " This is a perfectly correct statement . The ground of the obligation is the absolute good , the only thing valuable . This is the end to be sought . But there is a wide difference betv* een the ground of the obligation and the obhiagtion itself ; between the end and the choice of it . It is the nature of the thing itself-this generic obligation which we are inquiring after . We ask has tide a tendency to the highest good , not on what it is grounded ; it can not be grounded on itself . The very idea of obligation includes this tendency ; it is the main idea in it . The absolute good , the only thing valuable , does not impose upon the moral being a mere regard for it , i.e. , an involuntary state or mere impulse toward it ; but it imposes an active choice , one on which the good depends , a generic state of mind , such as the author describes it to be , an attitude of the will to promote the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improve every opportunity // presented to secure the end  --  the highest good of being . Here is a powerful tendency . This tendency is a main clement or quality of the obligation itself-not the ground of it . Excluding this tendency , and there is no obligation at all . This then is the central engine that drives all the subordinate wheels to the good result ; and if there is an adaptation , fitness , or tendency in the saw attached to the engine to cut the timber presented to it , then , surely , there is a tendency also in the engine driven by steam to reach this result . The result fails without it . Now whether this system shall be called utilitarian or not , is of very little consequence . The fact is here , and it is useless to deny it , that the thing required of the moral agent , that which is obligatory on him , is this fitPess , this tendency , this voluntary state that has this tendency in it to secure the endthe highest good of universal being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the law , because as love , it is its tendency , its fitness to secure the highest blessedness of all , and that of nothing else . Being a generic and subjective choice or state , its essential nature is at once recognized in consciousness . The question of tendency properly pertains only to the relative good , the subordinate choices , whether they do tend to promote the ultimate good , to secure the end chosen . The decision of this question settles their character for utility which the author fully admits . And had he been consistent with himself and carried the views which he adopts to their logical conclusions , he would have given to the generic choice its appropriate tendency , as he has to the subordinate choices of which they are the only development . Then instead of differing from those who adopt the system that happiness is the supreme good , he would have found himself in almost perfect agreement with them . The philosophers of this class can not essentially differ upon the foundation of obligation . The author 's system , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the charge of utilitarianism as the system of Dr. Taylor ; not that every statement of Dr. Taylor or of this author are the most correct that could be made , but that in the great essential principles their systems are the same . We say this because we think we know what Dr. Taylor 's system is , and we have // studied this author pretty thoroughly . A striking proof of the correctness of this statement is founded in the fact that the author professes to have embraced essentially the system of Dr. Dwight , but puts Dr. Taylor in a different and opposing class to that of the venerated teacher whose system he ever professed to adopt . He has misrepresented Dr. Taylor , and done him injustice-we think not intentionally  --  but from a misunderstanding of his views . We come next to notice the chapter on simplicity of moral action . The question discussed is-Can virtue and sin coexist in the same heart ? In his reasoning on this question the author is half right and half wrong . He is certainly right in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sinful man can become virtuous , and equally so in the conclusion that the two generic and opposite principles of moral action to which all sin or all goodness pertains can not coexist in the same being . No man in this sense can serve two masters . But when he affirms " that with few exceptions writers on morals and theology have answered this questkn in the affirmative , " he is certainly wide from the truth . For the import of his affirmation is that these writers have held that these two generic principles of right and wrong may and do coexist in the same heart . This is the issue which he discusses all the way through as is seen from the following answer . " The two forms of action are directly contradictory to each other , and in the very nature of the case must exclude each other . " Whereas , probably not a single writer to whom he refers ever believed or said that these two opposing principles ever did or can coexist . On this point they all coincide with the author @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different question whether the generic principle of benevolence may not be imperfeet and still remain in the will or heart , i. e. in no sense be abandoned so that its opposite is installed in its place ; and at the same time the agent be held responsible for some wrong doing . This question the author does not meet . lie interprets the views of those who differ from him wholly from his own stand point-on his own theory . having established the truth that these two generic principles of right and wrong can not coexist // in the same heart , he assumes that nothing morally wrong ,  - -  nothing for which the benevolent man is responsible and ought to confess-can exist except that which involves the abandonment of the benevolent principle . He accounts for all sin in the benevolent on the theory of alternation . The good man  --  the holy benevolent Christian man-performs some good acts and some wrong ones , perhaps more good ones than bad ones , and thns to-day he acts on the principle of benevolence and to-morrow he abandons it and acts on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not give this theory a full and exhaustive discussion at the present time-such as its importance demands-we propose only briefly to state a few things . This theory of the author fails , in our judgment , to account for the facts . The nature of these generic principles forbids such alternation . No such alternation is recognized in the consciousness of the good man . He knows that he has not always done his duty , has failed to do it when he might , has at other times done things of which he is ashamed-knows to be wrong , and for which he is sorry-at the same time he knows that the generic end and aim of his life to do good has not been abandoned . The theory of benevolence adopted by those who differ from the author we think will account more rationally for these failures in duty . This theory is , that the generic principle is weak and imperfect in energy . We lay it down as afact that every generic principle of moral action whether good or bad may continue to exist while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or failure is wholly inconsistent with the perfect , complet* , and possible development of the generic principle . The youth who has started in a course of education has formed a generic purpose to be educated  --  a purpose that is to cover many years of toil and perseverance , more or less severe . Now can any one show that every such youth gives perfect development to this generic principle ; never fails to do what might be done to realize most perfectly his end  --  a complete education ? Has he never done things which in the time allotted were a drawback to the completeness of his education ? And yet he knows that at no time has this purpose to be educated ever been abandoned . // All orthodox men , and this author among them , believe that sinful , worldly men are wholly depraved-have not a benevolent heart  --  but who believes that they are as wicked as they might be , unless it be in some very rare eases ! They might , years ago , have worked out a more aggravated character for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the most renowned character for money getting gave in our day ten thousand dollars to the Sanitary Commission , and never dreanied nor showed that by so doing he abandoned his end of money making . The same possibility pertains to the supreme choice to do good . It covers the entire life . And what is the incasure of his obligation ? The wicked man , the selfish man is not obligated to make his wrong choice as bad as it can be , but he is obligated to abandon it  --  to change it for the opposite . But the good man is obligated to give to his generic choice of good the most complete and perfect development possible , i.e. , His ability here is the measure of his obligation . Now we affirm that the failure to give it complete development in execution does not necessarily involve its abandonment any more than the failure of the wicked man to carry out perfectly his wrong choice involves its abandonment . The author has not shewn this nor can he . Yet these failures while the generic choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have done and ought to have done . ft is a wrong which he ought to feel and confess . But it is as unlike the sin of the selfish , worldly man as can well be imagined . He can not work sin in this latter sense , for he is born of God , and his seed remaineth in him . The generic principle of goodness abides , and is not relinquished by these failures . In giving definitions , we think the author has some times failed . Accurate and clear definitions in a work of science , and especially moral science , in a work designed as a text book , are of the highest importance . While the subjects in this work are generally well discussed , and the ideas clearly and fully developed , the author is not always successful in framing his definitions . One very general failure is to defer giving the distinct definition until after something is stated which is like it , and leads the student to think it is , while ft is not the same thing . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is found on page 21 , in defining the right . " Right or virtnous action is the action which we morally approve and for which we pronounce the agent praiseworthy . " This statement is true ; and it has the form , but none of the elements of a definition . The distinctive definition follows thus : " It consists in the choice of the right end of life . " This is clear and intelligible ; but it should have been stated in the outset The same criticism holds good in respect to the author 's definition of wrong action on page 30 . " It is a refusal to meet obligation , " which is a short , clear and accurate definition , and should have been stated first instead of placing it after things said which seem to be a definition , and are not in fact . A*nother defect is to embrace in the definition itself some things which do not belong to it . An instance uf this is found in our author 's definition of government , on page 137 . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and authority over moral beings to secure their conformity to obligation and thus promote the individual and general well being . " Here are several things that do not belong to the one idea of government . It is called an arrangement , but arrangement is only a mode of constituting government or of administering it . An arrangement may be made and no actual government exist . Or there may be an efficient government without any arrangement at all , as in the case of a skillful navigator in a storm , stated by the author on page 139 . Much less is any systematic arrangement necessary to the exercise of government . It is stated to be " to secure conformity to obligation and thus to promote the individual and general well being . " These things are the object or end of government , or should he , and not government itself . It is called " the exercise of power and authority , " whereas authority includes power . If he had simply stated government is the exercise of authority over moral beings through the medium of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and included a very important one , that of law , which he has omitted . We name only one more instance of defective definition . It is found on page 229 . He says , " Liberty is the opportunity // for the free exercise of our faculties in the performance of duty and in the pursuit of good under the law of benevolence . " Now liberty must be freedom to be something or do something which is a personal right . But opportunity does not come within the scope of this right , or at least may not ; nor does the pursuit of every kind of good included in this right even under the law of benevolence , constitute liberty . If our author had simply affirmed that " Liberty is the free exercise of one 's faculties in the pursuit ot his highest happiness , " he would have given all the ideas and the necessary limitations . Every moral being has a personal right to happiness and a right to the free exercise of his own faculties in securing it . His highest happiness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he has a right to the use of his faculties-no government , huluau nor divine , can rightfully restrain him from this legitimate pursuit . The pursuit of his highest happiness can never conflict with the welfare of others , nor with the legitimate interests of government . This pursuit of happiness *ras the right which our fathers , in the declaration of independence , intended to assert . There is also , we think , a defect in the author 's presentation of the subject of penalty . What he has said on this subject is in the main well said . The object of the penalty , its effects , its tendencies , and its distinction from natural consequences , are mainly correct and very important exhibitions . But penalty , as a necessary revelation of the moral governor 's character and its tendency as such to sustain his authority , and thus to influence to obedience , is left out . Its relations in these respects are scarcely hinted at . It is stated indeed , to be evil inflected as an expression of the guilt of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear , lead to reflection , and in this roundabout way to secure true obedience , are presented . But this is very far from being the full nature and the subduing power of a penalty . The first and chief necessity for a penalty is laid deep in the character of the moral governor . To possess uprightness he must not only have a decided preference for right over wrong conduct , but he must have a proper feeling toward these opposing moral actions , whether in himself or in his creatures . He // must feel a strong approbati ' n of the one and disapprobation of the other ; feelings directly opposite the one to the other ; feelings in kind and degree appropriate to the difibring natures and tendencies of th*se things . To be without them would deprive him of moral integrity , even if there were no created beings to whom the revelation might be made . But when created beings come into existence a new necessity arises . It is just as necessary to the preservation of the integrity of his character that these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have them . The moral subjects must know who and what their ruler is . These feelings can he manifested only by proclaimed good from his hand to the obedient and evil to the disobedient . These are the only two things that can stand as monuments on which his heart toward right or wrong in action can be read by intelligent beings . As a manifestation then of his character for integrity , the proclaimed penalty , evil inflicted or to be inflicted is as powerful to move the moral being to love the excellence embodied in this pledged evil , as is the good promised at his hands . When rightly viewed this is the appropriate tendency of a penalty . It is direct and immediate in its subduing power . It does not necessarily reach the soul in the roundabout way of fear and reflection as stated by the author ; but in its direct bearing on the soul which apprehends the manifestation . And to fail to present the penalty as flowing directly and necessarily from the very excellence of the Divine Being is to fail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and chief effect of penalty , either pledged or inflicted , is to sustain the moral governor 's authority , by preserving his integrity and thus by its influence , to secure obedience , protect rights , and promote the general good . Authority is right to command , imposing obligation to obey . But if the moral governor has no distinctive and appropriate feelings toward right and wrong , he is utterly destitute of any right to command . He has not the requisite qualifications . He fails in the required integrity of character . Equally destitute of such a right will he be if he fails to manifest these distinctive feelings . Hence not to pledge a penalty or to remit it after it is pledged , and deserved , is to deprive himself // of the requisite qualifications to command . The penalty is a monument of feeling that must stand the same uncontradicted to all eternity . It can never be remitted when once incurred , except by some substitute that shall make the same manifestations of the moral governor 's heart which the penalty would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law , as is also reward . The mere will of the moral governor , without a penalty expressed or implied , never can have the force of authority . It is no command . It contains no expression of his heart , as it must in order to constitute a law . The author is manifestly in error when he separates penalty from law , as he does on page 137 . In taking leave of this work , we are free to say that it would give us much satisfaction to dwell upon its excellences , which are many ; but these will commend themselves , and afford much profit to any who may give the work a thorough perusal .
