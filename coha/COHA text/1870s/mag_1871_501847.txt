ABOUT the middle of September last , on a beautiful and warm evening , there was a great public meeting or " demonstration " in Trafalgar Square , London . To describe Trafalgar Square to any one who has been in London would be almost as superfluous as to favor the readers of " The " with a description of City Hall Park , or to entertain the veteran European tourist with an account of the Place de la Concorde in Paris . But there may be some of my readers who have not been in London , and to these I may say that Trafalgar Square ( pronounced by the late Sir Robert Peel the finest site in Europe ) is a huge open space in the very heart of London life . It is a square much lower in level at one side than at the other ; it is bounded at one end by ( the National Gallery and Pall Mall , at another by Northumberland House and the Strand . It looks from one corner right down to the Houses of Parliament , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has no gardens in the midst , but only a stony plateau , adorned with fountains which might remind a New Yorker of the public works of " Boss " Tweed , and statues which suggest perpetual contracts with Vinnie Ream paid in advance ; but , in justice to London it should be added , adorned too by Sir Edwin Landseer 's four gigantic majestic hops of bronze . Such is Trafalgar Square physically and materially ; but of late it has come to possess a moral individuality , a political significance . Trafalgar Square is the unroofed Faneuil Hall or Cooper Institute of the J4ondon working man . On Trafalgar Square were held all the great popular meetings which helped so much toward the passing of the recent Reform Bill . The multitude fills the square , the chairman and orators gather round the base of the Nelson column , the garnins scramble and cluster on the backs of the bronze lions . No voice of mortal orator could be heard beyond a very limited section of the great enclosure ; and indeed the speech-making seldom amounts to much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any political mark ever makes his am pearance at one of these demonstrations . They are " demonstrations " and nothing else ; eloquence would be wholly thrown away there . Nobody listens to much of the speech-making , even among those who are near enough to hear it ; but there is abundant cheering and groaning as the names of popular or unpopular men and measures are shouted out . Popular reform songs or revolutionary songs are sung in chorus , and banners are displayed , and torches are sometimes flourished , and bands play ; and the whole thing is irregular , incoherent , noisy , tumultuous ; but in its way very sincere and very effective . The great political leaders never make their voices heard at Trafalgar Square ; but Trafalgar Square makes its voice heard by all parties . Some laugh , a good many sneer ; but they all have come of late to acknowledge that Trafalgar Square demonstratiOlls are things which have to be taken into account in the calculations of a statesman . Now , the meeting held on this September evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ordinary assemblages . Red caps of liberty were hoisted on poles everywhere , and the Marseillaise was chorused even while the orators were trying to speak . Collections were going on for the wounded of the French arftmy ( close by within the railings of the churchyard of St. Martin-in-the-Fields the ground was heaped and lumbered with bales and // boxes bearing the red cross , and intended for the relief of war 's victims far away by Gravelotte and Forbach ) , and cheers for the French Republic everywhere rent the air . This was in fact a meeting of the Industrial and political organizations of London , called for the purpose of giving a welcome to the newborn Republic of France , and at the same time denouncing Mr. Gladstone and his Cabinet for not having done what France herself had not yet done-recognized the Re public . I made my way through the crowd and stood not far from the speakers . The Atlantic cable , as I afterward heard , did me the unmerited honor to announce that I addressed the meeting in a fervid and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak . I did not even know , and do n't know now , who organized the meeting ; my sympathies were and are strongly with the Germans , and I thought Mr. Gladstone was quite right in seeing whether there was a republic to recognize before he volunteered to recognize it . I could not hear much of the speaking , and it did not matter . I could hear that ) every expression of sympathy with republican France was applauded to the echo ; that every allusion to the supposed coldness or selfishness of England 's policy brought out a very tumult of clamor ; that the family connection of Queen Victoria with the Germans was regarded with intense and vehement dislike . When the speaking was over the Mctrseillaise began anew , and then some band struck up the first notes of " God Save the Queen , " but a positive shower of hisses drowned the loyal air , and the musicia*ns judiciously dropped it forthwith and substituted " Rule Britannia ! " I have seen a good many political meetings in England , but I never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significance than this . The meaning of the thing was plain , let who would pretend to ignore or to deny or to despise it . The meaning was that the vast majority of the intelligent working men of London are thoroughly , earnestly , and even passionately republican . I had been absent from England for about two years ; and I was much impressed by the rapidity of the advance which republican sentiment had made in the mean while . When I left England very few indeed of the working men or their leaders openly avowed republicanism . It was rather the fashion to proclaim a sort of vague and formal loyalty to the principle of monarchy , even while demanding organic changes in the Constitution . But nqw , it would seem , the London working men were positively impatient of the least word which indicated any toleration of the principle of royalty . The fact that France now had proclaimed a republic was treated as if it ought to condone all past offences ; as if a republic were the consecrated of the Lord , which profanity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worse was said of the Germans than that they followed " a despot ; " nothing worse seemed necessary or possible to say . A republic could do no wrong ; a monarchy could do no right . Argument of the question between France and Germany there was none . No matter who began the quarrel ; no matter who was in the right . Enough that here were people calling themselves ( or rather supposed to intend soon to call themselves ) republicans ; yonder were people following a king . Every true-hearted London working man must throw up his hat for the former . I attended another and much smaller meeting  --  a meeting held in a room , and made up of delegates from the various political organizations of London operatives and other representative men . It was a meeting strictly for deliberative purposes . Leaders of the working men like Potter and Applegarth were there ; friends and backers of the working man like Baxter Langley were there ; Dr. Congreve , the distinguished , eccentric , fanatical head of the English // Positivists , was there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same as that of Trafalgar Square . The working men would listen patiently while Baxter Langley put in a quiet word for Germany , so far as to plead that perhaps she was not wholly in the wrong when resisting invasion . They only seemed to have a kind of whimsical curiosity while Congreve was urging that all the civilized nations of the earth ought to fight for France , because the birthplace of Auguste Comte . must be the Mecca of the new religion . They were delighted to hear any denunciation of the fallen Emperor Louis Napoleon and the Bonapartes generally . But the one feeling uppermost in their minds and hearts was evidently that of vehement , passionate , uncompromising affection and devotion for the French Republic . All they knew , all they cared to know , was that France now called herself republican ; and as such they gave her their cordial , unquestioning , unlimited sympathy and allegiance . They seemed to attach to a republic the same idea of sanctity which the old Scottish lady in the story did to the person of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sion with George Buchanan for having birched his royal pupil , and demanded of him why be had dared to touch the Lord 's anointed . Perhaps the Germans might fairly have answered in the words attributed by the story to the tremendous schoolmaster : " I have whipped the person of the Lord 's anointed ; you may kiss him if you please . " I believe old Geordie is said to have used plainer and homelier phraseology , but this was the purport of his answer ; and one can easily imagine Bismarck adopting it as a reply to those who held it profanity to lay a rude chastising hancfon the sacred form of a republic . Now , I can remember well enough the excitemeut of 1848 , and the fervor among English artisans and Irish republicans during the brief , splendid madness of that crisis . But I am much mistaken if the republicanism of the London artisan of to-day be not a far stronger , more intelligent , and more deeplyrooted conviction than the passionate sentiment of 1848 . Then the thing had all tie feverish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather social than political . It was Chartism with a strong suffusion of French socialism in it . It was a clamorous and almost purposeless commotion of what Victor Hugo would call the *rolJtaire , who , feeling himself miserably misrepresented and uncomfortable , joined in the cry of any movement which raised its voice against existing institutions . But the republicanism of to-day is as different from that kind of thing , as the London working man this year is from the London working man of 1848 . Perhaps some of my readers have reaj and remember " Alton Locke , " the book which made Kingsley 's celebrity  --  a book like its author full of inflation and blundering and nonsense , but having too , like him , a core of generous purpose and manly feeling . Alton Locke represented accurately enough the general character and object of a certain kind of London Chartist in the days when Fergus O'Connor was regarded as a po*werful popular leader . But Alton Locke is about as much out of date in England now as Jack Cade or Robin Hood . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to radicalism , is to-day a man well read in the politics of his time , highly practical in all his objects , well drilled into the discipline of organization and cooperation by his trade unions , and as little inclined to rave of social contracts or demand redistribution of property as Horace Greeley would be . He means what he says ; ho knows what he is talking about . When he throws up his hat for a repgblic , he has not the remotest expectation that a republic would make him rich or placc the property of his wealthy neighbor at his disposal . But he has acquired a clear and strong conviction that a republican government is the fairest , the cheapest , and the best // political system , and he sees plainly the real , not the imaginary , defects and sins of the system which surrounds him . The London artisan of to-day has very different teachers from wild , gifted ; crazy Fergus O'Connor . He has among his own class cool , sensible , practical men , like Odger and Applegarth and Potter-men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brotherhood of humanity . He has leaders and teachers outside his own class , in men like Professors Beesly and Frederic Harrison for example-men of culture and keen thought , fearless and often fantastic in their views , but always able to defend them by the closest logic and the most bewildering array of facts and figures . I hold that one of the most remarkable phenomena of English political life to-day is this extraordinary and apparently instinctive fraternization between the " thinkers " and the working men . On almost all public questions these seem to stand together . If , as I believe , the working fl an of London was making a somewhat foolish exhibition last autumn , when he allowed his devotion to the republican principle to drown all sober consideration of the right and wrong of a controversy , if in fact he was making afetish of the mere name of republic , it must be remembered that Beesly , and Harrison , and Ludlow , and the great majority of the school to which they belong , were doing just the same thing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . what the London working man believes , you have only to inquire what Mill and Huxley and their less renowned companions and followers believe . I attended a great meeting held at an earlier part of last season , to consider the education scheme then before the House of Commons . Several members of Parliament were present . The audience was mainly composed of working men . Professor Fawcett , M. P. , in the course of his speech uttered sentiments which would have been regarded as absolutely seditious a few years ago , but which found universal acceptance and drew forth unanimous applause from the meeting . Observe at what a rate English democracy has been lately travelling . It seems to me only the other day when I heard Lord Palmerston declare amid the cheers of the House of Commons , that " tenant right was landlord 's wrong ; " and he said this in condemnation of an Irish land scheme which was positively conservative when compared with M* . Gladstone 's measure of last year . Some five years ago Sir George Grey , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the disestablishment of the Irish Church would be revolution , and the Irish Church was disestablished the year before last . Household suifragehas been conferred on the people . Vote by ballot is coming ; the army is about to be made a profession or business open to all classes alike . In all this work of progress Trafalgar Square has borne its part , and knows it . Trafalgar Square knows too how little it owes for education or emancipation to the carnest good-will of Belgrave Square or Park Lane , or even of Russell Square and Bedford Square . Such as the political organization of the London working classe8 now is , it has grown up as utterly without the support and patronage of prince or prelate as Schiller boasted justly that the literature of Germany had done . All that great trade organization which proved so powerful an instrument for political work , when it declared on the side of the late reform movement , is the creation of the artisans themselves . It has its own laws , its own principles , its own officers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the opponents of progress in England , they must have been fairly startled when there suddenly appeared in the midst of society , in full and flexible organization , that great marching army of trades unions , Whose very existence had been previously unsuspected by the classes that once were rulino I beg my readers not to accept Charles Reade 's brilliant and 0* // powerful novel , " Put Yourself in his Place , " as a picture of the English trade union system . It is true enough as a portrayal of a place and an organization altogether peculiar , exceptional , and even monstrous . It is grotesquely untrue as a picture of the common condition of things . If a man were to write a novel founded *n the present state of affairs in certain parts of Georgia or Tennessee where the Ku-Klux organization reigns , and were to paint his pictures with entire truthfulness and fidelity to local coloring , that would be about as accurate a representation of the general condition of the United States as the incidents of Charles Reade 's novel present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general system is one based on clear , practical , perhaps somewhat selfish good sense and class interest ; and it has been worked out with remarkable patience , fidelity , and ability . While the upper and middle classes were asleep and comfortable in the conviction that everything in England was settled forever , this gigantic organization was quietly preparing , moulding , and remoulding itself . One day at last it stood up and said , " Jam ( here , and lam resolved to interfere in politics ; " and the men who saw in it nothing more formidable than might have been found in one of the vague , impracticable , purposeless , tumultuous Chartist demonstrations , were just the kind of nen who are always snugly fast asleep on the brink of the revolution 's opening chasm . Nothing could show the inherent , patient , natural strength of the class to which this organization belongs more effectively than the way in which it grew to maturity . It had outside itself no supporters , no patrons , and no friends . The English press , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decidedly against the trades unions . Even journals avowedly radical were opposed to these organizations of labor . Even demagogic popular leaders were not inclined to favor them . Ten years ago it was the recognized faith of England 's average mind , that combinations of workmen could do nothing but harm to the workmen themselves ; that the eternal verities had somehow pronounced against them ; that the law of supply and demand settled everything ( especially when worked out by capital and employers ) ; and that all the workman had to do was to open his mouth , shut his eyes , and see what Providence would send him . In the face of every kind of opposition which the weight of public opinion , the via inertiz of Philistinism , and the more direct force of the strength and interest'of the employer and the middle classes generally could extort , the English working men in the large cities persisted in their organization of labor . They made many sad mistakes and committed some grievous errors on their way ; but they at last attained their end , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole far more for good than for ill , and which in any case is a new element , a new power of as yet incalculable force in English social life . When once this organization had frankly taken its place among political bodies , it might as well have been admitted that a new estate had been added to the British constitutional system . The Sovereign , the Lords , the Commons , are theoretically the three estates . To these common parlance , half seriously , half in jest , has more lately added the press as a fourth estate , although Mr. Disraeli1 himself a newspaper man , stigmatized such a phrase as " vulgar jargQn . " I think we may now recognize the creation of a fifth estate in the uprising , of the organized working men . Now , I am sure I am warranted in saying that as a whole this new estate is emphatically republican . Its own organization is strictly republican . It has been hitherto an association formed virtually outside the English Constitution and with no protection from the English law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen that there was nothing divine there ; it has counted how much // kings and queens cost , and found that they are not worth the money . Most of its members have relatives or friends across the Atlantic ; some of its leaders have been in the United States and seen for themselves that nations can get along somehow without an aristocracy and without a king . Of late , too , the London working man has discovered that he counts for something . He has been called into council with the great political leader or the great aristocrat , and he sees that they are only men like himself . I read lately a report of a sharp debate at one of the London Boards of Education , those new institutions , the most splendidly revolutionary which England has created in my time , and which in their living illustration of the principle of social equality have no parallel that I know of even as the American side of the Atlantic . This is one of the school boards elected by ballot , and on the cumulative vote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the debate I allude to was on a very essential and critical question  --  the question of religious or theological teaching . A late Governor-General of India , Lord Laurence , presided , and the principal debaters were a nobleman , a Church of England divine , a great scientific teacher ( Professor Huxley ) , a woman ( Miss Garrett ) , and a working man . The savant , the woman , and the working man held generally to the same side of the question , and the working man was as firm and cool in his objection to the introduction of dogmatic theology as though it were quite a traditional and familiar thing in England for an artisan to sit in council and on terms of equality with noblemen and divines . The right to sit in that council and on those terms the working man owes mainly to himself . By . his own strength and his own brains he fought his way upward . It was not until his trade organizations had made their reality , their power , and their permanence as clear as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends among influential legislators . Always there were peers and members of Parliament ready to patronize the working man , but there were few indeed of these , his gracious patrons , who were anxious to set him up for himself as an independent individuality and one of the ruling jowers of the constitutional system . Nor even yet has there bcen much done which could have the effect of charming the working man into the belief that he can get anything without exacting it . As yet no working man has got into Parliament or received any cordial assistance from his old political masters in the seeking of a Parliamentary seat . The class formerly . ruling could not have conferred a cheaper and more harmless favor on the working men than to have assisted them in returning some Odger or Leecraft to Parliament . It would not in the slightest degree have affected the rulership in Parliament of the dominant interests , and it might have done much in the way of conciliation . Therefore the working man still learns , by the teaehing of events , that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exact ; that a middle-class Parliament would he hardly one whit more inclined toward him than an aristocratic Parliament ; and his tendencies toward republican democracy are not likely to be diminished by the knowledge . I have hitherto spoken almost exclusively of the London artisans . In most of the great towns , however , I presume that much the same thing might.he said as regards this tendency toward republicanism . Probably in Manchester , for example , there is a yet more general absence of anything like a tinge of the French hue of social democracy than in London , and in Liverpool there is a pretty strong Orange or ultra-Tory mob . The Irish element has , of course , to be taken into account in all these places ; and whether we regard the Irish as Fenians or as Ultramontane Roman Catholics , we shajl find few points of adhesion between them and their English brothers . But the Irish are nothing as // an organization in England . Numerically strong as they are in London , in Manchester , in Liverpool , Leeds , and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than the Chinese Jo in San Francisco . Working men having been until lately practically excluded from the franchise , the Irishmen who came to live and work in English cities had no direct incentive to interest themselves in English politics , which they could not control or affect in any direct way . Therefore they always remained as strangers in the land , and never took any part in a political controversy unless when it assumed the tempting aspect of a " row . " That this will be differ*nt in the future with our popularized suffrage may be taken for granted . Perhaps in some of the large cities the Irish vote may hereafter become as distinct an element of political calculation as it is now in Philadelphia or Chicago . But even when that does come about , I think I may venture to predict that the Irish vote will in no way retard the progress of English republicanism . That indeed should be an objectionable and odious form of government , the alternative of which would ( induce the Irishman in Great Britain to become a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is of the cities . How of the rural populations ? Of course the farmers of the English counties as a rule are stolidly and sluggishly conservative . They are naturally under the traditionary influence of the landed aristocracy , and they have little knowledge of or care for what passes in the world outside . Of the mental condition of the English peasant , the laborer in the fields , who ought at least to be the peer of the artisan in the towns , I hesitate to speak in language which would seem to be adequate , lest I should appear to be guilty of gross exaggeration . I doubt it any country in the civilized world has a class among its people so stupid , so ignorant , so debased in the passive sense , as the English agricultural laborers , more especially of the southern counties . The typical Giles Scroggins of this class may be fairly described as a man who knows nothing-nothing whatever-beyond the common drudgery of his daily labor and the me.chanical routine of his daily life . He gets Wages enough to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ever getting any more . His boys and girls , when they pass the years of infancy , can earn a shilling or two in the week by shouting in the fields to frighten the crows away , or some *uch easy and elementary labor . When he gets too old and stiff in the joints to work any more , lie goes into the union workhouse . He has never thought of seeking any other country ; perhaps he hardly knew that there existed any country other than his own ; probably he never thought of such a subject at all . Letters , art , science , commerce have been busy for all the rest of the world , but not for him . The animals who are his fellow-laborers know how to do their work and eat their food and find their place of rest , and he knows hardly any more . The blue sky , the shadows succeeding each other on the hillside , the murmur of the brook , the song of the spring birds in the branches , have no charm or beauty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have in the comfort of sun or shade , he hp.s , and no more . Nor is this stolidity , nor is this ignorance atoned for by pastoral simplicity , purity , and innocence . The evidence taken before Government commissions , the experience and observation of every qualified inquirer , have made it clear that there is as much vice in the stagnant puddle of the rural laborer 's life as in the seething whirlpool of city dissipation . The boys and girls work together in gangs in the fields , and they are just as virtuous as dogs or cattle would be under the same conditions . There is in the Celt , I do*not know why , a certain subtle , suffusing element of the poetic , which seems to save him always from this utter degradation to the // level of bovine stolidity . Partly owing to this fact , partly perhaps to the fact that the Irish priests have done their duty , according to their lights , far better than the English landlords have , there never was in Ireland any class of men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the English peasantry are . Ask an English rural laborer the name of the river that flows within sight of his own cottage , and if it be not near enough to have something to do with the business of his daily life somehow , the chances are that he will be unable to give an answer . Put such a question to an Irish peasant , and he will give you the Irish name , the English name , and half adoien legends illustrating one or the other , or both . Of course I need hardly s*y that in intelligence and education the Scottish peasant is half a century ahead of his English compeer . Scotland ranks among the most educated , England among the least educated of civilized peoples . England has at last adopted a measure of national education . It is not indeed all that the most active intellects of the country could desire , but it is a decent compromise , and we seldom get aziything better than a decent compromise at a time in England . Such as it Is , it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population of the country ; and therefore I am reluctant to venture on any suggestion of prophecy as to what the English laborer of the future may be . But for the present the agricultural workers may be set down in politics simply as a torpid mass , as incapable either of individual or collective action , even in their own interests , as the pigs and the oxen who are their familiar companions . At present these men have no vote , and I hardly think the most ardent upholder of extended suffrage could find much cause to desire the immediate extension of the franchise to them . Of course they are destined to become voters , and let us hope to become educated voters , some time or other , but for the present they simply count for nothing in politics . They can not promote organic change , and , with whatever impulse , direction , and injunctions from their landlords , they would , I feel convinced , prove equally incapable of resisting or even retarding it . Nothing therefore can be more unlike than town and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generally look to the rural population , the territorial democrticy , to redress the balance , correct the errors , compensate for the vices of the towns . But in England we look to the towns for all manner of political enlightenment and advancement . The country has hitherto chiefly occupied itself in endeavoring to frustrate , or at least to impede the enlightened efforts of the town . London , Manchester , atA Leeds are always busy in proposing measures of reform which the counties are busy In striving to prevent . The country always resists , and the country always is beaten in the long run . Town proposed to abolish the Corn Laws ; country resisted . Town proposed the late Reform Bill ; country resisted . The result is always the same . An English county member means almost as a rule a stolid conservative . The towns govern in the end . They , too , have their conservatism . The small boroughs often sink wholly under the Influence of the county-that is to say , of the county peers and territorial magnates . In London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radicalism , and devoted tt the aristocracy , just as a footman is , because the court and the aristocracy are its patrons and give it its pay . But the influence of such a class is only negative at its best , and in times of tumult counts for nothing ' . All the clear purpose and organized strength of will which exist in England to-day may be regarded as on the side of radical advance . Even that strength of will which 3 // comes from the naked selfishness of a privilegod class , anxious to keep the advantages it has got , loses much of its resisting power when , having already yielded a good deal , it is uncertain whether its own interests do not require it to yield yet more , and if so , how much ? Principiis obsta is the grand rule of a privileged class . Let the principle of social equality obtain ever so . small a footing , and it is sure to win its way in . Now the whole tendency of things in England , so far as radicalism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has always had in our time , and it used to be commonly and truly said that the Englishman cared nothing about equality provided he had his individual liberty , while the Frenchman could endure any restraint on his personal liberty provided he saw that no other class enjoyed special privileges denied to his own . But of late years the former part of the proposition , at least , . has ceased to be true , and the unprivileged Englishman has begun to ask very seriously why other classes should have advantages denied to him and his . I do not see how the aristocratic system can long endure against the encroachments ( of the popular demand for equalizing of classes . I even think it quite among possibilities that a time may come when the popular inclination would once more sanction a temporary strengthening of the influence of the Crown , in order to weaken the power and diminish the privileges of the aristocracy . Meanwhile these latter are undergoing invasion quickly enough as it is . The hereditary privilege of governing England is passing rapidly out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , we see middle-class men of quite moderate ability called to fill seats in the Cabinet , which the genius and profound knowledge of Burke could never have procured for him , merely because it is necessary that the growing sentiment of class equality should be conciliated and appeased . I am not aware of any instance in modern history where this natural , manly , and just principle , having once fairly come into operation , has ever sufli*red any serious reaction . Thus , therefore , did the political condition of England present itself to my mind when , after an absence of two years , I endeavored to study it impartially and coolly . I take it that the artisans of the towns are about to become an active and direct political power . The Reform Bill of 1831- ' 32 brought in middleclass wealth to compete with aristocratic rank . The Reform Bill of 1868 has brought in artisan labor to share the competition . I have wholly mistaken the meaning of what I saw and heard , if the working men of the English cities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that republican democracy is the best form of government . The English Church seems to have become almest wholly alienated from the sympathies of the working man . One l ) ranch of it concerns itself about candles and screens and genuflexions ; another about denouncing the Papists and the Lady of Babylon . Between the two the working man has been allowed plenty of time to learn that there are such persons as Mill and Huxley . On the side of the working man there is growing up that school I have already mentioned , of keen , clever , bold , and penetrating political writers , whose tendency is undoubtedly toward republicanism , even if they do not preach republicanism as a creed-men who subject every existing institution of the English political system to a criticism as sharp and searching as if " the wisdom of our ancestors " really had no manner of sanctity about it at all . Decidedly the age is a skeptical one in English politics ; and the artisan of the cities is a very Thomas in his reluctance to believe in t1mo* reality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for himself . Loyalty of the old-fashioned kind he has wholly ceased to feel or to respect . He has just as much faith in the sanctity of the monarchical principle as he has in the power of // the sovereign 's touch to heal the scrofulous . He is not in any hurry about rev .. olutionary change . He seems to wait rather composedly , believing that events are working out gradually , but very surely , the conclusions he desires to see accomplished . We do not therefore hear of any vehement agitation or clam orous demand for a republic going on in England . I have read indeed of a meeting convened in London by Mr. Odger , one of the very ablest and best among the working-men leaders , at which a resolution was adopted declaring the republican form of government the best for England , and announcing that a republican programme or " platform " is to be formally presented to the na tion . This in itself is a very remarkable and significant thing . We may be sure that there was none of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anarchical turbulence of mere revolution , in any meeting organized by such a man as Odger ; and indeed the resolution in favor of a republic was worded in the most cool and practical style , urging as the grand recommendation of the re publican form of government , that it was the one " best calculated to develop 7 the resources of the country . " I attach very great importance to the fact that such a meeting was held and such a resolution calmly adopted . But I do not expect just yet to see anything like a definite and organized agitation or even propaganda in favor of a republic . I think the London working man is dis posed to take matters coolly and patiently if no unforeseen event drives him on . He believes in a possible English republic ; probably he is even convinced hr his own mind that the thing must come some time , and he does not care to take the responsibility of trying to precipitate it . But he is resolved that when such a crisis arises as that of France in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the earnestness and fervor of his republican sympathies . Be sure he was not among the crowd who in the royal town of Windsor offered such uproarious welcome to Louis Napoleon . So far as he is a republican , he is so by virtue of a downright practical conviction , not because of the fascination of some leader 's dazzling eloquence . The influence of the working man has grown up , as his convictions have , without leadership outside his own class , and with out any remarkable brilliancy of leadership within . Throuoh the whole of these recent years of struggle for political rights and of successful endeavor after trade organization , no genuine popular orator has appeared among Eng lish working men , or has arisen in any other rank specially to address and to lead them . There is no Fergus O'Connor movement now , to collapse with the collapse of Fe*gus himself . There is no man , so far as I know , whose exist ence or whose efforts are essential to the political influence of the English arti san body , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon English political life . It is an upward movement of the whole body , an advance along the whole line , that we are now witnessing . I have great faith in the English artisan-all the more because there is so little of the " Red " about him , and because he is so little given to rhetoric and extrav agance . Above all , I have faith in him because he has proved so well that he can do without the leadership of persons who think themselves his social supe riors . Now this English artisan is assuredly a new power in the State , and when he proclaims himself even a theoretical republican , I can not but think that he means what he says , and that some time or other the meaning will find practical expression and resolve . As I turned to leave the scene of the great meeting , that fine September evening , and made my way slowly through crowds cheering for republican France ; through little groves of poles crowned with caps of liberty ; through marching bodies of industrial associations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through small , compact , and // isolated masses gathered round some spot where a volunteer orator had suddenly started up to tell to all who would listen his tale of the strength and the glory of republican institutions ; and through the fringe of wondering , or scornful , or vacantly-curious spectators , belonging chiefly to the middhi , but not a few to the higher classes , I could not help thinking that if there were any peer or other noble personage among those lookers-on , who possessed in his cranium anything of the brains and foresight of a Chesterfield , he must have come to the conclusion already that that demonstration of sympathy with republican France was a " first warning " to the aristocratic system of England . Nothing would have been more easy than to turn the whole thing into ridicule . Its one-ideaed , almost blind partisanship for France was perhaps in itself ridiculous . But at the heart of the whole affair was the sober fact that the London working men are earnest republicans-republicans by conviction and by sympathy ; and I hardly think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that .
