RECREATION AND SOLITUDE . I. AMONG the inspired imaginings ( if indeed the epithet be not tautological ) of the Hellenic brain , perhaps the most incomprehensible in its inner meanings is the history of Hercules , from the fantastic mingling of the historic with the mythic , and the constantly recurring union of the true Hercules , the type of labor and reform , with the incarnations of that spirit which the earnest , resolute , combating life of the Hellenic race was constantly developing . The myth tells us that Antmus , fighting with Hercules , was restored to new strength and life as often as , beaten , he returned to the bosom of his mother Earth . In Hercules I conjecture the divine-human spirit of labor , in whose arms the child of Earth , struggling , dies unless he can get back to his mother , to Nature , and find recreation in her supreme repose . It has been my habit for many years , at all times when I found myself broken down by fatigue , to resort to the wilderness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better workers to follow me and find renewal , pillowing their heads on the breast of an alma mater uncorrupted by civilization , her power and sweetness undiminished by human association or human mending , - the only complete refuge of man from labor . Your country house harbors care and the devil of business , and thoughts for the morrow are written over every one of its walls ; in the hotel , be it the most secluded , the postman comes and all the world is present . In the wilderness are silence and oblivion , which bring repose and render recreation possible . We are cursed by the thrift of our forefathers , by the puritanical sense of , the value of time ; purged of all love of holidays and haunted by the ghost of a wasted minute ; and in the fever of doing we forget the greater and final duty of being . As philanthropists we pursue the good of all but ourselves ; as merchants we gather the means of happiness // 11 with so much avidity that we lose sight entirely of happiness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dwelling amidst utilities and angularities until all sense of beauty or capacity of repose is extinguished in us . Our only remedy is in the enjoyment of nature , thus by her influences acquiring somethink of that spiritual balance and harmony without which art and music and the last refinements of life remain curious exotics . There may be something in the fact of our civilization having been a struggle against nature and having left in us the seeds of this antagonism , but , however it may be , it is a fact that we do not love nature . We avoid her , indeed , until fashion has set a seal on her , and then pay a most formal and discreditable reverence . I happened to be at the end of one summer and late in the autumn in that most charming of summer resorts , the White Mountain Glen . While the heats of the city lasted , the hotel was crowded , but the instant the city became habitable , the whole guest ! hood fled , and during the changes of September , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phase , the Glen was deserted . And as we do not love nature , so we do not as a people love art . I have long felt and reluctantly admitted this in spite of myself , without being able to assign any completely satisfactory reason why it should be so ; yet it very clearly is so . With all our quickness of perception - technical excellence , indeed - in artistic processes , with the grandest motives in history and nature continually forced on our attention , we have nothing that approaches the popular love of art and sense of external beauty which characterizes the French , the Italian , and even the German people . As a nation we are comparatively devoid of the sense of beauty ; and art , even , as applied to our houses , our costumes , our demeanor , is if not exotic at least sporadic . Ruskin once gave a cross view of this subject which illuminated it somew*hat and in a consolatory manner . We were traveling in Switzerland together , and one day , sketching near Geneva , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a group of dilapidated cottages near where he was drawing some mountain lines . The subject did not interest me and I made a careless sketch , bad enough in every sense . The houses were rickety , leaky , ready to fall , and I only felt that they were most unfit for human dwellings . On his abusing my sketch as it deserved I could only say that I did not enjoy the cottages , for I thought more of the rain that poured in and the fevers that bred there than of the picturesqueness of the lines . We were driving home , and he sat back in the carriage in silence for a long time , and then in reply said , " You are right ; yours was a nobler way of looking at the subject than mine ; and now I understand , for the first time in my life , how any one can live in New England . " Nature with us is not yet ripe for art , for the wilderness in which she keeps her primitive state , and where no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artistic motive , because all great art must be based in human emotion , and the very essence of the wilderness is that human associations shall not enter into it . This , which I believe to be logical and veridical , explains why unhumanized nature , while it refuses us the art which would in itself be the needed element of repose in our national character , furnishes us with another source of restfulness which no completely civilized country can give , in this wilderness where exists no link of suggestion to bind us to the labors and cares we leave behind us , and where we find the complete mental repose which responds to the Anta*an need . All this , dimly felt and in some sense long ago asserted by men of taste , especially by Ruskin , flashed on me as a demonstrated truth when I last passed through the wedge-end of civilization on my way to the grand old Maine woods for my summer 's rest . I had lived the ten previous years in the Old World , mostly in Italy and Greece , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and to my sense , grown morbidly delicate , as with those not to // this manner born , the New England border village was concrete pain and constructive dislocation . The palings of the picket fences piqued me , the square dry-goods-box houses repelled me ; even the neatness and the brightness of the white paint and Paris-green shutters jarred on my sense of color ; and the ample door-yard where the sunflowers and hollyhocks stared between fruit - trees and were flanked with the hills of some variety of early potatoes , for convenience ' sake , were a form of the dulce cum utile defying that sense of the proprieties which in my opinion should be regarded next after the laws of moral.1 am glad to see the evidences of cicanliness and health , but why should white lend be healthier than red ochre or the natural color of weather-worn wood ? or the front garden be planted with alternations of flowers and kitchen products ? The fact is that our people have no sense of beauty , no taste , in other words ; and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as when the stage which linked the civilization of the railway with the woods carried me through Greenville to the shores of Moosehead Lake . A small , straggling village on which in most unequivocal ch*racters is written lumber , * ' being in fact a great lumber station . Two country taverns of a larger type of the dry-goods-box style ; planks laid in the street to walk on , piles of them along the lake side , everywhere an evidence of that superabundance of wood which prevents us from having any rural architecture , or homesteads , or stability . This is the curse of the woods on us for our reckless and wicked sylvicide , a curse which falls most heavily on places like Greenville , which is the thin end of the wedge , and beyond which for miles and millions of acreR north , east , and west , stretches the grandest of our remaining forests ; a wilderness where lake , river , and mountain mingle in labyrinthine confusion , to find one 's way through which a special professional education is required , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hunter . The former has long since felled all the finest trees in the Moosehead country , and the latter has almost exterminated the great game except bears ; but the trees are not missed , and for all our purposes the forest is as unbroken as ever , the felling of the occasional pines and spruces making no perceptible impression on the mass of vegetation which walls the lake in on all sides and covers the mountains to their very summits . Lumbering in fact might be carried on for a hundred years still , as it is now carried on , and still not affect the forest perceptibly , and it is only where fire follows the axe and clears huge tracts of all vegetable life , leaving a brown and dusty area of ghastly tree trunks , under which nature commences anew and at once her work , that the appearance of the country is changed . Moosehead is the queen of all our forest lakes . It stretches wandering and spidering across and through a tract of about fifty by twenty miles , a puzzle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to number three hundred and sixty-five , - a conventional term in such cases for an unknown number , as they used ( and still use ) forty in the East ,  - -  and into the bays and inlets run countless streams , the tribute bearers of lakes and ponds scattered through the woods in every direction for miles , little ponds and big ponds , marsh ponds and trouty ponds , single lakes and chains of lakes , by some of which you may go through to the far north where the moose and caribou are tranquil still . I have not yet been able to decide if the introduction of a tiny steamer on Moosehead is an advantage or no . It is not so bad as it seems , however , f*ir the steamer does not depend on tourists , and would probably not pay its expenses except in the lumbering season ( when it is occupied towing rafts , etc. ) , were it not that wood costs but the cutting , and the crew is only of three men , captain , engineer , and bowsman ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burlesque on a bark canoe . Its summer service is to carry passengers to the Mount Kineo hotel , half-way up the lake , and bring them their supplies and letters . So far as I am concerned this hotel is a convenience too much . I do not believe // we get the good of nature we might till we abandon ourselves to her , plunge with a bold " header " into the depths , and leave our planks and buoys behind us . We sink like Peter only with incomplete faith , and my faith in mother Nature is no hesitating one . I have no fear to cut adrift from spring mattresses and the provided table , defy rain as sunshine , and abandon myself to whatever the wild woods may bring . But as a point of departure or convenience for those whom weakness or timidity prevent from taking the pure remedy , - crustacea of habit to break whose shell is to break their vertebrm , - the Mount Kineo House is an excellent make-shift . It stands on a point of land jutting far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No noise , no disorder of civilization , no confusion of the state comes there , and if one had the hardiness to refuse the postman , he might live as quietly as need could be . Pleasant wood-paths , the only beneficent bequest of the lumberman , run into the forest and even give you a chance to try that elsewhere dangerous sensation of being lost in the woods ; the clearing gives other ways for those otherways disposed , and the pebbly beach is charming at sunset , or the silently slipping bark canoe , flitting as if at a wave of the hand ( only the paddler knowing the power of that wave ) , carries one off into vagaries aflood and by moonlight as it glides by the bold shores - where the cedars reach out for the light and the air their crowding forest kindred deny them in the limits of the land - as if the forest were moving past , or as if one had entered some huge river whose current carried him on without other guidance . The hotel is not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love of quiet , of fishing , or of the forest 's self : invalids to whom pure air is length of years ; fishermen wise enough not to proclaim to the whole world that there is no such trout fishing on the wide continent , but whose places here are engaged with the regularity of the return of the season ; and Bohemians , like myself , who chafe under the perpetual wear of governmental infliction , and must now and then get where the law and the gospel have not the weight of punishments . The professor and I lay under the pinetrees soughing in the south wind on the Moosehead Lake shore until the sunset came and we heard the rolling of the hotel gong for supper , the evening of our first day on the lake . IL As between the great rival tracts of wilderness which remain to us , the Maine woods and the Adirondack , there is little characteristic difference . In the latMi4 there is a certain amount of " settling still , but in the former civilization seems to have met at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accessible part of either in its primitive state ; the pines have almost disappeared excepting a few invalids who could not pass even the merciless muster of the axe ; but Maine was so long ago ravaged that the scars have healed , and except for the absence of the gaunt , humanesque pines towering above the solid forest , the most weird and preternatural of the sylvan phenomena where they can be found , there is almost nothing in the Maine woods , even about Moosehead , to show the passage of the lumberman . Once in the woods one does not see where more trees could have grown ; the thrpnes of the dead monarchs are dust and fungi , and renewing nature has replaced them ; while in the Adirondack one sees the axe everywhere , the scars fresh and the vacancies yawning , the ravages of the fires that follow those of the wood-cutter and multiply them by infinity are wide-spread on hill and lake side . The nomad and irresponsible horde who crowd into the section and serve as guides in summer , woodsmen in winter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and holding a New-Englandly respect for the forest property , but , indifferent to all vested or other interests save their own , kindle fires and leave them to burn out their natural drift , or even set fire to huge tracts of forest purposely , to make // " slashes " on which to hunt the deer . They are Canadians , Yorkers , Vermonters , or anything else , neither to the manner born nor in it interested , and they come for the season , saying , " After us the fire . " In Maine the men are as careful to put out a fire in the woods as if it were on their own farms . That the Maine woodsmen are conservators appears in another curious feature of their woods economy , their continued use of the bark canoes , remnant , may be , of a lacustrine civilizatron of our own continent , as the flint weapons are of a stone period which has intruded into the golden age and tried issues with the fine steel of the Pilgrims and their successors . How absurd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civilization into " ages , " when we know that the day the Pilgrims laQded the Parthenon of Athens was still perfect , the stone period unbroken in one part of America , and in another a sister civil ? zation to that of Egypt sinking under the nascent barbarism of the corrupt Spanish empire . The bark canoe is a relic of the stone period which has never had justice done to its curious perfections . It is as noteworthy as the boomerang or any antique bronze work , and dates , doubtless , from the earliest ages of the stone working . All that was needed to make the canoe was a sharpedged flint to crease the bark , cords of bark or twigs to lower it safely to the ground ; and a stone wedge to split the wood strips which are placed inside to stiffen and support the bark . The bark is stripped from a standing tree , slit at the ends and gathered up into uniform bow and stern , slit and gathered again down the sides at intervals , to raise the lines fore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with gunwale added of strips of wood sewed on with thread of split spruce roots , the whole lined with thin strips fore and aft , and then thwart strips set to keep the longitudinals in their places ; not a particle of metal occurs in it from stem to stern , and though doubtless the use of steel implements adds to the neatness of the work , it has not in the least modified the lines , which strangely enough are almost identical July , with those which are found in the model of the fastest ocean steamers , and of which Scott Russell claimed to have made the scientific discovery as the " wave line . " For carrying power and fleetness the canoe can not be improved . Driven in the same manner , that is by the paddle , there is no form of boat which with the same flotation will keep up with it . Science has made study of the boomerang ; why not of the canoe ? Like its Australian relative , the canoe is a most dangerous implement for bunglers . Unsteady , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an egg-shell , and an awkward foot , a careless step , plunges the would - be passenger into the water beyond . The reversal is quicker than any possible voluntary motion , and constant care is required to prevent capsizing even when the canoe is properly loaded and skillfully paddled . Then it has other serious faults : its frame is too li , ht to admit of the use of oars , and paddling is weary and tedious work , employing the muscular powers to poor advantage ; having no keel the canoe makes leeway before the least wind , and is very unfit for rough water . The least touch on rocks or stumps starts a leak , and the comfortable drive on to the pebbly beach , bows on , of the Adirondack skiff , when one wants to land in a hurry , is certain ruin to the canoe , and the debarkation reminds you of an egg-shell still more forcibly than the embarkation . Your guide brings the canoe side on to the shore , carefully choosing his place with reference to rocks and stumps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his passenger steps out . That the Maine man holds to the canoe , while the Adirondacker adopts a model of boat so different and so much more convenient , is due doubtless to that innate conservatism of localized man which leads him to protect all usages and products of the natal region ; and the same element makes the Maine region the safer depository of woods instincts and characteristics , and the Maine forester , what one rarely finds in the Adirondacks , a true backwoodsman . There was therefore highest reason 1P*creation and Solitude. // for taking passage in " barks " for our camp life . For me the bark had no terrors , and the professor found his centre of gravity in the midst of blankets and cooking-utensils , leaving propulsion to his guide ; to me the accustomed paddle gave a workman 's place . Right across the lake from the Mount Kineo House is a bay into which debouches a little river , the outlet of a secluded lake which woods nomenclature distinguishes as Brassua Pond , and on this we determined to camp . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in amongst the lily pads of the shallow , tranquil water , " boomed in " by the chain of logs by which the lumberers hedge in their divinity . Joe , the guide , an old - fashioned Canadian of bulky frame and unwieldy wits , was half inclined to axe his way through , and it was curious how the restraint of woods law which protected lumbering property struggled against that higher law which protested against the blockade of a navigable stream . Fortunately for the boom owners , he found a bit of it so far submerged that the loaded canoes slipped over with no injury , and we slid into the quiet water beyond . A loon , which our approach had driven up the river , ha-ha 'd and retreated beyond the next bend . A brood of half - fledged sheldrakes fluttered along the water past us into the lake . Nothing else moved . We glided in silence through the sluggish water , the aquatic plants parting right and left ; the forest closed in on either side ; another turn , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water scenery more impressive than these wilderness rivers , especially when , as in this , there are no rapids or perceptible current . The f orest forms a wall about us , heavy , decaying , and growing ; the unbroken mustering of the sylvan tribes ; young trees pushing into the openings left by the last fallen ; a dense curtain of green through which one feels rather than sees the antique world beyond ; an ambush where lurk all mysteries of untamed nature . Down to the very water 's edge the innumerable leaves turn outward their faces to catch the light , a huddle of eager , thirsty , outreaching entities , yearning for and worshiping the sun , the sole duty and desire of their brief existences . A kingfisher flits before us with his kr-r-r ; a brood of young ducks , catching the alarm even from the silent paddle , go scuttling along in the shelter of the overhanging alders ; but except by these , we make our way unnoticed . The loon , which has from time to time reappeared in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banks and the pursuing canoes , tries his last resource and dives past us , rising far astern with a shade of reassurance in his ha-ha ! as he comfortably and leisurely rises on his feet in the water and shakes his wings and , crooning to himself a cadenza of laughter , swims leisurely away to the open flood . Our silent river ended in shallows and a rapid through which the canoes must be dragged , half-lifted , sometimes lightened , and so we holiday-keepers went ashore to walk through to the pond , where the canoes would meet us . A path like a sheep track , hardly perceptible in the woods , led from the landing-place , and by it we plunged into the forest . The transition from the glare and heat of . the hedged - in sunshine of the river to this more oppressively silent gloom , this shadow which Time has never seen broken since the accumulated dust of his earliest old age gave place to seed and growth , was one which deepened gloom and darkened shadow . If on the river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were shut into it . The sky twinkled through leafy interstices , little flecks of golden sunlight found their way to the sparse foliage below . Trees huddled round us , hung over us , tripped up our feet ; their living branches brushed our faces and blocked our way ; dead , they cracked under our tread as though we were walking amongst dry bones . It was not strange to me ; year after year had renewed my knowledge of this phase of nature , yet only deepened my sense of its mightiness and the enchantment of its mystery and solemnity . I would give much to realize the quality and power of the impression this forest 15 // would make on a matured and fully educated artistic sense , habituated only to the tame and use-shaped nature of old countries ; yet the truest of new sensations could never equal in intensity of satisfaction that with which for the first time in so many years I hailed the familiar solitude , and sensed anew the rest , the peace , and oblivion . No one not bred in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had felt at times in the old European world , and which now found its cure . It was not indeed the virgin forest of my earlier haunts ; lumbermen years ago bad disturbed the dryads , but their road , which we finally stumbled on , was buried in ferns , and the deep mosses muffled our footsteps on it . Moose-wood and whistle-wood put in their elder claim and held it , while the spruce and hemlock , of slower growth , prepared to wipe out the memory of invasion and injury ; and the great birches and maples , the slender and columnar beeches bearing their vault of sheltering green above us , had never known axe or fire . Here life , such as it was , was at its flood ; the accumulated mold of centuries , deep under moss , bearing a first crop of ferns , among which were mingled orchis , cypripedium , trillium , with delicate trefoil of the oxalis and countless minor plants which can live only in this humid and spongy bed , was overshadowed by the moosewood , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its yet pure white clusters of berries , and the shrub maples , overlooked again by the lesser firs , with the topmost growth of the huge , deciduous trees , leaving n ospace uninvaded . In no direction can the eye penetrate far . A labyrinth of egress makes traveling impossible save to him who holds the clew of use . The growth of the trees is modified by their closeness , and , lean and gaunt in the race for sunlight , they push up forty or fifty feet without limbs and then spread out in a canopy of foliage . The lesser trees below , not yet attained to their dignity of growth or destined by their species never to reach it , are thin , spindling , nearly destitute of July , leaves . A brisk breeze would throw them down if they stood " in the open , a hot sun dry them up if it could reach them . The shelter of the nursery of nature fosters their precarious lives till death makes way for them as for the heirs of conservative and well-ordered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after one has become habituated to the gloom , the pathlessness , and the apparent impenetrability of the screen it forms around him , is the absence of animal life . You may wander for hours without seeing a living creature , unless you look sharply enough to see the insects which toil in the mosses underfoot , inhabit the bark and the decayed wood , or wait for you to rest before settling on you . The damp . earth breeds in some months millions of mosquitoes and black flies , the pests of all forest lands . In the early spring I have found them so thick that my clothes were powdered with them , not a square inch of cloth lacking its gallinipper ; but they seem to have no bite . The black fly , even more than , the mosquito , so infests these regions , Maine as well as Adirondack , that it is impossible to exist without protection during the spring and early summer . He comes silently and inflicts no pain in biting , but leaves his bite bleeding , after which it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known men blinded by the swelling of the bites received in a morn . ing 's fishing . I should advise no one to venture into the woods until after the hot days of midsummer have stopped the breeding of the black flies . Mosquitoes come ali the year , I believe , when the ground is not frozen hard , for I have had them settle on me when the snow was in the woods , and I was painting With double overcoat and blanket above that to keep me comfortable . But they too are less troublesome after the great beats . But all this insect life is to the pedestrian inaudible - is no part of the great impression the forest makes . One thinks of the woods and the wild beasts ; yet in all the years of my wilderness living I can catalogue the wild creatures other Recreation and Solitude . I // than squirrels , grouse , and small birds ( never plenty , generally very rare ) , which I have accidentally encountered and seen while wandering for hunting or mere pastime in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marten ( commonly called sable ) , and may be half a dozen hares . You may walk hours and not see a living creature larger than a fly , for days together without seeing a grouse , a squirrel , or a bird larger than the Canada jay , a most familiar coaxing bird , who comes to you as a pet bird would , sometimes , to see if you have no venison whose remnants he may hope for . Occasionally I have seen huge owls , buzzards , and the pretty little falcon . Once I came suddenly on a superb eagle feeding on a dead deer , who seemed half disposed to fight for his dinner , which he might safely have done , for I had no weapon . This wonderful silence , which soon becomes weird , did not fail to impress the professor , and our commonplace ejaculations and observations died away . Before great facts men who can think amid be impressed easily are disposed to be silent . The former lumber road had almost disappeared , and to be sure of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into what we call Indian file , imperative where one can hardly go alone and two can not walk abreast , fell behind . Here and there little branch roads , for lumbering convenience , perplexed the way and made me turn back to be sure that the professor was followmr . This solitary peregrination has its perils not less than those of storm - beset highways , and to the unaccustomed eye the path which the woodsman finds clear as a river course is imperceptible . The mirage , the delirium tremens , any conceivable fallacy of the brain , is less terrible in its effect on the judgment and power of self - control than the sense of being lost in the woods . My own experience began early and under good guides , but I had to learn the full meaning of this awful peril from an experience not the least hazardous of many mortal dangers . I had been engaged for hours working my way up a brook on which I had been told was a capital fishing place , and , finding an end to navigation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a maze of alders impenetrable even to a bear , I lost the ' watercourse , and in looking for it crossed a low ridge and fell on another which ran the other side , and in the opposite direction from that which I had left . The reversal of the current was the instantaneous cause of a complete upset of all my ideas of material things . There was no reason in the thing , no reasoning against it . The points of the compass had been as clear in my head as if I saw the needle , but the moment I found thisominous stream running the wrong way , everything was unsettled . The sun was shining out of the clear heavens , but it stared out of the north . One minute before I could have taken a bee-line back to my boat , but the minute after I had lost faith in every landmark . I was not a. novice in woods matters . I could follow a trail readily , and find my way in the dark , and know the points of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but now north had become south and the labor of my reason would not persuade my senses that the sun was not sinking north by east . I dared not travel by the sun , so firmly was my fallacy rooted . I knew the thing at once and comprehended the danger . I knew that in ten minUtes I should be as mad as any man ever was with delirum tremens , that I should be beyond self-control or human help . Not once in three months would a human foot pass within reach of my voice from where I was , but that wolves were nearer I knew by their abundant footprints in the wet sand where I had passed . I ? knew , as well that if I 4ost my wits in that moment nothing lay between me and eternity but a nameless horror . In all my life I can recall no moment of terror like that which I felt gathering on me in that silent forest . I sat down on a rotting log , and , covering my face with my hands , waited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no idea how long it was , but when I arose the sun had . // got back into the southwest , and I made up my mind as I walked back to my boat never to trust myself in a strange wood again without blazing my path as I went along . I might point the moral of my experience by more than one ease not so fortunate . The most impressive one I remember is that of an Englishman who settled in one of the towns bordering on the Adirondack country , and who , having been fishing one day in the autumn with a neighbor , proposed to go back the next day and try it alone . He never returned , and after a day 's absence an expedition set out to hunt him up . A light snow had fallen in the night and his foot-prints were found in one case crossing the road near the village , but plunging into the thickets and deviating in the most aimless and frenzied manner , with long strides like those of a man running , and then these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from home , a man answering to his description came to the door of a house in the adjoining town and asked the way to his village . His face was haggard and he looked wild , the woman said who answered the door , and before she could reply he started away and raced frantically across the road into the woods again and disappeared . No trace of him was ever after found . A friend who surveyed the county lines of Franklin County . New York , told me another more singular case in his experience . His party were running a line in the thick woods and had taken with them a young man from the city who fancied camping-out and had joined the gang as a volunteer . In returning from their work to camp they missed the blazed line and proceeded to find their way by the compass , when it was found that the compa* itself had been lost . None of the gang were disturbed with worse fears than having to sleep out that night , save the novice , who was so fearfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they were obliged to bind him and finally carry him to the camp , the way to which they shortly rediscovered . Yet , finding one 's way is not so diffi cult to one who keeps and uses his wits . The north side of certain trees is always mossy , and whoever ventures into the forest must know at which point of the compass his destination lies , and walk always with reference to this direction , and as be goes slash a tree now and then , when if he misses his aim he can retrace his steps . Only if he misses his way , he must sit down , cover his eyes , and get perfectly composed before he moves aoain , knowing that he can easily be found in this way if he is sought for , and can only make matters worse by moving without certainty of direction . And do n't trust your senses , but carry a compass . Our way grew plainer as we progressed , and we came out on a cleared field where the rank long grass grew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fed quantities of robins , thrushes , with divers fruit-eaters whose names I could not catch . Here had been a farm and here were its hay-fields ; all , with the crumbling barn whose tottering corner posts kept up by the assistance of the clapboarding , were under reclamation by nature , and I felt glad at heart to see that here civilization had found its " thus far " and had been obliged to recede . It was only a sort of hay-making station to feed the oxen during the winter 's lumbering , but even at that I was delighted to find it a failure , and the grass unmowed and likely to remain so in years to come . I wish some law might be made forbidding the further destruction of these great forests . In default thereof I outlawed myself at heart , and gloated over the decay of this place like a red Indian . I felt even an itching to put fire to the tottering structure which gave me incomplete shelter from a coming rain . I think that every man ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a kind of reserve of wild nature ; something to draw on when his intellectual ( and moral ) nature is overdone with cultivation . I should expect the race which had become entirely domesticate ( l to lose all human virtue and vigor , and pass amongst the perfected to 18 July , // whom life has no more use , or amongst the corrupted to whom it gives no longer any hope of redemption . It seems to me that the vice of over-civilization is the utter eradication of the savage instincts and resources from the soul . I have little hope for the descendants of a man who has not some occasional glint of the fire that comes from our kindred with the brute ; to whom there does not often come an untamable delight in untamed nature , and who does not love better at times the fierce beast than the gentle one . The clearing was at the outlet of the lake , a lonely , beautiful sheet of water , winding away in the distance like a huge river , and lost in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , poled , pushed , lifted , and we deposited our weary limbs on the blankets while the guides paddled across to the camp . Save for the scar of the clearing we had just left , here all was satisfactorily free from human touch . Some beautiful pines , even , stood by the shore , saved to us by their imperfections in the lumberers ' eyes , though they had none to the artistic sense . We landed on a long , smooth beach , which from some unaccountable drollery the guides called Misery , a strip of herbless sand which marked the high-water or freshet limits of the lake . Balsam firs , arbor vitte , birches , alders , with shrubs and stubs of various sorts , dead branches and decaying trunks , mosses and foliage , made a hedge so thick that I wondered where the entry into the wood could be . The guides landed the cargoes , carried the canoes gingerly up the beach , and turned them bottom up . One finds that these craft must be used as if they were of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leading the way through an almost imperceptible break in the thicket guided us to a comfortable lumbering camp ; not a bark shelter , merely , but logged and roofed , with a hinged door , a fire-place in the centre , and a smokehole in the roof . The sleeping places , one each side of the door , were filled with old " feathers , " that is , fine branches of firs , which make a bed far from the most delectable ; and we at once proceeded , as rain threatened , to renew them by freshly cut limbs of balsam and arbor vitam . Old beds are the harbor of innumerable fleas , and when it is possible I always burn over the ground before laying a bed ; but the pungent odors of the fresh arbor vitam and hemlock annoy them so that they keep in the dust underneath , and while the bed keeps its fragrance one is unmolested . So Sam rattled down a few small trees of the required species , and we set to work to pick the feathers . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beds of fir branches being more comfortable than good elastic mattresses , as some would-be woodsmen will . Equally vain are the pretensions of the salutary effects of the odors of the leafage of balsam or pine , though the hunters do have a superstition that no one catches cold while sleeping on hemlock branches . A bed of boughs , when it is carefully made , is certainly , for two or three nights , not uncomfortable ; but I should advise those who wish to sleep in perfect comfort in the woods even to carry a small mattress if they can . I never did , but I have found that in most cases people who have had some experi* ence prefer going a little out of their way to find a house rather than sleep on boughs . Sleeping in the open air is unobjectionable , delicious , and when there has been no rain for seyeral days I have often gone out from the camp and slept on the bare ground under a heavy-topped birch . There are no dews in the forest , no agnes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep sure and profound ; but I had never imagination enough to find that either the ground or the firbranches were greater hypnotics than a good hair mattress . Bed provided for , Joe and I went out to catch some trout for dinner . The fishing place was up a stream that came in not far from where we camped , sedgy at its mouth and meandering through boggy , flag- covered ground , sluggish and spreading in wide shoals , through which the canoe with difficulty found a channel . Ducks whirred up from amongst the lily pads* Herons flew from the 18T7.1 19 // hummocks where they stood , one-legged , watching for frogs . It was long since they had been disturbed . The alders closed in on the bogs , the rushes gave way to small firs , and we could see where the brook issued from a dense grove of* balsams , when , narrowing , it made a sudden turn and we slipped in on a basin of deep black water where the swift water debouched . Joe paddled gently up to the bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soft mossy soil , sat astride the bow , with his feet on the land , to steady the boat , a precaution without which the effort to throw a fly makes an upset sure . The water was without a ripple . The sky , overcast , made successful fly-casting barely possible , for of all coy creatures a trout is the shyest when he sees the fisherman ; and nothing but the wiliest , most simulative fall of the fly on the water will lure him up . So I got not too near , and threw my lightest and best , just at the end of a log that jutted into the stream . A break immediately behind the fly , a tentative rise it might have been , showed me that there was no fish there in a hurry to be caught . The trout rarely rises out of the water except in running or cold streams , and at the mouth of a very cold brook I bave seen them jump two feet out of the water to meet the falling fly ; but here the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were slow and lukewarm . I made two or three more casts , however , crossing each time the direction of the first draw of the fly , when with a swirl of the tail and a nip of the fly that scarcely broke the glassy surface he took the feathered lie and went back to his refuge with it . Started , rather , for he never reached again the shelter of the unsunned nook from which he had made his exit . While I fished , with poor success for Moosehead sport , the clouds were gathering in the west and thunderheads rolled up their gray summits above the overhanging forests . Nothing is more tenacious , not even the gaming table , than a spot where one knows that the trout are lurking and hopes that they may be taken . I held on for another and another , though Joe hinted danger of . a wetting , and it was only when the first large drops began to dot the water that I consented to consider the propriety of a retreat . A crash of thunder settled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is falling , thunder keeps them perfectly quiet . I knew that it was time to stop , and while I reeled in Joe pushed for camp . I took the other paddle ; the wind came down in an incipient tornado and lent us speed , but the rain came on like a gray veil , - not rain , a del-. uge , not drops , but masses of water . It struck us , and in a minute we were as wet as though dipped in the lake . It came as if buckets of water were being thrown from an upper window on us ; it hurt like hail ; bolt after bolt of lightning blinded us and stunned us ; we paddled as if for life , but before we had gone the short mile to the landing-place the rain ceased , open sky showed in the west , and the lake was rolling in petty imitation of a ground swell , glassy and lustrous under the golden sky above , where the sun had set , and as we gently drew up the water-logged canoe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drifted across the serene west . To say that I never saw such a rain-storm would not be much , but Joe in all his backwoods life could recall nothing like it . Fortunately we found a splendid fire blazing in the camp , and preparations for dinner complete and waiting only the trout . .1 stripped and , dry clad , threw myself on the timely bed exhausted . Joe stood and dried himself before the fire ; he had not even a spare shirt to alternate with . Reckless of any change , he accepted all that fortune brought him with the imperturbability of an Indian . While Joe stood and steamed before the fire , Sam prepared the eatables . We were not quite dependent on the hook and line , but had in prudence brought a cold chicken and plenty of bread and salt pork , with sundry cans of preserved meats for emergencies . This kind of provision takes away the sentiment from the woods life , but to one who knows the precariousness of supplies there , the pre 20 July , // caution will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those flowing with milk and honey ; and when the sporting books tell you that game is abundant , do n't imagine that you are assured from starvation thereby . I have been reduced , in a country where deer were swarming , to live several days together on corn meal . We ate well and with infinite pleasure , and , leaving the guides to their own contenting , strolled out in the twilight on the beach , smooth , hard beaten , resonant . Loons were calling on the lake , an owl now and then hootdd from the wood . The sky overhead was blazing with stars ; they never seemed so many or so bright . The atmosphere , cleared from all vapor by the storm , had deeper depths , and the bold overhanging tree-tops cut in bolder relief against the sky . The least sound seemed to perpetuate itself , as philosophy has told us all reverberations do . The cry of the loon ran along all the shore ; when we spoke , it was as if the world were listening . There were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the deeper woods of the Adirondack I have heard makin0 night fearful . I told the professor of one evening when I was returning from work in the deep woods to my solitary camp , the light barely sufficing me , and heard a cry in the depths of the forest like that of a lost child , only no child , no man even , had such a " far cry " as that . I replied , and presently heard it repeated still nearer , and returned the cry thinking still that it was some one lost in the woods . Still nearer and nearer it came , the same unvarying note , half shriek , like one calling in mortal fear , in uncontrollable panic . It seemed too fine for a man 's voice , too strong for a child 's , and I assured myself that it was a woman lost in the forest . The first suspicion of anything uncanny I had in it was in finding that it approached too fast for any human creature . It was incredible that the voice should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and suspense became so great that I trembled with it , and my voice failed , not from fright , for I had a Sharp 's rifle with me , but from the weird nature of the thing . 1 fired three shots to guide the supposed person , but from that moment heard nothing more of the voice . The hunter who came to me once a week to bring my mail and bread told me afterwards that it was a panther . Only a few weeks earlier , coming to me , he had heard in passing the same ridge a cry which he took to be that of a lost luau , and replied until it came near , when , hearing no articulate sound , he judged it to be a panther and paid no more attention , as he had no weapon , but presently heard the steps of the creature following at the side of his track , not in it but near enough to see him and remain unseen by him . It has a habit of following the hunters in this way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found that their main business is to set traps for sable and mink , which it amuses itself by tearing up , and devouring the bait , having itself no scent by which it can follow the trail . INo incident occurred to break the quiet of the night ; incidents are rarer in the woods than anywhere except it be Sahara , and we went to bed early , the guides having long been asleep . The camp built in the way this was has the advantage that the smoke which fills it drives out the mosquitoes , and the guides have a notion that gmoke strengthens the eyes . It is however subject to the great discomfort of being very hot while the fire is burning , and getting cold while everybody is asleep . One wakes towards morning compelled to pull up the blankets , superfluous an hour earlier . I arose at various intervals to replenish the fires ; the guides slept , and would have slept the same on snow . So the finer sense takes its toll of discomfort , which the wise pay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ J. Stiliman. 1877. 21
