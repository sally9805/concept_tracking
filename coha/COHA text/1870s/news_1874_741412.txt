txt The ' current of travel to Europe this year does not seem likely to be so great as at some former periods . Want of finals , owing to dullness of business , has doubtless a good deal to do with this . Perhaps , also , the loss of so many vessels during the past Winter may deter some people from venturing on the ocean . But although the number of tourists will probably be smaller than usual , it will , in any event , be far from inconsiderable . To an unsophisticated individual , it would appear as if the various tastes of the multitudes of European tourists from this country would take them over an almost infinite diversity of routes . But iu all this great region , with its endless variety of customs and dialects , its different forms of government , its immense population , and its innumerable objects of historical interest , a six mouths ' tour of any one traveler resembles , in a great majority of cases , the six months ' tour of any other traveler almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of another street-car horse ou the same line . At least , whatever diareuce there may be is not discernible from their conversation after they come home . They all seem to their Mends to have been to precisely the same places , and seen precisely the same things . This uniformity is doubtless productive of some convenience . It is much easier to recollect what each one of a dozen persons has told about his travels , if they have all been over the same ground , than it would be if each Of them ; in choosing his route , bad indulged in some eccentric fancy of his own . Few compliments are more delicate and pleasing than that of remembering , after the lapse of several months , the details of an account a couple of hours long which a lady or gentleman has given of her or his adventures the other side of the Atlantic . It would . often be a great tax upon a man 's memory to . recollect as many such narratives as he has acquaintances who have thus favored him with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy circumstance that if he remembers one of them , he can scarcely fail to recall the substance of all the rest . The fact that a route is very much traveled is , so far as getting easily over the ground is concerned , generally an advantage . In respect to learning anything about the country or the people , it is usually a material disadvantage . Hotels on the Continent , at Which the landlords have learned to " : adept ' themselves to the wants of tourists , are by no means the best places to study local manners and usages . The distinguishing peculiarities of the people of any country are best seen in places at a distance from the beaten track . A European , for instance , who wish ' ed to study the American people , would be apt to learn far more of what the great mass of them are like by hiring a light wagon to take him one or two hundred miles through a tolerably thickly-settled rural district , than in traveling by rail from here to Chicago , and stopping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hotels , in the latter case , would , indeed , be incomparably more elegant , or , at any rate , more showy , than the country taverns at which he would put up with his conveyance . A palace car would jolt him far less ( if it did not run off the track ) than his vehicle on some of the roads he might iu the other case pass over . But for all he would see of American character or customs , he might almost as well stay quietly in a hotel in Now-York . Indeed , in reference to anything he would learn about a very large portion of the people , he might just as well have remained at home , and , in ? some respects , better ; for the idea he would get of American life by visiting our large hotels would not only be incorrect , but in many points exceedingly- fallacious . Traveling in Europe has , of late years , been reduced to a very perfect system . The care and thought required for " seeing " a tour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs to exercise in order to be transported from the neighborhood of the Mississippi to that of the Hudson . But the effect of making matters so very convenient is often a good deal like that of translating a school-boy 's Latin , or doing his sums for him . The absence of the necessity for active employment of his own mental powers may be in the former , as in the latter case , a loss rather than a benefit . To those tourists whose principal aim is simply to be able to say that they have been to the regularly prescribed places , and seen the regularly prescribed objects , this perfection of system presents , undoubtedly , the easiest method of accomplishing their wishes . To those , on the other hand , who seek the kind of in ' formation and the enlargement of mind which is furnished by the opportunity of seeing the essential principles of human nature in various phases and diverse relations , . there are many important advantages in. striking out for themselves , during a portion of tire time at least , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often afford them the means of acquiring valuable ideas in regard to the country and the people , which they could not otherwise obtain .
