SQUIRE WILLIAMS , FARMER JOHNSON and CITIZENS discovered waiting for the mail . Lively music . Squire W. Squire Williams Now , let me say , Farmer Johnson , I do n't think we 're agoing to have any war . My opinion is this  --  I 'm a school trustee and ought to know  --  the politicians and provision men have formed a combination to run up prices , so they 've started this story about war . Now , I 'll bet my best heifer I 'm right . Farmer J. Farmer Johnson Well , I know you'r pretty long headed , Squire , but I differ , for once , with you . There 's allus fire whar there 's smoke . My Jack was over to Portsmouth , yesterday , and he hurd it read out of a paper that the Southern people had fired on the flag , some were 's down South , and that Lincoln , him as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of men . I did'nt vote for Lincoln , but by the ' Ternal , I 'll stand by the Union , and so will my boy . He ai n't old enough to vote , but he dared that sneak Alf . Thornton to fight not long ' go , and I jest reckon he can lick any man of his years south of the Ohio . Them 's my principles . Squire W. Squire Williams Now , Mr. Johnson do n't get excited . I stick to my opinion , and , if there 's to be war , I 'll send in Jim Hanson , my son-in-law , if it makes Susan Maria a widder . But , see , the mail has just come in . Let us see the postmaster , and borrow a paper . Postmaster . ( At window . ) Thunder and greased lighting , friends , we are in for it . Enter TOM FLYNN , 1 E. L. Tom F.

Well , Mr. Ludlow , a man of your sinse to call me dhrunk ! Shure Tom 's never drunk while he has cint in his pocket ; but barrin ' yersel ' , Mr. Ludlow , gor ra , but I can whop any man in the place . ( Yells . ) Mr. L. Mr. Ludlow ( To the Postmaster . ) You seem excited , Mr. McDonald . Anything for me to-day ? Postmaster . Oh , Lud ! Mr. Ludlow ! We are ruined .

( Hands paper , opens letter and reads . ) Squire W. Squire Williams Friend Johnson , I back down , I cave , I obsquatulate , it ai n't the politicians and provision men . By the livin ' thunder , it 's the politicians alone . War ! War ! War ! The paper 's covered with it . I know 'd it was coming . Did'nt I allus say we 'd have war . I 'll bet my best heifer , my Susan Maria is goin ' to be a widder ! Farmer J. Farmer Johnson You'r a heavy old prophet , Squire . You just take the shine out of Joe Young and all the Mormons . Let me see the paper . ( Takes paper , reads and comments . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what a big pile ! The States are to be divided . Not , by the ' Tarnel , while me and my boy Jack 's livin .

Jack Johnson Not now , Tom The old man looks as if he wanted me . ( Walks aside with FARMER J. ) Enter JACKSON LUDLOW , 2 E. R. Jackson L. Why , father , are you sick ? . I never saw you looking so pale and excited . Come , let me take you home . Mr. L. Mr. Ludlow Oh , it 's nothing my boy ! But the news that comes to us to-day is most alarming . The South is in for war . Troops are called out by the Union , and you , my boy must go , and Louis , too , if both are needed . Jackson L. I am glad , father , you feel so , for I made up my mind to enter the army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Portsmouth . But what is that letter you cling to so ? Mr. L. Mr. Ludlow It is from your uncle Martin and your brother Thomas , who still remains with him . My friends , let me read this letter to you all . ( All gather around . ) Enter ALFRED THORNTON , 2 E. R. Mr. L. Mr. Ludlow ( Reads . ) ATLANTA , GA. , April 18 , 1861 . MY DEAR BROTHER : By the time this reaches you , you will have heard that the South has determined to sever a Union in which it can have no protection , and build up a Confederacy where there will be the most ample protection for all men in the stations which God called them to fill . We have struck the first blow at Charleston , and above the stars and stripes now floats the flag of the South . We hope to leave in peace , though amply prepared for war . We have plenty of friends North , and knowing your spirit of justice , I think I may count you among them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your son , has enrolled his name in the Georgia State Guards . He sends love to all , and I with him hope to hear from you before the postal communications between the separate nations cease , which . I presume , will be a temporary necessity of Secession . Faithfully , your brother , MARTIN LUDLOW . Squire W. Squire Williams Jest as I said  --  them Southern fellows is for war . But we 'll give ' em Hall Columbia , if Susan Maria lets her husband go . Him as is my son-in-law . Jackson L. Father , this is terrible . Poor Tom , he has been led blindly into this . But , with your consent , I will fight for the Union , though every man , with a drop of our blood in his veins , opposes us . Mr. L. Mr. Ludlow God bless you , my boy ; I feel as you do . Farmer J. Farmer Johnson Here 's my Jack . I 'm an old democrat , one of them as stands by the country , an ' I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I 'll give up my farm if Uncle Sam wants it , an ' more , this ole arm can hold a rifle , and my eye ai n't too dim to guide a bullet yet if need be . Alfred T. Alfred Thornton See here , friends , my opinion is , you are all too one-sided . Across the Ohio river are our friends and relatives . North of us is a land of mean skin-flints . I was born North but raised South . Jack J. Jack Johnson You mean you gambled South . Tom F. Tom Flynn Let the gentlemin talk . The Flynns were always for lettin ' a man talk . Alfred T. Alfred Thornton I know my own business . This is a free country , and I am not afraid to say , if there is to be war , I 'll draw my sword for the South . Farmer J. Farmer Johnson I knew you were a villain from the day you first came to see my daughter , and if the people felt as I do they would hang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Hang the rebel ! ( FARMER JOHNSON clinches ALF . THORNTON . ) Enter LOUIS LUDLOW , 2 E. R. Louis L. Louis Ludlow Stand back here ! This scene will do for the South , but not for the law abiding North . A man is ever at liberty to express his sentiments here without fear , no matter how much we despise him . Here , sir , I will escort you from the crowd , and it is with the hope that I may meet you some day better prepared to defend yourself . ( Scene closes . ) SCENE SECOND . Parlor in Farmer Johnson 's house . Enter JERUSHA JOHNSON and ABBEY SMITH 1 E. R. Jerusha J. Jerusha Johnson Abbey Smith , you talk like a woman of the world . I am astonished at a girl of your good sense ; but , as Mr. Goodman , our dear preacher , says , " Vanity of vanities , all is vanity . " Abbey S. Abbey Smith ( Twisting her apron . ) Well , it ai n't for hired help like me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorry when their fellers leave , just like others . I know Sam Roberts has always been soft on me , and I 've been soft on him ; you 'd be soft on him , too , Miss Jerusha , if you was me . Sam is the best fellah  --  Jerusha J. Jerusha Johnson There ! there ! Abby Smith , not another word ; you make me blush about your fellows . The day will come when , as Mr. Goodman says , you will see " all is vanity . " The world is fearfully wicked . Oh ! how it has changed since I was young  --  I mean since I was a child . I am young still , Mr. Goodman says . Abby S. Yes , mum . Jerusha J. Jerusha Johnson My , nephew , John Johnson , has determined to fight . He is foolishly in love with Alice Gray ; but , as Mr. Goodman says , " ' t is vanity . " Now , John is going to war . John has drawn his sword . Why ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know , mum ; but Sam has no sword , except a hammer . Sam 's a blacksmith . Jerusha J. Jerusha Johnson Abbey , you provoke me . I speak in figures . Abbey S. Abbey Smith Yes mum ; that 's the way Sam and me dance cortillions . Jerusha J. Jerusha Johnson The Government will give him a sword . There are too many men in the world  --  let them kill each other off  --  except John and Mr. Goodman . Abbey S. Abbey Smith Yes , mum ; there are too many men , except Sam . Enter LUCY JOHNSON , 1 E. R. Lucy J. Lucy Johnson Well , aunt , has Abbey been telling you that Sam Roberts is going to leave her ? Jerusha J. Jerusha Johnson Yes , my child ; but , as Mr. Goodman says , " all is vanity . " Lucy J. Lucy Johnson I have been giving Solomon credit for that refreshing sentiment , aunt . But , if you will pardon me , I should like to have the parlor to myself for a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desires to see me alone for a moment . ( Exit ABBEY S. , 1 E. L. ) Jerusha J. Jerusha Johnson ( Crossing to R. ) Some vile man . Oh ! that my niece would renounce the world , as Mr. Goodman says . ( Exit 1 E. L. ) Enter ALFRED THORNTON , 1 E. L. Alfred T. Alfred Thornton Ah ! Miss Lucy , you are cruel to keep me waiting so long . But I am afraid by seeing you  --  Lucy J. Lucy Johnson Mr. Thornton will confer a favor by transacting his business with me as soon as possible . I have another engagement . Alfred T. Alfred Thornton I can imagine that engagement , Miss Lucy . I hope to sever it some day . I came to say that to-night I start south , to be absent Heaven only knows how long . I could not leave without coming to say farewell , and to assure you of my love . Lucy J. Lucy Johnson Sir , I told you before this subject was offensive to me ; why will you persist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depth of my devotion be my only excuse . I know I have been bad in many things , but pure in this , my worship of you . I go to fight for what I deem right ; and , ere I leave , tell me you do not hate me , and , that in hours of peril , you will pray , at least for my safety . Lucy J. Lucy Johnson I pray for your safety ! I , whose brother and friends are going to fight against you , pray for your safety ! Why , Alfred Thornton , this is the very sublimity of impudence and cool effrontery . No , sir ! while I shall invoke Heaven to bring peace to my country , I shall pray that justice be meted out to the bad men who have brought sorrow to my home and my heart . Leave me , Mr. Thornton , this subject is even more objectionable than that of your love . Alfred T. Alfred Thornton Miss Lucy listen to me . I am not so bad that the slightest word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I am a Southern man in feeling , but a yes from your lips would lead me to fight in any cause . The faintest hope of your love would make me respond to-morrow to Lincoln 's call . If you would save me , Miss Johnson , Miss Lucy , do not cast me off without a hearing . Lucy J. Lucy Johnson Now , sir , I despise you . Your words confirm my worst fears of your utter want of principle . I can respect the Southern people who honestly act out their errors ; but a man whose sword hangs upon a woman 's word , when great principles are at stake , should not be trusted even by his friends . Alfred T. Alfred Thornton You are as cruel as you are beautiful . I have been a wanderer in the world , without relatives or love ' till I met you . Is it not worth your while to try my salvation ? Why crush me still lower , when you can raise me to your own level ? Lucy J. Lucy Johnson I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much to make you a good , true man . If you only change now , I can give you the love of a sister . Alfred T. Alfred Thornton No more than a sister 's love ? Lucy J. Lucy Johnson No more than a sister 's love is mine to give . Alfred T. Alfred Thornton Then the die is cast ; and while blood flows through this strong right arm , it will hold a sword against those you love ; and while my heart beats , its every throb will be hatred and death to Louis Ludlow . ( Exit 1 E. L. ) Lucy J. Lucy Johnson Yes  --  death to the man who saved your life . ( Solus . ) Oh ! my Father , above , would that this fearful dream of death would pass away . One short month ago and who so happy as I ! Home , brother and Louis ! Now , all seems dark as at that time far away back when my mother died . Oh , Louis ! you must go , though it breaks my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S. , 1 E. L. Abbey S. Abbey Smith Oh , Miss Lucy ! you look so pale . I feel very pale , too , on account of Sam , though your aunt Jerusha says " ' t is vanity . " Your vanity is at the door , Miss Lucy  --  Mr. Louis Ludlow . He looks awful riled . Guess he met that other vanity , Thornton , down the road . Lucy J. Lucy Johnson Tell Mr. Ludlow to come in , Abbey . ( Exit ABBEY S. , 1 E. L. ) Enter LOUIS L. , 1 E. R. Lucy J. Lucy Johnson Oh , Louis ! welcome ! welcome ! I have wanted you so much . Louis L. Louis Ludlow Lucy , why are you so excited ? Has that man , Thornton , been here ? Come , tell me all about it . Lucy J. Lucy Johnson Oh ! yes , Louis ! he has been talking again . I know I ought not to have seen him ; but I hoped I might be able to make him see the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the world , and the best ; but I am afraid , Lucy , you undertook too large a job in making Thornton a good man . He would have been in his grave to-day , but for me ; yet , when I met him on the road , as he left here he passed me with a scowl and low mutterings of revenge . Lucy J. Lucy Johnson Promise me , Louis , you will not court a difficulty with him . Louis L. Louis Ludlow But if I meet him in arms against me Lucy  --  Lucy J. Lucy Johnson Well , then , Louis , I would wound him in the arm , so that he could not fight . Louis L. Louis Ludlow Laughing . Would it not be better to wound him so that he could not run . Lucy J. Lucy Johnson Well , as you say , Louis ; but please do n't kill any one . I do so hope nobody will be killed in this fearful war . Louis L. Louis Ludlow Laughing . It would certainly be a fearful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my darling taking her hand. if all the soldiers were like you , we would meet on the field , drop our arms and shake hands as we do and be friends , eh ? Lucy J. Lucy Johnson Yes , indeed , Louis ! But I want to tell you we have been making a beautiful flag . Alice Gray and myself bought the material . To-morrow , before you leave , we are going to present it to you . Wo n't you guard it for my sake ? Louis L. Louis Ludlow For your sake ! You selfish little mortal ! I will guard it for the sake of the Union , and cherish that particular flag for my darling and our own little union  --  that is to be . But I must leave . We are enrolling men in the village and I must get back . Now , good-bye till to-morrow . Lucy J. Lucy Johnson Good-bye , my own brave Louis . Exeunt . Scene closes . SCENE THIRD .

Alfred Thornton Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well since your capture near Knoxville . I had charge of you , and but for me , you would have been hanged as a spy after you were captured roaming among the wounded . Do you know where you are , now ? Lucy J. Lucy Johnson I do not , sir . Alfred T. Alfred Thornton You are in the city of Richmond , Virginia . You have made the tour from Tennessee with Longstreet 's corps . We had to fall back before the Yankees , under that scoundrel Burnside ; but we got nearly even with him . I suppose you know we captured Louis Ludlow , near Knoxville . He was in our hands for some time . I tried to save him , but he died a few days since of his wound . Lucy J. Lucy Johnson ( Pressing her hands to her forehead . ) Go on , sir , tell me why you have intruded . Alfred T. Alfred Thornton From no desire to annoy you , Miss Johnson . Every care bestowed upon you , up to this time , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insult and disgrace , and I have watched over you when you dreamt no friend was high . Even now there are charges against you as a spy . They can be proved ; but your life and honor must depend on the reply you give me . Lucy J. Lucy Johnson Mr. Thornton , I left my home on a holy mission  --  to care for the wounded , who might fall for my country . I learned that Louis Ludlow was dying , on the field before Knoxville , and went to his aid . Your men took me prisoner and carried me here . You are the moving spirit in this matter , and my death will be on your head . Alfred T. Alfred Thornton Louis Ludlow I respected as a brave man . He is dead , and his fate lies before you , if you do not accept me as a friend . ( Draws near and tries to take her hand . ) Oh , Lucy , I have loved you with an intensity weaker natures could not feel . Day and night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and to win even a smile from you I would sacrifice all else that 's worldly . Lucy J. Lucy Johnson Sir I desire no more of this . It is cowardly thus to insult me with the memory of the dead in my heart . I desire to be tried , believing that the Southern men are brave and honorable , believing that only your falsehood and wicked designs have kept me a prisoner . Leave me , sir , at once . Your very pressence is worse than death . Alfred T. Alfred Thornton Not so fast , Miss Johnson , not so fast . For three weeks , though you knew it not , I have been your escort , and my comrades laughed and winked when I approached , in the evening 's camp , the wagon that contained you . Even if you should be dismissed after trial , you will leave with a stain and a dishonor on your name . Lucy J. Lucy Johnson O ! you are brave , thus to insult a helpless girl . ( Holds up her arms . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no one stronger here to protect me . But here , here in my heart , I am conscious of my honor and purity . And up there , at the judgement seat , I can stand , feeling that I have tried to do my duty , knowing that , by word or deed , I have never wronged the humblest of God 's creatures . Now , Mr. Thornton , are you prepared to do the same ? Alfred T. Alfred Thornton You will drive me mad , if you talk so . If I sink the lowest of men , it is you who have driven me to it . If I rise , regetting the errors I ask God to forgive , it must be through you . You , with no tie that can bind you to the dead , can save me . Lucy , I have ever regretted drawing my sword against the cause you love . Give me hope . Tell me that you may regard me , and to-night I will make arrangements whereby we may escape to the Federal lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nerved by the hope of your love . And you can watch me from the protection of your home . Lucy J. Lucy Johnson Sir , I respect a brave man , fighting honestly in any cause . I despise a villian , though he stand in the pulpit . No cause would make you good . No sword would make you brave . You are as devold of patriotism as you are of honor . If there be one spark of the love left you bore your mother , leave me , leave me . Alfred T. Alfred Thornton ( Excitedly . ) Yes , I will leave you . You decide your own fate . Death awaits you , or , worse , a disgrace which will cling to your name and follow your grave ; and my curse , the curse of a life you have blasted , will follow you forever . Death has no longer a dread for me , and it will be sweet if it comes with the anguish of those you love . Louis Ludlow is not dead . ( LUCY starts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in prayer . ) He is here , within hearing distance of your voice , a prisoner in the Libby . Down below its gloomy rooms there are damp cells , where no ray of light ever enters . I know Turner , and through him , I will place Ludlow where the green slime will cover him , and where a yellow manacled skeleton , he will pray for death . Think this over . His fate is in your hands . To-morrow , I will call again . ( Exit ALFRED T. , 1 E. L. ) Lucy J. Lucy Johnson ( Solus . ) Oh , if I could die ! It seems as if my poor heart would break !

We 'll sound the Jubilee , &c.; Yes , and there were Union men who wept with joyful tears , When they saw the honored flag they had not seen for years , Scarcely could they be restrained from bursting forth in cheers , While we were marching through Georgia . Chorus  --  Hurra ! Hurrah ! We 'll sound the Jubilee , &c.; Sherman 's dashing Yankee boys shall never reach the coast , So the saucy rebels said  --  it was a handsome boast , But , alas ! they reckoned without their host , While we were marching through Georgia .

I ca n't sing any mor'n a cat kin blow a horn , but some of the words is ' T is hard for you'uns to go to war , ' T is hard for you'uns to fight ' T is hard for you'uns to march all day , An ' sleep in a tent at night . But ' t is harder for we'uns from you'uns to part , Whin you'uns have got we'uns heart . Laughter . Now I call that poetry ; only Jim 's fellows do n't sleep much in any tents .
