txt The Republican State Convention for the election of delegates to the National Convention at . Cincinnati will be held in Syracuse four weeks from to-day . In fixing the date of the convention so early , the State Committee have doubtless been actuated by a desire . to give the delegates time to take a leisurely survey of the Presidential field , and to enable them to . go to Cincinnati ready to act according to the dictates of mature reflection . Three mouths is a pretty long interval to place between the date of giving specific instructions and the date of carrying them out . In these days , reputations are made and marred in a shorter time than that , and it is extremely likely that the Presidential kaleidoscope will receive a turn , or two between the 22d of March and the 14th of June . But the State Committee probably agree with the majority of the people in thinking that the instructions given to the delegates need not be very specific . Of course , the convention will have a first , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will consider themselves pledged . , If all that were needed was simply to deliver the " mandate " of the convention , and keep on voting for a single candidate till either he or some one else was nominated , it would be a matter of comparative indifference what kind of men were sent to . Cincinnati . In fact , under such circumstances , one man could deliver . the seventy votes of the State just as easily as the full number of representatives . But as it is at least conceivable that New-York 's first choice should be virtually beaten on the first or second ballot , some **25;0;TOOLONG may be needed to determine the further action of the delegation . It will be a matter of the highest importance to the Republican Party that New-York should be represented at , Cincinnati by a delegation capable of diseharging both ? judiciously and independently the very delicate and responsible duties which will devolve upon them . To secure such a delegation it will be necessary to see that the delegates elected to the State Convention are men thoroughly in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is to be honed , therefore , that the call of the State Committee will be responded to in a Manner obviously worthy of the occasion . The Republicans of Indiana yesterday ' nominated their candidates for State offices to be ' elected in October . The ticket appears to be an unexceptionable one , and the platform adopted shoes a marked advance upon the declaration of principles made in 1874 . The platform of that year pledged the Republicans of Indiana to the issue " of such an additional amount of currency as may be necessary to meet the wants of the agricultural , industrial , and commercial interests of the country , to be distributed between the sections according to the population of each , as is ' consistent with the credit and honor of the nation , and will prevent the possibility of capitalists and combinations of capital controlling the currency of the country . " During the last two years the Republicans of Indiana have found out that , even with a free banking law , currency can not be distributed like political representation . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of New-York banks are filled with accumulations of unemployed paper money , there is as little reason in demanding further issues as there is in accusing " capitalists " of sinister designs upon the currency of the country . Thus they have come to recognize the fact " that it is the duty of the Government in furnishing a national currency so to regulate it as to provide for its ultimate redemption in gold and silver . " The only concession to inflation sentiment is to be found in a demand for the repeal of the promise to resume in 187P . This is , however , accompanied by au expression of opinion that after such repeal the currency " should remain undisturbed , neither contracted nor expanded , we being assured that the financial troubles of the country , when . relieved from interference , will be speedily and , permanently cured by the operation of the natural laws of trade and by preserving that course which the Republican Party has constantly maintained of steadily looking to an ultimate resumption of specie payments . " The financial plank of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject by the Wisconsin State Convention , shows how rapidly all ' sections of the Republican Party are pouring to a substantial agreement on questions relating to the currency . The Greenback Convention . in New-Haven , yesterday , is another , proof of the hopeless division of opinion on financial problems which is establishing itself in the ranks of the Democracy . That convention was chiefly attended by Democrats , and was called fur the purpose of affecting the action of the Democratic State Convention to-day . Gov . INGERSOLL , who took very decided ground a year ago in favor of hard money , is said to be frightened at the display of force in the Greenback Convention , and declares himself ready to accept any financial principles which the party choose to prescribe for hint . And yet the NewHaven resolutions are the most comprehensive farrago of financial nonsense which has yet emanated from any similar body . Every nostrum that has been proposed to escape the simple . necessity of making a paper dollar what it professes to be , finds a place in this remarkable platform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper and to make greenbacks by some occult process adequate to " the purchase of Government bonds at par with gold coin ' . " There is the delusion about a currency " backed by the entire ' wealth of the nation , " whose volume should be " automatically " ? regulated , and which should be exchangeable for " intercAvertible " bonds . As if these were not enough , there is a demand that we should stop borrowing foreign capital , and after taking every conceivable means to increase the premium ou gold , flatter ourselves with the belief that a financial miracle will be wrought for our benefit in the extinction of that premium . This is the " honest financial policy " which is to-day to bo pressed on the acceptance of the Connecticut Donieracy . No better indication of the strength of inflation doctrines , even among Eastern Democrats , could bo found than in the fact that this attempt is likely to be at- , tended by a certain degree of success .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
