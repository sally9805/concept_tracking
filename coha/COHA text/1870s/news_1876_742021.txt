txt The regatta of 1876 of the Intercollegiate Rowing Association is over , and has resulted In a clean sweep for Cornell , that college having won the University race , the smilers ' race , and . the Freshmen 's race It is notorious that the real reason of Yale 's withdrawal from the contest lay in the fact that It was the deliberate opinion of , the University that no college stood on equal grounds with Cornell in consequence or tee superior material of the latter 's men . This view will of course be corroborated by the extraordinary success of the college in yesterday 's racing , but much of that success is due to tee brains of Ostrom , the captain . In fact , although it is the fashion to say otherwise , it can be proved that the men who were victorious in the regatta contests were not of that muscular class so deprecated by the feeble and the prejudiced , but were men attending long and laborious college classes . There are , no doubt , short courses in the curriculum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who rowed in yesterday 's race is entered for at the least a four-years ' course . Aud it would ill become any college in the nineteenth century to pretend that men taking scientific courses do not stand on as high a level as those who give themselves to the classics . In fact , Mr. Julian Kennedy , the best oar of the Yale eight , and the bow oar , Mr. Westeott , were both outside of the academia course , one being devoted to the science course and the other being in the law school . It can not be denied , however , that the members of the Intercollegiate Association are quite sick of Cornell , and that the body will tall to pieces to get rid of these unscrapulous victors . Still , in carefully weighing the facts , it does seem as if these frequent victories were duo rather to the , science of Ostrom than to the muscles of his stout men . THE NEW ASSOCIATION . The regatta of 1876 therefore closed with every event won by Cornell , a conclusion highly honorable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new association which is about to rise from the ashes of the Inter-Collegiate , . Cornell will not be excluded , for it is notorious that Cornell is. the bugaboo that scared Yale from the contest . The Yale men do not heeltate to say that the advantages of Cornell are so great that no other crew stand any chance with them . And yet Harvard rowed them gloriously , and made them show their beet work on the last mile , surprising everybody by the splendid . turn of speed they exhibited themselves at the wind up . Still it can not be denied that the remarkable and altogether shameless conduct of Cornell in making a clean sweep of everything in the Centennial regatta is an excellent proof of the , sagacity of Yale in leaving the assomatioa , and thus avoiding inevitable defeat . New York is sorry that her colleges will row FO famously that the New-Englanders have no other alternative to escape defeat than fleeing from the encounter . But this new college will do it , and if the association is maintained , will . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the children of the East are very wise , in smashing the association so as to escape certain defeat . We are sorry . We apologize to Harvard and Yale for the intemperate conduct of young Cornell , that would not be Weisfied with anything short of all the flags , and qwq acknowledged . the recognition by bowing their heads , and the Captain threw up his hand without staying his stroke . The Referee 's boat now came up and announced the time , which was felt to be very satisfactory . It should be owned , however , that the public did not get very excited , and everybody remained comfortably in his or her seat , for the next event , the s sutler 's race . The Referee had announced that he was going up to start the men as soon as they could be got into line , and so every one possessed his soul in patience and waited for the moving of the sienal flats . THE SCULLER 'S IIACE . Entered for the sculler 's race were Danforth , of Harvard ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Parmlee , of Princeton . Francis was greatly the favorite , and . the enthusiastic Cornell men began to believe they were going to carry off all the honors . The signal flag went up at 11:40 o'clock , but the public , took it very quietly . There was no roar of " They 're off ! " and no thunder of many voices . In fact , the first sign of interest was given by the Cornell men . who began to shout their college cry when the signal flag went up that Cornell was leading , with Princeton second . Up went the second signal , Cornell still leading , Harvard second , Princeton third . Again the signal went up , Cornell leading , Harvard second still . The boys began to speak from both colleges , and to cheer their men , the Harvard men shouting with all their might and the Cornell men yelling like demons . Danforth , of Harvard , rowed splenfidly , but , as had been foreshadowed from the commencement , bad no chance with Francis . ' who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on this occasion fairly excelled himself , crossing the finish line in 13m. ** not quite four seconds more than Courtney 's famous time . Harvard 's man dame in to the finish in 13m. 56s. , Princeton 's and . Weeks were fairly beaten off , and came in almost together  --  Parmlee in 14m. 21s. and Weeks in 14m. 22343 . PREPARING THE FRESHMEN . ' There had been much more excitement over this race than over the grand event , but afterward , when the referee went back in his boat to start the Freshmen. many personsleft thescene , Still there was a goodly company remaining , and the Columbia belles , in spite of the bad fortune of their friends , stuck faithfully to their places , awaiting , perhaps , the last chance of victory . Some dissatisfaetion was expressed at the thoughtlessness of the Union crow , who in their exceedingly light costume came upon the trend stand and made a little parade . They had done so exceedingly well its the race that the ladies forgave their apparent disregard of the scantiness of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get the crews into line , anti the contemplation of the ladies was rectified from the stalwart limbs of the Union men to the prospects of another race . In ten minutes more the second gun was fired , but tee the flag did not go up we were left hi a state of pleasing uncertainty as to whether the crews had started or were still motionless oe the water , waiting for the word . It was now very hot , and the ice-water men drove an exceedingly brisk business . A third gun was fired , and the flag went up this time at 12:32 , and the Columbia and Ilatvard boys began to cheer immediately , probably to get themselves in practice . The first signal displayed showed that Harvard was leading , and Cornell second . The second signal was forestalled by the quick eves of the Ithaca boys , for before the flags went up they had descried that the Cornell bops had spurted and taken the load , whereupon they yelled as the Cornell boys only Call yell . By this time the boats were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Cornell had a commanding read and that the Harvard men were rutrowed , although going with splendid pluck and persistency . But the question naturally arose , " Where is Columbia 1 " and to this no one could give any answer . Its position had not been signaled , and the sharpest eyes and the best field-glasses were alike powerless to discover the missing crew . On came Cornell , rowing well within themselves , but making the boat go through the water like a thing of life . They were on the outside and Harvard was on the inside , but their lead was so commanding that even the most unskilled could net fail to see that they were several lengths ahead . It was intensely hot , and there surely was an airy something overhead sending down . invisible flames that baked and broiled the hapless , beings below . But the two crews contesting the race seemed unconscious of any special heat , read were rowing toward the end with as much life as if they had lust started . Still the weight and mettle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have expected a Dan : 1 of the anlendideethe really magnificent=rowe regatta next year in some place aud at some time , but but all that has been known hitherto as the Intercollegiate Regatta is about to suf. for a sea change into something noteo strange , GA R. THE WARNING GUN . There was by no means that disappointment over the fiasco of Tuesday among , the public that might have been expected , , neither Was there any extraordinary alacrity in turning out the tollowieg morning . Along the road to the lake the long line of carriages was in open column , and pedestrians were exceedingly rare . The premonitory gun , warning the university boats to get into line fort-the great event of the regatta , was promptly fired at 9:45 o'clock . At that time the sky and water were alike perfect , and reminded the veteran regatta-goer of the great race of 1874 , when Columbia gained the coveted triumph . On that occasion there had been repeated postponements , and the public were considerably out of temper ; but such was the interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued disappointments , when the first gun was fired the grand stand was a brilliant , mass of gorgeous regatta costumes , and the number . of spectators was exceedingly great . Now , in spite of ' the fact that the victors of 1874 and , 1875 were pitted against each other , the excitement was so languid and feeble that the reserved part of the grand stand , shaded from tho sun 's heat , was only one-third filled , and the uncovered seats were a mere skeleton of empty boarline . Also . the display of boats upon the route was exceedingly meagre . In fact in this , particular Saratoga could scarcely compare Springfield . By 10 o'clock , however , the boys from ' the different colleges bea-an to arrive en masse , and as they bore with them the banners which they loved , this helped to enliven the scone , and acted as a stimulant to the flagging interest of the crowd . There was much merriment over the shrewdness of some of the Cornell men , who had extemporized banners of the carnelian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stars . Of regatta costumes there were none save those presented by the friends of Columbia .. It is true that there wore Harvard ladies who were rich in ribbons , and here and them a fair one whose breast knots showed her preference . But of regatta costumes the , eyes of the most observant could discover only such as were variations of blue and white . The Columbia boys . perched on the north end of the stand , rewarded all the ladies who bad such good taste by giving them three cheers and the college war cry of C-O-L-U-M-B-I-A . In fact , Columbia made all the stir , furnished all the fun and the frolic , brought almost all the crowd , and upon their Atlantean shoulders supported all those elements of the regatta which are usually observed from the grand stand . At about 10 o'clock the barges of the principal hotels were towed up by a little steamer and placed in position on the other side of the finish , an admirable locality , which enabled them to see everything without impeding the vision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same in which Dom Pedro and the Empress took an excursion , ranged alongside . Accessions of strength were constantly being made to the stand , and by 10:30 o'clock two things were plainly apparent . The first was that the iron resolution of Mr. Blaikie to start the boats precisely at 10 o'clock had gone the way of most iron resolutions in hot weather , and had been melted . The second was that the public had relented about the regatta atter all , and had turned out in very respectable numbers , that is , comparatively speaking , because even when the main current of arrivals had degenerated into thin driblets , the covered part of the grand stand was not entirely full , and the uncovered part was only thickly populated in the neighborhood of the Columbia and Cornell banners . Thera was no band to aileviite the tedium of a lingering wait , the state of the finances forbidding any such pleasing extravagance . This was another out of the many indications that Saratoga-was tired of the grand Intercollegiate Regatta , and that those who steered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is to be hoped that the new association of rowing colleges which is to be formed will be adamantine on the point , of not allowing themselves to be made an attractive feature . It they can resist perhaps they may have a long lease of life , but it they yield they will have the same fate as this which is now moribund . " NOW THEY ARE OFF . " At 11:35 the flag signaling the start flew up to the top of the pole , and this was greeted by ' rails from Harvard and counter cheers from Cornell ; the young Columbians being silent for a wonder . Probably their hearts wore in their mouths from excitement and prevented any vociferation . The first half mile was rowed very fast , for in a very short time up went the signal . flags , Cornell first , Columbia second , demoniac yell from the Cornelis , but strange to say , there was a general obeer from all the colloges , At the ** signaling Columbia was flagged as loading , and Harvard as second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cornell was first , Harvard second , Columbia third . The boats were now plainly visible , Cornell spurting in the erandest style , but Harvard sticking to them in the most manly way , Columbia seemed to be in some trouble from bad steering , for the bow oar struck against a buoy , and got locked with the oar of the man next to him . This , however , did not change the result , for the Cornelis came on Stronger and stronger . Oatrom 's determined stroke and queer throwing back of the head being a prominent feature in the boat , Four of them rowed in bathing straw hats , which gave them an odd appearance , but they were full of lite and vigor as they neared the finish , and seemed to be as strong as when they started . Columbia was evidently beaten off , and no boat was near the winners save Harvard , and they were but a little more than a boat length off . The plucky Unions wore rowing capitally , but were about three lengths behind Columbia . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought up the rear in a lamentable fashion . The winning crow pulled past the finish amid uproarious cheering from everybody , and then the second boat , Harvard , was lustily cheered . The others came in like a , dropping fire . Tins was the exact order of the finish : MIER RING THE OARSMEN . The Cornell demonstrations were as vigorous as could be wished , but everybody felt sorry that there were not more Harvard men to cheer the crew that had rowed so magnificent a race . The Columbia fellows cheered their crew generously , to which they responded , shouting their war cry from the boat as they leaned on their oars and took a rest after the pull . But every CORNELL 'S TRIPLE VICTORY . ing of the young Haryarde they ( crossed ' the finish line in 17m. ft31/2s. , several boat lengths ahead of Harvard. , who ' ores:sad leis same line , according to the referee , in 17m . 38s , But as they were hardly three lengths behind , 1 can hardly believe that this time correct , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least five weenie .
