txt What is the annual cost of our State Government to the tax-payers ? This question we shall endeavor to answer from the official statements contained in the Controller 's reports . In the first place , we leave out the tax for the schools . The money produced by this tax is distributed to the several counties , and by them expended . For a number of years the tax has been one and a quarter mills on each dollar of valuation , the sum produced increasing , as it should , with the growth of the State in wealth and population . We also omit the taxes for the sinking funds to extinguish the bounty  --  debt and one of the minor canal loans . These debts were made years ago , and will cease to exist before the end of next year . In the third place , we take no account of the ordinary repairs of the canals , including cost of superintendence and toll collection , the expenditures for these purposes being paid out of the receipts from tolls . Finally , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from auction duties , salt duties , State prison earnings , fees paid to State officers , the cost of the Bank and Insurance Departments , and that of the State Engineer 's office on account of railroads , ( these items being refunded by the corporations supervised , ) and a few other items of income of trifling importance . We include the expenditures for new work and extraordinary repairs on the canals , these being provided for by taxation . The result for the last four fiscal years , ending with the month of September , is as follows : deleted table If we deduct from the expenditures of 1872 the sums paid on account of appropriations for Orphan Asylums , Homes for the Friendless , parochial schools , &c.,; made by the Tweed Legisla tura of 1871 , a mounting to $895,342 75 in all , we shall have a total net expenditure for 1872 of $6,162,042 46 . In a memorandum to the Legislature , accompanying his veto of Assembly bill No. 274 , Gov . TILDEN made the following claim : SUURCES OP ECONOMIES CAUSING . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as compared witb 1874 ? allowing for the excess of the appropriation for schools of $276,869 , and the loan of $200.009 to the Commissioners of Emigration  --  is $7,936,155. 0 : that sum $1 , - 12.830 is in the diminished parrnents on debt . All the residue , 66,223,325 , is in real economies . The truth is that the entire expenditures of the State Government , exclusive of the apportionment of the school tax , the payments on account of debts , and the ordinary canal expenditures , including toll collection and superintendence , which are paid from canal tolls , were only $6,249,384 92 . Of these expenditures no less than $803,389 24 were paid from the ordinary revenues . of the general fund , which embraces , as above noted , the State prison earnings , auction duty , salt duty , fees of the various departments , and a variety of smaller items . It is a plain contradiction to claim to have saved $6,223,325 for the tax-payers in comparison with the year 1874 , when the total payments of that year , at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school money , amount only to $5.445,996 . We are dealing in perfect fairness with Gov . TILDEN 'S claim . We exclude the school tax because it merely runs in and out of the State Treasury . That tax , as the Governor is forced to admit , is $276,869 larger this year than it was in 1874 . We take no account of the ordinary canal repairs , because they are paid out of the canal tolls , and whatever surplus remains will be required for the canal debts . The tax-payers will get no relief from this source , we fear , for many years to come . They certainly will not this year , with the gross revenue from tolls less than it has been at any time ibr more than forty years . The Governor lays claim to " real economies " of $6,223,325 outside of the increased school tax and the diminished payments on account of debts and sinking funds . We also exclude schools , debts , and sinking funds . We are comparing exactly the saute things . He , by an artful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those items of expenditure which amounted , all told , to but 0,249,385 in 1874 , and of which $803,389 were provided for by revenue not derived from taxes ! On the whole , we consider the " iammoranduin " of the Governor accompanying the veto of Assembly bill No. 274 as a most remarkable document . Nevertheless we must stick to our belief that a slice of bread can not be greater than the whole loaf .
