txt Ohio Democrats have a standing invitation to the Greenbackers to join them , and , by making a common cause , insuring for it local success . " Why stand aloof , " they ask , " when our financial purposes are substantially identical I Why expose us to the probability of defeat , when by helping us you may give to our common principles the prestige of victory ? " The appeal , at once plausible and persistent , has evidently produced an impression on the Cincinnati Commercial , which proposes to apply to national concerns the tactics urged by its Democratic contemporary . " It is not worth while to be too sensitive about small matters , " is the appropriate remark with which the Commercia ' attempts to excuse its method of capturing the Speakership of the House of Representatives . That method is characteristic . " The Republicans , " we are told , " should aid the Greenback faction in the House to organize that body , in order to disorganize the Democratic Party . " Mr. KELLEY is suggested as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if the Greenbackers will make him their candidate . To clinch the matter , the Commercial reiterates its counsel to " give the Greenbackers a chance , " on the ground that " they ; will take just enough strength from the Democratic Party to ruin it . " Of the two Ohio plans for dealing with the Greenbackers , then , that urged upon Republicans is a shade the worse . The Enquirer does stand by its party : Greenbaekers must go to Democrats , not Democrats to Greenbackers . The Commercial , on the contrary , would have the Republicans in Congress go bodily over to the handful of Greenback Representatives , with the lofty purpose of circumventing the Democrats in the organization of the . House . At this moment , the proposal seems to be superfluous . If any dependence can be placed on the news from Washington , the Greenback faction knows where its natural affinities may be most reasonably sought . It is drifting toward the Democratic Party , with something like a certainty that a bargain will in due season be concluded . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Greenbackers are shrewd enough to know that they are more likely to obtain satisfactory terms from a party whose recent record is decisive as to its financial tendencies , than from the Republican Party . All their talk about the balance of power has been intended to advertise a willingness to negotiate ; and the narrow majority of the Democrats has in turn predisposed them to secure the co-operation of the dozen votes , or thereabouts , representing the third party . There is a great deal of nonsense generally in the balance of power doctrine ; but whatever reality is in it may , in this instance , be expected to inure to the benefit of the Democrats . They only can negotiate with Greenbackers without doing violence to their policy , as formally set forth in the House . They are not incumbered with Scruplos of any kind . And having entered upon a reckless policy , they are not likely to , haggle about stipulations when votes are available that will make them indifferent to any probable contin-d. gency . It is just possible , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afford openings for intrigue , which over-zealous partisans will be disposed to turn to account . The plan promulgated by tho Cincinnati Commercial is adapted to the average cunning and conscience of this class . " Anything to embarrass or damage the other side " is one of their favorite maxims . The idea of winning a point or two in the game of organizing the House would be to them irresistible . Should the absence of a trio of Democrats invest the Greenback faction with the influence it aspires to , these persons will be quite prepared to talk business on the basis laid down by the Ohio oracle . " Give the Greenbackers chance , " they will say , " in order to disorganize the Democratic Party . " Surely the proposition is too infamous to be entertained by any considerable number of Republicans , however tempting the opportunity presented . No emergency is conceivable that would justify them in entering into the relationship suggested , or any relationship involving aid and comfort to the enemies of the financial policy which the Republican Party upholds . Tho Greenbackers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concealment of their objects . Any bargain they enter : into will exact the furtherance of these objects , in. , one way or another , in exchange for votes on other questions . To this extent the Greenbackers are honest . But the concession they require is one which the Republican Party can not under any circumstances entertain . We are not prescribing for it an ideal standard of duty . We merely remind the advocates of bargaining that the party is bound by its principles , by its record , by the policy of which the Resumption act is an inadequate expression , to resist the measures of the Greenbackers ' and their friends , the soft-money Democrats . If there must be bargaining , let the Democrats monopolize it . The Republican Party would commit suicide if it abandoned an inch of the ground it occupies " in order to , disorganize the Democracy . " To " give the Greenbackers a chance , " it must endanger resumption , tamper with the public credit , and heap disasters on the community . Tactics of this sort are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disgraceful anywhere , and their adoption by the Republican Party in Congress ,  --  or the adoption of anything tending to help the faction whose policy leads to financial disorganization , ? would reduce the party to the Democratic level . At the proper time , mid in the proper sphere , there will be no lack of room for honest effort to break down the Democratic Party . For such effort the organization of the House is not a proper occasion . Indeed , we can not imagine a greater misfortune for the Republican Party than the occurrence of an accident that would deprive the other , party of the full benefit of the control which in a full House it will possess . With the power it must take the responsibility . Meanwhile , the duty of Republicans is too clear to be mistaken . And if they will but remain true to their principles and themselves , leaving the majority to their devices andithe Greenback faction to its fate , they will do infinitely more for their party than could be done by any other course .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
