ARTICLE IV. - NATURAL LAW , AND SPIRITUAL AGENCY . THROUGH the influence of that phase of scientific thought known as the New Philosophy , it is becoming the fashion to speak of everything as coming about by the operation of law ; as if having traced anything back to one or more of those constant forces which we term laws of nature , as its " proximate cause , " we had attained the limit of scientific inquiry concerning it , and were by some inherent necessity precluded from supposing a personal or spiritual agency in the case This is by no means a new doctrine , but whereas it was once held subject to grave doubts , owing to the imperfect and uncertain knowledge which men had of that Nature in which they sought to discover the origin of things , now we are told it stands immovably fixed upon that epitome of science the Correlation and Conservation of Force . Prof. Tyndall , in his Fragments of &amp;ience for Unscientific People , says , in expounding this law : " And why should a perpetual motion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer to this question is the statement of that great generalization of modern science , which is known under the name of the Conservation of Energy . This principle asserts that no power can make its appearance in nature without an equivalent expenditure of some other power ; that natural agents are so related to each other as to be mutually convertible , but that no new agency is created . Light runs into heat , heat into electricity , electricity into magnetism , magnetism into mechanical force , and mechanical force again into heat and light . The Proteus changes , but he is ever the same ; and his changes in Nature , supposing no miracle to supervene , are the ewpression , not of spontaneity but of physical necessity . " ( p. 38 . ) And in the same connection , continuing the argument , he says : " In the application of law in Nature , the terms great and small are unknown . Thus the principle referred to teaches us that the Italian wind gliding over the crest of the Matterhorn is as // firmly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun ; and that the fall of its vapor into clouds is exactly as much a matter of necessity as the return of the seasons . The dispersion , therefore , of the slightest mist by the special volition of the Eternal , would be as much a miracle as the rolling of the iRhone over the G-rimsel precipices and down Haslithal to Brientz. " ( p. 39 . ) And from such an argument the conclusion is natural , " that without a disturbance of natural law quite as serious as the stoppage of an eclipse , or the rolling of the waters of the St. Lawrence up the Falls of Niagara , no act of humiliation , individual or national , could call one shower from heaveii , or deflect towards us a single beam of the sun . " ( p. 39 . ) Accordingly , on the following page he says : " Granting the power of free will in man so strongly claimed by Prof. Mansel , and assuming the efficacy of free prayer to produce changes in external Nature , it necessarily follows that natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's volition , and no conclusion founded on the permanency of those laws would be worthy of confidence . " And it is noted as a " wholesome sign for England that she numbers among her clergy men wise enough to understand all this , and courageous enough to act up to their knowledge . " ( p. 40 . ) Extending this conception of law , again , into the facts of organic existence ( where , indeed , it must lead us if we adopt it ) , he says , speaking of the formation of a grain of corn : " We have in succession the bud , the stalk , the ear , the full corn in the ear ; the cycle of molecular action being completed by the production of grains similar to that with which the process began . Now there is nothing in this process which necessarily eludes the conceptive or imagining power of the purely human mind . An intellect the same in kind as our own would , if only sufilciently expanded , be able to follow the whole process from beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its position by the specific attractions and repulsions exerted between it and other molecules , the whole process and its consummation being an instance of the play of molecular force . Given the grain and its environment , the purely human intellect might , if sufficiently expanded , trace out a priori every step // of the process of growth , and by the application of purely mechanical principles , demonstrate that the cycle must end , as it is seen to end , in the reproduction of forms like that with which it began . A similar necessity rules here to that which rules the planets in their circuits round the sun . " ( pp. 114-117 . ) Supposing the view of nature set forth in these passages to be the true one , we should be compelled to conclude , with Prof. Tyndali , that " it ought to be known and avowed that the physical philosopher as such must be a pure materialist . " For there would be no room to doubt that " his inquiries deal with matter and force , and with them alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to investigate , is necessary action , not spontaneous action . " ( p. 92 . ) Neither are these the views of Prof. Tyndall alone , but they are the legitimate and inevitable result of what are assumed to be the materialistic tendencies of modern science , and appear with equal distinctness in the works of other writers . For example , Prof. Huxley says : " I have endeavored in the first part of this discourse to give you a conception of the direction towards which modern physiology is tending ; and I ask you what is the difference between the conception of life as the product of a certain disposition of material molecules and the old notion of an archaeus governing and directing blind matter within each living body , except this-that here as elsewhere matter and law have devoured spirit and spontaneity ? And as surely as every future grows out of past and present , so will the physiology of the future gradually extend the realm of matter and law , until it is co-extensive with knowledge , with feeling , and with action . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 87 . ) Mr. Herbert Spencer . too , in his hypothesis of Evolution , assumes to find in matter and the necessary interaction of its inherent forces a sufficient means of accounting for all the works of nature , including life and mind , with all their phenomena . In his own words : " Given the persistence of Force , and given the various derivative laws of Force , and there has to be shown , not only how the actual existences of the inorganic world necessarily exhibit the traits they do , but how there necessarily result the more numerous and involved traits , exhibited by organic and superorganic existences-how // an organism is evolved ? what is the genesis of human intelligence ? whence social progress arises ? " ( First Principles , 555 . ) That these views are in themselves a denial of the immediate personal agency of God in nature , on the ground that nothing takes place except by the spontaneous action of matter and force , is sufficiently set forth in the passages quoted : but whether they really constitute an era @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are compelled , as those who advocate them claim that we are , to abandon our belief in a personal God , and in a spiritual agency in material nature , and so to give up the groundwork of the Christian faith , by confessing that Christ and a divine revelation were impossible ; in short , whether we are compelled by them to conclude with a distinguished writer , that " Faith is bankrupt , and Science is called to administer her effects , " is a question which we shall be better able to decide when we clearly understand the true relation of natural law to the works of nature . Withthis end in view , it is the purpose of this Article , bearing in mind Prof. Tyndall 's assurance that " in the application of law in Nature the terms great and small are unknown , " to review some of the more familiar principles of science in the light of some of the facts of our common experience-facts so common as not to be easily misunderstood . The question to be inquired into is as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be found in matter and its laws ; while we say that it is in mind , by the power of thought and will . What , then , is the testimony of Nature ? When a tea-kettle boils it is necessarily by the act of a being possessed of intelligence and will ; for without the exercise of these , it could neither have been filled with water nor placed over the fire ; neither could there have been a tea-kettle , nor the fire over which it is placed . Then it is a voluntary action . But when the steam from its spout rises into the air , it becomes a part of the clouds and augments by so much the fall of rain . Thus the will of man may be , at least in part , the cause of rain . But we have been told by men of science , nobody can say how often , that men may cause an entire fall of rain by the burning of a forest , or a city , or by the cannonading of a battle ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Natural Law , and kSpiritaal Agency . Oct. , age annual fall of rain by clearing away forests , or draining swamps , or by bringing wild lands under cultivation . Man may thus cause the very phenomenon to which Prof. Tyndall 's argument relates . Is it the voice of science then or of some other divinity with which he speaks when he denies to God a power in nature which it is impossible to deny to man ? But when the rain in question falls , the artificially evaporated water in part composing it , does not change its character as being a natural phenomenon , for it is as completely a work of natural law as if no human agency had found a place among the causes which produced it , and it had been evaporated entirely by the heat of the sun . For science teaches , to use the language of Prof. Tyndall , that " here , as elsewhere throughout Nature , if matter moves it is force that moves it . " ( p. 86 . ) And the Correlation and Conservation of Force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is exactly equal in quantity to the force which produced it . ii ; then , every motion of matter is the work of an exactly equivalent force , it is impossible to separate phenomena into different classes on account of any difference in their relations to natural law , and say that one is natural and the other artificiaL For so far as natural law is concerned there is no such difference between them ; and they are in every conceivable sense of the term absolutely alike . And if all our knowledge of phenomena consists , as our materialistic friends affirm that it does , of a knowledge of their relations to natural law , it becomes necessary for them to admit that every motion of matter is a natural phenomenon . Then the artificial evaporation of water is a work of nature , and there is no reason why we should say , on account of it , that the rain is not a completely natural phenomenon . But the evaporation of a part of the rain in the tea-kettle , which is thus seen to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had its origin , not in matter , nor in any of its laws , but in mind . Thus artificial , and what we call natural causes , may be jointly concerned in the production of a phenomenon , without lessening the fact that it is purely a work of natural law ; and the phenomenon itself may be wholly the work of mind and at the same time wholly the work of natural law . If then we find that the boiling of the tea-kettle is wholly the work of // natural law , it is because it was wholly dependent upon the forces of nature for its occurrence ; and if it is , at the same time , wholly the work of mind , it is because the forces of nature , which can do any conceivable thing at the bidding of mind , can do nothing of themselves . What we call natural causes , then , have precisely as much to do with artificial as with natural phenomena , and there is no agency which could be attributed to them , which they do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet they are not the cause of them , inasmuch as we know that so far as the forces are concerned , they do not act of themselves , but as the servants of mind . If then an absolute dependence upon natural law may co-exist in the same phenomenon , with an equal dependence upon voluntary agency , who shall say that the uniformity of law is opposed to volition ? It being established that there is a spiritual agency in those human actions which involve changes in the condition of matter , it becomes necessary for the believers in materialism to find somewhere among the laws of nature , something which wi/i permit the admission of the fact , without at the same time compelling the admission of it with respect to every motion of matter : for it is evident that materialism explains nothing with respect to which it does riot enable us to dispense with spiritual agency . Let these men , then , who are acquainted with nature and can speak understandingly of her laws , instruct us in this matter by showing us what it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which they do not do in the works of man ; let them explain to us how we may rationally admit what we know of a spiritual agency in one , and deny it in the other . If the sphere of law may be completely filled without in the least abating the necessity for the interposition of mind , by what authority is it said , that Matter and Law , have devoured Spirit and Spontaneity ? But it is held to be on account of a certain necessity inhering in the operation of natural laws , that it is opposed to voluntary action . If the force be permanent the phenomena are necessary ( p. 64 ) , says Prof. Tyndall ; and again he opposes the necessity of law to the spontaneity of mind ( p. 92 ) ; and in still another passage : " And unless the existence of law in these matters be denied and the element of caprice introduced , we // must conclude that , given the relations of any molecule of the body to its environment , its position in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) The proposition in the latter form is much as if we should say , forgetting the office of the rudder and the minds of the pilot and the captain , that with a sufficient knowledge of the engine and the sea we could predict the destination of the ship . But in whatever form it is stated , it is clear that it is a necessary part of the system of materialism and equally clear that it is utterly untenable . In a passage already quoted ( p. 39 ) it is held by authority of this conception of the reign of law in nature , that for God to send rain or fair weather by the exercise of his will , would involve the creation of force and would therefore be a miracle . The meaning of the proposition , when rendered into plain language , is neither more nor less than this : to do anything is to create the force involved in the act , and its correlate is that to make anything is to create the matter composing it . To make a house , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no less than the force which brings them together . It would be a waste of time to refute so utterly groundless a proposition , except for the fact that the advocates of Materialism rely so implicitly upon its soundness . According to the doctrine of the passage quoted , Mr. Spencer , assuming that all phenomena are the natural and necessary outcome of the " persistence of force , " speaks of " matter and force " as manifestations to us of an unknowable cause , as if having done this he had made a place in his system for the belief that God is the author of the works of Nature . Yet by his own showing , the eternal existence of matter and force in the past is as legitimate a conclusion from his argument as their continued existence in the future , which he terms their persistence . ( See First Princ*ples , p. 182 , * 543 . ) If , then , the phenomena of organic and superorganic existences necessarily result from the persistence of force , the belief in a first cause outside of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any way distinct from them , is only alternative to the belief that matter and force are self-existent from eternity , of which Mr. Spencer thinks that his argument proves the contrary to be inconceivable . But slender as the necessity is which arises from Mr. // Spencer 's argument for supposing " the unknowable cause , " how does it affect the case if we suppose it proven , according to the argument , as the cause only of the existence of matter and force ? We still find that matter and force are independent , as they were in the other case , and , being in existence no matter how , have it in them to be the cause of whatever takes place in nature . Supposing matter and force to pe*sist  --  to be indestructible-how is the case changed if we drop out the unknowable cause ? All phenomena resulted necessarily from the persistence of these prime factors of the case before , why shall they not result from the same persistence now ? Manifestly the suppositiou of the unknowable cause is already dropped out , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is folly to call that an acknowledgment of God which begins its argument with an attempt to demonstrate the utter uselessness of his existence . But having thus excluded God from his scheme of nature , except as to the original constitution of matter and force , he completes the circle of his argument by denying his personal existence . Having thus denied to God all present interest in the order of nature , it has been seen that as he might proceed to deny his existence in direct terms without changing the case in any way , so he has already , by a mere artifice of words , denied his existence while seeming to affirm it . Again , it is evident that to be the cause of the existence of matter and force , is not the same thing as to be the cause of those forms of existence which are derived from them . The creation of man , for example , did not imply the creation of either matter or force , neither would his destruction imply their destruction . The acceptance of Mr. Spencer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two antecedent propositions ; the one , that organic and superorganic existences could result from the exercise of powers conferred upon matter ; the other , that such changes in nature as we know , or at least some of them , do as a fact so occur . That neither of these propositions can be established will more fully appear by the way . But the force being permanent , Prof. Tyndall tells us , the phenomena are necessary , and the necessary action of natural law is opposed to the spontaneity of mind . What is meant by this is undoubtedly , that when rain falls it is as a necessary // effect of gravitation . But after a little while , the conditions being changed , the same law , by an equal necessity , causes it to rise again into the air . Is the force then not constant , or is Prof. Tyndall in error as to the alleged necessity ? For we see that whatever the necessity may be , we may know the law , without being able to say on account of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rain or dry weather . Again , as a ball rises into the air as a necessary effect of the force impelling it , a necessary effect of gravitation is to retard its motion ; but when the projecting force is exhausted , it is an equally necessary effect of gravitation to accelerate its progress towards the ground . Prof. Huxley scouts the idea of necessity , and says : " Fact I know and Law I know , but what is this Necessity save an empty shadow of my own mind 's throwing ? ( p. 89 . ) Yet , that the motions supposed are , under the circumstances prevailing at the time , necessary effects of the forces producing them , Prof. Huxley could not but admit . And that they , all of them , occur by transformations of force , Prof. Tyndall will not deny . Nevertheless they are caused not by any necessity inhering in the forces themselves , but by the conditions which determine what The forces shall do . A locomotive , too , moves as it does on account of necessities inhering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engineer chooses he may so change the positions of some of its parts relatively to each other , that it shall from an equal necessity move either faster or slower than it does , or in the opposite direction , or stop altogether . The necessity alleged is not in the laws of nature then , for they are seen to be utterly indifferent as to what they shall do or whether they shall do anything or not . It is in the conditions rather , by the establishment of which the particular actions which we attribute to laws are rendered necessary , and it is determined what they shall do . So while the laws of nature are constant and unvarying in their operation , the conditions which call them into play and control their activities are infinitely variable ; and it becomes possible to do an infinite diversity of things , not by changing the laws , as Prof. Tyndall supposes , but by varying the conditions . When , therefore , we conclude that forces do not act of themselves , but only at the bidding of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when he // truly says , that the tendency of forces is to equilibrium . ( Spont . Generation and ilypoth. of Phys . Units . ) Equilibrium is rest , and a tendency to rest can not easily be construed into a power of motion . And when we say that the order of events is determined , not by the uniformity of law , but by some power having control of the conditions which render the forces of nature active , we only admit what we must do , if we interpret the law of correlation according to the facts of human experience . Prof. Tyndall discloses another aspect of the materialistic conception of the prevalence of law in nature when , in bespeaking our toleration for the hypothesis of Evolution , he says : " For what are the core and essence of this hypothesis ? Strip it naked and you stand face to face with the notion that not alone the more ignoble forms of animalcular or animal life , not alone the nobler forms of the horse and lion , not alone the exquisite and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human mind itself-emotion , intellect , will , and all their phenomena , were once latent in a fiery cloud . Surely the mere statement of such a notion is more than a refutation . But the hypothesis would probably go even further than this . Many who hold it would probably assent to the position , that at the present moment all our philosophy , all our poetry , all our science , and all our art-Plato , Shakespeare , Newton , Raphael - are potential in the fires of the sun . " In the hypothesis of Evolution , then , to discover that a thing was once latent somewhere in nature , or that it was potential in something , is somehow the same as to have discovered the cause of its present existence . But a house is one of the things which may be made out of wood ; it is therefore potential in wood . And it may also be made by the use of force ; thus it is potential also in force . Nevertheless , a little philosophical reflection shows , that if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potential only , it might remain potential in matter and force alone through an endless succession of geological epochs , without suggesting even a potentiality of becoming an actual house . If it could be proven , then , that " mind , emotion , will , and all their phenomena , were once latent in a fiery cloud , " we should still be as far as we were before from knowing how they came to be the facts which we know them to be . Latent then , why // are they not latent now ? like the infinity of other things which being potential only are no less potential now , but are likely to remain forever latent . Substituting for the heat of the sun or our fiery cloud a heap of coal , in which a great number of industries lie latent in the form of potential heat , we might know the fact , without involving a knowledge of the actual cooking , or house warming , or spinning , or forging , or journeying by land or sea , in which it will sometime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conscious effort of thought that it could never bear a part in any of them in any other capacity than as a servant of mind . Essential , therefore , as the conception may be , as a part of the materialistic philosophy , we might admit its truth , without making any real progress towards the materialistic conclusion . The question would still remain as it was before , How came these things to be as they are ? Is it the work of mind or matter ? Evolution , as expounded by Mr. Spencer , answers that it is the work of matter and its forces . But that the potentialities of matter and force form a sufficient groundwork for the answer , is a proposition to the admission of which we shall never be able to see our way , until we find that all the good things have come to pass which might have been . It will be observed that the argument of materialism at this point , as well as at every other , claims to be an outgrowth of the Correlation and Conservation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought by the " combination and resolution of the ideas of matter and force . " By a primary necessity of the case , therefore , it affirms a correlation of vital and mental with physical forces . Consequently , not only Prof. Tyndall , but Prof Huxley , and Mr. Spencer , are strenuous in denying that we can know any radical distinction between mind and matter . Says Prof. Tyndall , in relation to this point : " These Evolution notions are absurd , monstrous , and fit only for the intellectual gibbet , in relation to the ideas concerning matter drilled into us while young . Spirit and matter have ever been presented to us in the rudest contrast , the one as all noble , the other as all vile . But is this correct ? " ( p. 160 . ) And again , speaking of the notion that life is the product of molecular action , he says : " If these statements startle , it is because // matter has been defined and maligned by philosophers and theologians who were equally unaware that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Huxley , too , conceiving it to be proven that all vital action may with propriety be said to be the result of molecular forces , says : " Arid if so it must be true , and in the same sense , and to the same extent , that the thoughts to which I am now giving utterance , and your thoughts regarding them , are the expression of molecular changes in that matter of life which is the source of our other vital phenomena . " ( p. 83 . ) A sufficient examination of the subject will show how inadequate a view of it these passages disclose . What then does correlation teach concerning it ? This cardinal doctrine of materialism can not be true unless all the actions of matter can be resolved into motions . According to it no motion arises except by the conversion of some other motion into it , and no motion disappears except by being transformed into some other motion . Accordingly both Mr. Spencer and Prof. Barker hold that correlation implies convertibility . ( First Prin. , p. 217 ; ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) If then the actions of the mind are not convertible into material motions , the case breaks down . But the convertibility of correlation implies that the correlated motion is converted out of that which caused it , and again into some other motion of which it thus becomes the cause . Suppose then we affirm that the motion of a locomotive is the act of a man ! The proposition is indubitable ; but it is not implied that it is the act of his body , but of his mind . If now it can be shown that the mental action which causes the motion is transformed into it , and causes it by a transformation into it , then there is a correlation of mental with physical forces . But on no other terms is the idea admissible for a moment Yet correlation teaches that the force concerned is not derived from mind , but from matter , by the combustion of fuel under the boiler . Then the actions of mind are not transformed into the actions of matter , and do not reappear in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the actions of mind are not converted into physical motions , neither are the motions of matter converted into thought . Yet Mr. Spencer tells us : " That no idea or feeling arises save as a result of some physical force expended in producing // it , is fast becoming a commonplace of science ; and whoever duly weighs the evidence will see that nothing but an overwhelming bias in favor of a preconceived theory can explain its non-acceptance . " If we duly weigh the evidence then , we shall end by admitting the truth of Mr. Spencer 's proposition . Let us see ! He is here speaking of a correlation , and a consequent convertibility of vital and mental with physical forces ; and his proposition is identical with saying , that when a book excites thought or feeling in the mind , it is by the expenditure of a physical force upon the mind . Thus by the terms of the law of correlation , it is by communicating some motion of its own to the mind of the reader ; and as it can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excite mental action must suffer a proportional diminution at each successive reading , and become exhausted at last like the motion of a top . Or if the motion is supposed to proceed from a force residing in the book , it must proceed from a centre through a distance , of which its intensity must be inversely as the square . This may not look exactly like the law by which a book acts upon the mind , but if there is a correlation of mental with physical forces , it does look like that , and we make bold to affirm that nothing less can satisfy the requirements of Mr. Spencer 's proposition . If it is what Mr. Spencer means , then he believes in the alleged correlation ; but otherwise , what does he mean ? And the case is no better if we consider any other mode of exciting mental action . For the thing to be accounted for is not some vague and objectless vibration of the substance of the brain , like the producing of a heated state in a piece of metal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force . But when thoughts are addressed to the mind through the ear by spoken words , or through the eye by writing , while the eye or the ear is affected by those vibrations which we call light or sound , the mind is affected only by the meaning . And as the sensations of sight and sound are alike impassible to that which alone affects the mind , so the mind is not excited to think as it does by light or sound , but only by the meaning with which they are invested by mind itself . Materialism can not maintain an existence as a system of thought unless it can show an identity of mind with matter // through a correlation of thought with material motions . But the entire effort to establish such an identity is estopped at the outset by the discovery to which the law of correlation itself leads the way , that mind and matter have two distinct and inconvertible modes of action . It is an insoluble mystery then how the implied conversion can take place , for the completely satisfactory reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it could take place . When Prof Huxley speaks of matter and law , therefore , as having devoured spirit and spontaneity , he might us well have said , on account of the impenetrability of matter , that our knowledge of matter tends to banish oihur belief in space . If we class the motions of the locomotive among human actions , it is because we see in them a use of natural means for the accomplishment of human purposes , and we know that it is man who uses these forces of nature as the servants of his thought and will . The materialistic denial of miracles is in itself an admission , that this subjection of matter to the dominion of mind is in the order of nature . For if nothing takes place out of the established order , we may at least have the benefit of believing that what does take place is a part of that order . Nevertheless Prof. Tyndall thinks that science teaches a doctrine different from that of our proposition , and that we can accomplish our purposes only by changing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the power of free will in man , and assuming the efficacy of free prayer to produce changes in external nature , it necessarily follows that natural laws are more or less at the mercy of man 's volition , and no conclusion founded on the assumed permanency of those laws would be worthy of confidence . " ( p. 40 . ) But we have in the locomotive an example of the way in which the forces of nature are evoked from their latent form ( the equilibrium of Mr. Spencer ) and made to do the will of mind . The physical energy which moves it is generated within itself , from the store of forces existing beforehand in external nature , and laid up in the wood or coal consumed under its boiler : and it is done in a manner precisely analogous to that in which the strength of our bodies is developed from the food we eat . When it moves itself and the train , therefore , the // motion is fully accounted for , under the law of Conservation , modicum for modicum , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supremacy of physical law is complete and renders its testimony to the fact , that the motion of the locomotive is a work of Nature in as complete a sense as that of a comet . But if the force which moves it is derived from the fire , it is not at the same time derived from some other source . Yet we see that when it moves , its motion is like the boiling of the teakettle , the creature of thought , and that it starts or stops , goes fast or slow , forward or back , doing great feats of strength and swiftness , precisely as if it were a part of the physical organization of the thinking being whose acts its motions have become . We have in it an example then of the way in which the powers of nature are made obedient to mind and will , without being emancipated from the dominion of law . A further examination will show , that the agency of mind in causing the motion is not of the nature of a physical action as defined by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case is done by the use of physical force* from the mining of the coal to the turning on of the steam . Yet thought imparts nothing beyond the condition of activity to any of these forces , for each of them is tracable to some material source . But mind is nevertheless , by this fact alone , the author of all the actions which we attribute to them ; and not one of these actions could occur without this intervention of an intelligent *cause . Yet neither the thought which canses them , nor the motions themselves , can be said to be connected by conservation with the motion of the train , for not one of them is to be found reproduced in it . They are all of them actions of which matter is incapable , and even the material motions concerned have no conceivable relation to the moving of a locomotive , except as that relation is established by mind , and exists , as it can only exist , in thought It is not even a relation of matter to matter , and does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have an existence apart from thought ; for drop any material factor out of the case , and mind can replace it ; but drop mind out , and the case itself disappears . And it matters not at what stage of it we dispense with mind , whether before the locomotive was invented , or as it stands upon the track with // steam up , and every capacity of a locomotive complete and perfect in it , the moment mind ceases to be a factor in it , its existence as a locomotive is as completely at an end as is that of a man who has become a corpse , and nothing would be added to the completeness of its destruction if it were reduced back into the original dust from which it was evolved by the power of thought . Mind is absolutely the cause of its existence ; and it is no less absolutely the cause of every one of its motions ; but it is not the cause of either the one or the other by virtue of any motion which is transferred from itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transfer takes place , inasmuch as all the motions concerned are known to proceed from some material source distinct from mind . What mind does in the case is to know the nature of matter and its forces , and by means of its knowledge of them , to devise and establish such relations between them , inventing the locomotive and constructing it , adapted in the formation and arrangement of its parts to be moved by steam , and afterwards bringing together the fuel and water , so as to render them the means of doing its will in moving the train While , then , the physical entity , which we call a locomotive , would not be deprived of its existence as a physical entity by the fact of being separated from mind , that is , would not part with its physical existence , yet that very existence was derived from mind , and could not have been derived from any other source ; and it could not have become the thing that it is , even through the agency of mind , except for the conscious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is : and as it could not have come into existence , except as mind was both the author and the end of its being , so it can not even be imagined to exist as a locomotive , that is , to have a power of moving from place to place , unless we can first suppose that there is a power in mind to move it . There must be a mind in it . Tts physical powers are neither greater nor less from the fact that mind is in it or not ; but when mind is in it , it has a power to move ; but such a power is otherwise inconceivable . It is seen then that the very process of thought by which the locomotive was brought out of nonentity into being , presupposes a power which could be superadded to those of matter - which not being of them was superior to them , and able to // make them the means of doing things of which they are of themselves incapable . It has been observed that the motions of the locomotive are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partake of the volitions of the engineer . It has been seen , too , that they are like them in the fact that when his mind is separated from the control of them they cease , and the locomotive becomes like an inanimate , lifeless body . That most wonderful of the works of man , the product of a thousand inventions , which was before instinct with life and motion in every part , with a power of self-continuance , is reduced in an instant to the helplessness of a rock . Mind , then , is a vital force in the locomotive , and by adding it or taking it away , we are enabled to determine the very point at which mind and matter come together in the production of vital phenomena . It may be as the scientists affirm , that not an action of the mind takes place without some accompanying physical affection of the vital apparatus , involving the expenditure of force . But as in the locomotive the pressure of steam in the boiler is only an instrument by the use of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the body are seen to be only the instruments by the use of which the mind causes the motions of the body . And there is the same reason to conclude that the heat in the boiler emanates from the mind of the engineer , from the fact that it is a manifestation to us of the action of his mind , as there is to infer from those flushes of heat in the body which accompany the actions of the mind , that animal heat is correlated with the vital force . But as the heat in the boiler might remain for . ever without diminution or abatement , without so much as raising a presumption of a power in it to move the locomotive , so it is seen that in whatever forms physical energy may accompany the actions of the mind , there does not arise even a presumption of a community of functions between mind and matter . If they were inseparable in experience they could not be confounded in the understanding ; but the locomotive enables us to separate them , and so to study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reuniting their functions in what is , for all the purposes of the argument , a single living being . // We find in vitality , then , no departure from that order of nature according to which mind is the real author of what matter seems to do ; but on the other hand , a striking example of it , as we do in the formation of rain . If we may believe Prof. Tyndall , " the physical philosopher as such must be a pure materialist ; " and Prof. Huxley tells us that : " If there is one thing clear about the progress of modern science , it isthe tendency to reduce all scientific problems , excepi* those which are purely mathematical , to questions of molecular physics-that is to say , to the attractions , repulsions , and co5rdination of the ultimate particles of matter . " ( p. 111 . ) But the boiling of the tea-kettle and the motion of the locomotive are clearly a legitimate subject of scientific inquiry . Suppose , then , we ask these masters in science to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the cause of them , by " the combination and resolution of the ideas of matter and force , " or by what means we may compress all of it into a " problem of molecular physics . " And this is no idle request , for we find that so far as we are at present instructed by science , we may exhaust every conceivable resource of molecular physics upon them , without reaching , or even approaching , the weightiest question of all concerning them . And Prof. Tyndall himself admits as much when in speaking of the ultimate cause of things , he says : " As far as I can see , there is no quality in the human intellect which is fit to be applied to the solution of the problem . It entirely transcends us. " ( p. 93 . ) Yet by some means or other we do know that these things have a cause which lies beyond those laws which materialism discourses to us about , and which , transcending matter and its laws , uses them to make these works of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is a piece of science , too , " which may be verified experimentally as often as we like to try . " Can Materialism deny the fact ; or can it tell us how to treat it as a question of the " interplay of matter and force ? " It has been said that the motion of the locomotive is like every other motion of matter , a natural phenomenon . The . authority for the statement is to be found in the law of correlation , which affirms that every motion of matter is the work of an exactly commensurate force , and that so far as a depend-* // ence of phenomena upon the laws of nature for their occurrence is concerned , there is an absolute uniformity in every department of nature 's work . The proposition is unassailable , unless it can be shown that natural phenomena are more completely the work of force or natural law than those which we call artificial . If materialists choose to deny it they are at liberty to do so , but they must at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon which their philosophical habitation can be made to stand . But whatever materialism may say , in such phenomena as we clearly understand , as we do the motion of the locomotive , we know that there is an intelligent cause without whose intervention the forces concerned could not have had any connection with their occurrence . Extending this rudiment of science into the interpretation of the larger facts of nature , we infer such a cause when we can not directly see it ; and such a cause being a necessary factor in such phenomena as are completely within our knowledge , let him show who can how it can be otherwise than necessary in those more difficult problems of science which surpass our immediate knowledge . But Mr. Spencer , in his hypothesis of Evolution , reason fling backward as it were , from the more occult to the more familiar facts of science , seeks to explain the origin of the works of nature , including man , by the self-instituted action of material forces , without the intervention of mind . " Some two years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the current expression Conservation of Force ; ' assigning as reasons , first , that the word conservation ' implies a conserver and an act of conserving , and second , that it does not imply the existence of the force before the particular manifestation of it with which we commenced . In place of conservation Prof. Huxley suggested persistence . This entirely meets the first of the two objections , " &amp;c . ( Note , First Prirt. , p. 185 . ) His exposition of the theory recognizes the fact , that Evolution could not be complete as a scheme of nature without being able to assimilate mind with material things , but it can not begin to be true unless it can first find a power in matter to move itself . Such a power Mr. Spencer accordingly assumes to find in those material forces which act under the law of the Correlation and Conservation of Force . // A system which thus begins at the top of its edifice to build downwards , reasoning from the unknown and the unknowable to that which is familiarly known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but that it is utterly opposed to science is shown , among other proofs , by what is involved in the doctrine of inertia . Some seeing the difficulty and interpreting the law of Correlation by the hypothesis of Evolution , have imagined a conflict between Correlation and Inertia ; and , seeking to untie the knot , have made haste to deny inertia in behalf of molecular motion . ( ATicholl ' 8 l ) ictionary of Physical Science , Art . inertia . ) The doctrine of Inertia implies , say they , that the natural condition of matter is that of absolute rest , whereas no particle of matter was ever known or even supposed to be in such a state of rest . Inertia , therefore , can not be true . Molecular Evolution , as has been said , can not begin to be true unless there is a power in matter to move itself . That there neither is nor can be such a power in matter , has been already shown from one point of view , in the fact , that none of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occur without the intervention of mind . That the same conclusion is rendered necessary by the impossibility of asserting a power in matter to move itself , will appear when it is seen what the doctrine of inertia really teaches . Suppose a body of matter then , as a ball , subject to all the molecular and other motions incident to matter . Whether there is only one or any conceivable number of these , does not affect the fact either one way or the other , that another motion may be imparted to it , say by throwing . Bnt before the act of throwing begins , the ball is , with respect to the motion about to be imparted to it , in a state of absolute rest , as much as if it neither had nor was capable of having any other motion but this one . Here , then , is the state of rest required by the idea of inertia , and the ball is necessarily inert with respect to a motion which does not yet exist . But when the motion begins the ball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it had no agency in producing it ; and while it continues it is inert with respect to it again from necessity , having no agency but a passive one in continuing it ; and when it comes to rest , // it is again inert from necessity with respect to a motion which no longer exists . Matter is necessarily inert , then , with respect to a motion which is imparted to it , for with respect to every such motion its natural condition is that of absolute rest ; and it remains only to show that all motions are imparted to matter , to render it certain that it is inert with respect to them all and incapable of moving except as it is moved by some power extraneous to itself The contrary supposition implies , that matter may move itself . But if it moves itself how can it be in any more intimate and perfect sense than that in which an animal body moves itself ? Yet if it carries a load , it is with a part of the same strength with which it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moves another , and while it does so , is forced also to move itself , and whether it moves itself or an extraneous load , it is done with strength derived from extraneous sources , as food and air . Then it is done under the law of conservation by the use of forces which existed beforehand in external nature , and in a manner in no respect differing from that in which a steam engine moves itself The motions of an animal body are then as much imparted to it as to the load which it carries . And , unless we resort , to the unscientific and irrational snpposition of a power of spontaneous motion in matter which correlation denies to living beings , there is no escape from the conclusion that all motions are imparted to matter and that it is inert with respect to them all . For matter is necessarily inert with respect to motions imparted to it , and while nothing less than life can enable us to assert for it a power to move itself , we see that life itself has not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be either affirmed or denied with respect to matter-may be either present or absent in it without affecting the case either one way or the other . Evolution could not begin its existence as a scheme of nature , without finding in matter a power to move itself , for the reason that its entire stock in trade consists of matter and force . This precludes it from attempting to explain anything except by " the combination and resolution of the ideas of matter and force . " But as its fundamental postulate , the law of the Correlation and Conservation of Force , teaches , // by a necessity of its existence , that all the actions of matter are resolvable into motions , and that matter can do anything only by communicating some motion of its own to other matter , it follows , that if we attribute anything to matter as its cause , it must be upon the supposition that it first originated the motion which it imparts . But correlation also teaches that force is like matter , indestructible . Then whatever powers matter may have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beginning of its existence . Yet inertia shows that matter could not be the recipient of such a gift-that it could not be made to move itself . And correlation agrees with inertia in showing that no motion of matter has its origin in the body affected by it , but arises from the transformation of some other motion into it . It is not a part of the system of Evolution to deny that there is a power somewhere in nature to originate phenomena . How could it be denied ? But it can not admit that it is to be found in mind , without rational suicide ; it seeks therefore to confer it upon matter-failing to discover it in the only quarter where it was ever known to be , and vainly imagining that it sees it where it could not possibly go . But the attempt ends , as the expedients of desperation sometimes will , in the very suicide which it seeks to avoid . In order to account for a power of derivative motion in living beings , which is all that Correlation will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of spontaneous motion in matter . Endeavoring to get upon its feet , the utmost it can do is to stand upon its head . For that is surely the reverse of evolution which , assuming to account for the higher forms of existence by progressive development from those which are lower , is forced to assume , to begin with , as the basis of what it calls Evolntion , a higher condition of existence in matter than that which it proposes to end with in organized beings . Neither is this our view alone : for both Mr. Spencer and Prof Tyndall unconsciously recognize the justness of it , the former when he speaks of mind as compared with matter as the " so-called higher , " and the latter when he deprecates the summary rejection of Evolution on the ground , not that it may rationally account for the origin of things from matter considered as the lowest form of existence , but rather // on the supposition that we may , if we will , regard its powers as equal to those of mind . He says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fit only for the intellectual gibbet , in relation to the ideas concerning matter which were drilled into us while young . Spirit and matter have ever been presented to us in the rudest contrast , the one as all noble , the other as all vile . But is this correct ? Does it represent what our mightiest spiritual teacher would call the Eternal Fact of the Universe ? Upon the answer to this question all depends . Supposing , instead of having the foregoing antithesis presented to our youthful minds , we had been taught to regard them as equally worthy and equally wonderful ; to consider them , in fact , as two opposite faces of the self-same mystery . Supposing that in youth we , had been impregnated with the notion of the poet Goethe , instead of the poet Young , looking at matter , not as brete matter ' but as the living garment of God ' : do you not think that under these altered circumstances , the law of Relativity might have had an outcome different from its present one ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these statements startle , it is because matter has been defined and maligned by philosopbers and theologians , who were equally unaware that it is at bottom essentially mystical and transcendentaL " ( p. 415 . ) And " without this total revolution of the notions now prevalent ( he tells us ) the Evoludon hypothesis must stand condemned . " And so it must , and there is not even a gleam of hope in the proposed alternative . If Evolution has nothing better to offer as an excuse for its existence than a hope of incorporating into the body of human knowledge an inversion of the nature of things , it may as well roll up its scroll and flit away into the region of the " Unknowable . " Science can not permit Evolution nor its parent Materialism to reverse that order of nature in which the common sense of mankind has always seen , and must always see whether it will or not , that there is behind every one of those phenomena which our common language attributes to material forces , an intelligent , thinking agency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for if in any case we fail to see such an agent , we know that it is what we fail to see and not what we see-our ignorance and not our knowledge of Nature-which makes it seem to be an exception to the rule . // Again , inertia is but the obverse side of correlation , and when we say that " matter moves only as it is moved , " we state a truth which lies at the very centre of both doctrines . Yet Evolution can not bring its great problem of the universe within the compass of its formula without eliminating one of its factors by denying inertia , while it is forbidden on pain of death to dispense with the troublesome element by the terms of the law of correlation upon which alone it can stand . It has been premised , that that mode of causation implied in Molecular Evolution ,  --  a causing of particular things to come to pass by means of conferring certain powers upon matter at its creation , is contrary to the nature of things and impossible . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It has been shown that no such mode of causation is known to our experience , and that it has on that account no legitimate place in science ; and again , from the considerations involved in the doctrine of inertia , which show that no such power could be conferred upon matter , but that , on the other hand , its absolute incapacity to do anything of itself is inseparable from the very idea of its existence . And the force of the first of these considerations is multiplied by infinity when we take into account the uniformity of Nature . If there are two modes of causation , there are two Natures ; and uniformity is a myth . Evolution must of necessity then assert such a duality of nature , or , on the other hand , deny causation by mind , and along with it the validity of experience . In further illustration of the errors of materialism concerning the idea of Causation , we quote again from Prof. Huxley . He says : " Let us suppose that knowledge is absolute and not relative , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which it really is . Let us suppose further , that we do know more of cause and effect than a certain definite order and succession among facts , and that we have a knowledge of the necessity of that succession ,  --  and hence of necessary laws ,  --  and III for my part do not see what escape there is from utter materialism and necessarianism . For it is obvious that our knowledge of what we call the material world is to begin with , at least , as certain and definite as that of the spiritual world , and that our acquaintance with law is of as old a date as our // knowledge of spontaneity . Further , T take it to be demonstrable , that it is utterly impossible to prove that anything whatever may not be the effect of a material and necessary cause , and that human logic is equally incompetent to prove that any act is really spontaneous . A really spontaneous act is one which by the assumption has no cause ; and the attempt to prove such a negative as this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while it is thus a philosophical impossibility to demonstrate that any given phenomenon is not the effect of a material cause , anyone who is acquainted with the history of science will admit , that its progress has in all ages meant , and now more than ever means , the extension of the province of what we call matter and causation , and the concomitant gradual banishment , from all regions of human thought , of what we call spirit and spontaneity . " ( p. 86 . ) Suppose then we say that the boiling of a tea-kettle is the work of mind , it is the same as to say that it is caused by mind ; and our knowledge of the fact asserted is not relative but absolute , and we do know more about the cause of it than a definite order of succession ; for although mind might have failed in the effort to cause it , and it was not therefore a necessary effect of the action of mind , we know that it was by a necessity inseparable from the nature of things-that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action ; but having duly weighed the whole matter in the light of all that materialistic science has to say in the premises , we find nothing in it which hints at either materialism or necessarianism . For it is obvious that our knowledge of what we call the material world is to be interpreted by what we know of the spiritual world , and that being so interpreted , it renders our acquaintance with law of no effect , as against our knowledge of spontaneity . Further , it being demonstrable that the boiling of the tea-kettle is the effect of a material and necessary cause , it is nevertheless within the power of human logic to show , that it is at the same time a truly spontaneous action . For such an act is not one which by the assumption has no cause , and the attempt to fasten upon us such a contradiction is on the face of the matter absurd . And while it is thus impossible that anything should become an act , or what is the same thing , perhaps a fact // without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that anything but the folly of men has had a tendency to banish from any region of human thought what we call spirit and spontaneity . And further , it is evident that the difficulty which Prof. Huxley finds in this matter of causation lies in the vain endeavor to interpret it as if it were a function of matter , whereas experience , and therefore science , shows that it is in its ultimate nature exclusively a function of mind . And strange to say , Prof Huxley himself points the way to this very conclusion , when in speaking of the growth of knowledge in a child , he says " And having thus good evidence for believing that many of the most interesting occurrences about it are explicable on the hypothesis that they are the work of intelligences like itself-having discovered a vera causa for many phenomena , why should the child limit the application of so fruitful an hypothesis ? " ( p. 106 . ) And why , we ask , should the philosopher limit it ? And we do not charge Prof. Huxley with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for he frankly tells us that his materialistic reasoning is at war with his anti-materialistic convictions when he says , " Nevertheless two things are certain : the one , that I hold the statements to be substantially true ; the other , that T individually am no materialist , but , on the contrary , believe materialism to involve grave philosophical error . " ( p. 84 . ) And he emphasizes the conclusion , when he says , " the errors of systematic materialism may paralyze the energies and destroy the beauty of a life . " Nothing need be added to the force of such a condemnation . But when we are told , nevertheless , that views which involve such deplorable consequences are " not only consistent with , but necessitated by sound logic , " - that there is thus a necessity to teach " grave philosophical error " as a means of advancing the truth , it must be that Prof. Huxley means it only as one of those purely subjective truths which have no existence , except relatively to the mind , and which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . When we survey the works of nature we may find abundant ignorance of spiritual agency ; but where is the knowledge of its absence ? In which part of the rain is it that we discern the agency of man ? Yet we know it is there . And there is // none of the agency of his body in it , for all the force concerned is accounted for from other sources . Why then should we expect , by the examination of other phenomena , to know that there is a spiritual agency in them ? We know the fact , but we did not gain our knowledge of it by the study of " Molecular Physics , " nor by the " combination and resolution of the ideas of matter and force , " but from the knowledge of such an agency in ourselves . Without the knowledge thus acquired , we should be compelled to say as Prof. Tyndall does , that there is not a power in the human intellect fit to be applied to the solution of the problem ( p. 93 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has hid this mystery " from the wise and prudent , " who boast their knowledge of nature and her laws ( pp. 121 and 162 ) , has " revealed it unto babes ; " as Prof. Huxley admits , and it is only by becoming a philosopher that any one can help understanding it . When the materialists discovered the Correlation of Force , that wonderful law which at a stroke projects the idea of force into every fact of external nature , they seemed to themselves to have gained an invincible ally in the contest of matter and law against spirit and spontaneity ; and so they never cease proclaiming the reign of Law in the name of Matter and Causation , and the consequent banishment of their ancient enemy from the domain of thought . But they proclaim their victory too soon . Vainly imagining that they have inclosecl science with a wall high enough to shut out mind , they have only succeeded in erecting an impassable barrier of distinction between mind and matter ; and that which was to have been to them a sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their sure destruction . Correlation teaches that mind does not exert itself as a physical force , inasmuch as all force known to us existed in some form beforehand in matter , and that whatever mind does must therefore be done by the use of pre*ixisting force ; while , on the other hand , it shows that matter can not think , inasmuch as all its activities are fully accounted for as motions . Correlation , then , upon which materialism professes to be founded , is the very law by authority of which it is forbidden to exist . For we find that while it shows the universal prevalence of law in nature , and that force is the price inexor // ably exacted for every motion , it also shows the nature of its agency in phenomena , and that having exhausted all its capacities in accounting for them , we have only arrived at the discovery that no action can take place in nature , so far as we know , until it is caused by mind . After admitting all that scwnce has to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lies behind that a necessity of thought , which transcends matter and its laws , and that if force is necessary as a condition of motion it is only necessary as an implement of the great master-workman mind . And , however far we may extend our conception of the province of matter , and the necessary action of its laws , we may still see beyond it and including it a precedent necessity of spiritual agency . We conclude , then , that so much of the New Philosophy as would find the constitution of nature in matter and its laws , and is thus defined as the natural outcome of materialistic thought , is not as it claims to be , a result of the law of Correlation , and the consequent uniformity of nature , inasmuch as it is compelled , contrary to the law of Correlation , to affirm that thought which is inconvertible into material motion , is nevertheless a function of matter , and contrary to the uniformity of nature , that in addition to the causative agency of mind there is another and distinct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as above , p. 137 . ) It is not then from any hostility to the truths of science , nor from any want of appreciation of the dignity and importance of its pursuits , neither is it from any misconception of the nature and dignity of matter , that we distrust the teachings of those to whom science reveals the world only through the interplay of matter and force ; neither is it , as Prof. Tyndall supposes , because we are ignorant of natural law ; but rather for the reason that when we consider the nature of matter and its laws as science reveals them to us , we find that matter is distinct from mind , and that its motions are not converted into thought ; and that the essence of things is not in the matter composing them , and that the secret of phenomena is not in the force involved in them ; that the real explanation of them all is in a kind of action which can not be weighed in material balances , nor measured by material standards and von . xxxiii. 46 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not be resolved into material motions ; and because we find that the true meaning of the things which science busies itself in examining , whether we call them works of nature or of art , lies not in the things themselves , but in their relations to that thinking agency which formed them and is the author of what they seem to do . Let him who doubts the proposition explain to himself , the meaning of the locomotive and its motions without referring them to the mind of man ; and when he can bring us a rational explanation of them in terms drawn from the vocabulary of matter and force alone , let him afterwards tell us , if he will , about the material origin of thought . Meantime , finding in the known agency of mind in nature a clearly defined mode of causation by the action of mind using matter and its forces for the accomplishment of its purposes , and remembering that science teaches the uniformity of nature , we shall feel bound by the teachings of science itself to adhere to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mind and not Matter is the great fact and the moving power in nature ; and that God is the author of the works of nature , not by the exertion of blind force , but by the power of thought , according to the counsels of his will .
