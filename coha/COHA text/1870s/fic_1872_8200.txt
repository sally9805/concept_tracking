Tuckerman , Henry T. ( Henry Theodore ) , 1813-1871 : ON A CAST OF TENNYSON 'S HAND . from Selections from the writings after 1872 Large for his dainty work ; to draw from life Its latent music , by magnetic sway , And pulse that throbs with love ; its barren strife , With Beauty 's subtile melodies o'erlay In dreamful consecration ; yet , perchance , This is transcendent Nature  --  to combine Strong grasp with gentle touch , and thus enhance Both will and love . How wondrous firm and fine Is the brain 's peerless instrument  --  the hand ! This one hath blessed us all , and scattered wide A soulful largess over sea and land ; To clasp the hand of poets is our pride And noble joy ; and we will fondly keep This laureate brother 's  --  stretched across the deep . Tuckerman , Henry T. ( Henry Theodore ) , 1813-1871 : ODE FOR THE FUNERAL OBSEQUIES OF PRESIDENT LINCOLN . from Selections from the writings after 1872 April 25 , 1865 . I. Shroud the Banner ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gaze on that majestic sleep , Stand beside the bier to weep  --  Lay the gentle son of toil Proudly in his native soil , Crowned with honor , to his rest , Bear the Prophet of the West ! II . How cold the brow that yet doth wear The impress of a nation 's care ; How still the heart whose every beat Glowed with compassion 's sacred heat ; Rigid the lips whose patient smile Duty 's stern task would oft beguile ; Blood quenched the pensive eye 's soft light , Nerveless the hand so loth to smite , So meek in rule , it leads , though dead , The people , as in life it led . III . O ! let wise and guileless sway Win every recreant 's heart to-day , And sorrow 's vast and holy wave Blend all our hearts around his grave . Let the faithful bondman 's tears  --  Let the traitor 's craven fears , And the people 's grief and pride Plead against the fratricide ! Let us throng to pledge and pray O'er the patriot martyr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made him victor in the fight , Cling to the path he fearless trod , Still radiant with the smile of God ! IV . Shroud the Banner ! Rear the Cross ! Consecrate a nation 's loss ; Gaze on that majestic sleep , Stand beside the bier to weep  --  Lay the gentle son of toil Proudly in his native soil , Crowned with honor , to his rest , Bear the Prophet of the West ! Tuckerman , Henry T. ( Henry Theodore ) , 1813-1871 : TO ADELAIDE RISTORI , ON HER Benefit Night , New York , November 23 , 1866. from Selections from the writings after 1872 Thy country 's genius to the world revealed Our western land , and hers the name it bears ; Another bond thy Art 's enchantments yield , Another fame each nation fondly shares : For while along the chambers of the sea Electric voices call from shore to shore , That Italy is harmonized and free , In thy deep tones we greet her soul once more !  --  That soul that triumphs o'er relentless Time , Melodious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dante 's sculptured line , And Venice thrills with Freedom 's joy to-day ; How blest , Ristori , is thy welcome here ! Each spell the artist weaves , the woman doth endear ! Tuckerman , Henry T. ( Henry Theodore ) , 1813-1871 : THE DYING MODEL . A Picture by James E. Freeman . from Selections from the writings after 1872 As when the artist having wrought awhile , Stands back and scans his work with long survey , Achieved and unattained to reconcile , Till fact with fancy blends and toil with play , So Time 's perspective , in Rome 's hallowed air , From keen pursuit allures her musing guest  --  With tranquil vision all her charms to share  --  The latent harvest of prolific rest . He learns to linger in the path of life To look on Nature with a patient eye , Forget awhile the tumult and the strife And feel the beauty of the earth and sky . As thus we loitered on an autumn-day , A boy with olive cheek and dark-brown eyes , Who in the sunshine basked along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I never look upon a noble boy , But hope and fear awake a prescient thrill ; Life 's battle yet unwon , his reckless joy O'erleaps the future with confiding will . And this young Roman acolyte of art , Of boyhood was the gracious type and king , Of every phase the destined counterpart , Whose presence seemed a benison to bring : When , gleesome feasting on his grapes and crust , A little Bacchus blithe and " debonnaire ; " When , wistful gazing with pathetic trust , An Ismael of the desert sadly fair . As in his lustrous orbs arch-fondness gleamed , The ravished painter saw a Cupid near ; If awed by faith their saintly fervor beamed , An infant John beside his Lord appear . Summer 's fierce breath hung over silent Rome , And warned us from the lonely haunts of art , To track the Sabine Hills  --  his native home  --  With wayward footsteps and a buoyant heart . One eve the plaintive cadence of a psalm Stole from a cottage as we sauntered by ; Upon our spirits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hovered nigh . Within the humble walls a girl bent o'er The rustic pallet of a wasted child , Her arm beneath his head , as on the floor She , weeping , crouched to hush her anguish wild . Apart the mother bowed in rigid woe , While , clinging to her skirts , the latest born Peered at her hidden face , as if to know What made the scene so tearful and forlorn . His high brow rising from the fallen hood , With hand upon the lapsing heart-beats laid , Beside the lowly couch a friar stood , Upheld a crucifix and softly prayed . As to us turned the boy 's bright , pleading eyes , Once more their tale of faithful love to tell , His artless smile of rapturous surmise Revealed our dying model 's last farewell . Tuckerman , Henry T. ( Henry Theodore ) , 1813-1871 : THE ELMS OF OLD TRINITY . from Selections from the writings after 1872 Shame on the ruthless hands that tore away The venerable elms , whose graceful domes Of lofty verdure canopied these graves ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chastened ray , spread like a shield , By Nature interposed to guard the dead ; And waved in dalliance with the fitful wind , Or with it lapsed to monumental calm . What cenotaph that human skill may rear Can with their living symmetry compare ? What tinted window with their emerald ? What roof with their arcade of trailing leaves ? When Spring renewed her miracle , and clad The naked branches in their June array  --  Their life 's revival , to the trusting soul , Prophetic breathed of immortality . Echoes of prayer , the jubilant refrain Of choral anthem , and the organ 's peal , Blent with their murmur in the sultry air , While in their verdant depths the locust trilled , And on their sprays blithe swung the yellow bird . Their grateful umbrage then benignly screened The silent church-yard from the noisy street ; Their roots were twined around the mould'ring forms Laid long ago beside the ancient fane , To exiled worshippers the more endeared Because of these majestic trees that wore A guise familiar to their childhood 's home . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shade ; and under their old boughs The wise and brave of generations past Walked every Sabbath to the house of God . As grief , by time subdued , forgot to weep , Still fell their dewy tears ; frost turned to gold The leafy fringes of their drooping pall , With every breeze a requiem they sighed ; In wreaths fantastic swayed above their tops The mists of ocean , like funereal plumes ; While round their hoary trunk the gray moss crept , And softly marked the transit of the years . Of old the Church was warder of the tomb , Her ban restrained the hand of sacrilege , Her shrines were trophies of the saintly dead ; And pagan consecration kept the groves Serene and sacred ; Reverence is gone , Her haunts laid waste ; not life and love alone , Bereft of fond seclusion , grow profane , But the last home of poor mortality . Memory 's tender plea , nor beauty 's charm , Nor the long vigils of these sylvan kings Could awe the spoiler ; vanished , like a dream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That cheerful shelter gave the camp of death , And solace to the hearts that mourn their fall . Newport , R. I. , July , 1871.
