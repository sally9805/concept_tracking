Ward , Elizabeth Stuart Phelps , 1844-1911 : THE UNSEEN PREACHER . from The Unseen Preacher ( 1878 ) He spoke of souls that stooped and sinned , Of hearts that turned to roam ; He spoke of human restlessness , Of exile and of home , Of earth 's eternal vagrancies . " O slow ! " he cried , " to start And throw thy truant childhood back Upon thy Father 's heart . " That life must walk uncomforted , That leans not on His breast : They only know that God is Love Who learn that God is Rest . " He spoke , and on his lifted face The prophet 's halo crept : Like reeds within his outstretched hands , The people bowed , and wept . But in the chancel 's solemn shade , She saw a glamour sweet . " Beloved ! " said she , " was it you Fled by with flashing feet ; " Across the holy desk and book , Beside the holy man , Swift as a thought , and silent as Only the vanished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , All in a dream of light ,  --  Paused to attend the sacred Word As only a spirit might ? " As angels must , then , pity me , So tempted and so blessed ! And teach me how , O loved and lost , or bright , or dim , Containeth thee , to give my first , My best of love to Him ! "
