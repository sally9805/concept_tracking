txt Our readers are too painfully aware that a great outcry has been made in the Senate lately about the sale of arms to the French during the war between France aud Germany . It was originated by that distinguished patriot , CARL SCHURZ , who wished to prove that the United States had been guilty of a gross breach of neutrality toward his native country , Germany . In the course of the discussion it has been stated by the New-York 7Wbune , the Chicago Tribune , and the New-York Nation that a large amount of money was paid for arms which did not find its way into the Treasury . The Chicago Tribune staid one day this week that " millions " had been stolen . CARL Senurtz insinuated  --  for he never has the courage , notwithstanding his " heart " that " never quails , " to make a charge openly  --  that what he calls the " military ring " had stolen it . The New-York Tribune clamored cagerly for an " investigation . " While all this was going on , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject , and on Thursday the facts involved in it came out before a Committee . Gen. BELKNAP , Secretary of War , gave the following evidence respecting the money part of the affair : " The amount realized from the sale of arms , &c.,; was $9.748,942 ; of this sum 39,109,236 80 bad been deposited in the Treasury as per certificates on file ; $120,000 was reported in the bands of &welters; on the 80th of June , 1871 ; the bid ( moo was expended for preparing stores for the sale , fitting thorn up , &o.; In reply to a question by the Chairman as to the discrepancies between the accounts of Mr. WARD and the Treasury Department , Secretary BELKNAP said ne was aware of none . The close of the fiscal year of the War Department was the same as that of the Treasury Department , namely , the 30th of June . As to the Treasury books showing tho amounts received for the arms , Mr. BELKNAP explained that in almost every case payment was made by cash cheeks . Margins varying from five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to secure the United States , and the checks are carried as quickly as possible , and paid Into the hands of the Government agents . The full amounts are received by the agents , principally in New-York. and prior to the delivery of any arms to the purchasers . The depositing officer receives from the United States Assistant Treasurer a certificate of deposit . The money is turned over from time to time and drawn against the Assistant Treasurer in favor of the Treasury . The certificates are examined through the Secretary of War , to be covered into the Treasury to the credit et the receiving officer . Here , then , we see that the money realized from the sale of arms was all accounted for that not only are not " millions " missing , but that the total sum received , to the last cent . was paid into the Treasury , or was spent in preparing stores , &c.; Secretary BELKNAP went ou to another point : " The Chairman ! laving asked whether any of the parties designated in Executive document No. 89 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any foreign Governments , Mr. BELKNAP responded , not to his knowledge , and not until October did he have any suoli intimation , through the receipt of a telegram , already read to the Committee , when , as he had already stated , he stopped the sales to REMINGTON . Prior to that time he did not know REMINGTON was an agent of the French Government . In reply to the question by the Chairman , whether any arms suitable for military service bad been sold , Gen. BELKNAP answered : ' No , Sir ; we were getting rid of unsuitable arms in order to adopt better ones ; about a thousand new arms , by way of experiment , have been placed in the hands of the army , superior to those previously made . ' Gen. BELKNAP having been asked by Mr. ACKER as to who Judges of the fitness of arms for public service , replied the duties of the Chief of Ordnance are defined by law . " Thus the two charges brought forward by SCHURZ , the Tribunes , and the Nation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the New-York Tribune gets over the difficulty : " The arms investigation begun this morning by the House Committee on Expenditures in the War Department , developed nothing but the ignorance ( tad incompetency of the Committee . The Secretary of War was before them as a witness for over an hour , during which time they asked him few questions , the replies to which had not already been made public in official docments , and dud not press inquiries in any direction which would be likely to elicit new facts . The disposition of the Committee appeared to be to shirk the investigation , if they could , and as if they must proceed to ask a few questions , for form 's sake , the answers to which could be readily given without throwing any light upon the matter in dispute . " Not a word , you see , about Gen. BELKNAP 'S distinct evidence about the money . Only a slanderous accusation against the Committee before which the Secretary gave bis evidence . This is a sample of the tactics followed by the " Anti-Grant Republicans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the people ..
