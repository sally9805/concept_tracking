txt At about 9 o'clock on Thursday night , Sept. 17 , an almost exhausted swimmer touched with his hands Indian Reef , a spur of Black Rock in front of the grove and shore of D. L. Mansfield , in the town of East Haven , about six miles from here by the road . Resting a little , ho plunged in again , and crossed the mouth of the creek known as East Haven River , and then he stood on the mainland , which he recognized . A little walk brought him to Mr. Mansfield 's stable , and there he stood naked while Mr. Mansfield was roused from his bed to come and see him , and the Old Shore House keeper will probably always remember the handsome young man whose naked , finely-built figure met his eyes that night when he opened the stable door . The strange story which the swimmer told to Mr. Mansfield , after clothes had been put on him and he had taken a cup of hot tea , was as follows : " My name is Edward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite of age . This afternoon , at 4 o'clock , my only brother  --  William W. Bromham  --  and myself hired a sailboat at White 's Dock and went down the harbor . We passed out of it into the Sound , and were a mile a two beyond the new light-house when my brother asked me to sit in the stern on the edge of the boat , saying it would sail better . As soon as I had seated myself there he came behind me and said , Ai n't that a shark out there ? ' and as I turned to look where he pointed he pushed me overboard . At first , when in the water , I thought it must have been an accident , but soon changed my mind . I asked him to help me , and he put the boat about , but did n't try to get at me . He told me to swim toward the boat , and when I got near he would change her course and go away from me , as if he wanted to lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me an oar or a rope . In this way he kept me in the water for a long time , and some of the time laughed at me and asked me if I was tired . When it began to get dark he started for home , leaving inc in the water four or five miles out . Before he started I had given up all hope of help from him , and had started for the shore . In fact , I had been afraid he would strike inc with an oar if I should get near the boat . I am a good swimmer , but I had a hard time getting my clothes off and preparing for a long , hard struggle for life . My buttoned gaiters gave me most trouble , and . I must have gone down five or six times in getting them off . I laid my course for the Old Light-house on the shore , but soon it became dark and I lost my bearings . I kept on , floating at times to rest myself , but did not know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready to drown . I had been in the water three hours , and had come three or four or five miles to eastward . " I firmly believe my brother meant to drown inc . My lather has been dead many years , and my mother has married again . MN ' brother and myself inherited two-thirds of his property . If I , who ant unmarried , die without issue , my share goes to him . He is married , has one child and is two years older Olari I am . His action in the boat explains another circumstance hitherto mysterious to me . Some time ago I lived in his house . I am always very careful to turn out my gas before going to bed , but one night while in that house I awoke and smelled gas . I was very drowsy , but soon , when my head felt oppressed , with an effort I left the bed , staggered to the window , and had just strength enough to open it . The fresh air revived me , and I looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had turned the gas full on , and the room was tun of it . I shall complain to my guardian , Hon. C. B. Bowers . " Mr. Mansfield took him home that night to his mother 's house . His brother had told her of Edward 's probable death . and when Edward began to condemn William to her . site restrained him , saying that William had assured her that he had done all in his power to save him , but in vain . But Edward holds to the belief which he communicated to Mr. Mansfield that night , and has told the same story to several persons . He says his brother did not know of his rescue until the next morning , when he was told as ho was starting for the shore with the intention of looking for Edward 's body , and that he went home that evening and told no one of the accident except his mother . William says that Edward fell overboard by accident , and that he was not near him at the time , and did not say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could to save him , and after going around him several times he went home , as it was getting dark , and he feared his boat would not stand up against the wind . He got to the dock as early as 6:45 . He is surprised that Edward feels so , and says he thinks he will change his mind after deliberation . He also denies that his feelings toward Edward have ever been other than friendly . Mr. Mansfield was out fishing that afternoon , and says the sea was smooth and the weather pleasant . He considers it almost miraculous , however , that in the dark Edward swam to the shore that night . Edward has had no business . His brother is a book-keeper . Their father was for several years a member of the firm of Booth Bromham , dealers in paints and oils , in Statestreet . Their successors , Booth &; Laware , are now in Water-street . Mr. Bromham left about 000,000 worth of property , mostly in real estate , but Edward 's share is not thought to be now @ @ @ @ @ @ @
