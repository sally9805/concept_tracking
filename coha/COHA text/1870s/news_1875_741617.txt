txt A mother , who by chance was led to look after her little child , which was in charge of a " perfect treasure " of a nurse , and who found her darling utterly neglected , writes to THE Tnms in her perplexity . She asks , acknowledging that her question is among those " wildest conundrums " that are daily propounded to us , " must we give up everything else , neglect husband , house , society , and all the manifold calls upon a woman of culture and position , tie our little children fast to us , &c.,; &c.,; and thus utterly abolish the office of nurse 7 " The conundrum is not so wild . as our fair correspondent seems to think that it is . Indeed we do not regard it as a conundrum at all , ' ? but merely as a question which 4 is easily answered . Whatever the welfare of a woman 's children and household demand from her , that she ought to give , uo matter how mulLitudineus the calls of society may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If necessary for the good of her children , for the well-being of her household , she should give all k such things up absolutely . Let our ' correspondent and her sisters consider the matter a moment , and they will see that this is what the husbands and fathers do . There are idlers and dissipated scamps in the world ; but there is not one husband and father in a thousand ti who , if it is necessary to do so , does not give up all enjoyments and resist all the claims of society , of whatever kind , upon hun , that he may provide for the present and the future of his children and their mother , and give them the benefit of his protecting care from day to day . Why is it that the bulk of the male part of mankind are absorbed in business , harassed , anxious , drudging , but that they are husbands and fathers ? Iu the words of the wisest of modern philosophers , they have " given hostages to Fortune . " Men do not let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other pleasures or claims , stand between them and the doing of their daily work . And if that daily work stretches far into the ? night , as for many Men it often does , still the work is done ; and the man drudges on year after year , sometimes to success and competence , or even wealth , but . often only to get a . comfortable living for his family . Of course we are not speaking of the comparatively few vicious exceptions ; but of the mass of decent , well-meaning men who correspond to the class of women as to whom the question that we are considering was propounded . . Society and all that sort of thing is to be given up , as it is by fathers who do their duty ? if it is necessary . But it is not necessary that there should be an absolute giving up ' of social pleasures and duties by either . Women may be now , as they have been heretofore , fond wives , devoted mothers , and thorough housekeepers , without ' sacrificing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can not perform those duties well , or even enjoy those pleasures with a free , light heart , if they look to their servants as their substitutes rather than merely as their assistants . Here is all the wildness of this conundrum , all the perplexity of this question . Women nowadays , or most of them , seem to forget that a servant is but an assistant , and that ' assistant must always be overlooked . ' That is the way in which men manage their affiiri . They find ti.sat ? it is the only way in ' which their work can be done with any confidence in its correctness and thoroughness . Every subordinate not only receives Orders from his superior , but is overlooked by him . His work is examined ; he has to make his reports : he is in- spected at stated times , and - he is liable to ? irregular and unexpected visitsof- examination . This is true , whether the force under the principal is five hundred , or fifty , or five . Now , in what proportion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are subordinate to the mistress and mother I And will women undertake to say that they are not only the equals of men in the administration of affairs , but so milbh their superiors that they can get their work well done without the supervision that men find that they must give ? We think they are hardly prepared to take that position yet . But that position they do , many of them , practically take . The very occasion of our remarks shows this . We mean no reproach to our correspondent , but her letter shows that she had been entirely ignorant of such " goings on'P on the part of her nurse ; otherwise she was too good a mother to have borne with them a day . Now , if a man were similarly neglectful of supervision of a subordinate , au assistant of whatever sort , ho would be regarded by all other men of sense and ordinary business faculty as culpably indifferent to the performance of his duties . Women , within the last generation , have fallen into this habit of committing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than assistants , and they have for some years past been surprised to find that the plan do n't work well ; and yet they seem not to suspect what is the matter . How confirmed and general the habit is , the reply of tho servant in this ' instance clearly ' shows . She " would live with no one who watched her . " And such replies from female servants we all know are common . Now , no man in a subordinate position ' would dream of making such a reply as that . He expects his superior to oversee him . Spying upon personal conduct is one thing , but overseeing and inspecting the work and the business conduct of a subordinate is quite another . Every man subordinate expects that from a capable superior ; and every good and honest man subordinate receives it without the thought of complaint . If nurses knew that they were likely at any time to find the mistress-mother at their side , in the park or elsewhere ; if they knew that a vigilant eye went over each child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their part , there would be few such ' causes of complaint as that which " A Mother " brought before us ; and . mothers would be the gainers in peace of mind , and in time for all rational enjoyments.
