txt It is reported from Ohio that the financial propositions in the Democratic platform of that State were from the pen of Senator THURMAN . We should be sorry to have to believe this . Mr. THURMAN , though a strong and sometimes a bitter and unjust partisan . is a man to whom the country owes some consideration for the manner in which he fought the inflationists of his own party in the Senate last Winter . It was a losing fight , as far as immediate results were concerned . The current of Democratic opinion was strongly in favor of inflation , and neither the solid arguments nor the sharp ridicule of Judge THURMAN could turn the tide . If it is true that he has consented to furnish to his party at home the platform adopted by it , his friends in both parties will hear that fact with regret . Ho will only add one more to the number of those who have uselessly sacrificed their honest convictions to a mistaken desire to be on the popular side . It would be bad enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case it can not . Whether Senator THURMAN is or is not of this number , it is certain that the repudiating plank has divided the Democracy in Ohio . It finds some defenders , but few hearty advocates , and a considerable number of the more influential journals are engaged in explaining it away . They say that the platform means that the five-twenties were payable in greenbacks , but not necessarily that they are now so payable . And they declare that the purpose of the authors of the platform was to make a point on the Republicans for having by the act of March 18 , 1869 , turned a greenback debt , into a gold debt . There is a certain plausibility in this explanation . The behavior of the Ohio Democrats , according to this theory , is quite in accordance with the absurd , two-faced , evasive , and sophistical fashion of putting things which some of the leaders of that party think is an evidence of political sagacity . And it will have been remarked that Senator SHERMAN , in alluding to this proposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courtesy , the full benefit of the construction now claimed for it . But to , plain minds it must be obvious that this ' explanation of the Democratic position is too ingenious to be strong . If they only meant that the bonds were once , but are not now , payable in paper , what was the use of saying anything at all on the subject I That they traveled all the way round . Robin Hood 's barn " for the purpose of getting a point on the Republicans , is not incredible , but it is not probable . It is most reasonable to suppose that whoever contrived the platform meant to rake over the coals of the old Pendletonian contest of 1867 and 1868 , and get from these , if possi- ble , something to lend fire to . the appeals : of the party . Even by the apologists ' account of it , it was a desperate mold wholly contemptible trick . What is the spirit of those who have introduced this issue at the present time may be seen from the position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much zeal and adroitness sustains the Pendleton plank in the platform . That journal , starting with the assertion that the " greatest crime in our politisal history was the passage of the Legal-tender of 1852 , " winds up with the conclusion that the best thing we can now do is to issue more legal-tender notes . And it is unquestionably to what is supposed to be the popular demand for more paper " money " that this movement is intended to appeal . If that were all , it would be still a grievous mistake ; but in doing this the Democrats have gone much further , and struck a blow that at any rate carries all their strength against the credit of the nation . It remains to be seen what disposition will be made of the repudiation platform by the people . It has already scared some of its friends , and there are more now anxious to explain than to sustain it . But the only way in which it can be finally put to rest is by voting it down , burying it under an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any national canvass.
