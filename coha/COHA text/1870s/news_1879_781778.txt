txt Our erudite contemporary , the World , celebrated the 22d of Februaryby announcing in a paragraph by itself that " WASHINGTON was once a rebel Brigadier . " The venom of this pointed little paragraph is manifest enough . WASHINGTON was a rebel Brigadier , and ho was also one of the noblest and purest men known to history ; his having been a rebel and a Brigadier are nothing against him but , on the contrary , he was , by his rebelliousness and his brigadiership , a benefactor to his country , of which his signal services in the field and in council caused him to be called the Father . This being admitted by all men , of course , the suggestion is very pertinent on the birthday of this rebel Brigadier , that by parity of reasoning certain other robe Brigadiers , too numerous to mention , were , or at least may have been , of the grand and noble type of manhood ; that their rebelliousness and their brigadierships ought not to be reckoned against them ; and that , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress should fall into the power of rebel Brigadiers , is not only foolish , but a manifest setting at naught of the blessings which might be bestowed upon the country by the presence of such a noble army in its councils . Now , of course , it is undeniable that WASHINGTON was once a rebel and a General ; unquestionably , he " fit into the Revolution , " if no one else did ; and there is now no one , oven among the British people , who questions his patriotism , his purity , or his sagacity . But to draw , or to imply , or even to suggest , a parallel between GEORGE WASHINGTON and those other rebel Brigadiers , too ; numerous to mention , certainly requires /a degree of unshamefacedness which istbeyond estimation . It quite surpasses and utterly extinguishes El uellen 's well-worn comparison of the river in Macedon and the river in Monmouth . There was " salmons in both " these rivers , and in the otherase both parties in comparison were rebel . ' Brigadiers . The comparison suggested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But there are rebellions and rebellions ; and there are also brigadiers and brigadiers . There is a tradition of a very great rebellion which is celebrated by Mr. JOHN MILTON in a somewhat famous poem , the hero of which , if he did not bear the title of Brigadier or of General , certainly commanded many battalions . But the character of this eminent personage is not held in very high esteem , although he was a rebel and a commander , and also , has the distinction , which he shares with those other rebel Brigadiers too numerous to mention , of having been defeated , and defeated not because of any lack of bravery or skill on his part , but simply because the power against which he rose in arms was too mighty for him . Between , this eminent rebel and those others there is also this likeness in the cause of his rebellion : His cause , like theirs , was disappointed ambition ; his policy , like theirs , rule or ruin . As he said , better rug in hell . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule in a slave confederacy than be equals in a union of freemen . After -. his defeat he still rebelled , still.cursed , still defied , and attempted , by plot , and intrigue , and falsehood , and temptation to attain some semblance of the power the reality of which he had lost forever ; but ' whether there is in this course of conduct a continuation of the likeness which appears in other respects we shall not now ) undertake to say , but shall leave that paint to be discussed in Congress , in the Cabinet , or at the Executive Mansion . Between the so-called rebel Brigadier who , was born on the 22d of February and those other rebel Brigadiers , ( dates of birth numberless , unknown , and mostly unknowable , ) there is not only the very remarkable unlikeness that he was victorious and that they were defeated  --  a trifle in the eyes of a philosophical and highly constitutional Democrat , but somewhat in the eyes of a practical man  --  but there are others which seem to have a high moral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Government in which he and his countrymen had no voice ; they fought against a government in Which they had more than their just proportion of representation , and which they had controlled almost ever since it was established . He fought for principles , and upon a policy which brought about the Union of those States and the formation of the Great Renublie which is now one of the great powers of the world and one of the beneficent agencies of civilization and human progress ; they fought to break up that Union , to destroy that Republic , and to establish a society and a Government based upon an institution accursed of GOD and man . When his wars were over , he retired in the flush of victory into private life , and sought no public employment until the voice of a whole nation summoned him to its head ; they , defeated in the field , began at the earliest day possible to them to scramble back into public life , and to strive to get , by hook or by crook , control of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his services in all the years during which he served his country , accepted . only his actual official expenses ; they soon began to plot the extortion from that country of the expenses of their rebellion . The likeness between them is a verbal point , from which diverge , at a wide angle that spans the whole heaven of morals , the lines which we are called upon to accept as parallels . If there ever were men who were unlike in motive , in spirit , and in all the springs and modes of their action , those men are the venerated patriot and almost spotless man whose birthday was made the occasion of this comparison and . the rebel Brigadiers with whom he was com-pared . It may suit the Democratic managers to attempt to impose them upon the world as men of like character and purposes ; a well-meaning Administration may make the conformity of JEFFERSON DAVIS and his military chiefs to GEORGE WAsumaTON , the test . of its sagacity and the measure of its political skill ; but to convince the mass of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an army of men like him who was first in peace , and first in war , ' and first in the hearts of his countrymen , is about the most hopeless task that was over undertaken by a desperate political advocate .
