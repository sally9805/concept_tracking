Duke St. Lorme Deuce take the valets of the present day  --  they are a compound mixture of impertinence and laziness ; the toilette is a perfect bore with their excessive awkwardness . Thank fortune I am again in Paris ;  --  it will enable to procure-servants to my taste . But what can detain Pierre ? the rascal has caught the infection of idleness from my other domestics . Enter Pierre , L. H. By the Saints , Pierre , for the last half hour I have been fancying that you was either dead or left the country . Pierre . Pierre Rosia Why so , my Lord ? Duke .

Pierre Rosia Sir Patrick received me with great kindness , or  --  to use your lordship 's words  --  overdone the thing , considerable . Duke . Duke St. Lorme Exactly ; full of vulgar city politeness . He was a merchant in Ireland , and King George of England knighted him , through some political service that he rendered the Government . But he is wealthy , Pierre , and it is necessary that Eugene marries his daughter . Pierre . Pierre Rosia The family is very well to marry into , my lord , but would never do for your lordship to live with . Duke . Duke St. Lorme You 're right , Pierre there is no washing colored persons white . But tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Pierre Rosia Lady O'Neil  --  Sir Patrick 's sister  --  is rather a crusty old lady ; she appears to be the commander , or chief of the establishment . Duke . Duke St. Lorme I perceive : a small remnant of nobility , falling into decay . Pierre . Pierre Rosia The eldest daughter , Ma'amselle Cordelia , very much resembles her aunt , and judging from the little I saw of her , is her favorite . Duke . Duke St. Lorme A slight touch of the old maid about her , eh , Pierre ? Laughing . Ha-ha-ha ! Pierre . Pierre Rosia Ma'amselle Florence , the youngest daughter , is a very amiable and beautiful young lady . Duke . Duke St. Lorme Pierre , you deserve credit for the description you give of the O'Connor 's ; it is precisely the same account I was favored with at Brussels , by Count de Henri . But order my carriage , immediately ; I shall call for Eugene at his hotel . Pierre . Pierre Rosia Directly , your lordship . Bows , and exits , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What can I possibly do amongst these ladies , with this confounded rheumatism ? it is a most grievous enemy to gallantry and address . The description of Florence has absolutely inspired me . Lively . Young , amiable and beautiful . Egad ! I shall have the fidgets until I behold the little Venus ! Beauty is the devil amongst people of quality . Bright woman 's eye ever beguiles , and sets me capering ! Dancing . Delicious anticipations fill my soul with rapturous ecstacy ! Egad !

Katty O'Sheal Is it serious you would have me ? Me , Katty O'Sheal , whose ancestors were the followers of the family before the world began ! Florence . Florence O'Connor Before the world began ! Laughing . Ha-ha-ha . Katty . Katty O'Sheal Faith , ye may laugh : but it 's well known that my relations were the followers of your family time out of mind ; and , bedad , that 's before the deluge  --  and if nobody knows it why , who 's to find it out ?

Katty O'Sheal Bedad , I was n't then ; for I was born first a baby in long-clothes . Florence . Florence O'Connor Laughing . Well , you certainly are a great creature , Katty . Katty . Katty O'Sheal Sure , I 'm thinking that I 'd be twice the child that I am , if your father had n't transplanted me from my own native isle , to be smothered with the likes of maccaroni and garlic . Faith , I long to see the old cronies again , and listen to them singing their good old Irish ditties : " A sailor courted a farmer 's daughter that lived convauient to the Isle of Man . " Florence . Florence O'Connor I see there is no reason in you this morning , so I 'll leave you to indulge in your wild flights of fancy . Going R. H. Katty . Katty O'Sheal Oh , do n't you be after going yet .

Takes note from her bosom , and gives it to Captain . O'Lynn . Captain O'Lynn Smiling . You are really a droll creature . Katty . Katty O'Sheal Considering my youth !

Well , well , let me once see her eldest sister married to Count St. Lorme , I will soon provide a husband for Florence . O'Lynn . Captain O'Lynn Let it be one of my recommending , Sir Patrick . I flatter myself that I could point out the person that would not be altogether disagreeable to Mam'selle Florence . Sir Patrick . Sir Patrick O'Connor What ?  --  yourself . Eh , Captain ? O Lynn . Captain O'Lynn If I could but obtain your consent ! Sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no , that will never do . I esteem both you and your family . A soldier should never think of marriage , unless he has the chink  --  money  --  Captain O Lynn . O'Lynn . Captain O'Lynn It is true my fortune is but moderate ;  --  still sufficient to keep above want ; and I hope , by diligence and perseverance , to increase it . Sir Patrick . Sir Patrick O'Connor My good sir , add to your fortune before you think of a wife . I will do anything to serve you upon the footing of friendship , but  --  O'Lynn . Captain O'Lynn Be assured , sir , there is no instance that I should rate your friendship so highly . Sir Patrick . Sir Patrick O'Connor Pshaw ! that 's another affair altogether . You know where money or interest is concerned , friendship is quite out of the question . O'Lynn . Captain O'Lynn But would you not , sacrifice a trifle to secure your daughter 's happiness ? Sir Patrick . Sir Patrick O'Connor Confound it ! do you want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! O'Lynn . Captain O'Lynn No , Sir Patrick ; I can not answer for Florence , but I am sure that the chief happiness or misery of my life depends entirely upon her . Sir Patrick . Sir Patrick O'Connor Ridiculous !  --  a soldier should think of nothing but glory and promotion . The ladder of fame should be your motto . Come , come , now promise me that I shall hear no more of this . O'Lynn . Captain O'Lynn Hesitating . I fear , sir , I should not be able to keep my word with you . Sir Patrick .

Duke St. Lorme Great improvement indeed , your ladyship . I must confess you have wonderful taste . Sir Patrick . Sir Patrick O'Connor My sister has been showing you the various alterations that I have made in the old mansion . I can assure your lordship that I spared neither pains or expense . In fact it is quite another place compared to what it was when I first purchased it . I made a green house out of the old shed ; turned the wine brewery into a pinery , and the high octagon summer house , you saw , is raised on a Portland block , given me by the steward of the Earl of Pembrook ; you perceive it commands a view of the whole road to Paris . Duke . Duke St. Lorme R. C. It appeared to me , Sir , PatricK , like some fairy castle in the air  --  a kind of depot for balloons to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the channel to England , or a coasting voyage to the Rhine . Lady O'Neil . Lady O'Neil L. C. My brother is a little comical in his ideas , my lord , but you 'll excuse him . I have a gothic , grotto fitted up in my own taste , where nature and art are combined , that I must show you . Duke . Duke St. Lorme Bowing . I have every moment a fresh opportunity of admiring the elegance of Lady O'Neil ;  --  the very flower of delicacy and cream of politeness . Lady O ' Neil . Lady O'Neil Curtseying . Oh ! my lord ! Sir Patrick . Sir Patrick O'Connor How do you like the walks , my lord ? Duke . Duke St. Lorme Excellent ! they form a perfect maze , and wind like a true lover 's knot . To Florence . Your bouquet is composed of very choice and beautiful flowers , Mademoiselle . Florence . Florence O'Connor Yes , they are very miscellaneous , your lordship . Will you do me the honor of accepting them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'll wear it next my heart , Mademoiselle . Aside . I have positively made an impression on the young creature . Cordelia . Cordelia O'Connor Will your lordship permit me to present you with this rose ? Presenting it . Duke . Duke St. Lorme The truest emblem of yourself , Mademoiselle  --  all sweetness and poignancy . Aside . A little jealous , by the gods . Crosses to R. and back C. Sir Patrick . Sir Patrick O'Connor Now , my lord , we have time sufficient before dinner to stroll though the orchard , where I will show you some very fine prospects . Lady O ' Neil . Lady O'Neil But brother , perhaps you will fatigue his lordship with over walking ! Duke . Duke St. Lorme Not at all , madam ; let us at once proceed to the Garden of Eden , in the regions of perpetual spring and youth . Leering at the ladies . I am ever gay when surrounded by a bevy of beauties . Lady O ' Neil . Lady O'Neil Aside . Here is real nobility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ladies will you do me the honor . Offering his arm , which they take . Sir Patrick and Lady O ' Neil will lead the way ;  --  we young people will follow . Sir Patrick . Sir Patrick O'Connor Certainly , your lordship ! Come , sister , taking her arm , let 's hob and bob together . Crossing R. , 1 E. Lady O ' Neil . Lady O'Neil Aside to him . Do n't be so vulgar , brother ! Both exit , R. H. , followed by Duke St. Lorme , in ecstacy , with Elorence and Cordelia . Katty enters C. , and remains back . Count St. Lorme . Count St. Lorme At length we are alone . I know that you are my friend , and will rejoice to serve me . O'Lynn . Captain O'Lynn Our friendship has never been doubted ! Count St. Lorme . Count St. Lorme This treaty of marriage between Mademoiselle Cordelia and myself , will come to nothing . O'Lynn . Captain O'Lynn You amaze me ! But what 's to prevent it ? Count @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I do not like her . Katty . Katty O'Sheal Aside . Bedad , there 's plenty like you , exactly . O'Lynn . Captain O'Lynn I never supposed that you were extremely devoted to her , from inclination , but thought you considered it as an affair of convenience , rather than true affection . Count St. Lorme . Count St. Lorme Very true . You are aware that I was to receive the round sum of eighty thousand pounds with Cordelia . I looked upon love  --  serious , sober love  --  as a chimera , and marriage as a thing of course ; but I who , until lately , was so great an infidel in love , am now one of its sincerest votaries . In a word , my defection from Cordelia proceeds from the violence of my attachment to another . Katty . Katty O'Sheal Aside . Did you ever hear the likes of that ? O'Lynn . Captain O'Lynn Rather an awkward affair , count . Sir Patrick is an obstinate old fellow , and Cordelia is Lady O'Neil 's favorite neice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your engagement . But , tell me , who is your charmer ? Count St. Lorme . Count St. Lorme Her sister  --  the lovely and angelic Florence ! Katty . Katty O'Sheal Aside . Och , murther in Frinch ! O'Lynn . Captain O'Lynn Starting . Florence !  --  the devil ! My dear count , you really must not think of such a thing . Katty . Katty O'Sheal Aside . That 's my opinion of the matter . Count St. Lorme . Count St. Lorme Not think of it ! I can think of nothing else . Was it possible for me to be indulged in a daily intercourse with two such objects as Florence and her sister , and not find my heart led by insensible attraction towards her ? Katty . Katty O'Sheal Aside . That 's the honest truth he 's speaking . Count St. Lorme . Count St. Lorme You seem confounded . Why do you not answer ? Katty . Katty O'Sheal Aside . It 's a delicate question you 're asking him , anyhow . O'Lynn . Captain O'Lynn Indeed , Count @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it will produce the worst consequences . Let me persuade you to drop these thoughts in time . Count St. Lorme . Count St. Lorme Never ,  --  never ! Katty . Katty O'Sheal Aside . Faith , I think you 'd better , then . O'Lynn . Captain O'Lynn You have gone too far to recede . A negotiation so near concluded can not be broken off with any grace . The preliminaries finally settled between the Duke St. Lorme and Sir Patrick , and Cordelia , ready herself to receive you as her husband . Katty . Katty O'Sheal Aside . And she 's been waiting too long for a husband to be letting you off aisy . Count St. Lorme . Count St. Lorme I grant you the banns have been published , but persons change their minds occasionally after entering the church . O'Lynn . Captain O'Lynn You think too lightly of this affair  --  to carry your addresses so far and then desert her , and for her younger sister , too ,  --  it will be such an affront to the family they can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The old lady will give you scratch , for the sake of her prodigy . Count St. Lorme . Count St. Lorme I do n't think so . Transferring my passion from one sister to the other is not , like bestowing my affections out of the family . Katty . Katty O'Sheal Aside . You 're a beauty , anyhow . O'Lynn . Captain O'Lynn Count , take my advice , and think better of it . Count St. Lorme . Count St. Lorme I have thought already . Now , candidly , you can not blame me . Is there any comparison between them ? Katty . Katty O'Sheal Aside . Yes , one 's like a beautiful canary bird , and the other is like the ilegant bird they call the crow wid plenty of caw ! caw ! caw ! Imitates a crow . O'Lynn . Captain O'Lynn You should have thought of this before . Count St. Lorme . Count St. Lorme Looking off R. H. Oh ! I see her in the garden , I 'll go to her immediately . Going . R. 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too precipitate !  --  consider what you are doing ! Count St. Lorme . Count St. Lorme I would not lose the opportunity for the universe , Breaking from him . Do n't interrupt us , Captain O'Lynn , or I shall never forgive you . Runs off R. 1 E. Katty . Katty O'Sheal Och , hone ! What will we do ? O'Lynn . Captain O'Lynn I shall go mad . Walking about , greatly excited . This is the most unfortunate occurrence that could possibly happen . Katty . Katty O'Sheal Following him . It 's bothered I am , entirely . O'Lynn . Captain O'Lynn Not noticing her . In love with my wife . D  --  n it , ' I ca n't bear this ! Katty . Katty O'Sheal Following Captain . I do n't know what to do wid the likes of it . O'Lynn . Captain O'Lynn I am the most unfortunate fellow in the world . Katty . Katty O'Sheal Sure , you have the devil 's own luck , and your own , too . O'Lynn . Captain O'Lynn Acquaint me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for-bearance . Katty . Katty O'Sheal To make love to your own lawful wife , the big blackguard . O'Lynn . Captain O'Lynn Turns and meets Katty . What are you talking about ? Katty . Katty O'Sheal Sure , I 'm not talking at all , at all . I 'm just thinking what a fix yer in . O'Lynn . Captain O'Lynn Fix ! D  --  n me , I 'm mad ! Call fortune inconstant ! Katty . Katty O'Sheal Bedad , she 's constant enough to you , anyhow , and kicks you into all the gutters she can find . O'Lynn . Captain O'Lynn Going L. No matter ! the die is cast ! I 'll go and inform Sir Patrick at once . Katty . Katty O'Sheal Detaining him . And have you 're darling Florence 's fortune cut off to a miserable shilling . Sure , that would never do , Captain . O'Lynn . Captain O'Lynn I can never submit to Count St. Lorme making love to Florence ! S'death , I should break out and claim my right , were it the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you know that I 'm the poor but faithful follower of the family , and now , that you 're hitched to my young lady and the old family carriage , sure , it 's meself that will do anything to serve you . Do n't you know that I consider you one of the boys ? O'Lynn . Captain O'Lynn Oh ! nonsense ! Pray what can you do , Katty ? Katty . Katty O'Sheal More than you 'll give me credit for , I 'll go bail ; but you trust to me for a screamer , and I 'll have Lady O'Neil , together wid her pet , Cordelia , and your father-in-law , Sir Patrick  --  who do n't know it  --  bedad , I 'll have them all at loggerheads . O'Lynn . Captain O'Lynn But that will be of no use to me ! Katty . Katty O'Sheal Och , you be aisy , and you 'll see what a storm I 'll have here in less than no time wid the ancient O'Connors and the inspiring , St. Lormes . Faith , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like a cow 's tail in fly-time . O'Lynn . Captain O'Lynn Well , but I ca n't see the good of such mischief . Katty . Katty O'Sheal Mischief ! You 'll be calling it ilegant ammusement , when I accomplish my intentions . O'Lynn . Captain O'Lynn Curse me , if I can comprehend your meaning . Katty . Katty O'Sheal Whist ! here comes old duke . You be off , and you 'll see how I 'll snare the ould bird . O'Lynn . Captain O'Lynn Well , fire away , Katty , I 'll trust to luck . Exit Captain O'Lynn , L. H. Katty . Katty O'Sheal Sings . " Trust to luck ! " Enter Duke St. Lorme , R. , 1 E. Duke . Duke St. Lorme Ah ! what have we here  --  a songstress from the Emerald Isle . Good morning , my dear ! Katty . Katty O'Sheal Curtseying . Good morning to your honor . Sure , it 's mighty glad to see you , so I am ! Duke . Duke St. Lorme Aside . This must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard so much about . Aloud . You are attached to the O'Connors , I presume . Katty . Katty O'Sheal Faith you may say that wid all the truth in life , for , according to the ancient and modern history , there 's a long account to settle betwane us . Duke . Duke St. Lorme Aside . Egad ! she 's very pretty . Aloud . So , to keep up the ancient custom , you have left the land of your birth to follow your patron to sunny France . Katty . Katty O'Sheal Yes , your honor , sure , I left the land of the potatoes for the land of the frogs . Duke . Duke St. Lorme Frogs , when properly dressed are a very delicious dish , I can assure you , my little queen . Katty . Katty O'Sheal Faith , I know that . Sure , all the soup in the country seems swimming alive with the lively little fellows . Duke . Duke St. Lorme Aside . Her simplicity charms me . Aloud . But you are aware that France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Katty . Katty O'Sheal Bedad , I know that , for our cook makes lots of good things out of nothing . She roasts a great lump of butter as we would in Ireland a sucking-pig , and then makes ilegant broth out of the shavings ! Duke . Duke St. Lorme Laughing . Ha-ha-ha ! I perceive the arts and sciences in our French kitchens astonish you . They do n't serve up such savory morsels in your country ! Katty . Katty O'Sheal Faith , they do n't , and if they did , they could n't be afther getting anybody to ate thim . Duke . Duke St. Lorme Why not , my dear ? Katty . Katty O'Sheal Oh , the Pats are pretty good at the vegetable productions , but you would n't be after getting thim to swallow anything that has the appearance of unhealthy hedgehogs . Duke . Duke St. Lorme Laughing . Ha-ha-ha ! unhealthy hedgehogs Aside . The girl is positively a connoisseur in droll sayings Alouds . But tell me , my little sprig of the shamrock , have you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you came from ? Katty . Katty O'Sheal Colleges ? Bedad , the country 's full of thim . There 's the " Amitoress , " " Discriptive , " and " Non-Discriptive , " all full of beautiful music and poetry . Duke . Duke St. Lorme By my faith you have studied the classics . Katty . Katty O'Sheal Och , sure , I went to school to Judy McCree . She was a whole history in herself . She was distantly related to Tim Moore and Will Shakespeare . Och , would n't I like to see her equal among the Pol-i-vous ? Duke . Duke St. Lorme Aside . The girl is a complete composition of sayings  --  a rustic beauty . Aloud .

Then the old Duke fancies himself a young boy ; flirts with the ladies ; enters my mansion with all the pomp and stiffness of an emperor , and in two hours afterwards I find him dancing a jig with Katty O ' Sheal ! Katty . Katty O'Sheal Is it here ye are , Sir Patrick ? Faith its mighty glad I am that I 've found you . Sir Patrick .
