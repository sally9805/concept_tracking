txt The Currency ' bill is still an enigma . All the inflationists voted for it , and must , therefore , have supposed it a measure of expansion . On the other hand , many bank officers of conservative tendencies believe that the redemption clauses will cause a very positive , and possibly serious , curtailment of the circulation . There is fair ground for maintaining either opinion , and only the actual working of the law will show which party is right . So far as the lawful reserve is concerned , it is certainly diminished , and this tends to inflation . In future the only reserve to be kept against circulation is the five per cent . in the Treasury vaults at Washington . As this is also to count as a part of the reserve upon deposits , the latter is practically , in amount , the only reserve hereafter to be maintained . The amount relinquished is , therefore , precisely the amount heretofore required to be kept against a circulation of 350 millions of dollars . The average reserve of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having been exactly twenty per cent. , this amount was seventy millions , or one-th5d of the whole reserve . This is a very large sum to release , if it is really to be released , and especially if in greenbacks . But there is no reason to suppose that the reserve will , in ordinary times , be thus seriously reduced , and , still less , that the amount set free will be in legal-tender notes . Much of the reserve has been fictitious , because the law allowed three-fifths of it , for banks out of New-York , to consist of entries to their credit in the books of some bank in this or some other of the sixteen redemption cities . - The banks of New-York alone are required to keep their reserves in legaltender notes or coin . Nor because the law no longer requires it , does it by any means follow that any considerable part of the reserve will be given up . Prudent bankers will always see to it that their immediate liabilities are carefully guarded . Those who follow the high-pressure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past , and . it may be regretted that there should be any relaxation in the legal obligations of a class of banks from which all the trouble comes in times of peril . It was not to restrain prudent , but reckless , bank officers that laws requiring specie reserves ? were enacted by so many of the States after the crisis of 1857 . The practice of the Bank of England , of keeping one-third of the amount of its immediate obligations in specie , was adopted long before Sir ROBERT PEEL 'S act furnished the first legislation on the subject . The admirable Louisiana law was adopted after the crisis of 1841 , to compel the banks of New-Orleans to follow a rule of prudence which the better sort of banks everywhere had long before adopted as the result of experience . There has been one defect in all laws fixing the reserve  --  their inflexibility . The reserve corps of an army is useless if it can never fight , and the reserves of a bank are equally so if they can never be used . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in England . or this country , to give flexibility to the reserve . There needs to be a dispensing power lodged somewhere , but statesmen and bankers can not agree where it can prudently be placed . So they have been compelled , in both countries , to save the law by breaking it whenever a crisis occurs . Where the reserve is not a legal obligation , but only a prudent precaution , there will be no obstacle to using it , and the knowledge that it can be used . will serve to mitigate the stringency which calls for its employment . But if it should prove in practice that the relinquishment of one-third of the reserve operates to set free a considerable number a legal-tender notes , will this enlargement of the circulation be offset by a contraction resulting from a more effective redemption of national bank notes ? Hitherto there has been no redemption  --  except of mutilated cur- rency , the amount of which is inconsiderable . There will , doubtless , be some redemp- , tion of them in future ? in seasons of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would be well for banks , not otherwise tired of the national system , to wait and see how much the redemption will really amount to before hastily determining to surrender their circulation and . take up their bonds . What is the motive for sending national bank notes to the Treasury for redemption ? To get legal tenders . If banks have need to strengthen their reserves , the new law certainly enables them to do it more easily than the old .. They have only to send as many national bank notes as will cover the amount they need , and . in a few days the greenbacks will be returned to them . But the expense of sending and receiving falls on the banks making the exchange , and . the time required . involves , also , a loss of interest . It would be quite another thing if the Treasury office in New York , and the Assistant Treasurers ' offices in other cities were the redemption agencies . It would have been far better to have it so , for any system of redemption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it effective . There is no other motive , except the necessity of increasing the reserve of legaltender notes , which will lead bankers to send notes in for redemption . For all purposes but this the national bank note is practically as good . as the greenback . It is a legal tender to the Government and . in payments between banks , and the amount of all other payments by banks is very trifling . We assume , what will be found true in practice , that nobody will send notes in for redemption except the banks . While all the expense can be put upon them , individuals will not assume it , and banks can not refuse to receive bank notes on deposit , because to them they are a legal tender . With diminished . reserves , we do not look for a very active or steady redemption after the novelty has passed away and . the present excess of notes has been drawn out of New York to meet the requirements of a reviving business .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
