ART . IX . - POLITICAL BEFLEXIONS BY A JAPANESE TRAYELLER. *I IT is now eleven years since I first left Japan . At that time it was not permitted to Japanese to leave the country for purposes of travel ; nevertheless , I managed to escape , for I was anxious to study foreigners in their own countries . I remained three years away from Japan , staying principally in England and America . I had already read about those countries , and I desired much to see how Government was carried on . The impression made in Japan by foreigners , when they first came there , was so great , that Jap .. anese thought that their wise men must be almost like Gods , and that their political institutions must be perfect , because inventions were so wonderfuL Now many Japanese have become much wiser , beeause they have lived in foreign countries and studied them deeply . Certain foreign men had a very great fame amongst Japanese youth ,  --  such , for instance , as George Washington , whose became very soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come to America , principally on his account . Whilst in England and America I studied great deal , chiefly in science and language , and returned to Japan in 1868 when the war was going on . After the revolution , when Japanese began to introduce reform into the Government , I saw they were too igno .. rant in political matters to understand properly how to make new Constitution ; then I determined once more to come abroad to study especially the political condition of various countries . For six years I have been engaged in travel in Europe and America , and now I venture to tell my friends in this country my conclu-. sions . I beg they will forgive my frankness . When foreigners come to Japan they write quite freely what they think about it . Sometimes they write very foolish things , staying only short time , and telling results as if they had made deep studies . Sometimes they even say things which are not true and not kind . I will try and avoid this , but at the same time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it best to give this contribution to our readers in the form in which it reached us , without altering the idiom . - ED. // sincerely my feeling , because sometimes the view of the foreigner is of great assistance to a people . Japanese people received great benefit from the frank opinions about them of foreigners , because they were so accustomed to their faults , they never remarked them , but they were quite plain to strangers . It is the same with individuals . They can not see themselves exactly like others see them . It is true that there are plenty of European travellers who have written about America , but they are all Christians , and very often they write from jealousy and mean motives . Having same religion and same manners , they can not write so impartially as a man who comes from a much older and different kind of civilization , and who has no religion , but who tries to look at things from more high and pure ground of philosophy , which is taught by the great Master Confucius . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no other motive but to try and help them , by pointing out their faults , in the same way that many of their good missionaries have tried to help Japanese - but I shall not remark much upon their moral condition , however , now - though on this subject there is a great deal to be said , which I shall write in a book for Japanese in their own language . At present I desire rather to discuss American political state , because I have now studied very carefully for many months the interesting questions connected with this Government , and I think it might be possible to tell something that might improve it - but to propose any plan by which the moral condition of a people can be improved is indeed most difficult . I will now go on with my political reflexions . When I left Japan six years ago , I determined to study Europe first - to begin with the country whose political condition was most backward , and to end with the country whose political condition was most forward . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japan by San Francisco . In Turkey I remained very short time . It chiefly interested me on account of the effect of religion upon the Government . I then went to Vienna , Berlin , Rome , Paris and London . I stayed nearly one year at each place . Finally I came here . Now I see how . necessary it is to examine deeply political questions . When I was here the first time , I did not examine at all , and when I returned to Japan II still thought this country was more advanced than other countries // in political affairs . Now I have quite changed . I will state my reasons why I think , of all countries I have been in , this country is most backward . It is because here there is no change . In every other country there is change . The times we live in are the most changeable times that have ever been known . Japan changes , China changes even a little , Turkey changes also , only little , because of religion , all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hundred years never changes . Always just the same Constitution - but since that Constitution was made , steamboats , railroads , telegraphs , many wonderful things have been invented , so the manners and customs of people have been changed , their opinions about every thing are quite different , liberty and freedom are being every where introduced , only in America the rights of the people have not been increased for one hundred years . In Europe the people will not allow this ; they make revolutions , then comes more freedom . In twenty years how much has happened ! In Austria Hungary has been separated and free institutions have been given - with two chambers . At Vienna also in two chambers all different races in the empire are represented , and can talk freely . In Germany , Empire has been formed with chambers also rather free , only Bismarck has too much power , but there is no old Constitution to stop freedom when he dies . In Italy , the whole country has been united , bad Governments of Naples and Pope have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in chambers , quite free . In France , Empire has been abolished , free chambers have been established , only they have one bad thing , written Constitution , - only it is very short , and can easily be changed . In England , Queen has no power at all - House of Commons , that is , people 's House , has all power . Immediately when people want , they can change Government . One hundred years ago when American Constitution was made , people in Europe could not press themselves upon Governments ; now it is almost impossible for any Government to resist will of the people . In France it is quite impossible . Always almost immediately they make revolutions . In England , also , it is not possible . There the people make peaceable revolutions , but Government never can go against the people . Only here that is possible . This is the only country in the world , where , in // a popular election , majority can not elect their candidate . One hundred years ago this Government was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other Governments have moved on , pressed by the people , pressed by the people , always pressed ; so they go forward quite rapidly in a free direction . Only this never moves . It is the same with that remarkable people , the Chinese . I remark much resemblance between Americans and Chinese . Th*y are both afraid to move from old customs . This is in many respects a good thing . It is just opposite in Japan . Japanese go too fast ; they think they know everything , when they know very little , and they go on rashly - but Americans are too slow in politics . Owing to their splendid country , and to steamboats and railroads , they are increasing more rapidly in numbers than any other people in the world . So they have not the same excuse as Chinese . They are not increasing - so they do not require to change political institutions - but how can a Constitution which was made for two millions of people a hundred years ago , be good for forty millions of people now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and steam has altered every thing ? Then it was quite natural to elect a man to be President for four years , and give him almost same power as the King of England had then , and allow him to govern as he likes , even when the whole country is opposed to him . Then all the world was governed that way . I do not think in Europe now is one king who would dare to govern , like President Johnson , with the whole country against him , - only Prince Bismarck , or the Emperor of Russia , could perhaps try , but even then it would not be safe . In all the countries I visited in Europe , the Cabinets must be in the Houses of Legislature to answer to the people 's representatives . Only here members of Cabinet do not care about the people 's representatives ; they stay outside , they do what they like in their Councii with the President . He appoints who he likes to be his ministers . He has so much power he can even make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did the other day , and his measures . To get rid of him , the Congress must impeach him , but how difficult is this , and how bad it looks to the rest of the world ! So the Congress does not dare . Also he can bribe with offices so many people . What king can give so much without consulting the people 's two Houses of Legislature as the President of the United States ? Only // he must consult the Senate , but if he is obstinate man , they quarrel , then comes difficulty . If he is opposed in politics to Congress for four years , if they do not impeach him , they must veto his measures , if he wo n't yield . Then what ? If he proposes measures and the Congress vetoes them , and they wo n't yield - then what ? All this is very bad - very good a hundred years ago - but very bad now . Then the people did not know their rights , now they do . They want the President to govern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is called " popular government . " They are now o*oincr to have that in Japan . Surely it is time that this great b b country should have it also . Only one step have they made in a hundred years , and that is backwards , when they gave votes to a different race , who have no education and small intelligence , to help to elect a President who for four years is not responsible to anybody . Already it has been found that many things are not provided for in the Constitution . I counted nineteen difficulties during last election for which no provision was made in the Constitution . Suppose a negro is elected President , the Constitution permits him to have too much power . He should certainly be made responsible to the country . The only way to do this is to follow the example of more advanced countries of Europe , and oblige all the members of his Cabinet to be in the Congress . They would probably all be negroes , but if the country did not like them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to resign . In that way you could again get a white Cabinet , otherwise it is not possible . How can you go on with a Constitution that allows such great dangers to exist ? It has been proved , by what has just happened , that at any time they may occur again , but never again could you settle the question by eight to seven . I have conversed with many persons who say that never again will they agree to that . In Japan it would not be possible for those seven men to live , who have proposed this plan . After it failed they must commit seppukien , or the " self-despatch . " Though I do not approve this practice , I think , until countries have arrived at an advanced political state , it is in some respects good . It makes men very careful in proposing political plans . The practice , in this country , by which political enemies kill each other with pistols , does not make them so careful , but perhaps it is necessary while the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the introduction of popular government and a responsible Cabinet it might be abolished . In Japan it is hoped in the same way to abolish * self despatch , " which I think is a better check upon political violence and bad language than duels . In Japan all editors of newspapers writing like those in this country would be obliged  --  to perform this act , and even Mr. Tilden after he had got majority of nearly 300,000 votes could not survive his defeat with honor , but this is not because he has used bad language , but because he himself has been so much abused . For this reason he would have to commit seppuklcn . In my book which I am going to write in Japan upon the moral condition of this country , I will show how far the higher morality of Japan is due to seppuklcu , so that they may not abolish it rashly , or without providing some other check , by which all persons using violent language , slandering other persons , bribing other persons , being bribed , making false @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be restrained . None of these vices exist now in Japan . This is in consequence of former Government when such things were not possible . I believe they in this country entirely result from the hundred years old Constitution . It is true that I observe these same vices also in European countries but much less . As in Mahometan countries religion affects the politics , so also in Christian countries the vices of politics are different . As Japan is neither Mahometan nor Christian , I do not think that popular government , with responsible Cabinet , will produce the same vices as in Christian countries . They will be different , some kind of a vice made from mixture of Confucian Philosophy and Buddhism . If you had in this country Mikado , Emperor , or King , or Sultan , remedy would be easy , but , with President who has so much power , it is more difficult . It is always difficult when a man once has got power to take it away , and when he has got it by hundred year old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explain my meaning . To make this Republic into a more free Government , there is no necessity to change the name . To take away power from President , there is no necessity to change his name . So I do not propose , because I want to see this Government more free , to change any names ; the only thing to be done is , abolish the Constitution , then all is simple . Then make a law // that President must choc*se his Cabinet from two Houses of Congress . Then make another law and give more power to House of Representatives , because that is people 's House more than Senate . There are many reasons why it is not a good thing , when Government is responsible , for Senate to have more power than House of Representatives . Now it is necessary , because without responsible Cabinet the President is so powerful ; but when power is taken from President , then some power should also be taken from Senate and given equally to House of Representatives or lower House . Only in America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the power is in lower House . Then when the President and his Cabinet are in opposition to the country , at once you find it out in the House of Representatives much quicker than in the Senate . Immediately then there must be a vote of confidence in the Government . If the majority in the House of Representatives is against the Government , then at once the President and the Cabinet must both resign . The reason why it is best that the majority in the House of Representatives should decide this matter is , because they are elected every two years and the Senate only every six years ; therefore , when the opinion in the country changes , you see the change quickly in the House of Representatives , but only slowly in the Senate . So when the House of Representatives decides that the President and the Cabinet are governing opposite to the will of the people , naturally they must be at once turned out . This is free government , - it is very simple , but the American people do not yet understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old Constitution . At once a new President must be elected by the people , not as he is elected now , but directly by the people - something like the plan I read in the last number of this Review proposed by Ex-Senator Buckalew , so that it is impossible for minority to force him on majority . While he is being elected , the old President might still stay till new one is elected . If the old President thinks majority in the House of Representatives is mistaken , he might ask the country to elect him again . Then , if he is re-elected , he must choose different men for his Cabinet who can obtain a majority to support them , because it might be sometimes that country likes the President but does not like his Cabinet . Now the Senate can say if they do not // like the Cabinet , but the country can say nothing . Much bet .. ter plan is for the country to say if they do not like the Cabinet , and the Senate to say nothing . Very often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people must decide . Always in a free country people should decide every thing , - not Senate , not President , only people . This is difference between free government and old kind of government . With free government , all the power is with people ; with old government under hundred year old Constitution , people have no power ; only President and Senate have power . So , often there is danger . This danger will increase , because althoucrh the great American people , like Chinese , are most patient people , at last they will rebel , when they find that hundred year old Constitution makes only difficulty , and that sometimes one Judge of Supreme Court must be chosen to decide who is to be President . If the President promises some kind of reform and does not perform his promise because Senate will not allow him , even though people desire reform they can do nothing . They must wait four years . President Grant promised great deal ; he performed nothing , but people must wait . Now President Hayes promises reform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do nothing , because Senate will not let him , but people must wait . People do not approve all kinds of robbery and extravagance , but they can not prevent it . Always they must wait . How much longer will they wait and pay heavy taxes , to see their money make Senators and politicians and their friends rich ? Not always . In all countries except America there is a liberal or mdical party . This party is also called party of progress , or sometimes party of action . It is always in favor of reform , and desires to abolish old institutions and to secure more rights for the people . In this country there is no party of progress . There is the IRepublican party in favor of " federal rights , " and there is the Democratic party in favor of " State rights , " but there is no Reform party in favor of " people 's rights . " Republicans and Democrats are both old-fashioned Conservatives . In this country there are no real reformers in favor of radical changes , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now is not " going ahead " ; it is " going astern , " as sailors say . Excuse me if Jani speaking so plain . It is because I love American people very // much that I want to see them get their rights , and have pure and cheap government instead of dishonest and expensive one . Therefore reform is needed . Therefore hundred year old Constitution must be abolished . No other Constitution in the world is so old , it stops all reform . The other day I was reading Declaration of Independence , saying every man was born equal , and possesses inalienable right of life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness . This is only talking . Constitution does not secure this right . When I converse with colored person from Louisiana , he tells me life not safe , liberty only limited , pursuit of happiness very difficult . White persons from South Carolina explain exactly the same thing . They tell me Constitution prevents pursuit of happiness for white people in Southern States very much . Many clever politicians with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kinds of reform arises from old Constitution . One Republican gentleman very celebrated - therefore I can not tell his name - even said to me , " our Constitution is like an old gun , it wants new stock , new lock , and new barrel . " Therefore , no doubt , to throw away old Constitution would be a good thing ; only they say , Who can dare to say this ? It is too dangerous to propose such a thing ! No man will venture to be the first . Certainly he will be much attacked . People will say he is a revolutionist - but a nation which won its independence by warlike revolution need not be afraid of making progress by peaceable one . I think American politicians rather timid . Therefore , I am not writing for politicians , but for people - and already I have said enough . The American people are very clever people . They do not require long explanations ; only they require a hint . They are so busy making money they have not had time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . But what is the good of making money when you have to spend all in taxes ? When government is cheap , people get rich much quicker . Therefore , stop a little from making money and think how you can most quickly abolish Constitution and make reforms to suit present time . Better to do this now than wait till some revolution comes and you will lose all money . If Supreme Court Judge had not decided quickly the other day , even now you might have been fighting , and your money would be soon flying away . Next time , perhaps , you may // not find a Judge so clever and quick . Remember how great danger you have escaped . Every time you will not be so fortunate . This is very serious warning . American people are too thoughtless . When they escape danger , immediately they forget it . In this matter they are not like Chinese , more like French people . Chinese take warnings , reflect a great deal , but do n't change . French people never take warnings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Best plan is , - first , take warnings , then reflect , and then change . Do not say this is only Japanese , and his English is still not good , therefore he knows nothing . I pray you not to despise this because I am a man of low degree and moderate understanding , for this is a wise saying , " a precious stone in the dirt is apparently worthless , but he who discovers , polishes , and wears it , himself becomes of value . " When I was student in London , I learnt Latin , and when I read the motto upon your review I felt bold and became much encouraged , and I determined to write freely , because it told me you would receive truth impartially , no matter from whence it comes . Therefore , my American friends , I now call upon you to remember and to apply the words you have yourselves chosen - " Tros Tyriusque mihi nullo discrimine agetur .
