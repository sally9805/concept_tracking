SOME TALKS OF AN ASTRONOMER. 1. -A LOOK AT THE HEAVENS . YOU want to know how the planets are weighed ; how their distances are ascertained ; how we know that the earth turns on its axis and around the sun , and not the sun around the earth ; what sort of instruments are used in measuring the celestial spaces ; also something about comets , and something , moreover , about stellar astronomy in general . That is rather too much to tell at one time , but by a series of talks I may be able to make it all plain . You know that men found out at least some of these things before they had a telescope , and that by observations with the naked eye alone they were enabled to learn the main features of the system of the world . Let us , then , go out and view the heavens , and take our first lesson in astronomy with the naked eye . The first thing we notice is that all the heavenly bodies seem to be spread out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which we appear to be placed . One-half of this sphere is above the earth , extending down to the horizon on every side ; the other is below the horizon , and is therefore , together with the stars which stud it , invisible . The highest point is o ' *er our heads , the lowest one under our feet . This you see at the first glance . Now watch a few hours , and you will see that this whole sphere , with all the heavenly bodies which it contains , turns around from east to west . You know very well that the sun rises and sets daily ; but perhaps you have not noticed that most of the stars rise and set in like manner . Now let us examine more closely how this apparent diurnal motion of the heavens , or of the celestial sphere , takes place . The polar star never rises nor sets , and it changes its place in the heavens so slightly that unless we compare it with some fixed object we could see no movement at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can always be found . It is commonly called the " Dipper , " but astronomers call it Ursa Major , or the Great Bear . If you look out early on an autumn evening you will see it low down in the north , but in the mouth of May it will be high up , quite near the zenith . Here is a picture of it . Now OONBTELLATION OF URSA MAJOR . draw a line through the two stars on the right-hand end and continue it upward , and you see that it meets a tolerably bright star standing north nearly by itself . This is the polar star . Now if you watch this Dipper a few hours , you will see it moving around toward the west ; if you should watch it all night , you will see it moving down toward the northwestern side of the horizon , passing toward the east under the pole , and rising upon the northeastern side . In fact , it de // scribes a complete circle round the polar star , always keeping at the same distance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the polar star , and in the autumn near the zenith , is called Cassiopeia , or " the lady in her chair . " You perceive that if we take any star a little further from the pole than the Dipper , it dips below the horizon in its daily revolution , and the further we go from the pole , the treater length of time it will be below the horizon . A star which when it passes above the pole is directly over our heads will , in this country , be from one to two or three hours below the horizon , according to the latitude of the place we are in . Now if a straight line is drawn from the pole to where we stand it will strike the earth at this point . Continue it right through the earth THE IMAGINARY OELE5TIAL srHzRz , A5 IT WOULD APPzAR FROM THE EARTH . The earth in the centre at C. G H , the horizon . P , the north or visible pole .. Q , the south pole , invisible hecause below our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its whole diurnal revolution around the pole P without dipping below the horizon at all , as shown by the dotted line S H. Between S and E more than half its course will be above the horizon , and at E , or the equator , exactly half . Between E and G more than half its course will be below the horizon , and south of G it will turn round the pole Q without rising at alL in a slanting direction , and it will point toward the other pole of the heavens , or the south pole , which we can not see because of its being below the horizon . Around this line as an axis the heavens seem to revolve . A circle which spans the heavens half-way between the two axes is called the equator . In our latitude it is a little more than halfway from the south horizon up to the zenith . A star in the equator will rise exactly in the east and set exactly in the west , and will be below the horizon just half the time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you will find that , with the exception of five , they all preserve the same positions relatively to each other during their daily revolution , just as if they were set in a solid sphere of crystal , which sphere itself turned around on the axis we have described . So perfectly do they all seem to keep their po sitions that if Job should rise from the dead he would now see Arcturus and the Pleiades just as he saw them when he was on the earlAx four or five thousand years ago . But there are seven heavenly bodies which do not so keep their positions-they are the sun , the moon , and the five planets visible to the naked eye . IL-MOTION OF THE SUN AND PLANETS . If we were only to look at the heavens one or two evenings , we would not observe that there was any change in the relative positions of the sun and stars ; but if we should take a good time-piece and watch the time at which a certain star sets or passes the meridian to-night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same star to-morrow night , we should find that it occurred four minutes earlier , and as long as we chose to watch it we should find it four minutes earlier every day . That is to say , the stars do not , like the sun , revolve around the earth in one day , but in twenty-three hours and fifty-six minutes . Now why is this ? To answer this question clearly we must remember that if it were not for the glare of sunlight illuminating the atmosphere , we should see stars in the daytime as well as in the night . Really the whole sphere of the heavens is studded with stars , and they are as thick around the sun as any where else , only that we can not see them . Now a star which sets to-night at nine o'clock in the west will , as I explained , set four minutes before nine to-morrow night , eight minutes before nine the night after , and so on . Consequently , if we watch night after night , we will soon find that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sight of it . This shows that the sun is moving nearer and nearer to the star . If we keep calculating our four minutes earlier every day , we find that in three months it sets six hours earlier , thus it sets at three o'clock in the afternoon , and therefore before the sun . We conclude from this that the sun , after moving nearer and nearer the star , has now gone past it . If we continue our watch for a whole year , we will find that the star sets at the same hour it did a year ago , having in the mean while set at every four minutes throughout the day and night . This shows , therefore , that the sun in the course of a year passes all the stars in succession which lie on his path , and in fact makes a complete revolution around this starry sphere . If we could see the stars around the sun , and should watch the sun from the time that it rose in the morning until it set in the evening , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a space nearly equal to its own diameter , and next morning we should find when it rose again that it advanced nearly another of its diameters ; and thus it goes day after day , moving nearly two of its own diameters along the starry // sphere , and this motion in the course of a year carries it all the way around and brings it back to where it started from . The stars , then , seem to rise and set a little fnster than the sun . The sun rises and sets 365 times n as many days , while the stars rise and set 366 times . Let me try to make this clear by another illustration : If you watch those two pointers as they pass above the pole , you will see them to-night pass a certain point , let us say , at nine o'clock . To-morrow night they would pass four minutes earlier , and four minutes earlier every night following , so that after three months you will have to look at three o'clock in the evening . Of course daylight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really there , and you would see them but for the glare of the sun . Three months more they are there at nine o'clock in the morning ; three months more they are there at three o'clock in the morning , and you can now see them once more . About the 1st of March they cross at two minutes past twelve in the morning , and on the following night they would cross two minutes before midnight . This brings them across once more at nine o'clock of the same hour and evening on which they started . You see now that on the 1st of March there were really two passages across the meridian , the one taking place just after midnight , and the other just before the midnight following . This annual motion of the sun around the celestial sphere was one of the earliest astronomical discoveries . The path in which it moves was mapped out in the heavens at an age so early that we scarcely know by whom it was done . If the sun left any trace we could see it as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactly what stars it passed , and on what day it passed over them . That reddish star which we see rising in the east during the autumn evenings is called Aldebaran ; the sun will pass directly over that star about the end of May . The twelve constellations through which it passes were called the constellations of the zodiac , and the names Aries , Taurus , etc. , which are so familiar to you , were given to them by the ancients . Now one thing that is very noticeable in this path described by the sun is that it is not every where at the same distance from the pole . If we measure with our instrument , we shall find that on the 21st of March the sun is just 900 distant from the polar star . If we then watch its course , we shall find that it comes nearer and nearer in the three months following . On the 21st of June we find it between 660 and 670 distant . Since the equator is every where 900 distant , the sun is then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the farther a heavenly body is from the pole the longer the time that it is below the horizon . At the equator it is above the horizon half the time , and below it half the time . Consequently during the time of which we speak , when the sun is between the equator and the pole , more than half his path is above the horizon , and therefore the days are more than twelve hours long . Let us keep up our measurements until the 21st of September . We shall then find that the sun has moved south again until it is 900 from the pole . One-half of its course then lies above the horizon , and the other half below ; it is therefore below the horizon half of the time , and the nights are just as long as the days . His southern course still continues until the 21st of December , when we shall find that he is 23*O south of the equator , and therefore 113j0 from the pole . More than half its course is now below the horizon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were on the 21st of June , and vice v sa . That you may fully understand all this we give on pages 696 and 697 maps of the southern constellations , showing the oblique path of the sun through them during the entire year . It is owing , then , to this oblique motion of the sun that the changes of seasons , and the variations of the length of day and night at different seasons , are due . The result is precisely the same whether we suppose that the sun moves around the earth or the earth around the sun . Now let us pass from the sun to the moon . We have in her case a motion among the stars similar to that presented by the sun , which I have just described , only much more rapid . Thus the moon rises and sets later every evening by an amount averaging neariy three-quarters of an hour . If you watch the moon when she has passed her first quarter , and before she is full , you may actually see her motion among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of twilight , you will see that in the six or eight hours which elapse before she sets she has moved quite a perceptible distance toward the east ; and if you look again on the following night , you will see that she is 130 , or nearly so , east from the same star . If you keep up the watch for twenty-seven days , you will find that she has made the complete circuit of the heavens , and is now back again near the same starting-point at which you first saw her . If the sun and stars preserve the same relative positions , she would come back to the sun in the same length of time , and we would have a new moon every twenty-seven or twenty-eight days . But while the moon is going around , the sun is also moving among the stars , and having moved forward during an interval between two new moons , it takes the moon between two and three days to catch up to him again ; consequently the time from one new moon to another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maps on pages 696 and 697 show all the constellations of the zodiac and other southern constellations , as well as the apparent paths of the sun and moon through them . The continuous line shows the sun 's path , or the ecliplic , the dotted one the moon 's path , the latter being that which she followed in the middle of 1874 . The months at the top of the map show when the constellations under them are on the meridian at 9 o'clock P.M. For instance , in the middle of December at this hour Aries will he on the meridian and nearly overhead ; Taurus , including Aldebaran and the Plelades , will he the next to the east ; Orion will he low in the southeast ; Sirius and Procyon will be just rising ; while the square of Pegasus will be two hours west of the zenith . qwq in nearly all that part of the heavens which we can see in the evenings of that month ; hut it approaches the sun 's path , and crosses it near the eastern horizon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or that part below the horizon , the moon 's path is farther north . All this will be clear on examining the star maps , where the dotted line shows the path of the moon during 1874 , crossing the sun 's path in the constellations Aries and Libra . These two opposite points in which the moon 's path crosses the path of the sun are called the nodes . It is very clear that unless the sun is near one of the moon 's nodes when the moon herself passes by , the moon will pa.ss above or below the sun , according as her path is above or below that of the sun at this point , and consequently there will be no eclipse . But if the sun happens to be near the node , then the moon will necessarily pass over his face and eclipse some portion of him . Now , as I have just explained , there are two opposite nodes ; the one set a few hours ago , and the other has just risen . Since the sun makes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , he crosses the moon 's nodes twice in that time . In 1874 he crossed one node in May , and will cross the other node in November ; consequently it is only about these two times that any eclipse can take place during this year . If the moon always followed the same path in the heavens , we could never have any eclipses but at those two seasons . But if we watch the motions of the moon for several years in succession , we shall find that her path is continually changing . At the present time she passes seven degrees north of Aldebaran ; a month hence she will seem to pass the star at almost exactly the same distance ; but if you continue yout observations for four or five months , you will find that she passes it perceptibly farther north , and in three years you will find that she crosses it at the distance of about ten degrees . After that she would begin to cross farther south , passing nearer Aldebaran at every revolution for eight years , until in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If the moon 's path were painted on the heavens , you would see that every time the moon came roimd to the same point in her path , which takes place about every twenty-seven days , she would cross the sun 's path about three of her own diameters sooner than the month before . In the course of a year , therefore , she will have crossed about thirty-six diameters sooner , or farther to the west . In the course of twenty years you will find that this motion has been kept up until she crosses at the same point she does now , and thus the nodes have made a complete circuit of the heavens . The seasons of eclipses vary , therefore , in the same manner . This year they are in May and October ; in five years from now they will occur three months earlier , and we shall have them in February and August ; five years more , and they will be iu October and May ; five years more , in August and February ; five years more , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The motions of the sun and moon , which I have just described , are comparatively simple ; but those of the five planets visible to the naked eye , Mercury , Venus , Mars , Jupiter , and Saturn , are very complicated . Venus and Mercury always follow the sun ; they seem to vibrate on each side of him , Venus to the distance of about 45O* and Mercury about 250 . The three other planets seem to move among the stars sometimes in the same directi&amp;n with the sun , and sometimes in the opposite direction . The general rule in the case of Mars , Jupiter , anl Saturn is that whenever they are any where near the sun , or even at right angles to his direction , they appear to move in the same direction among the stars iu which he moves , but more slowly . But when their direction is opposite that of the sun , they always move in the opposite direction . This seemingly irregular motion was one which greatly perplexed the ancient astronomers , and to account for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hypothesis they supposed a point to move around in the heavens with a nearly uniform motion in the same manner that the sun and moon Tuoved . From this point they supposed an arm to extend , and at the end of this arm the planet was supposed to be carried . This arm they supposed to revolve around once in a year . The combined motions of the point around the heavens and of the planet around the point represented in a rough way the motion of the planet . Of course they did not believe that any such machinery as this really existed . They employed it only as a means of representing the apparent motions of these three planets . IlL-TIlE TRUE MOTIONS OF THE HEAVENS . What I have just been describing to you is the apparent motion of the heavenly bodies as visible to an observer here on the earth . You see that by simple observatious , such as can be made with the naked eye , we have found that the sun appears to make the circuit of the starry sphere once in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of seasons , and the difference of the length of days and nights at different seasons of the year , and we have found in a general way the cause of eclipses , and the reason they do not always occur at the same season . But in the modern system of astronomy the motions which we have described , excepting that of the moon , are only apparent // motions , not real ones . This annual motion of the sun in the heavens is really due to an annual motion of the earth around the sun . Suppose that I stand in the centre of this room , and that you walk around me , keeping near the sides of the room , and keeping your eyes fixed on me as you move . The direction in which you see me continually changes . Now you see me toward the window ; now I am between you and the grate ; now I am between you and the door . If you did not know that you were moving , it would seem to you that I was moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earth and sun , the earth moves around the sun once a year ; therefore in the course of a year the sun is seen every day in a different direction among the stars . You always see the sun in an opposite direction from that which an observer on the sun would see the earth ; aud thus , as in your course around me I am successively seen between you and the window , the grate , and the door , so is the sun successively seen between us and all the stars which lie in a certain plane in which the earth moves . We have started with the diurnal motion of the stars around the earth . This motion is not real , but apparent , being due to the motion of the earth around the axis passing through it . I have described to you two apparent motions , one of the whole celestial sphere , carrying with it sun , planets , and stars around a certain axis of the heavens , and therefore around the earth , every day ; the other an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the stars . To prove the earth 's motion every day on its axis we must begin by answering the natural objections to it . The first objection made by the ignorant is that if this were so , objects would fall off the earth on the other side . This objection , however , is scarcely worth talking about with any intelligent person . The evidence of the senses on a large scale shows us that the earth is really a sphere , and even the ancients knew very well that the direction which we call down , i. e. , the direction which a stone falls , is not every where the same , but that at every point of this sphere it tends toward the centre of it . In whatever way we suppose the earth to move , there would therefore be no change in the apparent direction in which a body would Call . A stronger objection is that we have no consciousness of such motion , but that bodies can move about on the surface of the earth with the same apparent freedom as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who has ever been in a steamboat knows that we are entirely unconscious of any motion which is regular and uniform . As the steamboat passes an island , the island seems to every one on board to be in motion and to pass the boat , and it is only by the reason of the thing , and not by any direct evidence of the senses on the part of the passengers , that they know that it is the boat that is , moving , and not the island . We have , therefore , no direct evidence whatever that the earth is at rest any more than that the heavens are at rest ; but the question whether it is the earth or heavens which move is to be decided entirely by finding which explains the observed facts most simply and reasonably , and of which motion we have most evidence . To one acquainted with the whole subject , the matter is so obvious that arguing it is like having to argue on board of the steamboat that it is the boat and not the island which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that observations hereafter to be explained will show that the heavens are immensely larger than the earth . Suppose the heavens to move , the motions would be so rapid and so complicated that ulo imaginable force would account for them ; whereas the motion of the earth explains every thing in a most simple manner , and in perfect accordance with the laws of mechanics . But we have two direct proofs that the earth does really revolve . One is afforded by the celebrated Foucault pendulum experiment . If we suspend an immense pendulum from some very high point , like the dome of the Capitol at Washington , and start it swinging , we shall find that it does not swing all day in the same apparent direction . In this latitude we shall find that , after nine hours , it is swinging apparently at right angles to the direction in which we started it . Now by the laws of motion the pland in which a pendulum swings is invariably the same so The above figure represents a plane or table on the top of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To this table are fixed two rods , from which is suspended a pendulum , moving freely in any direction . The pendulum is made to vibrate in the path a b ; it will continue to vibrate in this line , and have no apparent circular or angular motion until the globe revolves , when it will appear to have vibrated through the entire circle , to en object fixed on the table and moviny with it . It is scarcely necessary to say the circular motion of the pendulum is only apparent , since it is the table that revolves  --  the apparent motion of the pendulum in a circle being the same as the apparent motion of the laud to a person on hoard ship , or the recession of the earth to a person in a balloon . PRN*ULUM ExPEaIMENr. // long as the pendulum is not touched , and no force is applied to change it . The fact that the pendulum must be swinging in the same dii ? ection and that it appears to chauge shows that the building in which it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course of nine hours , and would make a complete revolution in thirty - six hours . You ask , Why not a whole revolution in a ( lay ? It would make a whole revolution in a day if we were near the north pole ; but the pendulum necessarily swings in a vertical axis , and as the direction of the earth 's axis to the vertical is here oblique , the earth does not revolve so rapidly relatively to its vertical axis as it does relatively to the real axis . When we reach the equator the axis of the earth is at right angles to that of the pendulum , and there is no motion around the vertical line in which the pendulum hangs . At the equator , therefore , the pendulum will always swing in the direction in which it is starte*l . The other direct proof of the earth 's rotation is afforded by the form of the earth , and the force of gravity at its different parts . If the earth were at rest the weight of bodies on every part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tendency of every part toward the centre would result in the earth being round . But we find by actual measurement that the earth is flattened at the poles and bulges out at the equator . We find also that heavy bodies are lighter the nearer we take them to the equator . This we can attribute only to the centrifugal force produced by the earth 's rotation . The proofs , then , that the earth moves are these three : firstly , the Foucault pendulum ; secondly , the flattening of the earth at the poles ; thirdly , the fact that the apparent motions of theheavenlybodies around the earth every day , and their irregular motions in the heavens , which we have described , can not be accounted for in any reasonable manner by mechanical laws if we suppose them to be real , while on the other hand , if we suppose it is the earth which revolves , every thing is accounted for in the most simple manner possible . In fact , so simply are the apparent motions of the heavens thus accounted for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been universally accepted in ancient times had the ancients been acquainted with the laws of motion . It was only because Ptolemy supposed that light bodies would he left behind if the earth revolved from west to east with so great a velocity that he was led to dispute the fact . But how do we know that the apparent motion of the sun in the heavens which we have described is really a motion of the earth around the sun ? So far as the motion of the sun alone is concerned , we can account for it just as well one way as the other . But when we consider the motions of the planets , we find a system which we can not account for but by the motion of the earth . I have already stated that the apparent motions of the planets may be represented by a combination of two separate motions ; the one is that of an imaginary point in a regular orbit around the heavens , and the other is a motion around this moving point . The combination of these two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to conceive from what cause it could occur , for although we can imagine a planet moving around the sun , it is very difficult to conceive why it should describe a regular curve around an imaginary point , which not only does not really exist , but is itself in rapid motion . Now this motion , in the case of all the planets , does not occur every day , but takes place once a year , and all the planets go in the same direction at the same time , so far as each is concerned . For instance , if the planet Venus is to-day moving east in this imaginary circle , the planets Mars , Jupiter , and Saturn are also moving east in the same circle , and as they curve their motions around toward the south and west , the other planets seem to curve their motions around toward the south and west . Not only so , but the sun also appears to move in this same direction . In a word , besides their regular forward motions around the heavens , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motion around an imaginary point , corresponding to that of the sun around the earth . It is impossible to conceive how any force should act so as to produce this motion . The fact that it is common and simultaneous in the case of all the planets shows that it must he produced by some common cause . l*ow the theory of the motion of the earth accounts for it in the most simple manner by showing that it is not real but only apparent , being due to the motion of the earth itself around the sun . I have already partly explained that when we stand on any body which is moving forward with a regular and uniform motion , we become unconscious of the motion , and all the bodies which we see appear to be moving in an opposite direction . Now if a party in a steamboat which was sailing among a group of islands should describe all the islands as moving together-first to the east , then to the south , then to the north , and then to the west , we should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is moving , and not the islands . " In the same way , it is perfectly reasonable to us that in the case of the planets this oscillatory motion is simply due to the fact that the earth is moving around the sun in the opposite direction , and is therefore not real . Making this hypothesis , we find the motions extremely simplified ; we get rid of the motions around imaginary centres entirely , and we find the smaller // qwq cessive generations of mathematicians show that these small forces may be represented by gravitations of the planets toward each other . We thus arrive at the theory of universal gravitation , which maybe expressed thus : Every particle of matter in the universe attracts every other particle with a force inversely as the square of the distance which separates them . It is not impossible that this force in some future time may be itself explained by some other law ; but the fact of its existence is as evident to the reason and senses of every man who has ever thoroughly observed and investigated the celestial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is evident to us all from our earliest infancy . v.-TIIE TELESCOPE . Every one knows that this instrument is one by which distant bodies are apparently brought nearer to the eye , but the principles of its construction are not so widely known . Let us begin by considering some elementary optical principles . Yon know that a body is rendered visible only by the light which emanates from it and reaches the eye . If we can make light emanate from a point of space where there is no body in the same manner it would if a body was there , we should seem to see the body although none really exists . Now the fundamental principle on which the telescope is constructed is this : A certain quantity of light which emanates from the surface of a body and reaches the instrument is to be brought to a single point . The eye , viewing this point , will apparently see the real body there . This point toward which all the rays converge is called the focus , and the imaginary object which we thus see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body . This image may be viewed with a magnifying-glass , just as we would view any small object held in our hands . There are two ways in which the light which comes from a distant body may be brought to the focus ; one is by reflection from a concave mirror , and the other is by passing through a lens or system of lenses like a common burning-glass . The first telescopes were made on the latter principle . We give a figure of a telescope of the simplest construction , as it was made by the successors of Galileo . All the rays of light which come from a star are , on pass*ng through the first lens ( called the objectumrreuENxsN TELESCOPE , eALILEo. glass or objective ) , bent out of their course in such a manner as to converge to the point F , which is called the focus of the glass . In front of F a little magnifying-glass , or pair of magnifying-glasses , is placed , and the eye , looking into this glass , sees the enlarged image of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the focus . In order to keep out all other light except that which emanates from the object , and in order also to make the two glasses preserve the same relative positions , these two lenses are placed in a long tube . this telescope is subject to a great imperfection , arising from a well-known property of the refraction of light . You know very well from an experiment with a prism that when light is refracted by a lens it is at the same time decomposed into the prismatic colors , red , yellow , blue , etc. , the red light being refracted or bent out of its conrs'e the least , the blue or violet rays the most . No substance has yet been found which will refract light of all colors equally . The conseqnence is that as the light passes through the glass , the blue rays , being refracted the most , go to the focus at G , nearer the objectglass than the red rays , which , being refracted least , will come to the focus at F. As all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is impossible to get any accuraic image of a star or other object at which the telescope is pointed , but , on the contrary , we have a confused mixture of images of Varions colors . This defect may be greatly lessened by making the telescope very long ; and the astronomers of the seventeenth cen // tury used to make lenses of thirty , fifty , or even a hundred feet focal length , and raise them up in the air , without any tube at all , on top of long poles . Such telescopes were of necessity very inconvenient for use . So serious and unavoidable did this defect of the refracting telescope appear to be that the making of a refracting telescope which would give a perfect image was for a long time deemed entirely impracticable . But toward the end of the last cen / tury it was found by Dolland , an English optician , that this C ) defect of the refracting tele z &lt; / 0 scope could be almost com* / * pletely cured by making the kAWz object-lens of two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flint-glass and AchROMATIc crown-glass refracted the light OBJEcT-GLASS. almost equally , but that the former disperses it or separates it into these prismatic colors about twice as much as cro ' *n-glass . Accordingly , if you combine a prism of crown-glass with a prism of flint-glass having half the refracting angle in such a manner that they should act on the light in opposite directions , the flintglass would disperse the light in one direction as strongly as the crown-glass in the other direction , and the lights of all colors would pass through the two prisms without LASSELL 'S GREAT REFLECTOR . any separation , while the greater refracting power of the crown-glass would cause all the light to be refracted out of its course . The achromatic objective is constructed on this principle . It consists of a double-convex lens of crown-glass and of a concave lens of flint-glass . The latter is ground nearly flat on the one side and concave on the other . Passing through this combination of glass , the light of all colors is brought almost absolutely to the same focus . Perfectly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by means of the eyeglass . The eyeglass of the telescope is commonly composed of two lenses of short focus . One lens will do ; but a combination of two can be so employed as to give much greater distinctness , and enable a much larger portion of the object to be seen distinctly in one view . The magnifying power of the telescope depends on the focal length of the object-glass and the power of the eye-piece . It may therefore be varied by simply changing the latter . The rule is to divide the focal length of the object-glass by the focal length of the eye-piece , and the quotient will give the magnifying power of the telescope . For example , if with a telescope ten feet long I employ an eye-piece of one inch focus , the focal length of the object-glass being one hundred and twenty times that of the eye-piece , will magnify one hundred and twenty times . If the eye-piece is only of half an inch focal length , the telescope willmagnifytwohundred and forty times ; while , if it is two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thus with any given telescope the astronomer may employ any power he pleases by simply using the proper eye-piece . This being the case , you may inquire why can not the smallest telescope be made to magnify to any required extent by simply using an eyepiece proportionately small I ' The reason is that the quantity of light thatwe getfrom an object is of great importance . When we look directly at an object we get from it all the light which falls within the pul ) il of the eye , the diame / // LI -- HORIZONTAL 5EOTION OF A NEWTONIAN TELESCOPE . terofwhichisabont one-fifth of an inch . When we look at it with a telescope we get only the light which falls within the object-glass of the instrument , and the objectlooks dim in proportion to the square of the magnifying power . If we have a telescope of five inches focns , and the aperture of the object-glass is twenty-five times that of the pupil , we can then employ a magnifying power up to twenty-five times without producing any dimness of the object . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the object is dimmed in the same proportion . If we carry it above two hundred and fifty times , this dimness increases so rapidly that in the case of the more distant and faint planets and the nebuhe the magnifying power will be more than neutralized by the deficiency of illumination . This difficulty does not apply to the case of a star which has no apparent surface . But there is another defect inherent to small object-glasses . No objectglass will bring the light to a mathematical point in the focus , but the very best glass forms a small round image surrounded by a circle of light . The larger the object-glass , the smaller its image and circle are . This effect is termed diffraction . The consequence is that in looking through a small telescope with a high magnifying power we introduce a certain indistinctness . And if we carry the magnifying power from fifty to one hundred times for every inch aperture of the telescope , the increased magnifying power will be neutralized by an indistinctness . An example of this indistinctness can be very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fine needle . On looking at objects through this bole you will not perceive them clearly , but they will This section shows how the luminous rays reflected from the parabolic mirror M meet a small rectangular prism m n , which replaces the inclined plane mirror used in the old form of Newtonian telescope . After undergoing a total reflection from m n , the rays form at e b a very small image of the heavenly body . This image is viewed through an eye-piece with four lenses placed on the side of the telescope , and magnifying from CO to 500 times , according to the size of the silvered mirror . all be a little softened and blurred , as thougli they were seen over water . Their appearance is exactly that which would be presented by a distant object seen through the most perfect telescope under the most favorable circumstances when a great magnifying power is used . A yet greater foe to astronomical observation is the atmosphere , as all objects seen through it are tremulous and indistinct . If you have ever noticed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hot summer 's day , you have seen a certain waviness of outline combined with a slight trembling . If you look with a telescope , you will find that this tremulousness increases in direct proportion to the magnifying power . In the night it can not be seen at all with the naked eye , but with a telescope it is seen to a greater or less extent at all times . Only on very rare occasions is the atmosphere so still that it does not interfere with the telescopic vision in this way . The higher the magnifying power employed , the more this tremulousness is magnified , and the rarer the cases in which distinct vision can be obtained . It has sometimes been said that Sir William Herschel employed power as high as six thousand on one of his great telescopes . If so , it is not likely that he saw any thing with the slightest distinctness . We sometimes hear it said that the moon has been brought within forty miles by the aid of the largest telescopes . I doubt whether the moon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it would be seen with the naked eye at a distance of four hundred miles . The refracting or achromatic telescope , as I have described it , is that now ordinarily used in astronomical work . But I have said that the rays of light can also be brought to a focus by a concave mirror . A telescope made in this manner is called a reflecting telescope . Most of the celebrated instruments of which we have read , like those of Herschel , Lord Rosse , and Lassell , were of this HEIISOHELIAN TELESCOPE . In this telescope the mirror was so inclined that the image of the star was formed at e b , on the side of the telescope near the eye-piece e ; hence it is termed the front-view telescope . As the rays in this telescope undergo only a single reflection , the loss of light is less than in either of the preceding cases , and the image is therefore brighter . The magnifying power is the quotient of the principal focal distance of the mirror by the focal distance of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from right to left , and the observer notes the time of passing across each of the five lines . and note accurately the points of the circle , the number of degrees , minutes , and seconds that are under the four microscopes ; then we point the telescope on the other star as it crosses the meridian , and again determine the degrees , minutes , and seconds which are under the microscope . The difference of the two gives the difference of the altitudes of the two stars when they cross the meridian . We also determine by means of the same instrument , combined with the astronomical clock , the interval of time which elapses between the crossing of one star and the crossing of another . The combination of this difference with the difference of meridian altitudes affords the means of calculating accurately the relative positions of the two stars .
