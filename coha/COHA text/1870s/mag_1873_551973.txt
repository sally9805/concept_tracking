THE QUARREL OF JEFFERSON AND HAMILTON . POLITENESS appears to have been invented to enable people who would naturally fall out to live together in peace . And there is great need of etiquette in a world where antipathy plays a part not less essential than sympathy . It is as necessary to the continuance of animated nature that cat and dog should hate , as that cat and cat shoujd love . A genuine and profound antipathy , therefore , may exist without either of the parties being to blame ; and in our complicated civilization , vast numbers of us are compelled to live in the nearest intimacy , or labor in the closest contact , with persons between whom and ourselves there is this incurable dislike . In such cases there is no peace , no dignity , save through the resolute observance of-all the etiquette which the situation imposes . It was this that kept our two secretaries , Jefferson and Hamilton , on friendly terms with one another for many months after both had discovered that they differed in fob and on every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past reconciliation . It was difficult to quar rel with Jefferson ; since , besides being nat , urally placable and good-tempered , he had a vivid sense of the value of peace and a singular knowledge of the arts by which peace is preserved . He advised his daughters to avoid breaking with disagreeable people as long as they could with hon or . Sacrifices and suppressions of feeling for such an object , he thought , cost much less pain than open separation . The effort of self-control was soon forgotten ; but an open brea*ch " haunts the peace of every day . " Hamilton , too , though much spoiled by applause too early and too easily won , was a good fellow ; amiable at home , agreeable abroad ; who sang his old song of The Drum at the annual dinner of the Cincinnati , and was welcome in all companies and circles till political differences embittered men s minds . What a pleasant picture we have of the breakfast scene at his house , No. 24 Broadway , the mother seated at the head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cutting slices of bread from a great family loaf of the olden time , and spreading them with butter for the younger boys , who stood Entered according to Act of Cqngress , in the year 1873 , by JAMES R.

XXXI. - NO. 185. // round her , ' reading in turn from the Bible or Goldsmith 's History of Rome ; while the father , in the room adjoining , was seated at the piano playing an accompaniment to his daughter 's new song , or singing it to her accompaniment . When the lessons were finished and a stately pile of bread and butter w*i.s ready , all the eight children came to breakfast ; after which , the younger ones were packed off to school , and the father went to his office . Who more generous than that father ? There is a portrait of Mrs. Hamilton , as one of her sons relates , bearing the name of the painter , " T. Earle , 1787 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in the debtors ' prison at the time , and Hamilton induced his young wife to go to the prison and sit for her portrait . She persuaded other ladies , and thus the artist gained money enough to pay his debts and get out of jail . No man was more ready than Hamilton to set on foot such good-natured schemes , though himself never too far from the debtors ' prison . At this very time , - 1791 to 1794 ,  --  while he was handling millions upon millions of the public money , he was pinched severely in the effort to live upon his little salary . " If you can conveniently lend me twenty dollars for a few days , " he wrote to a friend , in September , 1791 , " be so good as to send it by the bearer . " The friend sent a check for fifty dollars . And Talleyrand said , in 1794 , after coming from Hamilton 's house , " I have beheld one of the wonders of the world , - a man who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support a family . " Talleyrand made another remark upon Hamilton . When Mr. George Ticknor visited him in 1819 , the old diplomatist was so warm in his eulogy of Hamilton , that the American was disposed modestly to *waive part of the compliment by saying that the public men of Europe had to do with larger masses and wider interests . " But , " said Talleyrand , " Hamilton had divined Europe . " He may have di-March , vined Europe . His misfortune was , that he had not divined America . In Europe , after a drill of twenty-five years in the British House of Commons , he might have been another Canning , * a liberal Tory , the forerunner of Peel and Palmerston . In American politics it was impossible that he should ever have been at home , because he never could believe the truths , nor share the hopes , upon which the American system is based . In an ordinary period , however , he might have co-operated with Jefferson for a while , - both being gentlemen and patriots , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ losing its senses * and the discussions of the Cabinet had a bass accompaniment out of doors , ever deepening , always becoming more vehement . And it is but fair to remember that , if Jefferson had the inarticulate masses of the American people at his back , Hamilton was ceaselessly flattered by the articulate class , - the bar , the bench , the college , the drawing-room , the pulpit , the bureau . These two men , even if they had not become mutually repellant , would have been pulled apart by their adherents . When the government , in 1790 , removed from New York to Philadelphia , John Pintard , the translating clerk in the Department of State , chose not to go with it , and Jefferson gave the place - salary two hundred and fifty dollars a year - to the " poet Freneau , " an old college classmate and friend of Madison and Henry Lee . Captain Philip Freneau , a native of New York , besides being a kind of mild American Peter Pindar , had suffered and sung the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was the bright , popular writer of his day , both in prose and verse ; and , as he had contemplated " the British model " from the pestilential steerage of the Scorpion frig*ate anchored in the Hudson , he was never " bewitched " by it ; but remained , to the end of his long life , a sound republican . No appointment could have been more natural , more proper , or more agreea The Quc*rrel of Yefferson and Hamilton . // ble to the public . In recommending it , Mr. Madison 's chief motive was to promote the interest of his friend , then gaining a precarious and slender livelihood as man-of-all-work on the New York Daily Advertiser . But he had another object in view . Restive under the opposition of Hamilton 's organ at Philadelphia , the Gazette of the United States , Madison and Governor Henry Lee of Virginia had formed the project of setting up a weekly republican journal at the seat of government , to be edited , perhaps , by Captain Freneau . This scheme , half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but have had the approval of the Secretary of State , stranger though he was to Freneau ; and this may have suggested a remark which the Secretary made in his note , offering him the place . The salary , Mr. Jefferson observed , was very low ; but the office " gives so little to do as not to interfere with any other calling the person may choose , which would not absent him from the seat of government . " Eight months after , October 31 , 1791 , appeared the first number of the National Gazette , edited by Philip Freneau ; capital furnished by Madison and Lee ; twenty-one subscribers previously obtained by Jefferson among his neighbbrs in Virginia . Thus there were two Gazettes at Philadelphia , - Fenno 's daily and Freneau 's weekly ; the one Hamiltonian , the other Jeffersonian . But the only part which the Secretary of State took in the management of Freneau 's Gazette was to lend the editor the foreign newspapers which came to the department . " I never did , " he once wrote , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say a syllable , nor attempt any kind of influence , .... nor write , dictate , or procure any one sentence to be inserted , in Freneau 's or any other gazette , to which my name was not affixed , or that of my office . " The enterprise was chiefly Madison 's , who wished to have a weekly paper of republican politics for circulation in all the States , Bache 's daily paper not going much The Quarrel of 7efferson and Hamilton . 259 beyond the city of Philadelphia . Jefferson 's sympathy with the object was complete ; but the fact of Freneau 's holding an office in his department is itself a kind of proof that he could not have regarded or used the paper as a personal organ . How absurd the supposition that a " politician " would thus display his hand ! If Frene*u 's Gazette had been designed as Jefferson 's organ , Jefferson surely would have begun by removing Freneau from office . If the reader will turn over the files of Fenno , preserved in several public libraries , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it . No opportunity was lost by the editor of reflecting upon republican institutions ; and the adulation of the President was unceasing and offensive . Whatever question was uppermost , this Gazette of the United States might be depended upon for taking the side least characteristic of the United States . The burden of its song was , Government by the people is anarchy . If any one ventured to ask a Federalist , Why , then , are we not anarchic ? the answer was , The high character of the President , and the universal awe which that character inspires , hold the demagogues in some decent show of restraint . It is WASHINGTON that saves us , not our " shilly-shally Constitution . " When Freneau 's Gazette appeared , defending Paine , attacking Burke , criticising Hamilton 's measures , especially his new Bank of the United States , and commending Jefferson 's public acts , Fenno affected to be aghast . The morning after Freneau 's second number was circulated , a writer in Fenno , without mentioning the name of the audacious sheet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by saying that there were acts of baseness and villany so atrocious , that we could hardly persuade ourselves to believe that any of the human race were de* prayed enough to commit them ; and he proceeded to mention a crime or two of this description , - such as firing a city in the dead of night . But there // is a depth of depravity , he continued , far beyond that . Such offences are of a mild type of turpitude compared with the revolting blackness of the one which he introduces to the reader 's notice in his closing paragraph : " In a free republic , the officers of the people are entitled to double honor , because they have no inheritance in their office , and , when actuated by just principles , accept of public employments from motives superior to mercenary considerations . The crime , therefore , of individuals who devise the destruction and imbrue their hands in the innocent blood of such characters is tinged with the blackest hue of hellish darkness . " Such was the spirit of a paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patronage of the government , and an important portion of its contents from the pens of high officers of the government . Freneau continued his Gazette , however , and did not refrain from imbruing his hands in the innocent blood of an eminent public character . He proceeded to the length of mentioning the Secretary of the Treasury by name . He descanted freely upon all that Hamilton had done , and all that he proposed ; admitting many communications from republican friends ; doing all that in him lay to controvert and ridicule the writers in Fenno , and defend the principle of government by the people for the people . Readers who examine the file will find it difficult to believe that satire so mild and invective so harmless should have had power to kindle wrath in Federal minds , Antipathy , meanwhile , was growing in the hearts of Jefferson and Hamilton , blinding both , misleading both . It is of the nature of antipathy to distort the view , and shut the mind to truth ; and when it reaches the degree of rendering social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from misconception to misconception , until the idea they have of one another becomes monstrous . Never before , since they were born , had either of these two encountered immovable opposition . The lives of both had been too easily triumphant . From their youth up they had experienced little but acquiescence , sympathy , and applause , until they met in Washington 's Cabinet , and each discovered in the other an invincible antagonist . The self-love of both was deeply wounded . Hamilton owned that he took Jefferson 's opposition to the Bank as a wrong done to himself " Mr. Jefferson , " he says , " not only delivered an opinion in writing against its constitutionality and expediency , but he did it in a style and manner which I felt as partaking of asperity and ill-humor toward me . " This to Colonel Carrington , May , 1792 . But who can now discover in Jefferson 's opinion on the Bank one word savoring of asperity or ill-humor ? On the contrary , it seems studiously void of offence , full of respect for opposing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bill " if the pro and con hang so even as to balance his judgment . " This , he thought , would be paying only " a just regard to the wisdom of the legislature . " Miserable error , to attribute difference of opinion to baseness of motive ! Oliver Wolcott , Comptroller of the Treasury , Hamilton 's echo and successor ( as genial a soul as ever cracked a walnut ) , betrays his chief 's blinding antipathy in his letters of this time . " Mr. Jefferson , " he writes , February , 1792 , " appears to have shown rather too much of a disposition to cultivate vulgar prejudices ; accordingly , he will become popular in alehouses , and do much mischief to his country by exciting apprehension that the government will operate unfavorably . " The comptroller interpreted the PublicoVa controversy , too , in his own merry fashion : " Mr. Adams and Mr. Jefferson seem much disposed to quarrel on the question whether liberty can be maintained in a country which allows citizens to be distinguished by the addition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paine or Edmund Burke are the great- // 1873.1 est fools . " Hamilton 's grammar was better than Wolcott 's ; but he , too , was at first disposed to laugh at Jefferson 's notion of abolishing the small , lingering absurdities of the feudal system . But he soon ceased to laugh . Under Freneau 's attacks , he became , very early in 1792 , as sour and bitter in his feelings toward his colleague as so good-tempered a man could be ; and he poured out all his heart to his old comrade , Colonel Carrington of Virginia . He said he was convinced - " unequivocally convinced " - that " Mr. Madison , co-operating with Mr. Jefferson , is at the head of a faction decidedly hostile to me and to my administration , and actuated by views , in my judgment , subversive of the principles of good government and dangerous to the union , peace , and happiness of the country . " Such was Hamilton 's conviction in May , 1792 , and it remained his conviction until that fatal day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before Burr 's pistol , a conscious martyr . What reasons had he for thinking so ? He gives them at great length to Colonel Carrington : Madison and Jefferson disapproved his financial measures ! They had openly said so ; Madison in debate , Jefferson in conversation , yes , even in conversation with foreigners / Some persons , whom the Secretary of State " immediately and notoriously moves " had even whispered suspicions of his official integrity . It was , also , " reduced to a certainty " that Freneau , a " known anti-Federalist , " had been " brought to Philadelphia by IVIr . Jefferson to be the conductor of a newspaper . " And such a newspaper ! Evidently devoted to the subversion of me and my measures , as well as unfriendly to the government ! Moreover , both Madison and Jefferson ( and here Hamilton rises into capital letters ) " HAD A WOMANISH ATTACHMENT TO FRANCE , AND A WOMANISH RESENTMENT AGAINST GREAT BRITAIN " ; and this to such a degree , that , unchecked , they would in six months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AND GREAT BRITAIN ! " Mr. Jefferson was especially and exti*avagantly addicted to these womanish propensities . " In France , " continues Hamilton , " he saw government only on the side of its abuses . He drank deeply of the French philosophy , in religion , in science , in politics . He came from France in the moment of a fermentation which he had a share in exciting , and in the passions and feelings of which he shared , both from temperament and situation . He came here , probably , with a too partial idea of his own powers ; and with the expectation of a greater share in the direction of our councils than he has in reality enjoyed . I am not sure that he had not marked out for himself the department of the finances . He came electrified plus with attachment to France , and with the project of knitting together the two countries in the closest political bands . Mr. Madison had always entertained an exalted opinion of the talents , knowledge , and virtues of Mr. Jefferson . The sentiment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the time of Mr. Jefferson 's absence from this country . A close intimacy arose on his return . . . . . Mr. Jefferson was indiscreetly open in his approbation of Mr. Madison 's principles on first coming to the seat of government . I say , indiscreetly , because a gentleman in one department ought not to have taken sides against another in another department . " Both the Virginians , he thought , were chagrined and . out of humor because , so far , he had usually triumphed over the opposition of one or both of them ; and he proceeds to enumerate his victories ,  --  funding , assumption , the bank , and others , - a " current of success on one side and defeat on the other , " which had " rendered the opposition furious . " And worse defeat was in store for them ; for it was evident , he thought , beyond a question , that " Mr. Jefferson aims , with ardent desire , at the Presidential chairs ' ; and , / // of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And here the Secretary of the Treasury owns that he had already aided to frustrate the imaginary ambition of his colleague . It had been a question who should be President pro tern. , in case both the President and Vice-President should die in office . Some members of Congress had proposed the chief justice , Mr. Jay ; Mr. Madison had moved the Secretary of State . " I acknowledge , " says Hamilton , " though I took far less part than was supposed , I ran counter to Mr. Jefferson 's wishes ; for , if I had had no other reason for it , I had already experienced opposition from him , which rendered it a measure of self-defence . " Finally , he read Mr. Jefferson thus : " A man of profound ambition and violent passions . Thus may one honest and patriotic man misread another when , attempting to evolve his character from the depths of his own consciousness , the gall of an antipathy tinges his thoughts . Jefferson misconceived Hamilton scarcely less . He was , at least , unjust to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , first , and then a sense of injuries received , obscured his judgment . The mere difference of opinion between them was extreme . One day in April , 1791 , when the Vice-President and the Cabinet dined together at Jefferson 's house to talk over some public question , the conversation turned , as it often did in those days , upon forms of government . " Purge the British Constitution of its corruption , " said Mr. Adams , ! and give to its popular branch equality of representation , and it would be the most perfect constitution ever devised by the wit of man . " Hamilton waited a moment , and then said : " Purge it of its corruption , and give to its popular branch equality of representation , and it would become an impracticable government . As it stands at present , with all its supposed defects , it is the most perfect government that ever existed . " What intelligent American citizen , whose memory of public events ran back to 1765 , and who had access to the pigeonholes of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an opinion without something like indigna-tion ? But , in truth , when Hamilton pronounced the word government , he meant something radically different from Jefferson 's idea of government . What is government ? Jefferson 's answer would have been : An agency for the execution of the people 's will . Hamilton mi*ist have answered : A means of curbing and frustrating the people 's will . The British government had proved itself practicable , by being able , in the teeth of the people 's will , to alienate* and repel the American Colonies ; and it had accomplished this by buying voters at the polls and voters in the House of Commons . Hence , in a Hamiltonian sense , it wa* a " practicable " government . There were members of Congress who had a pecuniary interest in supporting Hamilton 's financial system . This he regarded as legitimate and desirable ; while good republicans could only think of it with horror , as if jurymen should sit in judgment on a cause in which their fortune was embarked . A few months after , Hamilton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jefferson mentioned to him , in August , in , that he had received a letter from Mr. Adams , disavowing Publicola , and denying that he had ever had any wish to introduce the hereditary principle . Hamilton censured the Vice-President for having stirred questions of that nature in the newspapers . " I own , " he added , " it is my own opinion , though I do not publish it in Dan or Beersheba , that the present government is not that which will answer the ends of society by giving stability and protection to its rights , and that it will probably be found expedient to go into the British form . However , since we have undertaken the experiment , I am for giving it a fair course , whatever my expectations may be . " Hence , he thought Mr. // Adams was wrong , however pure his intentions , to disturb , by the discourses on Davila , the public confidence in the present order of things . These avowals , apparently deliberate and made for a purpose , Jefferson thought worthy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first of the " Anas " which give us so many interesting glimpses of the interior of General Washington 's Cabinet . To this radical difference of opinion was added a grievance which was , at once , public and personal , wounding both to Jefferson 's patriotism and pride . Hamilton was an inyeterate lobbyist . Excluded from Congress by the Constitution , he nevertheless endeavored to exercise as much influence over legislation as an English Chancellor of the Exchequer who sits in Parliament . In his published correspondence , he mentions , with evident elation , several instances in which he had procured the passage or the rejection of measures . Upon occasion , he would even threaten to reszgn , unless he had his way ; and such was his ascendency that this absurd insolence provoked from his adherents neither resentment nor ridicule . The republican members objected to the reference of legislative problems to members of the Cabinet regarding the Cabinet as part of the executive power . Hamilton could not so much as believe that a member of Congress could have any other than a factious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , as belonging to his office , to perform the duty which now devolves upon the Committee of Ways and Means . He regarded himself as an injured being when Madison opposed the reference to the Seeretary of the Treasury of the question of ways and means for the indian War . Madison , he says , even went so far as to " combat , on *rinciftZe , the propriety of such reference " ; well knowing that " if he had prevailed , a certain consequence was my reszgwatiofl . " Late in the debate he became apprised of the danger . " Measures of counteraction , " he says , " were adopted ; and 263 when the question was called , Mr. Madison was confounded to find characters voting against him whom he had counted upon as certain . " Now , this interference with legislation was the more aggravating to Jefferson , because the Secretary of the Treasury had such a vast patronage with ' which to make his interference effectual : one hundred clerks at Philadelphia , a custom-house at every port , bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his gift .. And these places were not the trivial and demoralizing gifts which a cabinet minister has at his disposal now , - the brief , precarious tenure of under-paid offices . A government office was then a career . Y6u were a made man if you got one . A peaceful and dignified life could be founded upon it , and a family reared . Hamilton wielded more power of this kind than all the rest of the administration put together , multiplied by tern ; and it is reasonable to conclude that some voters in Congress ( not as many , perhaps , as , Jefferson thought ) were influenced by the interest members had in Hamilton 's various financial measures . Before he had been a year in office , the Secretary of State had had enough of it . Scrupulously avoiding all interference with the departments of his colleagues , never lobbying , immersed in the duties of his place , he found himself borne along by Hamilton 's restless impetuosity , and compelled to aid in the execution of a policy which he could as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head of the Cabinet , without possessing the ascendency that belonged to his position . He seemed to himself , at once , responsible and impotent ; and he believed the sway of Hamilton over public affairs to be illegitimate , and to be upheld by illegitimate means . In the spring of 1791 , when he had been in the Cabinet little more than a year , he discovered , from a sentence in one of the President 's letters to himself , that he had no thought of serving beyond the en*l of his term , which would ex The Quarrel oj 7efferson and Hamilton . // pire March 4 , i7*3 . Jefferson instantly resolved to make that the period of his own service also . He longed for repose . His affairs clamorously demanded his attention , lie was utterly devoid of commonplace ambition . All pageantry was wearisome to him . Ifin his earlier years , he had coveted the kind of distinction which place conferred , he had outgrown that foible long ago , and had now for himself but one wish , - to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his farms , his books , his apparatus , his children , and his friends . What man above forty-five , not a fool , has ever had , for himself alone , any other dream but that ? With regard to the Presidency , no one had as yet presumed to publish a conjecture as to what an infant nation was to do , when , at last , deprived of its " father , " it should be obliged - to use Jefferson 's expression - to " go alone . " Adams , Jay , and Jefferson were the three names oftenest whispered in conversation ; but the situation was not ripe for anything beyond a whisper ; and all patriotic men concurred in desiring General Washington 's continuance . It was in February , 1792 , in the course of a conference upon post-office affairs , that Jefferson disclos*d to the President his intention to retire . It was not yet clear whether the postoffice ' belonged to the Department of State or to that of the Treasury , and Jefferson wished the question settled . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belonged , and ought to belong , to the State Department , because , among other reasons , the Treasury Department wa* already too powerful , wielding " such an influence as to swallow up the whole executive powers " ; so that " even the future Presidents , not supported by the weight of character which hImself possessed , would not be able to make head against it . " He disclaimed all personal interest in the matter . If he was supposed to have any appetite for power , the intervening time was too short to be an object , for his own tenure of office would be exactly as long as that of the President 's . " My real wish , " said he , " is to avail the public of every occasion , during the rest of the President 's period , to place things on a safe footincr " The conversation was interrupted here at its most interesting moment . The President asked him to breakfast with him the next morning , in order that the subject might be resumed . They met accordingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duly considered , the President revived the topic of Jefferson 's intention to retire . " In an affectionate tone , " he told Jefferson that he had felt much concern at the intelligence . For his own retire ment there were reasons enough , and he enumerated them ; but he should consider it unfortunate if his own return to private life should bring on the resignation of the great officers of the government , which might give a shock to the public mind of dangerous consequence . Jefferson tried to reassure the President on this point . He did not believe , he said , that any of his brethren thought of resigning . On the contrary , at the last meeting of the trustees of the sinking fund , the Secretary of the Treasury had developed a plan of operations which contemplated years of his own personal service . General Washington was not reassured by this statement . He clung to Jefferson . He remarked that he considered the Department of the Treasury less important and less conspicuous than the Department of State , which " embraced nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retirement of a Secretary of State would be more noticed . Symptoms of dissatisfaction , he added , far beyond what could have been expected , had lately shown themselves , and to what height these might arise , in case of too great a change in the administration , could not be foreseen . Upon this , Jefferson 's tongue was loosed , and he expressed himself without reserve in words like these : " In // my opinion there is only a single source of these discontents , - the treasury . A system has there been contrived for deluging the States with paper-money instead of gold and silver , for withdrawing our citizens from the pursuits of commerce , manufactures , buildings , and other branches of useful industry , to occupy themselves and their capitals in a species of gambling destructive of morality , which has introduced its poison into the government itself . It is a fact , as well known as that you and I are now conversing , that particular members of the legislature , while those laws were on the carpet , feathered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and constantly since have lent all the energy of their talents and the instrumentality of their offices , to the establishment and enlargement of their system . They have chained the system round our necks for a great length of time , and , in order to keep the game in their own hands , they have from time to time aided in making such legislative constructions of the Constitution as make it a very different thing from what the people thought they had submitted to . And now , they have brought forward a proposition far beyond any one advanced before ; to which the eyes of many are now turned as the decision which is to let us know whether we live under a limited or an unlimited government . " " To what proposition do you allude ? " asked the President . " To that , " replied Jefferson , " in the Report on Manufactures ( by Hamilton ) which , under color of giving bounties for the encouragement of particular manufactures , meant to establish the doctrine , that the Constitution , in giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permitted Congress to take everything under their charge* which they should deem for the public welfare . If this was maintained , then the enumeration of powers in the Constitution does not at all constitute the limits of their authority . " With this topic the conversation end-265 ed . The mingling of justice and injustice in Jefferson 's observations is obvious . He was chiefly unjust in ascribing the ill-working of some of Hamilton 's measures to design ; whereas , the inflation of values and the consequent mania for speculation were unforeseen , and were by no one more regretted than by Hamilton . The real grievances of the republicans at that moment were two : i . Hamilton 's freeand-easy construction of the Constitution ; 2 . The interference of The Treasury Department with legislation . During that very week the republicans made a serious effort toward turning the Secretary of the Treasury and his allies out o ( the loby by breaking up the system of referring questions to members of the Cabinet . After a long debate , the House adjourned without coming to a vote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the highest spirits , so sure were they of victory on the day following . During the evening , as they believed , the special adherents of the Secretary of the Treasury bestirred themselves with such effect that - to employ Jefferson 's own words - " The treasury carried it by thirty-one to twenty-seven . " But even this triumph was esteemed only the forerunner of defeat , so omnipotent had the treasury once been . " It showed , " Jefferson thought . " that treasury influence was totter-mo " So far , the personal intercourse between the two diverging ministers was agreeable ; and we even observe in their official correspondence an apparent effort to conciliate . In March , 1792 , Jefferson submitted the draft of a Cabinet paper for Hamilton 's review and emendation ; and when it came back with comments , Jefferson appears to have made a point of accepting as many of his colleague 's suggestions as possible . Out of ten emendations he adopted all but one , which would have involved a looser construction of the Constitution than he approved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the conversation with the President ) , Jef The Quarrel of *efferson and Hamilton . // ferson , in returning his colleague 's Report on the Mint , commended the performance , suggested a change or two , and ended his note thus : " I hazard these thoughts to you extempore , and am , dear sir , respectfully and affectionately yours . " This , however , was the year of the Presidential election . For the Presidency there was , indeed , but one candidate ; but Mr. Adams 's incoherences upon Davila , and his son 's essays in the name of Publicola , cost him a severe contest for the Vice-Presidency George Clinton , of New York , being the candidate of the republicans . Need it be said that the two Gazettes , Fenno and Freneau , improved the occasion ? But how mild the prose and verse of Captain Freneau compared with the vituperation and calumny which have since made the party press as powerless to abuse as to exalt ! " On Davila 's page Your discourses so sage Democratical numaculls bepuzzle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The republican bull-dogs to muzzle ! " It is to be presumed that the VicePresident did not take seriously to heart such fooling as this , which is a fair enough specimen of " Jonathan Pindar 's " doggerel . Hamilton and his friends were assailed in prose not quite so pointless . Perhaps the following was as " severe** as most of the editorial paragraphs , if only from its containing a portion of truth : " The mask is at length torn from the monarchical party , who have , with but too much success , imposed themselves upon the public for the sincere friends of our republican Constitution . XVhatever may be the event of the competition for the Vice-Presidency , it has been the happy occasion of ascertaining the two following important truths : First , that the name of Federalist has been assumed by men who approve the Constitution merely as a promising essay toward a well-ordered government ' ; that is to say , as a step toward a government of king , lords , and commons . Secondly , that the spirit of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Secretary of the Treasury was specially designated , and his financial system was always condemned , as Jefferson condemned it in the hearing of the President . When Hamilton read his Freneau , week after week , during that exciting summer of 1792 , he read it , not at all as the publication of Captain Philip Freneau , mariner and poet , but , wholly and always , as the utterance of Thomas Jefferson , Secretary of State . He was right , and he was wrong . Jefferson , to people like minded with himself , was a pervading and fascinating intelligence . His easy manners , his long experience , his knowledge of nature , men , and events , his sanguine trust in man , his freedom from inhuman pride , his prodigious Christianity , his great gifts , his great fame , and his great place , all conspired to make him the oracle of his circle , as he was the soul of his party . Freneau could not help infusing a good deal of Jefferson into almost everything he wrote . But although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of State ever exerted over the pen of his translating clerk , Hamilton could not believe it . He took it for granted that the National Gazette was edited in his colleague 's office , with his colleague 's assistance , for the purpose of subverting himself . Irritated and indignant , the Secretary of the Treasury composed , July 25 , 1792 , the epistle following , and had it inserted in the other Gazette , - the Gazette of the United States : - " MR . FENNO : - The editor of the National Gazette receives a salary from government . " Qucere . Whether this salary is paid him for Tr*vzslaficms , or for publications , the design of which is to vilify those to whom the voice of the people has committed the administration of our public affairs , - to oppose the measures of government , and , by false insinuations , to disturb the public pe*ace ? " In common life it is thought un // 1873. grateful for a man to bite the hand that puts bread in his mouth ; but if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is al tered . " T. L. " Freneau was not politician enough , nor guilty enough , to pass by this hint in silence . He repelled the insinuation , which gave Hamilton a pretext for following it up . A series of strongly written , incisive articles from the pen of the Secretary of the Treasury appeared in Fenno , in which Jefferson was attacked by name . Some of these articles ( there were twelve in all ) were signed , " An American " ; others , " Amicus " ; others , " Catullus " ; one , " Metellus " ; one , " A Plain Honest Man " : but all of them are included in the authorized edition of the works of Alexander Hamilton . They appeared from time to time , during the rest of the Presidential " campaign , " calling forth replies from " Aristides " and other sages of antiquity , but eliciting no printed word from Jefferson . The burden of the earlier numbers was , that Mr. Freneau was brought from New York to Philadelphia , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the purpose of establishing a gazette hostile to the government . ( Denied by Freneau on oath . ) When that topic was exhausted , Colonel Hamilton endeavored to show , by fragments of Jefferson 's letters to Madison from France , that his colleague had been an original opponent of the Constitution . ( Disproved by Madison 's publishing the whole of the quoted passages . ) Hamilton proceeded to descant upon Mr. Jefferson 's indorsement of Paine 's reply to Burke : accusing him , first , of an intention to wound and injure Mr. Adams ; and , secondly , of a dastardly denial of the same , when he found that " discerning and respectable men disapproved the step . " After relieving his mind of many a column of fluent and vigorous outrage , he called upon Mr. Jefferson to resign his office . " If ; " said Metellus , " he can not coalesce with those with whom he is associated , as far as the rules of official decorum , propriety , and obligation may require , without abandoning what he conceives to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place himself in a situation in which he will experience no collision of opposite duties . Let him not cling to the h6nor or emolument of an office , whichever it may be that attracts him , and content himself with defending the injured rights of the people by obscure or indirect means . Let him renounce a situation which is a clog upon his patriotism . " The effect upon the public mind of this ill-timed breach of official decorum was such as we should naturally suppose it would be . The thin disguise of the various signatures adopted by the Secretary of the Treasury deceived only readers distant from the capital , and them not long ; for Hamilton , besides betraying himself by the power of his stroke , seems , in some passages , to have courted discovery , - pushing aside the gauzy folds of the curtain , and all but crying out , Behold , it is I , the administration ! " Society " applauded . The drawing-room eyed Jefferson askance . It could not quite cut a Secretary of State , but its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and power would permit ; and , to this day , if indeed we can be said to have a drawing-room now , it has loved to repeat the traditional disparagement . But the articles had not the political effect which their ingenious author intended ; for , while they emphasized Jefferson 's position as the republican chief , they really - so Federalists themselves report - lowered Hamilton in the view of the country . He lost that prestige of reserve and mystery that gathers round a name associated in the public mind only with affairs of national magnitude and subjects of general importance . The people were not pleased to discover , in an adviser of the President , a partisan , positive , vehement , ingenious , and unjust , a coarse assailant of a name hallowed by its association with the birthday of the nation . Hamilton lost something which is of no value to an // anonymous writer in a Presidential campaign , " but is of immense value to a public man , - WEIGHT . And , with all this , he did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received fifty electoral votes for the Vice-Presidency , Jefferson four , and Burr one , to seventy-seven for Mr. Adams . There was one man in the country who was great enough to do justice to both these men , and to feel only sorrow for their dissensions . How the President tried to reconcile them is a pleasing and noble passage of his history . He wrote a kind , manly letter to each of them , employing similar arguments and several identical phrases in both letters ; reminding them of the difficulties and dangers of the country 's position , encompassed as it was by avowed enemies and insidious friends ; and urging them to a more charitable interpretation of one another . Both secretaries replied , as it chanced , on the same day , September 9 , 1792 . Hamilton owned that he had attacked his colleague in the newspapers , and , intimated that , for the present , he could not discontinue his assaults . He justified his conduct thus : " I know that I have been an object of uniform opposition from Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city of New York to enter upon his present office . I know , from the most authentic sources , that I have been the frequent subject of the most unkind whispers and insinuations from the same quarter . I have long seen a formed party in the legislature under his auspices , bent upon my subversion . I can not doubt , from the evidence I possess , that the National Gazette was instituted by him for political purposes , and that one leading object of it has been to render me , and all the measures connected with my department , as odious as possible . " These , however , were personal wrongs , which he had resolved to bear in silence . But when he saw that a party had been formed " deliberately bent upon the subversion of measures which , in its consequences , would subvert the government , " then he had felt it to be his duty to defeat the nefarious purpose by " drawing aside the veil from the principal actors . " Jefferson 's reply was long , vehement , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was perfectly successful ; but , at such a moment , he must have been either more or less than man to have been just to his antagonist . Nor is there any one now alive competent to say precisely how far he was unjust to him . Who can tell us to what point " treasury influence " may have influenced legislation , and how far Colonel Hamilton may have deemed it right and legitimate to enlist the interests of men on the side of what he called " government ' * ? One thing we do know : the rule which Jefferson prescribed for his own conduct as a member of the Cabinet is the true republican rule . " If , " said he , " it has been supposed that I have ever intrigued among the members of the legislature to defeat the plans of the Secretary of the Treasury , it is contrary to all truth . As I never had the desire to influence the members , so neither had I any other means than my friendships , which I valued too highly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conscientious pursuit of their own sense of duty . " This was the right view to take of the limits prescribed by the spirit of the Constitution to his place . But , though we know Hamilton gloried in holding an opposite opinion , we do not know how far he carried his ideas in practice . That he interfered kabilually inlegi slation , and was proud of his success in so doing , his letters plainly reveal . Jefferson charges him with using his power as minister of finance to control votes . " That I have utterly , " writes the Secretary of State , " in my private conversations , disapproved of the system of the Secretary of the Treasury , I acknowledge and avow ; and this was not merely a speculative difference . His system flowed from principles adverse to liberty , and was calculated to undermine and demolish // the Republic , by creating an influence of his department over the members of the legislature . I saw this influence actually produced , and its first fruits to be the establishment of the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persons who , having swallowed his bait , were laying themselves out to profit by his plans ; and that , had these persons withdrawn , as those interested in a question ever should , the vote of the disinterested majority was clearly the reverse of what they made it . " He accused his colleague , too , of defeating the system of favoring French commerce and retaliating British restrictions , by cabals with members of Congress . Another retort of Jefferson 's gives pause to the modern inquirer . Who can say , with anything like certainty , whether , in the passage following , Mr. Jefferson uttered truth pure and simple , or truth colored , distorted , and exaggerated by antipathy ? " I have never inquired , " said he , " what number of sons , relations , and friends of senators , representatives , printers , or other useful partisans Colonel Hamilton has provided for among the hundred clerks of his department , the thousand excisemen , custom-house officers , loan officers , *ippointed by him , or at his nod , and spread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the man who has the shuffling of millions backwards and forwards from paper into money , and money into paper , from Europe to America , and America to Europe , the dealing out of treasury secrets among his friends in what time and measure he pleases , and who never slips an occasion of making friends with his means , - that such a one , I say , would have brought forward a charge against me for having appointed the poet Freneau translating clerk to my office with a salary of two hundred and fifty dollars a year. ** A passage followed , in relation to this appointment , which had a wonderful currency years ago , and is still occasionally revived . He declared , that , in appointing Freneau , he had been actuated by the motive which had induced him to recommend to the President for public employment such characters as Rittenhouse , Barlow , and Paine . " I hold it , " he added , " to be one of the distinguishing excellences of an elective over hereditary succession , that the talents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be selected by the society for the government of their affairs , rather than that this should be transmitted through the loins of knaves and fools , passing from the debauchees of the table to tho*se of the bed . " In conclusion , he said that , as the time of his retirement from office was so near ( only six months distant ) , he should postpone any public reply which he might deem it best to make to the Fenno articles until he was a private citizen ,  --  a period to which he looked " with the longing of a wave-worn mariner , who has at length the land in view , and shall count the days and hours which still lie between me and it . " The ; z he would be free to defend himself without disturbing the quiet of the President ; but if he did break silence , he should subscribe his name to whatever he wrote . Conscious , he said , of having merited the esteem of his countrymen , which he dearly prized , by an integrity which could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their rights and to liberty , he " would not suffer his retirement to be clouded by the slanders of a man whose history , from the moment at whidi history could stoop to notice him , was a tissue of machinations against the liberty of the country which had not only received and given him bread , but heaped its honors upon his head . " But during the short time he had to remain in office , he should find " ample employment in closing the present business of the department . " This letter was written at Monticello . On his way to Philadelphia he stopped , as usual , at Mount Vernon , when the President renewed the subject in conversation , and urged him to reconsider his intention to resign ; for // he " thought it important to preserve the check of his opinions in the administration to keep things in the proper channel and prevent them from going too far . " The check ! The check to what ? The President said he did not believe there were ten men , worth consideration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thought of transforming the republic into a monarchy . Mr. Jefferson replied that there was " a numerous sect who had monarchy in contemplation , of whom the Secretary of the Treasury was one . " The most intimate friend Hamilton ever had was Gouverneur Morris , who pronounced his funeral oration . This exquisite writer stated Hamilton 's opinions at much length in x8ii , in a letter to Robert Walsh of Philadelphia . The following are some of Morris 's expressions : " General Hamilton disliked the Constitution , believing all republican government radically defective He hated republican government He trusted that , in the changes and chances of time , we should be involved in some war , which might strengthen our union and nerve the executive . He never failed on every occasion to advocate the excellence of , and avow his attachment to , monarchical government . " The other points of difference were gone over , but without lessening Mr. Jefferson 's passionate desire to retire from public life . But , on reaching Philadelphia , friends insisted on his remaining in office with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he knew not how either to rebut or accept them . No language can overstate his longing for retreat . Six months before the Fenno assaults began , this had been the burden of his letters to his family and friends . " The ensuing year , " he wrote to his daughter , in March , 1792 , " will be the longest of my life , and the last of such hateful labors ; the next , we will sow our cabbages together . " To other friends he said that the 4th of March , 1793 , was to him what land was to Columbus . He had sent to Scotland for one of the new threshing - machines , and a plough of his invention had recently won a medal in France . He had engaged mechanics in Europe to work upon his house , and upon other schemes which he had formed . He was packing his books in view of the termination of the lease of his house in Philadelphia , and had arranged for one of its inmates , " Jack Eppes , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon schemes were forming in his mind for extricating his great estate from encumbrance , and turning its latent resources to better account than could be expected from overseers . But the attacks in the newspapers and the hostility of powerful classes , though they intensified his desire for repose , seemed to interpose a barrier which he could not pass . He was torn with contending emotions . " I have been , " he wrote to his daughter in January , 1793 , " under an agitation of mind which I scarcely ever experienced before , produced by a check *n my purpose of returning home at the close of this session of Congress . " Madison , Monroe , Page , Randolph , all friends and all partisans , united in the opinion that he must not give the Federalists the triumph of being able to say , with an appearance of truth , that Hamilton had driven him from office . He consented , at length , to remain a short time longer . He sent most of his library home , sold the bulkier articles of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rooms in the suburbs , and " held himself in readiness to take his departure for Monticello the first moment he could do it with due respect to himself . " Thus he wrote to the father of " Jack Eppes , " in April , 1793 . But why this agonizing desire for retirement ? Thereby hangs a tale . If we give ten reasons for a certain course of conduct , there is often an eleventh which we do not give ; and that unspoken one is apt to be Ike reason . He could no longer afford to serve the public on the terms fixed by Congress . It was not merely that his salary did not pay the cost of his Philadeiphia // establishment , nor that his estate was ill-managed by overseers . An ancient debt hung , as he says , " like a mill-stone round his neck , " - a debt which he had twice paid , although not incurred by him . Upon the death of his wife 's father , twenty years before , he had received property from his estate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debt of thirteen thousand . Impatient of debt , he sold a fine farm near Monticello for a sum sufficient to discharge it ; but by the time he received the money , the war of the Revolution had begun . Virginia invited all men owing money to Great Britain to deposit the same in her treasury , the State agreeing to pay it over to the British creditor after the war . The identical coin which Jefferson received for his farm he himself carried to the treasury in Williamsburg , where it was immediately expended in equipping troops . The Legislature of Virginia , however , thought better of this policy , rescinded the resolution , and returned the sums received under it . But Jefferson was obliged to take back his thirteen thousand dollars in depreciated paper , which continued to depreciate until it was worthless . In fact , the thirteen thousand dollars just sufficed to buy him one garment ; and in riding by that farm , in after years , he would sometimes point to it , and say , laughing , " That farm I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the war , during which Cornwallis destroyed more than enough of his property to pay this debt , he had , as he remarked , " to lay his shoulders to the payment of it a third time , " in addition to a considerable debt of his own incurred just before the outbreak of hostilities . " What the laws of Virginia , " he wrote to his creditor in England , " are , or may be , will in no wise influence my conduct . Substantial justice is my object , as decided by reason , not by authority or compulsion . " Ever since the war closed , he had been struggling to reduce these debts ; and , finally , made an arrangement for paying them off at the rate of four hundred pounds sterling a year . How easy this ought to have been to a person owning ten thousand acres of excellent land , " one hundred and fifty-four slaves , thirtyfour horses , five mules , two hundred and forty-nine cattle , three hundred and ninety hogs , and three sheep ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were cultivated , nine of his horses were used for the saddle , and the labor of his slaves had been , for ten years , directed by overseers . In 1793 , the greater part of the debt remained to be discharged , and he saw , whenever he visited Monticello , such evidences of " the ravages of overseers , " as filled him with alarm . He had now a sonin-law to settle , a second daughter to establish , a mountainous debt to pay , a high office to live up to , and an estate going to ruin . Behold his eleventh , unuttered reason for the frenzy which possessed him to live at home . He might well desire to see the reign of overseers brought to an end on his estate . Readers remember , perhaps , General Washington 's experience with them . How , when he owned one hundred and one cows , he was compelled to buy butter for his own table ; and how , after building one of the best barns in the country , where thirty men could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manager from treading out the grain with horses , - so impossible was it , he says , " to put the overseers of this country out of the track they have been accustomed to walk in . " He reached home for his annual vacation in 1793 , about the middle of September , and caught this truly conservative gentleman in the act . " I found a treadingyard , " wrote the President , " not thirty feet from the barn - door , the wheat again brought out of the barn , and horses treading it out in an open exposure , liable to the vicissitudes of weather . " With such men to manage , the General thought the new threshingmachine would have a brief existence . What need there was , then , of the // master 's eye upon an encumbered es-tate ! Jefferson settled to his work again in Philadelphia , and watched for a good opportunity to resign . Through the good offices of the President , a truce was arranged between the two hostile secretaries , who tried their best to cooperate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular , was scrupulously careful to avoid the error of interfering , or seeming to interfere , in his colleague 's department . At heart each felt the sincerity and l*atriotic intentions of the other , and Jefferson had even an exaggerated idea of Hamilton 's ability . The elections , too , of 1792 , had strengthened the republicans in Congress , who gained a decisive triumph in the first month of the session by defeating ( thirty - five to eleven ) a proposition to allow members of the Cabinet to attend the House of Representatives and explain " Ikeir measures " to the House . This made it easier for Jefferson to continue . And , besides , the French Revolution , of late , had turned in arms upon the kings banded against it , and seemed to be able , contrary to all expectation , to hold its own . As yet , nearly all America was in enthusiastic sympathy with France . When the news arrived of a movement favorable to the French , the " monocrats , " as Jefferson styled the Othercrats , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ringing , illuminated their houses , and wore a tricolored cockade in their hats . The time was at hand when the youngest of the nations would need in its government the best talent it could command , and , above all , in the department which directed its intercourse with foreign nations . The French king had been dethroned , and was about to be brought to trial , all the world looking on with an interest difficult now to conceive . It stirred Jefferson 's indignation sometimes to observe that mankind were more attentive to the sufferings of the king and queen than to the welfare of the people of France . " Such are the fruits , " he once wrote , " of that form of government which heaps importance upon idiots , and which the tories of the present day are trying to preach into our favor . " It pleased many of the republicans , however , to learn that Thomas Paine , one of themselves , was exerting himself ably to save the king 's life . Paine said in the convention , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favored by fortune , - if he had been born in a private station , in " an amiable and respectable neighborhood , " - would have been , in all probability , a virtuous citizen ; but , cursed from the dawn of his reason with ceaseless adulatjon , and reared in " brutal luxury , " he was a victim of monarchy , as well as the agent of its ill-working . England , he reminded the convention , had cut off the head of a very bad Charles Stuart , only to be cursed ; a few years after , with a worse ; but when , forty years later , England had banished the Stuarts , there was an end of their doing harm in the world . What a happy stroke was this in a French Assembly ! He followed it up by offering to accompany the fallen king to the only ally France then had , the United States , where the people regarded him as their friend . " His execution , I assure you , " said this master of effective composition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ propose to you to conduct Louis to the United States . After a residence of two years , Mr. Capet will find himself a citizen of America . Miserable in this country , to which his absence will be a benefit , he will be furnished the means of becoming happy in another . " There was a passage in this speech to which the bloody scenes about to occur in Paris give a singular significance . Part of the long period of reaction towards barbaric ( i. e. ancient ) ideas and institutions , which began with the French guillotine , and from which we are only now emerging , might have been spared mankind if Thomas Paine could have spoken French as well as he wrote English , and brought this warning home to the convention // 1873. with the oratorical power of a Mirabeau . " Monarchical governments , " he said , " have trained the human race , and inured it to the sanguinary arts and refinements of punishment ; and it is exactly the same punishment which has so long shocked the sight and tormented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their turn , they practise in revetige upon their oppressors . But it becomes us to be strictly on our guard against the abomination and perversity of monarchical examples . As France has been the first to abolish royalty , let her also be the first to abolish the punishment of death . " In these words spoke the humane spirit in which the French Revolution originated . The execution of the king , January 21 , 1793 , saddened every well-constituted mind in Europe and America . It lessened the sympathy of a vast number of persons with the Revolution ; and all but the most extreme republicans felt in some degree the infinite impolicy of the act . From that time the good-will of mankind for unhappy France would have more sensibly diminished , but that the world in arms seemed gathering for her destruction . It was a mad time . The manager of a Philadelphia theatre thought it opportune to revive the tragedy of Cato . Before the play began , the company of actors sang upon the stage La Marseillaise , when the whole theatre rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of each act this performance was repeated . Every evening , afterwards , as soon as the musicians entered the orchestra , a cry arose for La Marseillaise , and no other music would be listened to . Usually , some portion of the audience caught the fury of the piece and thundered out the familiar refrain . But as the guillotine continued its ravages , the enthusiasm decreased ; and , instead of the universal and deafening demand for the French hymn , there would be , at length , only a score or two of voices from the gallery , all the rest of the house sitting in grim silence . Finally , on a night long remembered in the theatre , one defiant soul ventured to give the usual sign of disapproval . Instantly the whole house burst into one overwhelming hiss ; and never was the terrible piece played again . Soon the new song of Hail Columbia took its place in popular regard , and was , for s&amp;rne years , played at every theatre just before the rising of the curtain . The change of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of General Washington had to deal at once and practically . Questions of law and of finance , as well as of opinion and sentiment , had to be , not only discussed , but rightly decided under penalty of being drawn into the maelstrom of the war . Our two " cocks , " exasperated by previous encounters , were now pitted against each other every day ; but they were under bonds to keep the peace , and each was further restrained by the perils of the situation . Hamilton , by himself , might have involved the country in an entangling alliance with the powers hostile to the Revolution . Jefferson alone might have found it difficult to avoid a too helpful sympathy with beleaguered , bewildered France . The result of their antagonism was an honorable neutrality , useful to France , not injurious to the allies , and exceedingly profitable to the United States . How irreconcilable they were in their feelings respecting the great events of 7793 ! " Sir , " said Hamilton , in August , to Edmund Randolph , " if all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to call on me to say whether I am a friend to the French Revolution , I would declare that I have it in abhorrence . " Jefferson , on the contrary , wrote thus to his old friend Short , just before the execution of the king : " My own affections have been deeply wounded by some of the martyrs to this cause ; but rather than it should have failed , I would have seen half the earth desolated ! Were there but an Adam and an Eve left in every country , and left free , it would be better than as it now is. " // Gouverneur Morris was then American Minister in France , - a very able gentleman and honorably frank in the avowal of his opinions . Mark this striking sentence , written by him as far back as 1790 : " The French Assembly have taken genius instead of reason for their guide , adopted experiment instead of experience , and wander in the dark because they prefer lightning to light . " He meant Mirabeau . But , a few weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a list of the ancient abuseswhich the Revolution had abolished as amount to a compensation to France for all the Revolutionary miseries she has suffered from Mirabeau to Thiers . As the Revolution advanced , though Jefferson , in official instructions , had cautioned him to avoid the utterance of opinions hostile to the Revolution , he gave such offence to the Revolutionary leaders that Lafayette complained of it to the President . But , in 1792 , he redeemed himself nobly . Upon the dethronement of the king , when all the diplomatic corps left Paris , the American Minister alone , rightly interpreting his mission , remained . " The position , " as he truly wrote to Mr. Jefferson , " is not without danger ; but I presume that when the President did me the honor of naming me to this embassy , it was not for my personal pleasure or safety , but to promote the interests of my country . " And he re*ained at his post all through the period of the terror , though the Ministry gave him pretexts enough for abandoning it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violated by a committee in search of arms . The fury of the people , he wrote to Mr. Jefferson , was such as to render them capable of all excesses without being accountable for them . The calm courage and utter frankness of this splendid old tory conciliates the modern reader . The French Ministry , however , abhorred him to such a point that they made it a matter of formal complaint to Mr. Jefferson , that this representative of . a republic , in a despatch addressed to the government of a republic ( a few days old ) , had used the familiar expression , " Les ordres de MA COUR . " But the Cabinet question was this The king being dethroned , who was authorized to give a valid receipt for the money which the United States was paying to France from time to time ? Upon this point , the orders of Gouverneur Morris 's coz/rt were necessary ; and the real secret of the animosity of the French ministers was , that he would not and could not pay over to them the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their own way , and sent complaints across the sea . Morris , at his own table and in the hearing of his servants , indulged himself in calling them a set of damned rascals , and in predicting ( he was curiously fond of prophesying ) that the king would have his own again . Upon the pecuniary question , the opinions of the Cabinet were divided . Jefferson 's opinion : Every people may establish what form of government they please , and change it as often as they please . But the National Assembly of France , to which all power had fallen by necessity upon the removal of the king , had not been elected by the people of France as an executive body . For the moment , therefore , the French government was , at best , incomplete . But a National Convention had been elected in full view of the crisis , and for the express purpose of meeting its requirements . T/uzf Convention would be , when organized , a legitimate government , qualified to give a valid receipt to the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Convention would be a legitimate body . In case the monarchy should be re-established , the king might disallow payments made to it . He was for stopping payment altogether until there was something more stable and regular established in France . On this occasion , General Knox , Secretary of War , ventured to express an opinion . " For once , " says Jefferson , // " Knox dared to differ from Hamilton , and to express very submissively an opinion that a convention named by the whole body of the nation would be competent to do anything . " The result was , that the Secretary of State was requested to write to Gouverneur Morris , directing him to suspend payments until further orders . A few days after arrived the despatches in which the French Ministry complained of the too candid Morris and of his insolent contempt of a sister republic in speaking of " ma cour . " Upon this delicate subject the President conversed with the Secretary of State in a manner which exhibits the situation . THE PRESIDENT . The extracts from Ternant ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in short , as decisive . I see that Gouverneur Morris can be no longer continued there consistently with the public good . The moment is critical in our favor ( that is , for getting free-trade with the French West Indies and freer trade with France ) and ought not to be lost . Yet I am extremely at a loss what arrangement to make . JEFFERSON . Might not Gouverneur Morris and Pinckney ( American Minister in England ) change places ? THE PRESIDENT . That would be a sort of remedy , but not a radical one . If the French Ministry conceive Gouverneur Morris to be hostile to them , if they were jealous merely on his proposing to visit London , they will never be satisfied with us at placing him in London permanently . You have unfixed the day on which you intended to resign ; yet you appear fixed in doing it at no great distance of time . In that case , I can not but wish that you would go to Paris . The moment is important . You possess the confidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wish you could do it , were it only to stay there a year or two . JEFFERSON . My mind is so bent on retirement that I can not think of launching forth again on a new business . I can never again cross the Atlantic . As to the opportunity of doing good , t/*is is likely to be the scene of action , as Genet is bringing powers to do the business here . I can not think of going abroad . THE PRESIDENT . You have pressed me to continue in the public service , and refuse to do the same yourself . JEFFERSON . The case is different . You unite the confidence of all America , and you are the only person who does so . Your services , therefore , are of the last importance . But , for myself , my going out would not be noted or known . A thousand others can supply my place to equal advantage , and , therefore , I feel myself free . HE PRESIDENT . Consider maturely , then , what arrangement shall be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not remind the President of the vast difference in their pecuniary condition . He did not remark that General Washington was so rich a man that not even the ravages of Virginia overseers could quite ruin him , but that Thomas Jefferson could only continue to serve the public at the imminent risk of financial destruction . Meanwhile , Genet was coming , - the first minister sent by the Republic of France to the I*epublic of the United States . The republicans of the United States awaited his arrival with inexpressible ardor , and were prepared to give him one of those " receptions " for which the country his since become noted , - receptions which are so amusing and agreeable to all but the victim . Colonel Hamilton was by no means elated at the prospect of his coming . At a Cabinet meeting a short time before the landin* of the expected minister , he had dropped this remark : " When Mr. Genet arrives , whether we shall receive him or not will then be a question for discussion .
