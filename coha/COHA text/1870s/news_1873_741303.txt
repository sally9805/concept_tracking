txt The complaint mode by a correspondent of tho difficulty of securing girls for domestic service from any of the various charitable institutions of the City , together with the reply in our issue of yesterday from the Matron of the Girls ' Lodging-house , suggests some reflections on thepolicy that now regulates such charities . Our correspondent says he was unable to get a nurse- girl for his Emily , living sixty miles from the City , while urged to contribute toward sending hundreds of just such girls to the West . The matron of the Lodging-house answers that " the great object of the chiklren ' ? eltarities is not so much to satisfy the demand for labor as it is to improve the children , " and " that the chances for a child 's rising in the world are a hruidredfold greater in the West than in the East . " Doubtless this is true . The only question is whether the system based on these principles is sufficiently elastic for all the necessities of the case . It may be that " a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associate with the mistress of the household , " is not in every instance all that is demanded by the best interests of society , or of the children themselves . Among these children , there can no doubt be found many who would make excellent fsmily servants , and who would be more useful and . not less contented in that sphere than in any other . There seems no good reason - why we should deprive ourselves entirely of the services of such persons for the benefit of the Western States . Even though , as the Matron fears , they should remain servants , we can , see in that contingency nothing so dreadful to contemplate . Domestic service is not degrading . Properly understood , and . intelligently followed , it is as reputable and . selfrespecting a field of labor as any other . Eat to attain this perfection it must be taught , and . considered as a permanent business , like another . One great reason why our servants are generally so bad , is that they are continually looking for " something higher , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are utterly unfitted ; and , therefore , they never take pains to learn , or pride themselves in performing their actual duties . In supplying the places of discontented slovens with smart , tidy , intelligent girls , thoroughly trained in their various tasks , and prompt to , fulfill them , the Children 's Aid Societies might help to relieve a great social want . That they do so to some extent we are well aware . That they are sometimes prevented by traditional usage or prejudice from rendering the fullest service in this direction , the experience of our correspondent appears to indicate . What we should like to see , therefore , in the management of such institutions , is a more liberal and accommodating spirit in meeting the requirements of our own community . That this may be done without at all imperiling the happiness or well-being of the children we fully believe , while it would greatly help one of the chief embarrassments of our housekeepers.                    @
