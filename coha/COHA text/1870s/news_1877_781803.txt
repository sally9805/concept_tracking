txt Americans , being too proud to bog and too prudent to steal , resort , in case of need , to borrowing , for which they have a certain talent . Borrowing , though often injudicious , is harmless enough in itself , when the borrower has the means or a prospect of repayment . But when he has neither , yet assumes to have both , as so frequently happens , he is meaner than a beggar , and more dishonest than a thief . This sort of borrowing  --  - Ao call it by that mild name ? is probably commoner in the Republic than anywhere else , because money is more evenly distributed , audits citizens more benevolent . Many of them are also more hopeful and more reckless , and , if overtaken by adversity , they are resolved that others shall help them out . Bent on bettering their immediate condition , they are unscrupulous as to the means they employ , satisfied if they can relieve themselves at any vicarious expense . These men  --  not representative Americans , happily  --  do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by disappointing expectation and destroying confidence , than men of coarse mold and worse reputation . They invariably affect to be gentlemen ; insist on their sensibility ; talk of their honor ; proclaim their trustworthiness , until any one , not knowing them from sad experience , is forced to believe them by sheer strength of their audacity and iteration . These Genteel Swindlers  --  for they are nothing else  --  pervade society , determined to have the best which magnificent promise and meagre performance can secure . They got what they can everywhere ; but they prosper most in largo cities , where the field for their operations is broad , changing , and diversified . They abound and thrive in the Metropolis at all seasons , as thousands of its residents know to their indignation and their cost : It is impossible to detect them ; for they are eminently calculated to deceive . Being conscious counterfeits , they employ every device to mislead , and declare their genuineness to the very last . To become acquainted with them is always expensive , and their acquaintance makes a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally renders you angry , uncomfortable , cynical , more at the imposition practiced than at the loss of money necessarily implied . One of these Genteel Swindlers does not explain or prepare you for another , because each has his own manner and method , and may appear so different from his predecessor or predecessors that you may believe him all that he assumes to be up to the very moment tin t he cozens you as you have never been cozened before . The Genteel Swindler does not confine himself to borrowing ; lie does not care particularly for money , if he can get what money will purchase without any kind of equivalent . Therefore , lie is au ardent and stubborn advocate of the credit system in matters both small and large . He abhors paying for anything on the spot ; he would rather bind himself to pay $1,000 next year , next month , or next week than 1 1 $5 dow:i , and very naturally , since the hastantaneous payment would cost him $5 , and the promised obligation would cost . him nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in airy enumerations ; but figures representing dollars and cents , and demanding them , repel and confound him . He is an uncompromising foe to cash whenever lie is asked for it , or thinks he will be , although ho is very well disposed toward it , if it take . the shape of a loan . To be punctual in payment , to be mindful of debts , to be anxious to discharge them is bourgeois ( his favorite adjective ; ) and consequently , to be indifferent to financial obligations , and to meet them only when most convenient , is 1 princely . So it is , as many Princes have been ; but they were Princes by rank , not nature , and had something besides falsehoods for indemuity . ' The Genteel Swindler is a Prince in all the baseness and worthlessness that has marked a certain order of Princes ; but even these have seldom been deliberate sharpers . Hardly a social coterie or organization can be found that is not worried and contaminated by Genteel Swindlers . Business circles are rarely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense , based on integrity , fidelity , and promptness , affords them little or no room to prosecute their calling . They may begin , but they can not long continue . there ; for ouco discovered , business exposes and rejects them ruthlessly . Hence , they have no liking for business ? except the business of cheating  --  and are apt to decry it , in snobbish fashion , as unbecoming gentlemen . Not infrequently they have been iu commerce or trade , and having failed therein , they ascribe their failure to their lack of *sordidness and avarice , which , if they are to be believed , are essential to any mercantile success . They claim to have souls above barter and exchange , above notes of hand and bills receivable , above mere dollars and cents ; and so they have , as their associates are doomed to learn to their sorrow . They are prone to assume much superiority of spirit , special fineness of fibre , extraordinary delicacy of sentiment , and by much assumption they hide for a time from their new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their nature . Their time is valuable , for they make the most of it to dupe and fleece those who have confided in them , and profess amazement and a sense of injury when their dupes abandon them with a mingled feeling of misanthropy and disgust . The wonder is that the Genteel Swindler can almost always find persons to swindle . His continued triumphs prove the inextinguishable kindness of the human heart and the boundlessness of human credulity . Ho appeals to the best that is in mon , and requites them with the worst of experience . For their goodness , he renders evil ; for their faith , ho gives them skepticism ; for their generosity , he exchanges meanness . Ho is so liberal in words that he puts to shame those whose words mean something . If they hesitate , from motives of prudence , to incur any expense , he censures them for coldness and doubt , and gains reputation for munificence by telling what he will do , and what he shall see carried out . If speech were redeemable in coin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yellow with his gold , and every path of his promise smooth and broad with performance . But , as he is , he is conspicuous on every black list , pinned to every wall of delinquency , a hopeless debtor to every demand of honesty and honor , a liar , a rogue , a poltroon , an arch enemy of society , whom society despises too heartily to undertake to destroy .
