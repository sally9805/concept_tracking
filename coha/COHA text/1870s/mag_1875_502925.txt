" iDUT I do n't love you ! " said U Laura , in a lazy sort of way , as if it were a matter of no particular consequence . " Yes , you do , " answered Frank , lying at her feet in the short , sweet grass , and looking up in her face . A very pleasant face to look into no *loubt : piquant , sensible , humorous , with great capacities of sweetness not yet called out by life ; for Laura 's life had been as tranquil as that of the clover blossom she was punching with her parasol , and her dark eyes had never yet been dimmed or softened with sorrow . They were all sparkle . Yet what girl of twenty would sit quietly and hear a man tell her she loved him in that calm way , even if she had known him always , and was his step-cousin ? Not Laura Gay ! A quick flush of angry color rose to the dark hair that lay in soft , fluffy clouds almost down to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She jumped up from the rock where she was sitting : " You are impertinent . I shall go home I " " Oh , Laura ! do n't be cruel . Stay a moment-give me a chance . I do beg your pardon , ma'am , " and Frank Dyer put himself into such an absurd posture on his knees , with his hands dropped at the wrists , for all the world like Laura 's own little spaniel which he had taught to beg , that she had to laugh , and after that there was no more to be said ; so she sat down again and waited for the sunset which they had come to see . Norfolk is a little village in western Connecticut : sleepy as Sleepy Hollow , except that it is partly on a hill , and that the north winds blow there straight from the Arctic regions , without let or hindrance . In winter Norfolk is a howling wilderness of snow or stones , where the people endure hardness , and keep alive by strenuous exertions . In summer it blooms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The barren hills put forth mullein ana hardhack , with scant bloom of diluted yellow and unwilling pinkness . The ready ferns illustrate the wood-edges with their delicate grace and faint odor . The gnarled apple trees writhe into rosy buds , and the knotted , straggling kalmia entertains angels unaware in its clouds of dawn-tinted or pallid flowers , that come and go almost too quickly to be discovered . People go to Norfolk in summer to keep cool  --  and they do it . A few people live and die there . One of these few was Laura Gay 's father . Mr. Gay was born in Norfolk , and having made money enough to content him elsewhere , returned to his birthplace and settled down in the old homestead . It can be inferred what sort of a man he was from the two facts that he was content with fifty thousand dollars , and that he was willing to settle down in Norfolk after a long absence money-making in New York . But he was very fond of his children , and city life had proved fatal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have persuaded him to leave the country . He took kindly to his life therepottered about his garden in summer , hoed his corn , brushed his peas , made wonderful scarecrows , and exterminated the worms from his currant bushes . In winter he had full occupation in keeping his house warm . Seal-skin bags and blubber would have been a vest comfort to him , but civilization demands coal fires and roast beef . Laura was never sent to school . A governess of some sense and a good deal of sweetness brought her up . Her mother was a fat , fair , incapable female , who liked her dinner and her novel , and was abundantly careless of what other people said  --  a happy gift // in the country . It was Miss Greene , the governess , who was Laura 's real mother , who directed her nature in its bright , simple , fearless fashion , who bought her clothes and saw that they were not outri enough to be remarkable , who bought also the books she read , and permitted novels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who introduced Laura to the few mild dissipations of society she had ever enjoyed , for Mrs. Gay said she was too feeble to visit , being in fact too fat . Mr. Gay had never entertained as possible the idea that Laura would or could marry . She was his little girl still . She always would be . He felt a curious surprise when she began to go to the church sewing society , and said , " Sh , sh , dear ; children should n't talk about such things , when she piquantly retailed at breakfast all the gossip with which the unbleached cotton and cheap calico garments had been seasoned in their fashioning the night before . He even doubted in his secret heart if she could read well enough when she was asked to join a reading circle , which was to Norfolk what a ball is to New York . But he did not express the doubt lest he should grieve her . So she grew up as natural , as honest , as delightful as any wild blossom in the fields about her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose father had married Mrs. Gay 's sister , when his boy was some seven years old , should find out , after knowing Laura as long as he could remember , and much longer than she could , that she was the very sweetest girl in all the world , and the dearest to him . But Frank manfully held his tongue till Laura was twenty . He did not want her to accept him before srie knew her own heart fully . She had no lack of admirers , such as they were . The village post-office had a succession of clerks , who fell in love with her as fast as they came into position . At least three young farmers spent Sunday in worshipping a human idol with shining eyes and fluffy hair , and she counted among . her scalps all those youths who administered dry goods to the Norfolk population , one after another , and forsook their counter because Laura had no smiles to measure off for them . One theological student also , who came to try his new-fledged powers in the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then went his way sorrowing . Frank might have despaired of such a Diana had he been a man given to despair ; but he knew , without conceit , that he was a better man than these , and he saw with in .. ward delight that Laura depended on him more and more every year . So he spent his summers there with his step-mother , who preferred her sister 's society and the cool idless of the deep country to Newport or Saratoga ; and when his vacation was over and he plunged into business again , he kept Laura always reminded of him by occasional gay notes ; sometimes a piece of music , a box of Maillard 's delicate confections , books just published , birthday bouquets , and all the small munitions of war wherewith the illuminate besiege fortresses in these days . But in vain had he waited for Laura to spend a winter in New York or even Hartford , or to be allowed a season at some gay watering place , where she might see some other world than that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a city ; his early experience filled him with nervous horror of the idea . Was one child spared him out of five-well , straight and strong , with bloom on her face , light in her eye , laughter on her lips-and should he be insane enough to risk his treasure where all the others had been wrecked and lost ? Never ! No persuasion could induce him to trust her to Mrs. Dyer 's care even for a month . As to travelling , that too was not feasible . Mamma was altogether too supine . Railroads tortured her both by their punctuality and their speed ; hotels were an astonishment and a hissing on account of their stairs and their chairs . She did not see why people wanted to travel when they // could stay at home . So she staid there I She could not be left alone , so they all staid with her , and therefore it came to pass that Laura at twenty had seen no better man than Frank Dyer , and he took heart of grace That night they strolled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marry him , receiving the answer and making the response we have already revealed . It is true they sat down quietly to wait for the sinking sun , but it was an outward quiet only . With all his audacity , Frank Dyer 's heart was apprehensive enough , and Laura was disturbed deeply . Change of any sort had never come near her ; life had never been a conscious thing ; she had grown up in careless comfort , happy in her daily ways , as a child is happy unawares ; and here came the first stone to vex the placid stream 's career that had hitherto known only a bright shallow ripple in its grassy bed . But , like a child , she put the trouble aside for the moment and gazed before her . * They sat on the precipitous edge of a little hill that holds on its summit the church , the green , and a few pleasant houses ; the last step of a terrace rather , for beyond green and church the land rises again , and still again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lay the West Norfolk and Canaan valley ; a green ravine straight on to the sunset , its lofty sides clothed to their summits with tender foliage of birch , beech , and maple , shaded with masses of hemlock and dark spear-heads of pine ; a brook babbled down through the verdant cleft in the hills ; you could hear its distant fall over more than one dam , but its light and shining were hidden by thick leaves , and by the flood of golden , dusty , radiant mist that filled and overflowed all the valley from the fast-sinking sun . Now that day star fell behind a dark blueslate cloud , and gilt its edge with a vivid fringe of fire . Silence brooded over all the woods , broken only now and then by the thrilling , vibrant , silver-smitten note of the woodthrush , who sings at noon and night as if he disdained the song of other birds , and would have all ether to himself for the clear spirit of his fairy clarion to fill . Then the sun emerged ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ golden scales of light dappled all the southern sky in streaming fans of splendor . The east was filled with warm rose tints flushing and fading , and deeper still the crimson grew and softer the purple of the west . A parting cloud of fire and gloom revealed the high evening star  --  the sun was gone . Laura drew a long breath . She had lost something , and tried to recover herself and remember . It came back to her , with a disagreeable thrill , that Frank had asked her to marry him . She pulled up her light shawl hastily , and stooped to pick a cluster of strawberry blossoms to hide the hot blush that covered her face ; but Frank Dyer saw it . He was wise , however , and said no more just then . They went home through the dew , the Juae grass brushing them with fragrant spires , and the cool evening air breathing promise of a storm to-morrow , as well as the heavy gathering clouds all about the horizon . " It will rain to-morrow , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say ; and here they were at the gate . " Good-by , " was all that Frank answered . He did not offer to come in . She did not ask him . For the first time in her life Laura was glad to be rid of her cousin . It did not strike her as significant that it was the first time . She was too young , too simple , to know why . She went in to the house and sat down by the window . A tall white rose pushed its fragrant milky buds against the sash ; the half unfolded roses showed their soft saffron depths , and stood pearled with dew , and breathing tranquil odors close to the sill . Laura loved roses , but she never looked at these . Her face was troubled and thoughtful , and nobody disturbed her , for her father was hunting cutworms at the roots of his cabbage plants , her mother deep in // a new novel , and Miss Greene had gone up the hill to prayer meeting . Not that she would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three but the silence forced them upon her own attention , and she sat there a long time wondering if she really did care anything about Frank Dyer except as a cousin , and getting more and more indignant that he should have asserted it as a fact instead of asking it as a favor . For , as I said , Miss Greene had let Laura read novels . It was in fact making a virtue of necessity , for she knew what feminine nature is in the best of us ; that from the days of Paradise down it has been forbidden fruit that tempted us all ; and by permitting Laura to read novels she achieved for herself the power of selecting them . But novels are not nature , save and except a noted few ; and it was not in Laura 's experience of gentlemanly love-making that the lady should be so curtly taken possession of as she had been , without so much as " by your leave . " It is true her lovers-for a few of the enamored rustics had really committed themselves-had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face , but with proper humility . She had expected of a lover on her own plane the elegant diction , the well-turned phrases , the rapture and devotion of a well-behaved man in a book and Frank had first asked her in the simplest Saxon to marry him , and then when she said she did not love him , assured her she did . Was this to be borne ? So she meditated long on the fact that she did not love him ; they were always quarreling ; not a week passed but their *little tempers " rose and flew to arms , for at least five minutes ; then they were not in the least alike ; at least everybody said so . Frank was not afraid of anything ; he was dreadfully rash ; he had brown hair and blue-grey eyes ; and so forth and so on , till she had catalogued the poor young fellow remorselessly  --  the very police would have known him . Then femininity relented of course , and the other side of the shield was interviewed ; but good qualities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from her hand , got up and lit her candle , and ignominiously went to bed , thinking all the way upstairs of the hero she always had meant to marry : tall , pale , with deep , glittering eyes and raven hair ; a man dedicated to consumption and the ministry  --  a man to be adored , waited on , worshipped . Poor dear little Laura I she was so young 1 But she went to sleep very soon , and slept better than that audacious Frank , who was half scared at his first daring venture , and lay wondering how it would result , in what fashion he should follow it up . Night brought him no counsel ; he made up his mind only to wait , having a dim suspicion that these matters , out of novels , find their own way to a fit ending , much like the drop of water that works a patient way through sand and stones , and tenacious clay , at last to the root which awaits it in thirsty longing . Even after a week 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and two picnics , opportunitymakers for the aid of all deliberating lovers , all he contrived to say was one brief sentence that escaped him almost l ? efore he knew it , as the two sat together one Sunday night on Mr. Gay 's doorstep , the rose-freighted air breathing softest balm about them , and the young moon , slender as a dream , floating down the twilight sky . " Laura , have you found out yet whether you love me ? " " No 1 " snapped out this thorny young person , with a sudden red in her face that even the twilight could not hide . She did not say , " I donot , " thought Frank to himself . " Wo n't you try to find out ? " he replied , with a certain strenuous meekness quite as masterful as a demand . " I do n't know , " she answered ; but the tone was far more subdued , the doubt was half assurance . " Chateau qui parle , femme qui ecoute tous deux vout se rendre , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proverb , as Laura abruptly rose and left him to welcome Miss Greene , just home from another prayer meeting ; for Miss Greene was a good woman - conveniently good , though1* Frank Dyer . Matters went on very tranquilly after this . One little adventure occurred to Laura that was destined to be cut deep in her memory by after events . She went over to Winsted one day to the dressmaker , and Mrs. Dyer went with her . At the last moment Frank discovered important business would take him to the borough too ; and although both ladies assured him he would be dreadfully in the way , he was yet allowed to go on condition that he would not expect their society , but only meet them at the last train . Now Mrs. Dyer , though not equal to Mrs. Gay in size , was a fairly stout woman , and of all things despised a hill ; so after Laura 's dresses were talked over , fitted , tried on , her Sunday bonnet of last year a bit changed and sobered down for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peaches bought , Mrs. Dyer went to the hotel to take the carriage to the West street station . But Laura at the last moment remembered she must have some candy , and really it was absurd to ride up a little hill like that-she could buy her sweets and run up the road very nearly as fast as Aunt Bell could be driven up . But she was long buying her candy , there was a delay about change , and when Laura at last crossed the Lake street bridge she heard a whistle at the lower station , and supposing the train to be coming , hurried up the steps to the track , intending to cross the railroad bridge , which there runs high above the road , and affords a quick way to reach the cars . Luckily for her , the whistle she heard was that of the train just in from Hartford ; but she did not know that , and hurried over the plank that is laid across the open floor of the bridge for pedestrians . Her aunt and Frank stood on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Laura was sure-footed , and prided herself on her safe passage of many a dangerous place in her walks . This time , however , between hurry and carelessness , one foot slipped just as she got to the last tie of the track , and went down into space as far as it could . She threw her bundles away instinctively , and grasped the rail with both hands ; for an instaift she recalled that coming whistle , and shivered ; but the thought gave her desperate strength , and before Frank could reach her she had pulled herself forward on to the solid abutment , and was safe , though trembling with excitement and somewhat scraped and bruised . Frank 's face was white with terror , and he could not speak ; he just gathered up her bundles , drew her hand into his arm , and hastened to the platform , where Aunt Bell stood wringing her hands almost in hysterics . After this good woman was quieted and Laura in the cars on her way home beside the still silent Frank , she remembered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wondered what made him care so much about her , and if she ever could or would care about him enough to marry him , half smiling , half sighing over the idea . So that summer passed , and the Dyers with it , though they only went to New York . Autumn again painted all the world about Laura with its wondrous pigments . Sober Norfolk became transfigured ; respectable old Haystack flaunted in kingly robes of crimson and gold ; the great green valley turned to a ravine of fire and blood , darkened with the constant evergreen sentinels that withstood all temptations of gay attire ; the very ferns turned delicate bronze or faint yellow ; and weeping blackberry vines trailed garuet and saffron tracery over the scant grasses of the rocky hillsides . Laura went nutting with more than one party ; she gathered a bushel at least of gay leaves , and forgot to dry them ; she took long lonely walks and read volumes of nice , harmless poetry ; // her eyes grew dreamy , her manner abstracted ; life out-doors seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she began to hate the youths of Norfolk who fluttered about her like uninteresting moths only to burn their fingers . She wished it were summer , and behold , here was winter ; dreadful more dreadful than ever , for it rioted among the deep figures below zero-made the house dismal with cold o ' mornings and desperate with frozen water everywhere at night ; there were days when the post-office was not accessible , when the railroad itself was over-drifted and no New York paper even lifted the weight of their solitude with the assurance of a pleasant world somewhere beyond  --  a long and dreary winter , in which almost the only gleam of pleasure was the weekly pamphlet from Frank or the frequent letter from either his mother or himself . But after all , if one can endure , spring surely comes at last , and when May began to make the old hills green in patches and dot the sward with shy delicate blooms , Aunt Bell wrote that she had been so worn out with one influenza after another , a touch of pneumonia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctor had ordered her to leave New York at once , and she had resolved to take board at a hotel in Winsted till July , when of course she should come to Norfolk . Mrs. Gay fussed a good deal in her harmless way about this new caprice of Mrs. Dyer 's ; but she knew long ago it was of no use trying to move her sister 's fancy , however capricious it might be . Laura was very glad ; if Aunt Bell was so near , she could run down and see her any day . Nothing was said about Frank ; he never could leave New York so early ; but by-and-by , when June began , and Aunt Bell had coaxed Laura into coming to stay a week with her , much to the ( apparent ) astonishment of both ladies , Frank appeared Thursday night , to stay till the next Monday . How unfortunate it was that Laura had promised to go to Hartford with Miss Greene on Saturday . But then she was coming back at night , and since she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Frank promised to run down to Pine Meadow on the four o'clock train and meet her there ; he might be very useful , Aunt Bell said , to carry her bundles out of the car . Laura thought so herself . So at four o'clock the two simultaneously left Hartford and Winsted , flying toward each other on the wings of steam , though in a mighty prosaic fashion : Laura hot , tired , and cross ; for Aunt Bell had made her wear a thick black silk dress and a black hat and feathers-becoming enough , but fit for the cold Winsted morning , not for the hot Hartford noon-and then shopping is not always conducive to peace of mind when you can not possibly match your summer silk with trimming , or get the right shade of gloves , or suit yourself with a summer bonnet ; when you are blinded with tints of blue , gray , and lavender ; when your dresses demand white and black , with just a bit of rose-color in your bonnet , and you fall really in love with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want that exquisite French cambric , with a border of daisies to its blue ground , and have spent all your money but two dollars you have a right to be cross . So Laura was cross as , with half a dollar left in her portemonnaie after buying her ticket and her inevitable candy , and six bundles in her arms and hands , she seated herself in the train and moved slowly out of the station . In the mean time Frank bethought himself of the garnets that are to be found here and there in the rocks of Satan 's Kingdom ; and having a fitful fancy for geology , and remembering that he had an hour to wait for Laura , borrowed a hammer , and as the train crept at a snail 's pace through this evil-named gorge , dropped off the platform of the car , and proceeded to amuse himself . The day grew hotter toward night , as some days in the early // 1875 . HOW SHE FOUND OUT . season do . Geologizing is not done in the shade , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , good-tempered , and rested in the breezy cars , and thinking of Pine Meadow station more than she was aware . Suddenly the train stopped , and she was surprised to find the way so far passed over that they were waiting at the side track west of Stratton Brook for the four o'clock train from Winsted ; fifteen minutes dragged . on like an hour . By-and-by the steam whistle shrieked from a distance , the train rattled on to the siding , and with a vexed yell the detained engine was off again , as they swept , half an hour after , through the Kingdom gorge . Laura , who sat looking out of the window , saw a man try to get on the platform of the car , and fail . She thought it might be the engineer of the construction train at first , and then quick as light it flashed on her brain that it was Frank , who expected the train to slow as usual , and could not reach it . She flew to the rear door of the carby this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there he was running across the open floor on the single plank over that black swift river . Laura turned to the conductor with almost a cry . " Please , wo n't you stop the train ? Mr. Dyer is left here , and it is Saturday night . " " I ca n't , Miss Gay . " The conductor knew both Laura and Frank from their frequent transits over the road . " I wish I could , but we are fifteen minutes late . " She turned to look . Prank was gone . Laura felt her way back to her seat : she remembered her own fall on the bridge at Winsted ; and there came back to her a horrid story in the paper only yesterday , of an old lady whose daughter had come to bid her goodby at a train , and standing on the track to wave her handkerchief , the mother saw , as she rolled off in the car , another train run over her child , and kill her before her eyes . Laura shuddered ; but having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat down and considered what to do . At the Pine Meadow station there was no telegraph office . She could not stop there ; she could not go home in this horrible anxiety ; she must know the worst-if anything is worse than doubt . She went to the conductor again and asked him to tell the station-master at the Meadow , that if Mr. Dyer came there he might tell him that a wagon would be sent down for him from Winsted at once . Now , Laura did this , partly not to let the conductor know she was frightened-for she already , with the logic and justice of most young ladies , regarded this poor man as a callous and cruel brute not to have stopped for Frank  --  and partly to give Frank himself information that would set him at rest , if by any possible chance he had escaped the ghastly river , with its rocks and pools ; for Laura had enough poise left to remember that such a thing might be . But little did this young person know the ways of men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or the station-master to deliver it . They knew* very well that any average man could take care of himself without a girl 's intervention . Laura hates them both t , o this day ; but I do not know that it troubles either of them I Then she resolved to leave the train at New Hartford , for she knew certain Winsted people whom she knew well would get into the cars there , and she could send after a carriage to come down for her from the hotel and fetch her home . So , gathering all her bundles , she hurried* to the door , and as soon as they stopped seized upon the first gentleman she saw entering and charged him to tell the driver of the Blank House carriage to send a man down to New Hartford for her as soon as possible . " For my cousin , who was to meet me here , has been left at Pine Meadow , and I must wait . " Diplomatic little Laura I She did not see the furtive smile that curled the corners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal pronouns . // She did not know that he came down on the train with Frank , and knew perfectly well who he was waiting for ; much less did she know the conclusions he drew at once from her white , anxious face and wistful eyes . But he promised to give her message . Then where to leave her bundles ? The station-master assured her he should immediately shut up for the night , as there was no later train , but kindly advised her to go to the tavern . She would have asked where she could* find a wagon and driver ; but alas ! there was only half a dollar in that depleted pocket-book . So she found her way to the tavern , interviewed the landlord , and left her parcels in his keeping , telling him she expected to be sent for , and if th eman- from the Blank House , Winsted , came there before she got back , he must wait for her . Laura 's parcels were valuable-among them her pretty French Cashmere shawl , rolled up in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  but do you think she cared , when Frank was perhaps lying dead in that black river , what became of things ? So she gathered up the long train of her heavy dress , whicfL had been torn from its loopings before she left Hartford , and prepared to walk down to Pine Meadow . How hot and dusty the road was How long as a bad dream its dull track ! One wagon after another passed her , but Laura had no courage to ask for a ride . Two ladies in a pony-carriage drove down , and one turned and looked at her . Laura felt uneasily how peculi*r her appearance must be then and there , but she kept on till the Canal railroad station was in sight . Then she paused to consider . if Frank had not been drowned , of course he would walk up to the village ; if he got her message , he would stop at the station ; if not , he would probably take the track as shortest ; at any rate the road ran parallel to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mile side by side with that oi ? he Canal . She would walk down tIle rails and look across at the highway ; then she should be sure not to miss him ; so holding up her gown-that kept increasing still in weight-she stumbled on across the ties , her head turned toward the highway , till the two paths diverged so far that in the deepening twilight she could scarce discern figures , and in despair she took a little cart-path back to the road , and found herself close to the Pine Meadow station . It was shut tight ! nobody to be found . She looked along the lonely track toward the Kingdom bridge , but no figure appeared ; she heard the rushing river and the whispering trees sighing in the soft , damp air of the valley ; her heart sank very low . She could not walk to the bridge and then back to New Hartford ; her strength was all but gone now . Sadly she turned back and hunted up the station-master , only to find that he had shut up as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did . " " Had n't nobody ben there I " Then there lay all that walk to be retraced , and by this time hope had almost left her ; the tears came hot and fast to her eyes , and dropped unheeded . She went over , with the fertile imagination of a woman , not only all the probabilities but all the possibilities of the case : how should she tell Aunt Bell ; how glad she was that she had not confided her terrors to Mr. Blinn , for Aunt Bell might have had a real fit and died ; to hear such a rumor , and not be able to search it out , and Uncle Dyer not there either ! Poor Frank - poor Laura rather , she thoughtwhat should she do without him ? If she asked herself any further questions , they are unknown to this deponent . But the hot night grew hotter to her all the time ; her feet ached as well as her heart ; it is well that we have bodies to deaden the aches of our souls sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time with but one lady . She drove very slowly , and Laura , with her heart in her mouth , took courage and said timidly , though clearly , // The lady stopped and assented . " Can I ride up with you , please ? I am so tired . " " Certainly . " And in another moment Laura was safe beside this friend in need , inexpressibly relieved as to her weariness , and very glad to have her companion ask , " Are you not Miss Gay of Norfolk ? " And then Laura told her story , too glad to be known and befriended to remember or care for any possible inferences . Blessed are the sympathizers ! they give the most precious gifts of earth . Man does not live by bread alone even in this mortal life ; we exist on other food than that which is physical . Had Mrs. Parker been sarcastic , and sniffed at Laura as a foolish girl , scared at nothing , and assured her a man was always able to look out for himself , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have added a third to her list of hates ; but Mrs. Parker was a lady , and knew better . Life had not made her bitter any more than nature . She soothed poor Laura with the kindliest words , assured her she should feel just so in the same circumstances , and proposed at once that they should drive right back to the tavern , and see if Mr. Dyer had by any chance been there ; but he had not The landlord had seen somebody who looked like a stranger ride by , but he was with another man , and went up to the depot . So to the depot they went , to find that all closely shut ; then Mrs. Parker suggested that he might have come up to the telegraph office and sent a message for her to Winsted , thinking she would be alarmed ; but when they got there the operator had gone to tea ; she must be looked for , and when they found her there was no record of any message for the last hour . Mrs. Parker , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her , bundles and all , to wait for the " team " from Winsted , which the landlord of the tavern promised to send to Mrs. Parker 's when it came ; and the homesick , heartsick girl was only too glad to go . The cool , quiet house , the friendliness , the rest , seemed to Laura 's undisciplined soul only aggravations ; she wanted to do something ; she could not swallow the nice supper set before her ; she could not even drink the tea ; she paced up and down the piazza in restless misery , till at last the idea occurred to her to telegraph to a friend of Frank 's who was boarding at the hotel in Winsted with his wife , and find out if her cousin had been heard from there . So she wrote a hasty message : " Has Frank come home ? I am left in New Hartford . " Laura Gay . " Further particulars she spared , thinking of that half dollar ! and when Mrs. Parker 's little boy had gone down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return . It was seven o'clock now : by eight at most she ought to see the wagon from Winsted , and before that she should hear from Mr. White . An hour ! The next fifteen minutes were like a day to her ; and at every roll of wheels over the bridge below , her heart jumped . But nobody came ! By-and-by the boy returned , but there was no answer to her message . At eight-oh , how long first ! - Mr . Parker came home , and proving to be an old acquaintance of Laura 's , was as kind as his wife . He went at &amp;nce down to the livery stable , which they had not thought of , to see if any one had been there to hire a horse , as it was the only place where one could be had , and surely Mr. Dyer would not think of walking to Winsted . Laura was by this time nearly frantic . Nobody came for her ; no answer arrived to her telegram ; nothing could be heard of Frank . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like an awful nightmare . She beat against these bars of circumstance like a newly-pris // oned bird ; she begged Mr. Parker to order a carriage for her at ten o'clock , for if nothing happened by that time , she must and would go back to Winsted ; she must reach her aunt-she must know something ! They all pitied her ; they were all good to her . Perhaps her fervent gratitude to them stands balanced in her record against her hatred of the conductor and station-master . I think the gratitude outweighs the hate if that be so ; it is so much the rarer emotion . But even the kindness and pity could but pacify the external expression of Laura 's wild and impatient distress . The minutes passed in slow torture ; her nerves were racked with doubt and dread ; her incisive and impatient nature could know no more unendurable pangs than those of suspense . Mr. Parker did not come home : he had then no good news to bring ! Night darkened over the hills about her ; mists curled up from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below ; the tranquil stars came out softly into the misty heaven . Laura looked at this still world with dumb rage and reproach . Frank dead in that whispering river , and all the world so silent , calm , and sweet I It was horrible . Where should she go ? what should she do ? Her head throbbed with pain and excitement . She walked up and down in the night air till she was shivering with the chill , though her head and her eyes were still aflame . Kind Mrs. Parker , with pity in every tone , tried to make her sit down and rest ; she did not try to comfort her any more . Laura noticed that . Nine o'clock : must she give up all hope ? Just then hoofs rattled on the bridge , clattered up the hill . Mr. Parker 's cheery voice cried out that there was news , and in a moment more Laura tore open a telegram from Winsted : down in a chair somebody gave her . Her strength was all gone . There are human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joy I nowhere near enough to describe the blessed relief and rapture that made our little girl so weak , so con tent . Now she could remember her politeness , and try to express her vivid gratitude to these kindest of all people who had helped her in time of need . But it seemed to her as if words failed even there : she had to cease herself and hear how Mr. Parker had heard nothing at the stable , and being then a little alarmed himself , had kept the telegraph office open as long as he could , hoping to hear from Winsted . Let us take the time while Laura is waiting in hope-far different dispensation from the waiting in fear  --  to explain how this missing young gentleman had spent his time for the three hours during which his fate had been so doubtful to his dismayed " cousin. ** When Frank found himself at five o'clock in the gorge tired and heated with climbing , his pockets full of specimens , and his hands bruised against the rocks , he resolved to wait there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any one to reach the car steps easily , rather than to walk in a hurry up to Pine Meadow . When the cars passed him so fast he still thought they would stop for him on the other side of the bridge , as the conductor had seen him , he supposed , from the baggage car ; so he ran over the single plank , never thinking it to be dangerous , and coming to no harm , except , indeed , that he perceived the train did not slacken speed , and that further effort was useless ; so he turned at once into the highway , and prepared to walk to New Hartford . Just then it must have been that Laura turned to look again after speaking to the conductor ; for the road turns at " I am coming for you . Wait where right angles with the bridge , while the train curves but little there ; and you are . , , standing back in the car , she could not " Frank Dyer . see the road , but only the bridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an old farmer whom he persuaded to put one of his horses into a wagon and carry him to Winsted ; and so it happened that while Laura , hot and anxious , was trudging down the Canal railroad track , Frank was quietly driving up the highway , and she had failed to recognize him so far off , having moreover made up her mind that he would walk . They had driven up to the depot at New Hartford , for the farmer had some errand there , and would have been seen again and probably recognized in passing the hotel had they not , to save time , taken a little by-road that cut off a scorner and put them sooner on the turnpike . Frank thought of sending a telegram , but supposed the conductor had seen him , and would tell Laura he was left , as she would ask probably , on his not appearing at the Meadow station , if he had come down in the four o'clock train . When he got home and did not find Laura , his mother having gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no information from her . Mr. and Mrs. White had gone to ride , and the telegram from Laura lay safely on the floor of their room , shoved in through the crack of the door I The landlord asserted that Laura did not come home in the carriage , and now both driver and carriage were gone to the Naugatuck train . Frank naturally supposed she was left in Hartford , and very tranquilly sat down and ate his supper , and then went up street to hunt up Mr. Blinti and see if he had seen her on the train , as it was just possible she might have heard from Miss Greene news to take her back to Norfolk , though he felt a certain chagrin that she had not in either case thought of her aunt 's iiatural anxiety and telegraphed to her . Mr. Blinn was not in his office , so Frank went on to send a telegram to Hartford , and there learned of Laura 's message to Mr. White , sent his own down to her , and waited till her answer came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and drove back to the hotel for wraps and to interview the driver who had received Mr. Blinn 's order at the cars , and find out why it was not executed . But that worthy was in a muddled frame of mind not unusual to him , and " did n't remember nothin ' beout it anyhow . " So , with a mildly derogatory remark , Frank went his way to New Hartford , quite unconscious of Laura 's anxiety , and wondering not a little how she came to be so silly as to get off the last train at New Hartford , and on Saturday night too . Her reply to his message had been , " Will wait at Mr. E. B. Parker*s " ; so after an inquiry or two he drove directly to the house . It was dark by this time , or Laura , who was at the door to meet him , might have been a little confused at his look of surprise when she threw herself into his arms and began to sob ! Here was an event to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a child , hanging on his neck in tears , and before utter strangers . Mrs Parker came to the rescue . " Mr. Dyer , I presume . Miss Gay has been dreadfully frightened . " " Frightened ? " echoed the bewildered man . " Oh , Frank I for three hours I have not known if you were dead or alive . I thought you were drowned . " " Come , " said he in a curt masculine way , being in fact mightily tickled with the obvious state of affairs . " Put your things on , Laura ; we ought to go directly-it is late " ; and while Laura , meek as any nun , folded herself in the wraps he brought and hunted up her bundles , Mr. Dyer made his warm acknowledgments to Mr. and Mrs. Parker , and obtained some idea of the complications he had unwittingly caused . It was after ten o'clock when they drove out of the little village ; the moon glittered just above the crest of an eastern hill , red and hot through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a tender dream over the woods , and drew out
