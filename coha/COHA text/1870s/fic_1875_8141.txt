Carleton , Will , 1845-1912 : Waitin ' to Be a Bride . from Waitin ' to Be a Bride ( 1875 ) And so you 'll soon be goin ' away , My darling little Bess ; And you ha ' been to the town , to-day , To buy your weddin ' dress ; And so your dear old mother an ' I , Whose love you long have known , Must lay the light o ' your presence by , And walk the road alone . So , come , to-night , with mother and me , To the porch , for an hour or two , And sit on your old father 's knee , The same as you used to do ; For we , who ha ' loved you , many a year , And clung to you , strong an ' true , Since we 've had the young Professor here , Have not had much of you . But lovers be lovers , while earth endures ; And once , on a time , be it known , I helped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our own ; And we laid it out in a garden-spot , And dwelt in the midst of flowers , Till we found the world was a good-sized lot , And most of it was n't ours . You 're heavier , girl , than when you come To us , one winter 's day , And seemed to feel so little at home , We feared you would n't stay ; Till I knew the danger was passed ; because You 'd struck so mortal a track , And got so independent and cross , God never would let you back ! But who would ever ha ' had a whim , When you lay in my arms an ' cried , You 'd sometime sit here , pretty and prim , A-waitin ' to be a bride ! But lovers be lovers , while earth goes on , And marry , as they ought ; And if you would keep the love you 've won , Remember what you 've been taught ! Look , first , that your wedded lives be true , With naught from each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grow In the soil of a faithless heart . Look , next , that the buds of health shall rest Their blossoms upon your cheek ; For life and love are a burden , at best , If the body be sick and weak . Look , next , that your kitchen-fire be bright , And your hands be neat and skilled ; For the love of man oft takes its flight , If his stomach be not well filled . Look , next , your money be fairly earned , Ere ever it be spent ; For comfort and love , however turned , Will ne'er pay ten per cent . And , next , due care an ' diligence keep , That the mind be trained an ' fed , For blessings e'er look shabby an ' cheap , That light on an empty head . And if it shall please the gracious God That children to you belong , Remember , my child , an ' spare the rod , Till you 've taught ' em right an ' wrong ; And show ' em that though this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt , Yet heaven an ' earth ai n't so far apart As some good folks make out .
