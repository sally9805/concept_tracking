txt The reader of THACKERAY wilt remember that , in the Profasaione of Fits Boodle , that ingenuous aristocrat proposes to add to the limited number of vocations which it is supposed a gentleman may enter  --  those of auctioneer and dinner-master or caterer . With regard to the first mentioned , our rePublican simplicity has long ago made possible in earnest what the satirist threw out in jest , and if the other suggested occupation has not yet been included in the avowed list of gentlemanly callings , it is probably because the people who give dinners are unwilling to admit in themselves any need for instruction in the arts of entertainment . But the proposition is pow made to open to those of the polite world , for whom the departments of law , divinity , or medicine have no places , Still another field of industry . more odd and in many respects more congenial than either of those brought forward by THACKERAY 'S hero . This is the profession of master gardener , in which it is asserted a gentleman might find ample room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the least from that somewhat vague sense of dignity Which attaches to the title . The study of botany is not only an elegant accomplishment to be taught at young ladies ' seminaries with music , embroidery , and the modern languages , and speedily forgotten . Rightly regarded , it is an erudite and masculine pursuit , fertile in profound analogies bearing upon the history of our race , and to which no man after Lmatzeus need be ashamed of giving his life . Then why should not the master of this beautiful science lend his services and information to those with less knowledge and more money than himself ? The ordinary gardener of the present , we are told , is usually an illiterate , commonplace person , whose knowledge is wholly of that superficial and vulgar sort called practical , whose care is limited to seeing that his plants flourish , and . his blossoms are profuse , and who may or may not have a dim , rude instinct for harmony of color and proportion . Bat for the subtle poetry of flowers , the epigrams and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no sense , and is as competent to develop to the fullness of their lovely possibilities to latent resources of fm extensive garden as an organ-grinder , let us say , to compose " Beethoven 's Ninth Symphony . " So ranch for the scope of the new calling . Its attractiveness scarcely needs an argument , its healthfulness is quite as manifest , and its dignity is upheld by the living testimony of all the English essayists , with BACON in the van . There is even more ancient evidence to commend its respectability to the most fastidious , for as the old distich tells us , " when Adam delved and Eve span , who was then the gentleman ? " The " grand old gardener , " who , according to TENNYSON , " smiles at the claims of long descent , " might trbat with equal derision the pride that is ashamed of the noblest , and if age be a mark of honor , the most honorable of human callings . These are in brief the arguments advanced in favor of the new departure in learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the law schools , medical colleges and theological seminaries throughout the land , or set young gentlemen everywhere to breaking their heads over the mysteries of nhenogamous and . ? rimtogamou8 , or setting out experimental plantations in back yards . It will be long , probably , before we shall read in the daily papers , advertisements explaining that " a graduate of Harvard and . Fellow of the Botanical Institute desires a situation as assistant gardener ; is sober and industrious , and has good recommendations from his last place . " But merit may be accorded the suggestion if it inspires gentlemen who have gardens to find health and amusement in giving more practical attention to the pursuit which BACON and ADDISON loved , and . we may be content to wait somewhat longer for the advent of the great innovator who shall give to flower gardening that rank among the polite arts which its elder brother , landscape-gardeuing , long since attained at the bands of such votaries as OLMSTED and MITCHELL .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
