txt A STARTLING EXHIBIT . New York Times ( 1857-Current file ) ; Jan 15 , 1879 ; ProQuest Historical Newspapers The New York Times ( 1851 - 20 ( pg . 4 A STARTLING EXHIBIT . Gov . MCCLELLAN , in his first Message , gives prominence to the subject of county and municipal indebtedness , the burdens it imposes , and the cause by which alone relief can be honestly obtained . More or less attention is accorded to the same subject by half a dozen other Governors in their communications to the Legislatures of their respective States ; but though they say enough to indicate the importance of the problem , they contribute little or nothing toward its solution . Illinois is one of the few States whose Auditor has been enabled to tabulate the municipal debt . His statement shows that the total of this form of indebtedness in Illinois is little less than $52,000,000 , of which , according to Gov . CuLLom , nearly 30 per cent , represents obligations incurred in aid of railroads . Michigan only knows that the indebtedness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make provision for acquiring the requisite data . Gov . WILLIAMS tells the legislators of Indiana that " it is not the State taxes but the county and township taxes and fees of officers that oppress the people ; " but his Message does not embody . particulars . Gov . HARTRANFT discusses at some length the need of a reform of the municipal system of the State , which at present fosters extravagance , debt , and taxation . " It is apparent to all , " he says , " that , under the present system the bankruptcy of our Pennsylvania larger cities is only a question of time . " But we have no figures to determine the literal significance of the remark . In Ohio , again , as Gov . BISHOP shows , while the State debt does not exceed $6,000,000 , the county and municipal debts , in the aggregate , exceed $41 , - 000,000 . .. It is creditable to Gov. ? MCCLELLAN that he has endeavored by his own efforts to gather a portion of the information which the New-Jersey Legislature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local indebtedness is more striking in NewJersey than in Ohio . Within the year , NewJersey has reduced its indebtedness as a State by $600,000 ; the total existing debt amounts to $2,196,300 , of which all but about $700,000 is already provided for by a sinking fund . The time is not distant , then , when this fund will furnish all the means required to meet the principle and interest of the debt . , On the other hand , we lately published an approximate estimate of the municipal indebtedness of the State , amounting to $50,000,000 , or about 10 per cent . on its assessed valuation . The Governor 's inquiries appear to have been confined to nine cities , and tho exhibit he makes more than justifies the apprehensions that have been entertained with regard to the financial future of some of them . The nine comprise Jersey City , Hoboken , Newark , Paterson , Elizabeth , Rahway , New-Brunswick , Trenton , Camden ; and their aggregate indebtedness is $36 , - 502,722 , or nearly one-sixth of their entire taxable property , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ levied , only $223,998 is on account of the State . The city taxes are $3,440,034 . Looking at these New-Jersey burdens in heir relation to population , the three most oppressed cities are Rahway , Elizabeth , and Jersey City . The debt of the first , ' per head , is $243 and the expenses , also per head , $23 ; of the second , $224 and $14 , respectively ; of the third , $130 and $16 , respectively . New-Brunswick comes next , with a debt of $88 per head , and expenses $10 ; then Newark , $71 and $8 , respectively ; then Hoboken , Paterson , Trenton , and Camden , with burdens diminishing in the order named . Evidently , the NewYorker , anxious to escape taxation , will not transfer his abode to any of the five cities , whose inhabitants , according to Gov . MCCLELLAN , are groaning under debts recklessly incurred , and expenses which they are ill-fitted to provide . And yet it may be fairly inferred that the ruinous indebtedness of Rahway and Elizabeth , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the view of attracting pram - lation during the era of real estate inflation . Elizabeth , which has absolutely nothing to recommend it beyond its railroad facilities , put on the airs of a thriving city ; spent borrowed money to suit the purposes of speculators in houses and lots ; and incurred ? obligations which make its bankruptcy merely a question of time . Rahway has been ruined . by the same folly . Now-Brunswick , with more advantages of situation , moved more moderately , but still unwisely . And Jersey City , in its eagerness to outstrip Brooklyn as an absorbent of New-York 's surplus , rushed late debt at tr rate that billet , brigd water into the mouths of the Brooklyn Aldermen . There is danger that New-Jersey will suffer in the estimation of many who are on the lookout for new homes . The State will be prejudiced by the . bad financial condition of its spendthrift municipalities . Outside of these cities , however , its position is a strong one . Gov . MCCLELLAN expresses the opinion that " as a general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good . " The farmers are cautious and safe . Speculators and jobbers are the root of the evil . Gov . HARTRANFT sees no likelihood of maintaining the solvency of overburdened Pennsylvania cities except through the adoption of a plan for their government substantially resembling the plan devised 1 ) y the New-York Commission . Gov . ' MCCLELLAN bases his hopes upon the greater willingness of the individual citizen hereafter to take a more active part in municipal affairs . Only thus , the Governor argues , can existing embarrassments be overcome and their recurrence prevented . Those who have a direct interest in honest and economical local government must exert themselves " to restore order to the financial affairs of the municipalities and townships " " and preserve the financial good name of localities suffering under a burden too heavy to be borne , " or the system of municipal government will suffer a shock not easily to be overcome . We fear that the Governor talks to ears that will not listen . His argument is unanswerable , but it has been pressed on tax-payers ' attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The cities and townships which rushed recklessly into debt , must endure the consequences . For the rest , nothing less than stringent constitutional provisions , keeping withinnarrow limits the proportion of debt to values , and prescribing with equal strictness the possible purposes of loans , will arrest the tendency to spend borrowed money lavishly .
