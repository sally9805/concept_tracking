txt Even if Judge DAVIS were never to try another cause , his managnment of the two important trials just concluded would . entitle him to grateful and distinguished remembrance in the annals of our American Judiciary . And this not only or chiefly because , throughout those trials , he displayed more than many of our Judges the qualities and . virtues that most adorn a Judge . To say that his bearing on the Bench was marked by dignity , impartiality , and uprightness , is to say simply that he did his duty , and praise for doing that in less degenerate days might savor almost of reproach . " The popular Judge , " soya BACON , " is a deformed thing , " and by this he meant the judge whose action is directed . by the hope of vulgar applause , rather than theparamount interests of truth and justice . If the simple performance of duty has nowadays grown so uncommon that it seems a thing to be commended and rewarded , we need . look no further for the causes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Davis , if we eatirnate him rightly , would have little gratitude for praise accorded on that score , least of all for praise - which implied an invidious distinction over his brethren of the Bench . But it was the fortune of this Magistrate to decide in the course of the trials of Crones and TWEED two points , of apparently minor importance , but really of primary moment to the future administration of justice in this community . It was his merit that the opportunity which chance afforded was seized with , unerring appreciation and admirable decision . The lesson he gave to the two offending jurors may seem to many unnecessarily severe . It was not so , if we eons der that the iseue involved scarcely less than the continued existeace of the system of trial by jury . It vas that system which was on trial in the Stokes case , not less than the prisoner in the dock . Successive instances of its liability to corruption or error had . greatly weakened public faith in its further efficacy or usefulness as an instrument ofjustiee . Had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . even the flagrant violations c-a propriety on the part of the-se two jurors been permitted , as they might well have been by a more indulgent or less inflexible Judge , to pass - without rebuke or punishment , it is not too much to say that the jury system would have received a blow from which , in the existing state of public opinion , it might with difficulty have recovered . That Judge Davis perceived at once the importance of the crisis , and . acted upon it with decision , involves the credit of being more than a good Jedg ?  --  and that is a good . citizen . The service he was able to render in the TWEED case , while of a somewhat different nature. , is even more salutary andimportant . Ile taught the New-York Bar , what many of its members seem to have forgotten , and what , indeed , they have had only teo much reason to forgot , that the office of Judge is one of dignity and honor , and . that every lawyer honors himself and his profession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is essential to the public welfare , and where it is not given freely , it is the Judge 's duty to enforce it . The proceeding for which TWEED 'S counsel were very properly fined and . rebuked can hardly be defended on any consistent understanding of the relatioa between Bench and Bar , or any just conception of their reciprocal obligations . In an English court there is little doubt that , as Judge DAVIS said , it would have been punished by disbarring  --  a remedy for legal misconduct which it is to be regretted . is all too unfamiliar to our practice . The reproof administered to the offenders was as timely as it was calm , unimpassioned , and just . To the younger members of the Bar it should prove especially valuable in the way of instruction and . warning . It will teach them that the old period of laxity and corruption has passed away , and that they may before long hope to see revived that golden period of our law , when New-York Judges had honor wherever their names were 1:nown , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tribunals . A less worthy , hut perhaps a more natural reason , should even inspire in the younger part of the profession a feeling of gratitude to Judge DAVIS for thus repressing the encroachments of their elders . In point of fact , he has iu this matter been fighting their battle as well as that of the Bench . In taking so decided and unmistakable a stand against the system of intimidation and irregular influences of all sorts , by which our courts have so often been manipulated , he is really opening the door to merit , industry , and talent , that would have otherwise stood but little chance of making any way . He has given notice that hereafter bullying , either of courts or counsel , will be much less effective weapons toward winning causes than legal learning and shill . Thu importance of these services is not yet , perhaps , rightly or fully estimated . We rate it highly , and we believe that the future will sustain oar jraasaent . But even should the effect he less beneficial than we trust and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DAVIS has thereby won for himself -- a place in the roll of our most honored Judges , a fit successor of HOFFMAN , DUER , and KENT .
