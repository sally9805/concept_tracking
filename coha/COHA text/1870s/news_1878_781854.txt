txt The Senate has very wisely increased from $125,000 to $250,000 the provision in the House Fortification bill for the armament of the sea-coast forts . The existing armament of our fleets and forts is so far surpassed in range , penetrating power , and weight by the guns of all other first-class powers , that the Chief of the Bureau of Naval Ordnance puts the matter tersely when he says , " We have our whole artillery to reconstruct . " What is quite as serious is the fact that:the neglect of adequate appropriations for years has had such influence on the private gun foundries that now only two in the country have still at hand the costly plant needed to ma aufactare heavy guns ; should continued inertness drive these to divert their machinery to more useful ends , the country would bo forced to go to European foundries for its sea-coast and naval artillery , especially in case of sudden need . What makes this backwardness specially mortifying , as well as discreditable , is the now almost forgotten fact that our country was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of modern warfare , while seine of the recent marvelous additions to the power of this ordnance can be traced to American origin . When the 11-inch and 15-inch American smooth-bores were first carried in the monitors , these huge guns dwarfed any artillery ever put on shipboard , and were regarded with amazement . Since then , American inventions in the methods of rifling heavy guns , in powder , and in expanding projectiles , have been reproduced , and doubtless in some eases improved , in foreign countries , while little or nothing has been done with them at home . Even the marvelous results lately obtained by the Armstrong chambering process have been traced by good authority to their . origin in an American chambered gull , built many years ' ago , while several other completed systems of construction patented hero , but never used to the proper extent , if , indeed , to any extent , have , when boldly seized upon by foreign gun-makers in England , France , Germany , or Austria , gained them great riches and honors . It is largely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and impetus have been derived which have sent foreign nations far ahead of our own in effective ordnance . Several of them have a good supply of guns that can penetrate the armor of the heaviest iron-clad in ' service anywhere . How much of the blame of American backwardness is to be laid at the door of Congress for its meagre appropriations , and how much at the door of those military and naval authorities whose duty it is to see that the appropriations , whatever they are , are effectively applied , and that no valuable additions to ordnance construction are left in neglect , we need not undertake to discuss . What we see is that obsolete ordnance is carried about in our ships , while powerful guns of American . conception , and very likely also of American handicraft , grace the ships of other powers . It is possible that if the authorities in question had put ever so strongly to Congress the actual needs of our forts and ships , and with a zeal , singleness of pin. - pose , and clearness of statement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evaded the subject as dry , or as requiring an outlay which would too much reduce the amount of miscalled " economy " which they proposed to exhibit to admiring constituents . Be that as it may , there is no doubt that earnest , simple , and persuasive presentations , by competent authority , of the national needs would be timely now , and i6 is to be hoped that , as a beginning , this Senate amendment to the Fortification bill will be agreed to by the House . It is generally admitted that all the new ships that may be built should be armed with steel , breech-loading , rifled guns of the modern and most approved patterns ; and further , that the batteries of such existing vessels as bid fair to have any long period of usefulness as war-ships should by degrees be renovated with the same powerful arms . In addition , our coastwise forts should be supplied with guns of a calibre and power equal to those which are mounted even in foreign war vessels , to say nothing of fixed fortifications . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it ' may be said that five years ago the heaviest gun mounted on any ship was the 35-ton ; now we find the weight nearly tripled by the 100-ton gun , using projectiles of from 2,000 to 2,500 pounds weight . When to the prodigious size of the projectiles thrown by European guns it is added that seine of them have the almost incredible range of nine mires , it will be seen how puny in comparison are most of the guns in our forts  --  still more those in our ships . It is undoubtedly true that , so far as the Navy is concerned , there is no question about the larger calibres destined for seamonsters like the Dandolo and.Diulrn . Such ordnance would be useless to any vessels that we are ever likely to construct ; for the penetrability of any armor , however thick , has now ceased to make absolute impregnability longer aimed it . But with regard to such ordnance as could be handled and carried on our existing cruisers , or the cruisers of the immediate future , there is much to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ striking power of the projectile of the new British 0-inch rifled gun is double that of the projectile thrown from the American 0-inch smooth-bore . This latter gun is , nevertheless , a leading feature of the armament of some of our best sea-going vessels . Evidently , then , the cast-iron smooth-bores which once served our turn , must now bo displaced for something more effective . The comparison just spoken of is only one of many that could be adduced to show the inferiority of the greater part of the guns now in our vessels , weight for weight , as compared with foreign ordnance . It has always boon a point of pride in our country  --  or it always was , in an elder day ? to furnish our sailors with means for fighting on fair terms ; and even when our ships were very fow in number , they carried powerful batteries . It frequently happened in the war of 1812 that while British ships carr 1 more guns than American ships of the same class , the latter had the greater weight of metal . Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if now some of our ships should encounter in battle English ships with fewer guns and even of smaller calibre , the latter , iu range and effectiveness , would be found superior . To repair past neglects in this particular is the urgent duty of Congress .
