qwq class in front , and by her a fine - looking white-haired old man . As the prayer end ed , she fell across his breast ; it was the helplessness of exhausted , unavailing grief ; and hold her and grieve over her as he might , yet the father had to give her up , for the parting hour had come . We saw this picture as we moved slowly past . It was the constantly recurring do mestic tragedy of emigration . I could have called out to her to stay ; for in that in stant I saw back into the time when I had learned to know how painful is the process of founding a new country . What loneli ness , what privations , what trials of every kind , went to the first steps of even that rich and lovely country of California-an experience which made one sure that what cost so much to build must not be broken up ; an experience , too , which was in such strange contrast to all that belonged before and since in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its own outlines and color . The many memories this gave rise to unfolded themselves in long talks constantly renewed , until they crystallized into what we named the year of American travel : somethiun necessarily personal and narrowed to personal experience , but interwoven with a period of governing importance to our country . When it was first planned that I should go to California , in the spring of 1848 , the gold discoveries had not been made . In August of that year was the first finding , and with the uncertain , slow communications then had with that coast , it was nearly winter before the news reached us in Washington . It seems odd to recall now the little vial of gold- dust so carefully brought as voucher for the startling story . A long sail down the coast to Mazatlan , then the crossing through Mexico , then another sailing vessel to New Orleans , made the chance mailroute : only a strong party could risk itself overland , and few ventured into the winter . For reasons which belonged with the military history of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I , too , decided to go to the newly acquired Territory and live on some lands we had there . It would be too long here to go into these reasons , but those who may share my wish always to know " why , " and get completed ideas , I would refer to my father 's Thirty Years ' View , * the second volume , and the chapters that treat of the acquisition of California . Judge Black said to me lately that my father 's * Senator Bonton . THERE are some years of our lives that compare with the others as our October days do with those of the rest of the year . They follow the fitful , doubting spring and the heat of summer , and beyond them lie the short cold days of winter ; but they themselves are perfect rest , and their still , gentle influence is made perfect by the merciful veil of mist that shuts out past and future , and leaves only the serene present . In such an October time we had made our charming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us ; for there we had walked upon the very rampart where the buried majesty of Denmark had walked before us . By so much were we closer to Shakspeare 's Hamlet-not the Hamlet of the foot-lights , but Hamlet the Dane . And we had heard the low lapping of the waves on the sands of Elsinore , an ( l thought " of them that sleep , Fall many a fathom deep , fly thy wild and stormy steep , Elsinore . " And , in short , we had been where centuries of tradition and fancy and fact had blended into an atmosphere that shut out ordinary ideas , and left us in that charmed and dreamlike state of mind which I am afraid can only belong with an old country where every thing " stays put , " where the word " fixed " has its corresponding meaning in facts . One of our little party , perhaps because of always living in such an atmosphere , argued against " the good " of this , but she had never known the ordeal of being uprooted and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large grief that these infold . " I knew the good and the necessity of progress in a nation , but I knew also what it cost the individual to make part of this progress . This question of ha utepolitique-whet her the nation should be for the good of the individual , or the individual for the good of the nation-was one that often came up for discussion at the " family hearth . " We christened our compartment of the railway carriage by this name , for the hours we were seated there gave us the best opportunity for talking over what we saw and the many ideas suggested . Just out of Hamburg our train halted at a station where an emigrant train was ready to go off to connect with the steamer for America . The people were all gathered at the village station . The afternoon sun came bright on their uncovered heads as they knelt in a parting prayer ; their pustor , standing with uplifted hands , in the // work " had the privilege of standing uncontradicted . " He was exact in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " to secure evidence when it presented itself , " and in that way , from the best official and personal sources , he gives the exact record of that period . Since then there have been such great events that even important matters of that time have been overlaid and obscured , except to those who lived through them . And lately two works have been published by writers of distinction which show this , as they have just reversed some of the most prominent facts relating to the early history of California . Nothing could have been more complete than the arrangements which were to make this journey delightful as well as comfortable . By waiting until March my father would be free to go with me after the session of Congress was over . He looked forward with eagerness to this journey over the track of the early Spanish conquests . His large knowledge of Spanish history upon our continent , aided by his knowledge of the Spanish language , gave this part of the voyage a peculiar interest to him . My father 's French and Spanish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became his friends also . He not only comprehended , but strongly felt for , their bewilderment at finding themselves under new and strange laws . He knew that this condition must obtain in California also . He wished to know personally the newly acquired country , its people , and its needs . If it was to remain a Territory , he , as Senator from Missouri , had the neighbor 's right to look out for its interests ; and from many causes , personal , political , and geographical , this friendly representation would have been for him , as a queen of Spain said of something akin to this , mi privilegio , prerogativa , y derecho-my privilege , my prerogative , and my right . But not even my father foresaw how much they would need this , nor the shameful injustice of our government in disregarding its treaty stipulations , and despoiling them . General Herran , then minister from New Granada , gave us letters to his friends in Panama , although it was not probable that we should be long enough there to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Washington on business connected with his new enterprises of mail steamers to the Pacific , and the projected Panama Railroad , was a great favorite with my father , who gave him a standing invitation to dine with us whenever he could , and talk over at that leisure time the large interests opened by these new channels for Oriental commerce . * Colonel Iligginson 's Child 's History of America . General Sherman 's Memoirs . Coming to us in this familiar way , Mr. Aspinwall entered into the family anxieties regarding my journey with all the sympathies of his kind nature . His experience taught him how to render these sympathies efficient , and he made the most thorough arrangements for my comfort and security . In short , every thing that foresight and friendship could do was planned : how events disposed of our well-laid plans was another thing . I have been reading lately a reprint of the letters of the Hon. Miss Eden , who was with her bro4her , Lord Auckland , when he was Governor-General of India . She says that although only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account , as giving the details of their two years ' journey of inspection , and the contrast of that past time , when to seven persons belonged a retinue of twelve thousand people , with elephants , camels , and horses to match , with the present condition of India , where now railroads have reduced the Governor-General to a first-class passenger with a travellingbag . In the same way I look back to my preparations for that voyage into the unknown - all the planning and reading and grief and fears-in contrast with the seven days ' pleasure trip of to - day . Mr. Aspinwall , who had so large a part in making things smooth for me on that first journey , was near me at a morning wedding when , quite simply , and in the same tone with which he had been speaking of the bride and the flowers , he said , " Have you any messages for San Francisco ? we leave for there tonight to be gone six weeks . " Only twenty years had brought about this wonderful change . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ended ; to live through them day by day and hour by hour is another thing . I look up at the little water-color which is my r6sum6 of that time of severance from all I held indispensable to happiness-it was made for me on the spot , and gives my tent under the tall cotton-woods , already browned and growing bare with the coming winter winds . Mr. Fremoat was to make a winter crossing of the mountains , and I went with him in October to his starting-point , the Delaware Indian reservation on the frontier of Missouri , to return when he left , and remain at home in Washington until my time came to start in March . Of every thing in the Centennial Exhibition , I think nothing interested me so much as the display made by Kansas . It seemed so few years since I had been there , when only a small settlement marked the steamboat landing where now Kansas City // stands . Looking at its silk manufactures , its produce of not only essentials , but luxuries , it was hard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indians and wolves for figures . I had been there before to meet Mr. Fremont on his return from different journeys ; this time it was to stay with him until the last preparations were completed . The party was gone . Major Cummings was to take me the next day to connect with the river steamer at Westport Landing ( now Kansas City ) . He had been annoyed by a wolf ; which carried off his sheep to her cubs , and had just succeeded in following up her trail and destroying her young ones , and as the place was not far , the good major took me over for a " pleasant change of ideas . " I was sorry for the wolf , " still for all sins of hers , " with the mother nature , coming back to her ruined place and her dead cubs . We came back by way of the deserted camp , which did not lessen my sympathy for the wolf ; the ashcs of the morning 's fire were still warm . Altogether nothing alleviated the lonely impression of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moaning with a toothache , while the creak of his wife 's rocking- chair was the only other break to the silence . I was glad to go off to sleep . While one is young , that comes with surprising readiness . The house was a succession of logcabins , set , some gable end on , some facing front , making a series of rooms alternating with open places , having only the connecting roof . These frontier houses grow as the family requirements increase ; the timber and the strong willing hands are there , and the getting a new house costs no heartburnings or cares . This establishment of Major Cummings 's , who had been for thirty years superintendent of Indians there , was of many years ' growth , and my room was the extreme end of the last added wing . A stone chimney built up on the outside gave an ample fire-place , where the great fire of logs made a cheerful home light in the great clean room . My good " aunt Kitty " was in my room , and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sound full of pain and grief ; and wild rage too  --  a sound familiar enough to frontier people , but new to me . It wa* the she-wolf hunting her cubs ; there followed with it , as a chorus , the cry of the pack of hound puppies-they were young , and frightened . As for me , with nerves already overstrained , a regular panic came on . I knew hunters built fires to scare off wild things ; but after Kitty had made a great blaze , a new fear came . The windows were near the ground , and without shutters or curtains . What if the blaze only served to guide the wolf ! More than once I had seen dogs go through a pane of window-glass as safely as circus-riders through their paper hoops ; so shawls were quickly hair-pinned over the windows , and by that time men 's voices and the angry sounds from older dogs gave a sense of being protected , and sleep came again , to be broken again by a big dark object , rough-coated , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but not exactly like Red Riding-hood 's , althou* , h it was hungry . Camp had only been moved about ten miles , and a fast ride through and back before sunrise would give us another hour together , " and would Kitty make tea I " And so , with our early tea for the stirrup-cup , " he gave his bridle-rein a shake , " and we went our ways , one into the midwinter snows of untracked mountains , the other to the long sea-voyage through the tropics , and into equally strange foreign places . The question of a servant to go with me to California was a serious one . The elder women could not leave their families , and after much thinking , a younger one was set apart , and each of us was considered a victim selected for a sacrifice . Although I was born and brought up among slaves , the servants in my home were all freed people , their children had grown up with us , and there was great attachment between us . One of these , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a*reed to go and remain with me . Not only had none of us ever been to sea , but we knew but very few people who had made a real sea-voyage . This to California was to be very much like the old journeys to India , and a friend who had been with her husband in China was called in for consultation , while an old-fashioned book , The Lady of the Manor , really gave us some most useful details . Only we followed our models too literally , and made absurdly large preparations . I must remind that this was before sewing-machines , that we were in Washington , and that it was quite before the day of ready-made outfits in our country , so that we busied ourselves with preparations for the heat of the tropics , with refreshing my Spanish , and I , for my part , chiefly in reconciling myself to the fact that in a few months I should be cut loose from every thing that had made my previous life . March came , and the start had to be made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although by this time the original plan had lost its best point to me , for he found himself unable to go from home . A brother-in-law ( Governor Jacobs , of Kentucky ) , who had been ordered a sea-voyage for his health , and was going to Rio Janeiro and back , changed his plan , and started with me for California instead . At the Astor House , where we were staying , // we found a large party of favorite relations , my cousin General William Preston and his family , assembled to welcome back from Europe a member who had been away for years . I was much in the position of a nun carried into the world for the last time before taking the veil . All the arguments , all the reasons , all the fors and againsts , had to be gone over with this set of friends ; all the griefs opened up again , and the starting made harder than ever . While we were talking , Mr. Stetson came in and spoke to my father , who went out with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and explain a new break in our plans . It seemed my maid , " young Harriot " ( to distinguish her from the elder Harriot , who was our dear old nurse ) , was , at the last , not to be permitted to go with me by her New York friends ; and as one of them was the man she was to marry , he spoke with authority . All this had been considered and arranged ; but at the last he withdrew his consent . She stood true to me ; she knew that never in my life had I had a strange servant about me , that I was already as much grieved as I could endure , and she would not add to it by leaving me without her care , and as much of home as she could represent to me . Finding that no argument prevailed on her to stay , he hit upon an idea which was successful . He went off and raised the whole force of people who were allied for rescuing colored people being carried off to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Astor House , filling the lower halls , and raising such a commotion that Mr. Stetson came for us to see what could be done . The cry of " carrying off a free colored girl against her will " had the same effect in those days as an alarm of fire . Looked at by all of our lives , it seems incredible that a colored mob should have assembled against my father and myself on such a hue and cry , but they would not be rensoned with . It was true that we were Southerners , it was true that Harriot was a free colored girl , although it was not true that she was being carried off against her will . The trouble was that she had no will ; she had only affections , and these pulled her in contrary directions . When she appealed in tears to us to decide what she should do , we told her to stay . So I was not only to be without my father 's care , but I had lost my last fragment of home . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some one going out on the same steamer who would be glad to have the place ; and this was done : " a reliable middle-aged New England woman , far more useful than Harriot , who could only sew and dress hair . " I barely looked at her , and saw she was a hard , unplensing person to my mind ; but the steamer sailed next day , and there was no time for any choice . She was only an item in the many griefs that seemed to accumulate on me at this time . My father 's going with me would have made it a delightful voyage for both of us ; without him , it was , in all its dreary blankness , my first separation from home . I had never lived out of my father 's house , nor in any way assumed a separate life from the other children of the family - Mr. Fremont 's long journeys had taken him from home more than five years out of the eight since we were married ; I had never been obliged to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was to be launched literally on an unknown sea , travel toward an unknown country , every thing absolutely new and strange about me , and undefined for the future , and without even a servant that knew me . The first night out , when the numbness of grief was over , I put my little girl to bed ; for she would have nothing to do with the new woman , and I myself pretended to be asleep in order not to have to speak to her . Later on in the night this woman came into my cabin and looked at me , to make sure that I was really sleeping . Being satisfied that such was the case , she opened my trunk , and commenced a leisurely examination of its contents , laying aside in a small heap such articles as she preferred ; at the same time she lifted off her dark wig , and gave her head a little shake , and stood there , not the dark-haired , middle-aged woman who was to be so much better for me than my Harriet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expression of hardness that puzzled me then , and frightened me too , so that I kept as much asleep as possible , and let her help herself to all she wanted from the trunk . When she left the room , with an armful of undergear , I jumped up and bolted the door after her , and remained blockaded until morning , answering none of her knocks or calls . When I recognized the clear voice of the stewardess in the morning , I let her in . She was that good Mrs. Young , with the gray hair and fine teeth , that we all knew so well when she was with Captain Lines on the Humboldt and Arrago . Then I was safe , for Mrs. Young brought the captain , and the woman was put into a separate cabin under guard for the journey . In brief* this person should never have been allowed to go with me . She was a jprot&amp;g6e of an authoress who believed in certain moral reforms , and who thought that by giving her a start in a new country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This lady , well known in New York , had given her such credentials that Mr. Stetson chose her from other applicants on those recommendations . My brother-in-law was thoroughly seasick , // and I was naturally supposed to be so , because I kept my room and had no appetite . But the stewardess saw it was not so , and made me go into the air . We were through with the rough weather off Hatteras , and were in the Gulf Stream . I had never seen the sea , and in some odd way no one had ever told me of the wonderful new life it could bring . It stays with me in all its freshness , that first recognition of the ocean which came to me when I went on deck ; that grand solitude , that wide look from horizon to horizon , the sense of space , of freshness , the delightful power and majesty of the sea-all came to me as necessities ; I loved it at the first look , and I am never fully alive without it ; sometimes I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but when I can , I go there , and am soothed and calmed and comforted if I am in trouble ; if I am happy , it is only there that I feel completed by the exultant , abounding vitality and keen happiness which it alone brings to me . The ship was crowded , but I was too worn down and silenced to care to know strangers . The captain , Captain Schenck , who was a naval officer , was in every way kind , and very wisely so , in securing me entire quiet while on deck , so that the " healing of the sea " soon began to revive my health , and the silent teaching of sky and sea lifted me from morbid dwelling on what was now ended . The young think each thing final-they can not well see that " I shall ontlast this stroke , I know , For man is conquered by the mighty hours , " must be true for them too . Perhaps the sharpest lesson of life is that we outlast so ranch-even ourselves-so that one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first time- " But the sea asserts its mighty power also , and no one ends an ocean voyage in the same state of mind with which he began it . In this gentled state of mental convalescence I remember how persistently my mind pictured scenes of my childhood and early girlhood . Especially the many charming things belonging with our constantly recurring long journeys to and from our homes . For we had three houmes : the winter home in Washington , which was " ours ; " that in St. Louis , which was " our father 's home and that of our grandfather in Virginia , which was my mother 's dearly loved home , and my birth-place as well as hers . This was near the beautiful mountain town of Lexington , best known of late from both General Lee 's and " Stonewall " Jackson 's connection with its great colleges . These were widely apart , and before the day of railways , made travel serious ; taking so much time that it divided our lives into distinct parts , but broke up nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it altered , the form of our studies . A certain little English valise held the maps and books , and our schoolroom was improvised any where-on the guard " of a river steamboat or in its cabin , or resting under trees . It trained us to holding on to our thoughts through interruptions ; it trained us to much for which I can never be grateful enough , for then my father himself was our teacher  --  to his real pleasure , and our endless regrets when we had to drop back to regular teachers , who could not enrich and illuminate every topic as he did . He suited the books to his own tastes ; and though much was above our comprehension , yet we grew into them . Especially we never got away from Plutarch and the Iliad . The gods and goddesses descended on us every where . The little invalid of our family was not let to brave the harsh prairie winds of early spring in St. Louis , so we took New Orleans first on the alternate years when we went to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , but water transportation made it no trouble , while the eight days on the Mississippi was as , welcome a rest for my parents as we now find our Atlantic crossing . Ours was a constant changing from an EnglishProtestant into a French-Catholic atmosphere , to find them blended in Washington through widely various representations , and by the diplomatic corps , which was a more permanent body than now , when steam and telegraphing have nearly abolished diplomacy . It had been but few years since the Louisiana Territory had been ceded to us , greatly to the indignation and regret of most of its settlers . It was an article of faith with these to alter nothing in their habits , not even to learn the language of the country of which they had become unwilling citizeus : Jo sltisfran9ais , etjeparle ma langue , was a common expression among them . Among these we came into an atmosphere thoroughly foreign-dress , cookery , all domestic usages and ideas , as well as their language and religion . St. Louis being a so much smaller place , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was also the frontier garrison and the head of the fur business . From the broad gallery of my father 's house in St. Louis there wan always to be seen in my earlier day a kaleidoscopic variety of figures ; the lower classes of the French still wore their peasant dress , and its bright and varied colors and the white caps belong as much to the remembrance of that time in St. Louis as they do to my earlier visits in France ; now it is hard to find a peasant costume even in their own countries on travelled routes : the sewingmachine has abolished picturesqueness in dress . When I was first in France , even in // Paris the streets were animated by the pretty white caps arid gray gowns of the working-women ; now a pall of black alpaca has hidden all this , though the greatest desecration I have seen is a Tyrolese monutaineer in a ready-made business suit . There were also long files of Indians stepping silently by , the sqnaws and babies bringing up the rear-real Indians in real Indian dress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Catholic clergy in the clerical robe ; hunters and trappers in fringed deer-skins ; army officers in worn uniforms going by on horseback . Our house in Washington was a headquarters for the varied interests from all these places , while about my mother there collected and shaped itself a circle which formed for many years really a salon , to be broken up only by her loss of health . This life rubbed out many little prejudices , and fitted us better than any reading could have done to comprehend the necessary differences arid equal merits of differing peoples , and that although different , each could be right . The manner in which my father tanght us also led us rip to the same ideas . The French language was a necessity , arid that we acquired without any trouble , because we had a nurse who began us with it as soon as we could speak ; whatever governess or teacher we had , my father always was our real teacher , my mother reserving one day and one line of instruction , which , like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her own . While in Washin , , ton we had our routine of studies and town life , in New Orleans my elder sister and myself rose to the proportion of members of society , for my father 's clients , when on their visits to Washington , were pleased to have us for their little interpreters , and when we would be in New Orleans they would insist on treating us as grown people , inviting us formally to dinners , where we would be taken in formally by grown gentlemen , and sit through the whole entertainment . There was great inherited wealth among these planters ; they were generally educated in Paris ; and with the combined resources of climate , taste , and wealth , their mode of living was beautiful as well as luxurious . One detail I have never met since in any country , that of having the dinner and the dessert in different dining-rooms . With us this classic custom has faded into the afterdinner coffee of the drawing-room , but it was completely carried out in these great houses . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinner was in a spacious and splendid room , and served with plate enough to satisfy even English ideas , the next room was more charming , for its furniture , as well as that of the table , was suited to the grace and fragrance and lightness of the dessert . The crystal service and the wax-lights in their glass shades were reflected in great mirrors on three sides of the room , while the fourth was open to a court of grass and flowers , where the moon shone on the sparkling spray of a large fountain . The punka-bearers , as they would be called in India , had great fans of peacock feathers . I do not wonder it fitted into the Arabian Nights ' entertainments in my mind . In St. Louis , where our house stood among its large trees , in a square of its own , we had , to a large degree , a pleasant out-door life . Our lessons always were given on the broad gallery running around the house , and in every way we had a great deal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only to be had at my grandfather 's place in Virginia . When going there from Washington , we used no public conveyances beyond Fredericksburg ; there the carriage and saddle-horses met us , my mother as well as my father often making the journey back on horseback , while the carriage was there for us children , and for her to return to when tired  --  a London-built travelling coach which gave all the rest one looked for-large , high swupg , and with so many springs that the jolting from the execrable roads was lessened . Its pale yellow body and scarlet morocco lining made us children christen it " Cinderella 's pumpkin ; " maybe , too , an underlying consciousness of unlimited indulgence associated with those who sent it . There was always a sense of freedom and expansion of mind connected with the arrival at my grandfather 's . His was one of the crown grants of the colonial time , and had been given , for military service , to his father , who was killed in the early Indian wars , but not before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The oaks here were especially beautiful ; they had been preserved , and made a noble park . Leading straight through this park to the large hospitable-looking house was a planted double avenue of cherry-trees , which had been arched on the inner boughs and trimmed up straight on the outer side ; these had grown to the height and thickness of forest trees by my time , and made a lovely vista , whether they were in blossom or red with fruit , or their naked boughs glittering with ice . On the lawn about the house some remarkable oaks had been kept , and some sycamores of really giant proportions . There were beautiful old-fashioned gardens to the south , and masked by the tall hedge of holly and privet were the cabins of the house servants . These were comfortable , clean cottages , but forbidden ground to the children of " the Big House " unless they were with some of the family . The land patent gave the ownership of // all the lands in sight from a certain point in the valley , and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this valley , that we were monarchs of all we surveyed , including the grandparents . On this travel we rarely stopped at a public place ; it was held as an unkindness to pass a relative 's home , so that our journey was a progress along a cordon of great estates of this kind , where every thing had so long been going along in an established way that it was small wonder they believed in predestination and fore-ordination . Every where among them was inherited property-their houses , their servants , the cattle and sheep on a hundred hills , were theirs by descent . Nothing varied muchthings were all in the deep lull of secured prosperity . The life on these estates will not be lived over . With the introduction of railways , the war , and the termination of slavery , this phase of living has completely passed away ; it lies back in my memory like a sunny , peaceful landscape , and I am as thankful for having been born in its atmosphere of repose as De Quincey says he was for having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ns what Hawthorne and so many others have found England , " the old home , " with soothing influences that go always with its memory . When we would return to this place of my grandfather 's , each resumed the delights belonging to it . The grown people would go to the White Sulphur Springs , then the Saratoga for the North as well as the South . I always had the pleasure of being left with my grandmother , and went with her on that daily round of inspection* which made one of the necessary duties of a Southern lady . This included not only the immediate household , but the cabins of the house servants , the gardens  --  to see , in short , that all had been faithfully attended to ; and then into the spinning and sewing rooms , and always into the large room used as a day nursery and hospital for the infants of women who were employed about their different work . I can hardly get to the end of all the duties that filled up the busy mornings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points that remained most in my memory as the places where my grandmother gave the most time ; the dairy was all right under the care of its presiding head , " Aunt * who was the wife of " Uncle Jack , " shoemaker to the I ) lantation , and Methodist preacher to his own people . It was not considered respectful in us children to address the elder slaves by their name merely ; there was always the prefix of " aunt " or " uncle ; " to the head nurse always " mainmy . " Occasionally there were inspections at a longer distance from the house-  --  to the weaving-rooms , the shoe-maker 's , etc . Every thing that was worn was grown and made on the place , except the finer woolens and linens for family use , which came from Richmond . The various stages of woolen fabrics , from the sheep on the hill-sides , and the dyes taken from the sumac bushes and the green bark of walnuts , all the details of buzzing wheels , and carding wool , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ childhood . The interval between the close of the long session and the winter was too short for the long , tedious journey to St. Louis and back . We only made that on alternate years after the short session , when high waters gave us large steamboats and comfortable transportation for our little crowd . What we do now in two days required then several weeks . My father knew no plan of life that separated him from his family , so we led this charming nomadic existence , with its fixed points in such contrast to the trouble of travel and distance between them . Washington was in one way work , and St. Louis and New Orleans had their sides of political work and his duties as a lawyer . But it was all holiday here , and my father enjoyed it thoroughly . Especially he liked the autumn shooting . The birds were most plentiful in certain large wheat fields , which , in their warm tints of stubble undulated over the south face of the hills , the trees of the " little orchard " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here and there through the fields were good apple-trees ; under one of these we would rest , and eat our luncheon of a biscuit and some fruit taken from the tree above us ; and then my father would take a book from his pocket , usually a classic in a French translation , from which he would read aloud for me to translate . There were plenty of ideas , even words , that I did not understand ; if it had been a description of the steam - engine , I should have gone through it with equal good-will and docility ; but much of it remained in my memory , and I grew into it . Hard words and hard ideas tired my mind as the long tramps and ploughed fields tired my young feet , but with time I grew used to both , and the benefit of both remained with me : these long sunny mornings in the open air were the most delightful phase in which my lessons came . In winter I had my corner at the library table . No matter how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepare our lessons with him . About a year after I was married , my father sent for me one morning , and pointing to my old place at the end of the library table , said , " I want you to resume your place there ; you are too young to fritter away // your life without some useful pursuit . " So back I went to my mornings of work and readings and translations , which brought with them the scraps of talk and connected interest on all subjects which can only exist where lives are passed together in that pleasant intimacy . As I have said , the long expeditions which Mr. Fremont made took him from home five years of the first eight after we were married , and I remained in many respects in my old place as one of the children of the family . My mother 's long illness deprived my father of her companionship to a great extent , and made him turn to me still more . How great a loss this was to him and to us can only be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak of that life , for it is not , like mine , in a manner public property . For myself , so much good-will and warm feeling have been given me during the public portions of my life that it does not seem more intrusive to talk of myself to my unknown friends than to those I know personally . As my mind turns back to that time , so much crowds upon it that I can neither tell it in its fullness , nor can I bring myself to leave it a mere skeleton . I think there could hardly have been a happier life than mine as a child , and in all my youth ; it would be a full volume to be bound in white and gold , and red-lettered throughout , and full of lovely pictures , and every where and in all of them my father the prominent figure . He made me a companion and a friend from the time almost that I could begin to understand . We were a succession of girls at first , with the boys coming last , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have had ; and my perfect health-without a flaw until I was twenty-four-gave me not only the good spirits but the endurance and application that pleased him . When we reached Chagres , if it had not been for pure shame , and unwillingness that my father should think badly of me , I would have returned to New York on the steamer , as the captain begged , putting before me such a list of dangers to health , and discomforts and risks of every kind , as to kill my courage . One often gets credit for what he does not really deserve , and it would hardly do to tell the whole truth about every thing ; but I have since confessed that when I first saw land , my pleasure in the first sight of palm-trees and the tropical growth was lost in the feeling that I had to make another separation from what had grown to be something of a home . Captain Schenek had made every thing as pleasant as possible for me . My large double cabin , which at first seemed like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a ship before , I had only a house to compare it with , and felt choked on first going into it ; but I have learned since to know that a double cabin , with a large square port , is a luxury . The little tender on which the passengers and mails were landed was as small as a craft could well be to hold an engine , and was intended to go as high as possible up the Chagres River . It seemed like stepping down upon a toy . But even this had to be exchanged , after the first eight miles , for dug-out canoes , the shallows and obstructions of every kind making it impossible to use the little steamboat . Here Mr. Aspinwall 's care secured for me what was , by the contrast to what the other travellers had to endure , luxury . While they had to take the dug-out canoes , with their crews of naked , screaming , barbarous negroes and Indians , I was put in the " company 's " whale-boat , with a responsible crew in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difference which I learned to appreciate more thoroughly on hearing afterward of the murder of passengers by their crews . With all our advantages , we only made a few miles each day , taking three to reach Gorgona , where we were to exchange our boats for mules , on which we crossed the mountains . This travel is so changed by the railroad that it maybe interesting to know just how we made the crossing in 1849 . The other passengers took their chances of sleeping on the ground or in the huts of the Indians , and in that way contracted fevers from the night air , the tropical mists , and all causes of ill health that were so well known , while I was protected from all this through Mr. Aspinwall 's care . He had sent with me one of his trusted employees , a captain of a vessel in the mahogany trade , who had had his wife with him on his different journeys on that coast , and knew just what to do for the health and safety of a lady . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across , and leave me in safety at Panama , his wife objected , because , she said , I would be a Washington fine lady , and make objections to the Indians having no clothes on , and make him a great deal of trouble altogether , and he had better ask Mr. Aspinwall to have some one else do this ; but after Mr. Aspiuwahlintroduced him to me at his house , the captain , as he told me afterward , told his wife he would take care of me ; that I was not a fine lady at all ; that I was a poor thin pale woman , and not a bit of a fine lady ; that he would see me through . And she agreed to it . While the sun was still bright we made our landing . One needs to realize it in the tropics to know how true is the line , " Down dropped the sun , up rose the moon // only the moon , but the discordant noises of night in the tropical forests , a hideous , confusing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasant iuterior of our tent , with its cauvas floor and walls , lit up by the great fire outside , which was our protection not only against wild animals , but the heavy dews , which were so deadly that they had obliged the further protection of a fly tent . Persons sleeping on shore even one night forfeited their lifeinsurance . Within , it was ready for us with all the comforts the " company " could provide , and our clean linen cots were very welcome after the fatigue of the day , with all its excitement and new ideas . Among all the passengers there was but one other lady . I invited her to go with me ; I could not leave her to meet all the exposures and risks , when I had such care taken of me . I am sorry to say that I was also obliged to have with me my " reliable niaid . " The captain had treated her " man-of-war " fashion , and put her under lock and key while we were on the steam-ship , and intcnded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go . She claimed not only her rights as an American citizen to travel where she pleased , but to say what she pleased , and created a sort of public opinion for herself among the steerage passengers , who , hearing only her side of the story , looked upon her as an ill-used woman , and it was thought best that I should at least take her as far as Panama . She too had the benefit of all this friendly and delicate care . Each camping-place was provided for in the same way , always one or two of the army officers connected with the survey that was being made for the railroad were there to see that every thing was right , and to have the pleasure of home talk with a lady . It took a long time to make these thirty miles of river travel , for we were only poled along against the stiff current of this mountain river . Though we made but a few miles each day , they were full of novelty and interest . Sometimes for nearly a mile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oars , and we would be sometimes out in the stream , sometimes close to the bank , under the overhanging branches of trees , bent into the ' water , matted by masses of flowering creepers , so that we seemed at times to glide along an aisle of flowers through a great conservatory . There I first saw the white and scarlet varieties of the passion-flower , and many flowers , both fragrant and brilliant , for which I know no name . Then we would have to put out int'o the stream from under this shade , and the sun was hot . At times we would have to get out while the men would be busy with their long knives clearing a little pathway for us through the dense growth , where some point put out in such a shallow that we could not get the boat round it . We hardly felt the heat more than in our own hot weather ; but the effects of the sun were very different upon white people . The Indians and Jamaica negroes , of whom our crew was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving it a shove , and leaping back , as much at home in the water as porpoises . We were near to the close of the last day 's journey , within an hour of Gorgona , when my brother-in-law , being young and strong and a Kentuckian , in his impatience at the delay on one of those sand spits , jumped into the water and dragged the boat , in spite of the men , who told him that it would kill him . We did get off sooner than usual through his help , and he was very triumphant about it , when suddenly his eyes rolled back in his head , and he fell prostrate from sun-stroke , just as we reached Gorgona ; and throughout that whole night the physician with the engineering corps was doubtful if he could live . I will say here that this deprived me of his care , for the illness that followed was such that he was taken back in the next steamer to the United States , as he could not recover in a hot climate . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the engineering corps all begging me to return to the United States , telling me that I had no idea of what I was to go through . In fact , at each step of my journey I was told , like the young man in " Excelsior , " that the thing was impossible ; and quite secretly to myself I said so too when I began to see what the emigrants suffered . There were hundreds of people camped out on the hill-slopes at Gorgona in apologies for tents waiting for a certainty of leaving Panama , from which as yet there was no transportation . There were many women , some with babies , among these ; they were in a hot as well as unhealthy climate , and the uncertainty of every thing was making them ill : loss of hope brings loss of strength : they were living on salt provisions brought from home with them , which were not fit for such a climate , and already many had died . Some pleasant English people , returning from South America , were , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The alcalde of the village invited us all to a breakfast , where I had a caution given inc just in time to prevent my showing my horror at the chief dish , a baked monkey , which looked like a little child that had been burned to death . The iguana , or large lizard , of which we had seen so many along the river , was also a chief dish . This is held to be very delicate , and its eggs are esteemed as much as certain eggs are among us . The alcalde 's house was a thatched roof on poles , with wattled sides , like a magnified vegetable crate . Unbleached sheeting had been tacked over this , in our honor , and the wall further adorned by four colored lithographs. // There were the " ThreeMarys , " and although mere daubs , had at least the garments and attributes of their subjects . The fourth was a black-haired , red- cheeked , staring young woman in a flaming red dress and ermine tippet , and a pink rose in her hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ POLK , President of the United States . This , he evidently thought , was our object of worship . When we went back , Mrs. XV said , " We will have our breakfast now , " and had her own tea-pot and tea brought out . When she found that I was too young a traveller to know the necessity of carrying these with me , she gave me hers , with a warning , which I have heeded to my great comfort , never to separate from my own tea equipage again . The distance from Gorgona to Panama was about twenty-one miles . It was distance , not a road ; there was only a mule track-rather a trough than track in most places , and mule staircases with occasional steps of at least four feet , and only wide enough for a single animal  --  the same trail that had been followed since the early day of Spanish conquest ; and this trail followed the face of the country as it presented itself-straight up the sides of the steepest heights to the summit , then straight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rapid streams . These had to be forded by the mules , or , when narrow , the mule would gather his legs under him and leap it . If one could sit him , so much the better ; if not , one fell into the water ; and in this way many emigrants got broken bones ; and many more bruises and thorough wettings . There was no system about the baggage ; people generally had taken the largest trunk they could find , because the journey was to be a long one ; there was no provision for taking these across other than by hand ; and when the trunk was absolutely too large , mules and cows were pressed into the service . My invaluable Captain Tucker had made all arrangements for me , and I knew nothing of these troubles on my own behali , but even the civilized baggagesmashin0 of our railroads was nothing compared to the damage done in that Isthmus transfer . The slender Indians bending under the weight of a trunk carried between them on poles , and the thin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trunks , valises , and bags , both got rid of their load when tired of it . There were very narrow defiles worn through the rock where we could only go in single file , and even the men sat sidewise , because there was not room to sit as usual . At one of these we came upon a cow loaded with trunks and bags . She was measuring her wide horns against the narrow entrance of the defile , as her load prevented her twisting through . There we had to wait until some solution of the difficulty was found , which she reached by rubbing off all her load , leaving us the debris of the broken trunks and smashed baggage to climb over . We had two days of this before reaching Panama . A fine mule is really a delightful animal to ride , especially in a mountain country ; but these very small , badly fed , ungroomed , wretched little creatures that we had were full of viciousness , and they resented the unusual work required of them . I had been , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mule belonging to the " company ; " and Captain Tucker was exultant that I was neither ill nor tired , nor in any way broken down by the unusualness of the whole thing , and repeated his constant expression , " I told my wife you were not a bit of a fine lady . " He judged , as we alljudge , by appearances . As there were no complaints , or tears , or visible breakdown , he gave me credit for high courage , while the fact was that the whole thing was so like a nightmare that one took it as a bad dream-in helpless silence . The nights were odious with their dank mists and noises ; but there was compensation in the sunrise , when from a mountain-top you looked down into an undulating sea of niagnificent unknown blooms , sending up clouds of perfume into the freshness of the morning ; and thus from the last of the peaks we saw , as Balboa had seen before us , the Pacific at our feet . There I felt in connection with home , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conquest , and family readings and discussions in a time that seemed so far back now , for it lay before the date which should hereafter mark all things-before and after leaving home . Panama , too , was the first walled city I had ever seen ; and its land gate and water gate , and its old cathedral , with the roof and spire inlaid with mother-of-pearl , all made me feel that I had come to a foreign country . My stay at Panama was not all one-sided ; it had its very pleasant aspects . General Herran 's letters made his family accept me as one of themselves . One of them , an elderly lady , a widow , made me come to her house and remain with her during my whole stay ; there , with her daughters and her nice old servants , I had none of the forlornness which belongs to being in a hotel , and quickly slipped into a routine very much like my ordinary life , only with very different scenery and actors . I learned the reality of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ que tiene es d su disposicion " is not merely a phrase . Many of the young people had been educated in London and Paris , but there was no want of topics in common , and of interest , // even with those who had never left their country . I had plenty of books with me ; there were interminable letters to be written home , visits to receive and visits to return ; and delightful walks on the ramparts in the cool of the day just before sundown , often en ding in going to dine or have an evening of music with the ladies of native or foreign consular families , who also had their exercise there . When I was in Paris in 1852 , I thought I recognized in a carriage that passed me in the Bois do Boulogne a beautiful face with those eyelids the Spanish call durmididos , a peculiarity I had first seen in one of the most beautiful girls in the Hurtado family . The Empress had those eyelids , and as she was then in the first blaze of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was among her beauties commented on and praised . This expression , dermididos , or sleepy eyelid , is a characterization given to the long , heavily fringed , slowly moving eyelid , where the eye is more open at the inside than at the outer corner , and where the eyelid descends with a sweep , giving that look that we see in a child when it is struggling against sleep . I ventured a bow , which was quickly returned , and we drew up beside each other and renewed the acquaintance . I was so pleased to find I could be of any service to them in Paris , helping to decide on a school for the young girls , and in everyway I could think of taking from them in turn the sense of being far from home . On Sundays we had the service of our own church . Mr. Aspinwall had looked to the starting of the Episcopal Church in California , and sent out the Rev. Mr. Minor to plant it . It was liberal and kind of some Catholic Panama ladies to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They not only did this , but every Sunday we found the room arranged with as many seats as it could contain placed in aisles , a temporary altar made by a table covered with the finest linen , and decorated with flowers , while they themselves , although they could not join our service , staid just without the door , and made us feel welcome in that way . Some passengers had a melodeon , and not a bad improvised choir chanted the responses . It was a sincerely religious gathering , and I recall no other service like it for simple , genuine impressiveness . The best rooms in that climate are always on the upper floor , their only windows being as large as our barn doors , which , in this room , when slid aside , gave us a broad view over the bay . Mr. Minor , in his orthodox robes , at the flower-decorated table , the melodeon with its little choir around it on one side , the space at the other side remaining open for the ladies of the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where they , with their idea of respect , sat in full evening dress-satin slippers , fan , lace mantillas , and flowers in the hair-every thing in the old Spanish style ; the few American ladies in the front row of chairs in their morning suits and bonnets , while the rest of the room was crowded with men in every variety of dress and want of dress . No one had anticipated such detention , and the small outfit intended for rapid travel was pretty much used up , while at that time there were no means of replacing it ; red flannel shirts and corduroy clothes seemed to be the only thing to be had in Panama , and so made a picturesque though uncomfortable wear for the tropics . Some observances of the Catholic Church , of which I had only read , I saw here . The house where I was staying was on the great square where the cathedral and customhouse and other large buildings are ; my rooms were about twenty feet above the ground , one a corner room ; the broad covered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out on the whole active life of Panama . Sometimes it was a church procession , very picturesque from the brilliant awnings carried over the heads of the officiating priests , in their splendid lace robes over the red under-dress , and followed by a long array of ladies in the old Spanish costume-lace mantillas on the head , bright silk and satin gowns , and satin slippers , all carrying flowers to be cast in the water ; they in turn followed by gentlemen in full European evening dress ; and then the long crowd of Indians and women , looking like pictures because of their very odd and scanty garments . Sometimes it was a procession to the ramparts to bless the waters and pray for a favorable season ; these would have not only the music of the church service , as it was chanted by the priests and taken up by the people , but at the end of the procession nearly every man had a rude form of guitar on which he played , and sang , while the women danced along at the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the early Jewish ceremonials . On Good-Friday the search for the body of the Saviour made another very striking church occasion ; the usual persons were in the formal procession , led by priests , but they were in funeral vestments , the ladies all in the deepest mourning , with black veils over their heads , and every one carrying a lighted candle . Often and often the Rev. Mr. Minor , our Episcopal clergyman , with white robes and bared head , followed a solitary rough coffin , attended by a few men in red flannel shirts making their way to the temporary burialplace just beyond the land gate , where the graves were growing thick . Just by was // the entrance to the calaboose . The soldiers on guard , who had muskets , and hats with feathers , but no shoes , whiled away their time by fighting chickens . I became , in spite of myself ; an expert in judging these ; there was a constant bringing in and comparing ; it was the high exchange for fightin* cocks . Those , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the open air , just as in the Arabian Nights , a bench and stool his only shop , I saw all the time . My Panama Tiffany 's best effort was the making of filigree crosses with the imperfect Panama pearls interwoven , for which I became one of his customers . One morning I heard a voice of lamenting , a voice of real sorrow . Looking down , I saw , walking to and fro in the shade beneath my balcony , a young Indian man , carrying a child of about three years old , both of them with the least possible clothing on-country Indians , evidently . The face of the child shocked me , and I called to the man that it was very ill ; to bring it in and let us do something for it . He interrupted his wailing to say , " No , no ; ya se murio " ( " It is dying now " ) . He had been with it to the cathedral near by . Candelaria , one of the servants of the house , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man at my asking , and brought them in and cared for them ; but the child was really in the agonies of death , and only lived a little while . The next morning the tinkle of the little bell announcing that the Host was passing through the streets drew me to the balcony . I saw for the first time in action the theory that the death of an infant is a cause for thankfulness . People often say this with us ; it is the religious belief of the Catholic Church , and here , where the people were simple and acted their belief ; it was being carried into practice . It was an Indian funeral , and on a very humble scale . The priest led the way , as usual , preceded by the Host , chanting a service for the dead , but with a quick , glad intonation , which was taken up by the Indian women following . The little child , robed in white , with ruffles and lace and ribbons and wreaths of flowers , lay on an open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the child was its father , now dressed out in a shirt and pantaloons , with a haggard face , and wistful eyes fixed upon his child , but singing also . Behind them a long crowd of women in their holiday dresses ; violins and guitars were playing cheerful quick music , and they followed them dancing . But for the dead child one would not have known that it was not a marriage procession . When we realize our utter helplessness to shield those we love from the chances of life , how can we say that these people are wrong ?
