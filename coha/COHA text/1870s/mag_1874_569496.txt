ARTICLE VI-THE UNITY OF THE CHURCH . THE recent convocation of the Evangelical Alliance held in New York , if it did not claim or have the authority of an cecumenical council , was a significant event as marking the advance of a true idea in the world . Its occurrence in the New World itself showed progress in the widening circle of liberal Christian sentiment . The meeting was a far more impressive and important one than had been anticipated by its most sanguine advocates . It was the testimony of all who watched its progress that it grew upon them steadily , that its interest was profound and wide-spread , and that its spirit was of a primitive type of Christianity . It was characterized by a forgetfulness of what was narrow and selfish in the past , and by a large and scriptural hopefulness prophetic of greater things to come . Were it not too bold an expression we would say that the Spirit of God took possession of this simple instrumentality to teach men divine lessons , and there flowed forth from the meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who participated in it , and was confirmed by the enlargement and elevation of spirit that resulted from its silent influences . Many who came from curiosity went away deepened in their religions convictions and purposes . The whole Christian community was unexpectedly ripe for it , and it met the earnest though undefined yearnings of hundreds and thousands of souls , in all sections of the Church , for a freer common expression of thought and feeling upon themes that belong to man 's higher nature , and that rise above the incessant clamor of temporal interests-who were tired of differences and wished to show their common love for Christ . Even if it aroused opposition and has stirred up controversy upon new and old issues , that showed it was a power . As its crowded sessions went on day after day with increasing enthusiasm , calm but deep , it was seen by all , whether friends or enemies of Christian faith , that Christianity possessed an intellectual vigor at least equal to the demands of the age ; that it was also thoroughly in earnest // to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , on the same platform , the earnest worker gained for himself as close a hearing as the ablest thinker ; that there was no repression of humor and the human element , and that they who took part were evidently among the happiest as well as most loving of men ; that there could be disagreement among members in matters of opinion , and strenuous discussion even upon radical points , without the disturbance of fraternal feeling ; and , above all , it was seen that Christians of various churches , languages , cultures , garbs , and complexions , from all parts of the earth , were , in a deeper sense , truly one . That was the significant fact . That was what made the meeting a kind of spiritual niloineter , indicating the height to which the waters of religions opinion and sentiment had risen . There may not have been , and , from the nature of the organization , could not have been , in this meeting of the Evangelical Alliance , a positive expression of the unity of the Church , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christians ; but , nevertheless , a gain was made toward the practical recognition in the world of the great idea slowly and wearily struggling to make its way in men 's minds and hearts , of the unity of the Christian Church . This truth undoubtedly now exists as an ideal truth , or , we should rather say , it is a truth which has not as yet wrought itself out into an objective fact , although there is no more real truth . It is true , 1 . From the nature of things . In every object , philosophically conceived , its unity precedes its diversity . Both in an absolute and relative sense the law of unity is a fundamental law of all being . The arguments that prove the absolute being of God also go to prove his unity , even as the very existence of the human soul proves its unity . First the one , then the many . First unity , then variety in unity . And especially is this essential law of unity true in the relative sense of the term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nothing is perfect which stands alone , or which is cut off from its true relations to other objects . Through all creation runs this law of interdependency , of union , of mutual support and perfection , binding the stars together in their // 109 courses . This comes from a common plan enstamped upon all things by a one common Creator . When we apply this principle to man , especially in his highest religions nature and relations , we can not escape from the binding force of the law of unity . In origin , all men are one . In the law of righteousness which is impressed upon their consciences and hearts , they are one . In the consequences of their actions , their aims and destinies , they are one . In their mutual wants , sympathies , feelings , and affections as members of the human family , they are one . And is it to be supposed that in their spiritual interests they can be separated ? Can they live in these without mutual dependency and union ? Can they exist in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these higher spiritual things where they come nearer to the one Divine Will and Spirit ? The best minds , therefore , in all ages discerning the one original plan of God in men 's natures , have yearned for a true religious as well as political unification of the race . The longings for " the city of God " have been transferred by great and devout minds to a future state , only because it seemed impossible that there should be even an approximate realization of this high and joyful truth on the earth . Roman Catholicism , from an inherent error in its theory , has not succeeded in its attempt to carry out the idea of a universal church ; but this ill-success by no means proves that the idea is not philosophical , is not one that is true in the nature of things , is not one that is intuitive to the human mind when freed from prejudice and selfishness , is not one that is possible and shall be finally realized . As sure as men , made of one blood , shall be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , recognizing the equal rights of each nation and each individual before the law , and binding themselves to mutual acts and responsibilities for each other 's temporal safety and welfare , so there shall be , by the constitution of things , a like union in religion , a world church comprehending the whole human race , one holy Catholic Church , whose members are members one of another , recognizing each other in every right , in every sympathy , in every duty and responsibility , and bound together in a unity where nature is made doubly nature by the Spirit of God . // 2 . From the testimony of Scripture and the type of the primitive Apostolical Church . The church of the first disciples was the " one body " of Christ . " For as the body is one and hath many members , and all the members of that one body , being many , are one body , so also is Christ ; for by one spirit we are all baptized into one body . " There was in the apostolic period a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christ 's body , the Church-not merely a spiritual , but a bodily , or , rn a true sense , vital and organic union . This union embraced all believers , and was as wide as the world . Neander , who as a Church historian unites philosophic profundity with the most reverent care for the truth , speaks thus of the typical idea of the Apostolic Church : " But this consciousness of divine life received from Christ , is necessarily followed by the recognition of a communion which embraces all mankind , and passes beyond the boundaries of earthly existence , the consciousness of the Holy Spirit as the spirit producing and animating this communion ,  --  the consciousness of the unity of the divine life shared by all believers , a unity which couiiterbalances all the other differences existing among mankind , as had been already manifested at the first promulgation of Christianity , when the most marked contrarieties arising either from religion , national peculiarities , or mental culture , were reconciled , and the persons whom they had kept at a distance from each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no abstract representation , but a truly living reality . If in all the widely spread Christian communities , amidst all the diversity of human peculiarities animated by the same spirit , only the consciousness of this higher unity and communion were retained , as Paul desired , this would be the most glorious appearance of the one Christian Church in which the kingdom of God represents itself on earth ; and no outward constitution , no system of episcopacy , no council , still less any organization by the State , which would substitute something foreign to its nature , could render the idea of a Christian Church more real or concrete . " t To bring this idea of the one apostolic and universal church * Planting d Training , B. vi , C. L Id . note . // into something like a definite statement , we would say , that he who studies with unprejudiced mind the scriptural account of the planting of the primitive Church , freeing his mind from the influence of subsequent historical developments and following the New Testament record pure and simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life of the apostles , who , under Christ established the constitution of the Church , the Christian Church was formed of various communities of believers , in and out of Jerusalem , and also in cities and nations other than Jewish , who , though varied , still all held together as the real members of one body , with recognized relations to each other , and with mutual duties and responsibilities arising from such a corporate union . They were one body . The apostles never thought of anything else . Christ was not divided . The doings of the Church in Antioch were a common and serious concern of the Church in Jerusalem . The membership of the Church iii Ephesus was a membership of the Church in Antioch . A man was a member of the Church of Christ rather than of the Church of Jernsalem . The Church at Jerusalem was only one of the doors , or inlets , by which he entered into the one temple and kingdom of Christ . This kingdom was world wide ; this Church was a universal Church . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Empire . An idea like that fired the hearts of the first disciples and evangelists to go forth to the conquest of the whole world for Christ , and be . cause we have lost this great idea , we have grown cold in our zeal for the world 's redemption . This then , we conceive to be the type of the primitive Apostolic Church , a unity in diversity in which the diversity was as nothing to the unity ,  --  in which the diversity was chiefly human and the unity divine . It was a union not only spiritual but visible , or organically corporate . When numerous minor churches began to be formed , differences began to develop themselves , since neither Christ nor his apostles laid down a uniform model of church organization . Such differences already existed between the Jewish and ilellenic Churches in the apostles ' time  --  but these did not break the union ; they did not divide the body of Christ . True brotherhood , communion , equality , sympathy , the reciprocal reference of difficul // ties , the recognition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christ the Head , continued constant and unbroken . It was a real union , whereas with us it is only an ideal or theoretic union . Here then we have set before us a type of the Christian Church which is not even ideal , for i.t was absolutely realized . From this divine type , received fresh from the hands of Christ that were pierced for the world 's redemption-from this perfect and glorious body of Christ , which shone before the eyes of the first disciples in simple but resplendent beauty  --  the Church very soon departed . It became corrupt and could not sustain the divine unity in its purity . It fell away from the Head , and thus also the body was broken up into many irreconcilable parts and sehistus . But to this apostolic type of the Christian Church once set clearly before us we should and must return , keeping it ever in view as a stimulating object of aspiration and attainment . One of the great and at first sight insurmountable obstacles in the way of return to the apostolic idea of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undue love , may we not say selfish love , which lingers in the minds of Christians for their own denominational and national ecclesiastical communions . It is the spirit of ecelesiasticism intensified by the spirit of clanship and nationality . In the discussion upon this topic before the Evangelical Alliance , Pr . Hodge , in his able and valuable essay , made use of a classification , which , if in the main it is correct , is assuredly in one particular ( the New Testament being witness ) far from being correct . The term *otNi7o1a is employed , he affirms , in the New Testament , in three *ays : 1 . As denoting scattered believers in every part of the world without regard to their ecclesiastical organizations . 2 . As applied to local church organizations . 3 . As signifying national or denominational churches . No national , or denominational church , we are confident , is spoken of in the New Testament . There is no " Church of Asia , " there is no " Church of Europe . " There are " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Churches of * There is not even the church of a city spoken of exclusively as such , as the " Church of Antioch , " the " Church of Jeru // salem ; " but it is rather the " Church at Jerusalem , " the " Church at Antioch , " the " Church in Smyrna ; " it is the community of believers that are collected in a certain city , by which local or geographical name it is most conveniently designated . The translation in our English version of the " Church of Ephesus , " the " Church of Laodicea , " etc. , when critically examined will bear out this view . Special pains seems indeed to have been taken by the writers of the New Testament to give no shadow of authority or recognition to the view that the Church of Christ is ever narrowed down or applied to a nation , a province , or even a city . Neither is it limited to a Christian denomination , or " a church , " as it is now called , of whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Paul ; and another , I am of Apollos ; are ye not carnal ? Who then is Paul , and who is Apollos , but ministers by whom ye believed , even as the Lord gave to every man ? For other foundation can no man lay than is laid , which is Jesus Christ . " Can we doubt that the same apostolic rebuke applies in its spirit to that denominationalism-in so far as it is divisive and is built upon a purely human foundation-which is expressed in the name of Lutheran , Calvinist , Wesleyan , Presbyterian , Episcopalian , Baptist , Congregationalist , whether the name spring from a minister , an office , a rite , or a polity ? Who can doubt but that the old warnames of Roman Catholic and Protestant lie under the same apostolic censure , and that when the Church returns to the pure types set by Christ and His apostles they will vanish away ? As to the meaniry , and use of the word *xAi7oia in the New Testament which is fundamental to this subject-not to draw out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too great length-we would offer the following classification , which , as we think it could not be essentially improved , we have taken , with some modifications , from the work of an English writer on ecclesiastical polity . It applies 1 . To all true believers who ever have existed , or ever will exist , who compose the whole body of Christ*- " the general assembly and church of the first-born , which are written in heaven . // the passages : " The Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved ; " " Give none offence , neither to the Jews , nor to the Gentiles , nor to the Church of God . " 3 . To every distinct community , assembly , or even household of Christian believers , gathered together for the purpose of religious worship and service in any given place , as " The Churches of Asia salute you , " " The Church which was in Jerusalem , " b* The Church which is in his house . " These three instances of the use of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe , to cover all cases . The more comprehensive use originates and modifies the more restricted uses . First the one , then the many . Wherever used , the term represents the real body of Christ , either as a universal whole , or as an integral part and member of this whole . The arm is not the body , but still we call it our body . The member of the body of Christ , which was represented by the Church at Antioch-call it the arm-was still one with the body of which Christ was the Head . It represented a variety of the unity . It expressed a living union , not life isolated and independent , but life springing from and nourished by the one common source- " for by one Spirit we are all baptized into one body " - " one Lord , one faith , one baptism , one God and Father of all , who is above all , and through all , and in you all . " Hence , from the very nature of the Christian Church there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it even if they resist it ; it is inherent in the origin and constitution of the Church of Christ ; it is a living and divine law ever operative to purify the Church of its corruptions , and of its merely human , imperfect , and selfish elements , and to bring out in it the perfect image of the glorious and undivided body of Christ . Having thus endeavored to establish , from reason and Scripture , the truth of this idea of the unity of the Church , the question now arises , which we can only touch upon , how is this scriptural and essential unity-this unity which exists now as truly as it did in the days of the apostles , although obscured and corrupted  --  to be redeemed from obscurity , and restored to full power and beneficent working in the Christian Church ? Like the summer when it steals over an ice-bound continent and melts all nature into one green-waving ocean of bloom , so // the warm breath of the Spirit shall at some day bring about this change , and men will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were ever other than brethren ; but what are Christians themselves to strive after7 in order to hasten this blessed day of the Lord , when all shall be one as Christ is one with them and with the Father ? Roman Catholicism has tried and failed . In the line then of the Roman Church , and of all hierarchical churches , by laboring to bring about an external uniformity in church organization and rule , founded upon a jure divino assumption , the problem can not be solved . The dominion that Pope Innocent Ill , laid upon the whole world , and all its powers , has been growing less and less , and that arrogated ecclesiastical unity , or universality , which is vitiated by the simple fact that an earthly head is put in the place of the spiritual Head , has been passing slowly off the surface of the world like a cloud , nation after nation emerging into the light of a clearer faith . We do not say this in hostility to the Roman Church , or in denial of its claims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bound to most corrupting and almost fatal errors ; but we say that it has failed to represent the apostolic idea of the one universal Church . We honor even the falsified but maj estic shadow of this idea which Catholicism has held up , and perhaps it will be her mission , when purified of the papacy and other " adulterating ingredients , " as Coleridge calls them , and brought to a spiritual faith , to teach us this great lesson . But it will not be in the line of external uniformity of rule and government , or of sacerdotal and sacramental theories . Different forms of church organization , different ecclesiastical denorninations , if you choose to call them so , will continue to exist ; and , as far as they are the genuine expressions of honest even if partial theories in regard to the outward form of the Church , they are useful . We are not in favor of dead-level uniformity . We are not opposed to denominations as expressive of freedom and life . Better the narrowest sectarianism than spiritual death , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Church grows , denominational differences will ineasurably diminish , and in forms of church polity and administration there will be more of assimilation . What the ages have // proved to be good and wise , in the various forms , will be interchanged , and the whole will be re-organized , simplified , and strengthened . The Protestant has also tried the experiment , and-we had almost said , though this perhaps is not quite true , as he has not yet wrought out the problem wholly , or the scriptural truth committed to his charge-has failed . This unity in like manner fails to be realized by efforts , however sincere , to bring about an internal doctrinal unanimity . The clocks can not be made to strike together . The creeds can not be squared . While we see here as through a glass darkly and the perfect has not yet come , there must be allowed to all believers untrammeled liberty of search and opinion . Men must be left to the free teachings of the Spirit and the Word . The doctrine is precious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the doctrine are imperfect and changeable . In theology there is not unity . While there exists the instinct of order in the human mind as truly as there is an instinct of faith itself , the science of theology will live , and will draw to it the greatest minds in the world ; it will alway be the queen of the sciences : but theology is not faith . Theology is not love . Theology is not religion . Theology is not the uniting principle that joins men to God , or to one another in the Church of Christ . We would attempt to answer the question , that has been proposed , in a very simple way . We believe that the only method by which Christians can themselves truly aid in hastening the consummation of this great truth of the unity of the Church , is , by striving to have restored in their own hearts the primitive condition of the Christian Church , by having re-awakened in their hearts the real sense of brotherhood that was a living and operative principle in the apostolic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divine nature of which all partake and to which the selfish or separating principle is alien . Thus by the expulsion of selfishness , the one higher life in Christ will be realized both in the consciousness and outward life . By increase of faith there will be increase of unity ; and love , which is the grand unifying principle , will work in all the members to the perfecting of the saints and of the body of Christ . In the mean time , however , there are certain acts , // 117 duties , and lines of conduct on the part of Christians and Christian Churches , which may be said to be practically within the power of such , if so disposed . to pursue , and which strongly tend to union and if Christians and Christian Churches are not so disposed to do these things , it may then be clearly seen who are the true schismatics that destroy the unity of the body of Christ . We would mention but three of these possible or practicable measures , that , if carried out faithfully , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) The equal rights of all Christians and Christian Churches to be mutually recognized and practically acknowledged . A true Church of Christ , whatever its name , ought to be regarded by other Christian Churches as entitled to all the rights and privileges that belong to a true portion and member of the body of Christ . Its ministers , or officers , regularly ordained and accredited , should be recognized by other churches as ministers of the Church of Christ , especially since the ordination of a Christian minister does not derive its prime validity from the act of man but from the appointment of Christ . Its members , under due tests and restrictions , should be held to be members of the Church of Christ , and entitled to the privilege of full communion and fellowship in all other churches . There might be , we grant , at first , great practical difficulties in the way of carrying out this plan or mode of inter-ecclesiastical action , but the difficulties would grow less and less as the churches became more pure and more filled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be made for the sake of higher objects. * The recognition of the true inembership of Christ 's body would be a slow process , and caution woald have to be employed in the extension of Church fellowship to low types of Christian faith and of so-called Christian Churches . The tests of the gospel , looking to the reality of character , to the work of Christ 's Spirit in the heart , to the existence of the common evangelic-life implanted by the grace of * The Dean of Canterbury recently preached by invitation in the Chapel of Yale College , and was listened to with marked attention and respect . If President Porter were to be invited to preach in the Dean 's pulpit , the circle of Christian liberality and courtesy would be complete . It is fair to surmise that if it depended upon the Dean there would be little difficulty in the case . // God in ways and methods , and under forms of religious education and worship quite varied oftentimes from ordinary standards , perhaps in heathen lands as well as in highly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pure discrimination and a broad charity , following the blessed example of Christ and the instructions and spirit of His Word . The largest liberty is not to be feared so long as a true faith in Him who is the meaning , and beginning , and end , and glorious divine life of the Church , is maintained in the hearts of those who are called after His name , and who are appointed to perpetuate and extend His kingdom in the world . ( 2 . ) The community of Christian living , which also includes working , to be observed among all the followers of Christ . There should be open and bearty codperation among all who call themselves Christians , of whatever Church or denornination , iu Christian life and activity . This life proceeds from an inward power imparted by his Spirit to all who serve Christ , and this life therefore should be manifested in common among all Christians as something superior to outward differences . This union was a very practical thing in the apostolic times , and exerted a powerful influence upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great force constantly brought to bear upon the shaping and ordering of their conversation and all their actions : " Wherefore , " - said the apostle , clinching the instructions with the strongest reason that an inspired mind could employ ,  --  " putting away lying , speak every man truth with his neighbor ; for we are members one of another . " A common love , a common aim to serve the Master , should bring all together in one , should break down every partition wall , and all hearts and hands should join in the work of doing good , of preaching the gospel to the poor . of building up Christ 's kingdom of righteousness on the earth . The individualism of our churches-seemingly growing more and more narrow and divisive -- renders these efforts at grand , unitc*l , aggressive missionary work almost an impossible thing . 3 . Communion in worship . We may as churches and individual believers formally repeat the apostolic creed , credo in sanctam ecciesiam catholicarn , sanctorinn communwnem , but uii - less as Christians we pray together in the spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the communion of saints may be doubted . As the purity of spiritual worship increases , and as the divine fact of Christ 's intercession as our only ugh Priest , by whom through the Spirit we all have access to the Father , is more truly recognized , then the differences even in modes and forms of worship will more and more be done away . Devotion is a bond of unity . It is woven by the thousandfold breath of prayer . If the devotional communion of all Christian Churches should ever gain ground , they would pray themselves into one . They would be benetltted also in the methods and power of public worship  --  the Protestant worship would gain in richness from the beauty and copiousness of the ancient liturgies , the liturgical Churches would learn the language of primitive spontaneous devotion ; but in the breath of common supplication the who% Church would be brought by one Spirit into the unity of the gospel , and closer to the heart of Christ , the ever-living source of a common life , faith , and love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be a real matter , something more than an easily affirmed and boasted spiritual unity . The spiritual union , it is true , is the essence of the bodily union , but it must be so genuinely spiritual that it shall truly manifest itself that it shall be seen in the united life of the whole body of Christ on earth . It must not be so inwardly invisible that it is not visible at alL It must not be put off to heaven while Christians are fighting here below ; each sect , or church , jealously standing on the defensive on its own fortified hilL We are not opposed , as has been remarked , to those different church-zions . Let them still exist , but let their walls be demolished . Let grain and fruit-trees be planted where once the frowning battlement and grim weapon of defence stood . Let each church cultivate its own field and vineyard in peace , welcoming , however , the mutual help and the common products of its neighbors . We would not have the earth , religiously speaking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garden of the Lord , with it infinite variety and beauty . Let those who by education , affinities , and tastes are Congregationalists , or Presbyterians , or Episcopalians , each take good care of // his own-they would probably do more good in this way-but at the same time let them be careful to work not so much upon the line of denominationalism , or narrow ecelesiasticism , as upon the higher plane , of the one universal Church and kingdom of Christ ; and we would here commend to all our brethren the words of Dr. Parker of London , that seem to have been inspired by the influences of the late meeting of the Evangelical Alliance : - " Men separated from each other by the widest ecclesiastical distances have looked each other in the face , have bowed in common prayer at the same altar , and extended to each other the right hand of Christian recognition and fellowship . From that advanced line of brotherhood there must be no retreat . The good vow has been spoken and must never be recalled . For my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seek out lines of sympathy and union rather than to magnify points of antagonism and alienation . " A noble resolve which all should imitate ! " From that advanced line of brotherhood there must be no retreat , "  --  and there must be also further advance . The evangelical alliance of the future must not be all on the side of Protestantism , but must sweep a wider circle , and comprehend all who , even though in much imperfection , under rites and forms of pure superstition , or in the barrenness of religions ignorance , still recognize in their hearts Jesus Christ as the way of life to sinful men , and as the hope of the world . The next Evangelical Alliance which is formed should not assume an adverse or antagonistic attitude to any , but like the universal gospel which it aims to express , should take into its efforts , prayers , thoughts , and loving sympathies , the whole brotherhood of man .                    @
