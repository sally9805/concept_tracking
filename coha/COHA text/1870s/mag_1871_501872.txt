WE are all born into the world living interrogation marks . The sting that tingled in poor Pope 's soul so long , defining him to himself as " a little crooked thing that asks questions , " has a broader application , characterizing the whole race of man . Unlike most other distinctive traits of the race , this " grows with what it feeds on . " The castle that parleys , the woman who listens , have alike begun a career of disastrous defeat ; and the soul that begins to question has but begun to slide toward the dark and slippery steps of hell . It is the office of faith to lay her calm , cold finger upon the trembling lips , to arrest the wandering steps , to teach us the last and hardest lesson of life , that all things come to him who can wait . For with questioning comes speculation ; we pull up our anchor of contented ignorance , and trust to unknown seas , in hope of equally unknown shores . When we begin to define We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet there is a subtle fascination in the very danger that tempts us continually ; and , like a child on the shore that dips its dimpled foot into the cool foam of the advancing wave , and follows its retreat with dancing footsteps , overtaken by the mightier rush of the nearer billow , which , sweeping away all foothold , and tossing those desperate arms and that bewildered face a moment on its surface , forever hides them from the eyes of love and the arms of maternity ; so we , once beginning to lift the veil of Isis , fearless of its pure and tempting folds* smitten with the madness of curiosity so far transcending even the madness of passion , we too raise the divine drapery with irreverent hands , and are struck lifeless with spiritual paralysis . Of all these questions that vex and mock us , perhaps the most common is the relation of mind and body ; that problem which babies and philosophers alike endeavor , each in their own fashion , to solve , and each with similar result ; and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theory of dreams . What , where is this wondrous country , so full , so far fuller than daylight life , of passions , people , nature , art , that night transports us to ? Why are its glories so incontinuous , its speech so incoherent , its agonies so terrible , so helpless , so ludicrous even , and yet so brief ? Why do we wake night after night exhausted and panting with insane terrors , or calmed with impossible delight ? Why is sleep so peopled , so tortured , so raptured , that waking alone is rest ? " Behold , the dreamer cometh ! " was the ironic salute of Joseph 's brethren ; and " dreamer " is the world 's title of scorn in all time , till men are ashamed of their visions and proud of their facts . Alas ! what is fact and what is vision ? Are they visions , the dead who return to me night after night , whose fond eyes shine , whose voices comfort , whose arms clasp me , whose tender faith so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the love that visits me in sleep , the fear that maddens , the tongue that reviles , any less fact than if the sun shone upon them ? Do they not console , thrill , distress , with the same vividness as their daylight congeners ? What is it that gives inc warning days beforehand of a sorrow that impends , or a delayed delight ? Why do I interchange dreams with the few whom I know to be of my kind ? how do I know that I do not interchange them with others whom mine eyes in the flesh have never seen and never shall see ? How do I know that those strange , sudden perceptions of places , faces , thoughts , words , which startle all our souls at times , like lightning out of a blue sky , and are oftenest credited to some vague theory // 196 ThREE GhOSTS . of pre*xistence , are not due to this subtle kin-ness of souls-this counterpart sympathy that . we recognize when we meet and can compare ourselves , but which may be equally potent in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself , subject all my life to their dominion , I dare not deny the mystery of dreams . Mental philosophers tell us , with the shallow wisdom of all mortal philosophy , that dreams are the result of association ; that like spiritual parrots they only repeat in garbled language the events of the day or the past ; that no dream has ever exceeded the limits of humi*n experience , or even equalled in the enjoyments of sense the exercise of our waking senses ; premises so false that their conclusion fails . Many years ago I had myself a dream that , among others , perhaps more than any other , exceeded all those conditions . With the strange inconsequence of dreaming , I found myself in the street , walking quietly toward home ; all my surroundings were actual and commonplace . I could point out to-day the vcry flag-stone where my feet were arrested , the very tree above whose stately green pyramid the heavens opened to my sight ; for they opened not with the breaking apart of piled thunder-clouds , or the radiance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the rolling away of a scroll ; but the serene , blue heaven parted as with a clean rift into deeper and still deeper azure , up , up , up ! with an expression of space and distance beyond any aspect of faintest stars or midnight 's purple depth , " as the body of heaven in its clearness , " but bluer and still bluer to immeasurable heights , and calm with the intensity of color ; and in this parted rift stood three colossal angels , so grand , so tranquil , so lofty , that their very size expressed the immensity of space beyond them . Yet , not like any pictured or storied angel-shapes were these ; no spotless robes clothed them , and whatever were their method of descent from those infinite spaces beyond , no conventional wings indicated it to be flight ; yet every figure was so full of rest , of rapture , of still lightness , that wings could no more have expressed soaring , although they stood and stayed themselves upon great harps of crusted gold all lit with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nursed , and no earthly sun ever lit with cognate ray ; while all their robes floating and flowing against the heavenly blue were dyed with mingled colors , for which earth has no name , language no words to describecolors no human eye has capacity to see , no human thought to form for itself , dazzling , wondrous , a blaze of mystery , such as only the Creator may know , hiding in his boundless stores of eternal glory secrets for that endless existence , food for the ever-hungry souls , the transfigured and fire-refined senses of his children . Nor were those garments and those types of music the chief assertion of these wonderful spirits . That they were of God was written on those faces , whose rapture was too calm , too rapt , too utterly divine to be uttered in any human speech ; all three upturned toward this far height in the rifted heavens , through whose illimitable space streamed down waves of some atmosphere beyond the name of brightness , or splendor , or glory , or fire , or sunshine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its soft , fluent , free , ever and overflowing waves , in whose tender and splendid radiance those calm faces basked like a happy child in a happier mother 's smile , to the visible expression of Love so utter , so inefthble , so divine , that it manifested itself as atmosphere , and made mere existence an absorption of rapture , an annihilation even of individuality in the hour of manifestation . Never while I live will that vision pass from my soul . For the whole following day I spoke no loud word , and held the breath of my thoughts ; even // 197 now , after long years , its recall thrills all the spiritual nature life has left me with unspeakable awe . Where was this dream born and nursed P Or where that other , when , standing on a vast plain , I beheld on its further edge the slow and measured rise of clouds , pearl-topped , lurid* heaped height as height against the quiet field of azure air ; so grand , so awful in their vast upward lift and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crept , while the words formed themselves on my consciousness , " Behold he cometh with clouds ! " when , like a sigh of some far-creeping , wailing , shivering , April wind , there breathed from beneath that awful and majestic canopy a strain of music , that sobbed its first anguish into the rest of mild despair , and rose by wondrous gradations into triumph and repose ; so sad , so calm , so throbbing with a human sorrow , weeping itself out upon the bosom of Divine Love , that even its inexpressible anguish ceased to rend my listening soul , but calmed it as a c'hild is calmed with sudden surcease of tears , though still its slumber thrIlls with painless sobbing and soft sighs of peace ? Years after , when the dream , if dream it were , was nowise present to me , suddenly it sprang up   the very chords of that same music , so long unheard , so long what men call forgotten . I asked , and found it was that very work of Mendelssohn 's that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eluded me , for who dates a dream ? hut so far as I could recall the time , it corresponded with that midnight when his own soul , through those who loved him as their souls , uttered his own requiem . What metaphysician shall expound to me the birth and nurture of that vision ? Or where , whence , came another that through all the long agony of our civil war kept my soul in peace above its distracting fluctuations , sure of a just ultimate end ? Hardly was the conflict begun when " I dreamed a dream ! " Out of some thick and darksome wood , where close boughs and clinging vines blinded and strangled me , where my steps slipped on sodden leaves and wandered in pathless mazes , I came suddenly into a vast plain girt with forests , and apparently unknown to man , except that on its most distant verge - stood a lofty castle , white as if fashioned from polar ice , lifting alabaster towers far heavenward above the smooth greensward of the plain ; and on its front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and so high , so wide , that its upper edge overtopped the highest tower , and its width concealed the broad front of the supporting castle . This I did not see at first ; for , coming from the forest gloom , a strange and awful light poured itself from the upper air upon my level eyelids-light born neither from sun nor star ; nor yet from the ghastly flames that stream and flicker in the north was that strange brilliance shed . I lifted my fearful eyes above me , and there , reaching in stature from the horizon even beyond the zenith , bending over earth , I beheld a seraph clothed in dazzling garments , and holding in his right hand a turreted sceptre , from whose every point streamed light , so formless , so pure , so effulgent in its blinding rays , that from the Source of Light alone its brightness could have emanated . Wonderful as were its garments and its sceptre , transcendent as its illumination of the quivering depths of air , there was a sight more wondrous yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stature , every lineament vast and majestic , its face was yet the tranquil , innocent , pure face of a baby ; the fluent and unformed lines , the lips , the brow , so inexpressive , so content , yet so sad because of that innocent content , all were there . It was the face of an untried seraph , so born and cradled of love , so informed and interpenetrated with Divinity , that even its woful and awful message to earth could not 13 // breathe one troubled breath across its all-loving and all-trusting existence ; could not shadow the bright calm that shone on those serene , infantile features , gazing from mid-air with eyes that saw but the recent face of a Father , ar ' * lips but just closed from the rare breath of heaven 's own atmosphere . I said its woful and awful message ; for while its right hand bore at rest the turreted sceptre , its left , as if directed by some will not its own , but in whose possession its own was passive and insensitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off , upon whose surface under that indicative finger grew these words : I am weary of delaying ; I am weary of oppressors and oppression . Now is my time come ; Now will I avenge myself on the earth ' So I awoke  --  and behold it was a dream ! And to come nearer the absolute dominion of spirit , the " dead-line " as it f were , beyond which Our audacious mortal theories are put sharply out of existence by inexplicable truths , why did I year after rear awake in the night , roused by the sound of drums beating reveill6 and muster , and all their campcalls ( which I never then had known nor thought to know ) , from a hillside just beyond the city suburb where I lived ? Two and three years before the war of secession , these sounds haunted me night after night ; time after time I awoke some member of the family to listen ; but the rattle and rush that fell so distinctly on my ears were dumb to them . I heard and knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognition , when the Twelfth regiment C. V. for weeks camped on that same hillside , and marched from there straight to the battle-field , to the beat of those very t drums I had heard so often so long before . Or what shall we call it , when once , utterly exhausted by acute disease , so weak I could not turn on my pillow without the greatest exertion , yet free from illness , which indeed was short , though sharp , and had never affected my brain , I became suddenly conscious that I was not in my body . There was no other person in the room . I had been lying wide awake ( as I thought then and think still ) , so weak that it was an almost impossible effort to breathe ; and at once I was free , painless , self-sustained in air ; and beneath me lay that nerveless shape that had been mine  --  the man-face , the thin features , thc damp , tangled hair , all at rest ; peaceful as a deserted nest ; quite quiet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , insensitive , dead ! And the first thought that came to me was , " how easily I died ! it was slippping off a cloak only ! how good to be over with all ! " And then those indestructible and mystic threads of relative existence vibrated suddenly . " I must get back ! I ca n't die ! What will and do ivithout me ? " I made a dreadful hut clearly conscious effort to reunite myself with that pale shape of clay on the pillows below me ; it was a struggle of absolute agony , a pang so mighty that it compelled success . I was again there , wretched , languid , drenched with a sweat of terror , trying to stifle a useless but sharp regret ; but again an embodied soul , or spirit , or consciousness , whatever name best defines the dualities we call life . Had all these things occi*rred to an organization distorted by organic disease or hysteric spasms and their various remedies , medical science might dismiss their recital with a sneer ; but a temperament that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it is relief to substitute one disease for another  --  a temperament that rcccivcs no exhilaration and very little effcct from any stimulus except // 199 tbe purely cerebral ones of tea and music , surely may be considered a fair subject for spiritual tests , and yet here have all my experiences ended . I do not mean in these instances , but at these bounds one would naturally expect that a nature so toned and affected by what we call the supernatural would be the prey of so-called " spiritualism , " and be also a veteran ghost-seer 's . But common sense has kept me from the one , and the limitations of my nature from the other . Yet from the extent of my own experience I should be as I am a firm believer in ghosts , even had I not received from eye-witnesses evidence on that had which is in itself convincing to any candid mind . And it is through this long avenue of their forerunners that I venture to lead my patient readers up to a trial of apparitions , whose evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence can be ; as unprejudiced and as honest as is in human nature to give or to receiye . The first relation of a ghostly apparition from a living ( still living ) eyewitness which I ever received was made to me by a young woman whom I have known for many years ; a person of great tact and perception of character and more than ordinary intelligence , perfectly honest in word and deed , and one of those women who have done the duty that lies nearest with faithful persistence , though it involved hard work , courage , and great unselfishness . If I give the story ( so far as I can recall it ) in her own words , it is to save the awkwardness of a narration in the third person . Let me premise that her father and mother were Irish Protestants , religious and respectable people ; she herself was born in Canada , where these events happened . " When I was about ten years old , I think , though I ca n't remember , we went away from Toronto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent word to mother we must all come there right away , for he had hired a house and it was ready for us to move into ; so we packed up all our things and went . I was the oldest but one , and there were four younger than me , besides my mother 's sister , Aunt Lyddy . She was about thirty , and lived with us to help mother , there were so many children . " When we got to the house father had hired , we liked it very much ; it was bigger and better than we expected . It was n't in the town exactly , but just a little way out , maybe a quarter of a mile , and it stood in a large green yard that had a road in it coming in at a gate at one corner , and sWeeping round before the front door and down to the other corner , where there was another gate . It was meant for a carriage-road , but was all grass-grown now , and only showed the track , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a partition right through the middle that made it into two tenements , though it was built for a single house ; and it had a piazza running clear across the front of the lower story . Somebody lived in the other half of the house , only a man and his wife , no children . They were a Mr. and Mrs. Gray ; Scotch people I believe ; the man worked in H- . We liked the house very much ; there was room enough , and the children liked the green yard . None of us went to school that summer . After we had been there a few days mother and I were sewing one afternoon in the kitchen , and we heard a dreadful crash up stairs , something as if all the chairs and tables had fallen down . We ran right up , but there was not anything amiss ; the children were in the yard and Aunt Lyddy gone to H- . Then we started to go into the loft that ran over the house without any partition , and had a scuttle-window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came another worse crash from down stairs , seemingly in the pantry ; and we went down with all speed , but there was nothing there either ! Why , Miss - , you would have thought every dish in that closet had been thrown down and broken , and there // was n't even a cobweb stirred . Mother said she thought it was the blinds perhaps in the next part ; there was a soft wind blowing . I did n't think any more about it then . Next day I had toothache , and mother put me down on the kitchen settle SO she could poultice my face . I got so easy with the heat I fell asleep , and the first thing I knew I woke up with the kitchen clock striking . I do n't know what time it was , but it was night and there was a moon ; it shone into the window . Mother 's bedroom door was open into the kitchen , but she was asleep ; I could hear her breathe hard . I had n't been awake but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast up the road to our door . Somebody jumped out , and there was a soft clear knock three times on the front door , which opened right into our parlor , mother 's room being partitioned oft ' from that and the kitchen , which opened into both rooms in a kind of L part behind . I had just got up on my elbow to call father when I heard him jump out of bed , and in a minute he came through and went to the door . I could see , for he left the kitchen door wide ; and when he opened the other there was f nobody at all there , only the moon shone as still and cold as could be on everything . He went out into the road and down to the gate . I heard him tell mother when lie came back that both gates were shut and no sound to be heard . Then they thought it must have been a dream . I do n't know why I did n't tell about hearing it . I suppose I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much , and they did n't know I was awake either , and I went right to sleep again . I did n't really think any more about it till afterward . " After that we heard the crashes a great many times in different places . Mother said it was rats in the wall , or blinds , or the wind . Somehow we children all got used to them ; we did not mind , not even when the next moonlight nights caine , and we heard the carriage-wheels and the knocks more than once . Father went to the door a few times , then he stopped going . I do n't know what he said to mother ; she never spoke to us about anything , but she seemed to get uneasy and irritable a little . Aunt Lyddy said she was nervous , but niother did n't like that . " We did n't see much of our neighbors . Mr. Gray was gone all day , and Mrs. Gray went out a good deal to dressmaking ; when she was at home she always went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and stood there till her husband came home ; and when she went out she always came back with him , never alone . Aunt Lyddy would laugh and say she guessed she would n't be quite so ready in winter-time to go and meet him ! " By-and-by it got to be July . The weather was hot , and Aunt Lyddy had walked into H- one day with some shop-work she had been doing . She had errands besides , and walked a great deal , so her feet were very sore when she got back ; for she had dreadful chilblains always in the winter , and somehow they always hurt her in hot , dry weather . I used to sleep with her , and that night she could n't sleep a bit , nor I either . She used very often to go out nights when her feet burned so , and step in the grass to cool them ; she said the dew was healing ; but that was generally just before she went to bed . She did n't go that night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't possibly sleep she got up , though it was far into the night-I think about one o'clock  --  and said she must go outdoors . The neighbors had been gone away a week visiting soinewhem*e , so we should n't scare them opening the front door , and she stopped to tell mother what was the matter . I went with her , partly because she wanted to have me , partly because I thought it was fun . I was wide awake , and did n't want to lie there alone in a hot room when it was cool and fresh outdoors . She walked on time grass till her feet were all cooled and // dripping with dew , while I kept on the step , or went in the path , for our steps had worn a bare path up the grassy road by this time . Then she came on to the piazza and says to me , E. , let 's walk up and down here a bit ; it 's so cool I hate to go in . ' So we walked along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's side , and there was a light showing through the blind ( outside ) of her parlor window . There were shutters inside , and they were always shut at night , so we were surprised to see them open now , and the blind-slats turned straight . We were both barefoot , so we had made no noise ; and now , without once thinking it was n't vei-y polite , we peeped in through the blind . The chimney was at that end of the house , and though the night was so hot , there was a great blazing fire on the hearth . That was what made the light , for there was n't any lamp or candle ; and right in front of the fire , all huddled up on a low , three-legged stool , sat a little old man . He was dressed very oddly ; he had on blue breeches and long , gray , ribbed stockings , with low shoes , a striped short jacket , black and white , and on his head a dark red woollen cap with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for it was so queer , and nexi* morning father made me tell it all over to him , so it fixed it in my mind . I could n't see the man 's face very well , for he made a kind of rest for his chin with both hands , and he was looking straight into the fire ; his hair and short whiskers were grizzled and thick ; his eyes , I remember , looked very bright and fierce . He did not move while I looked , but Aunt Lyddy plucked my sleeve and beckoned me away . Come , ' she whispered , as we got to our own door ; they 've got company , and it a n't over-polite to be peeping in at the window ; hut was n't he odd-looking ? ' Then we went to bed and to sleep , and while we were at breakfast-table next morning Aunt Lyddy says to mother : " When did the neighbors come back ? ' " They did n't come back yet at all , ' says mother . " Why , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' says Aunt Lyddy back again , and then told what she and I saw in through the blind . " It was not them , ' says father . It could n't be them , Lyddy , for here 's the house key they left with me , safe in my pocket ; it . must be some one came on no good errand . I 'll step in and see . What was the man like ? ' " Aunt Lyddy had stepped to the shed for some water , so I spoke up and told father just how he was dressed . Moth*r laughed and says , E. has always the quick eye for dresses ; I 'll lay she 'll be a milliner yet . ' And so father says he 'll go for a policeman into H. , and see if the house is robbed . " I had to go out into the country a mile after butter that day , and I took the children ; and when I got back I asked mother if the house was robbed in Mr. Gray 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a tramp . So I thought no more about it , nor should have to this day only that we moved into H. in a month , and there father took sick and died , and after we came away into the States to live , and Aunt Lyddy with us , she told me all what happened after . You see father got the policeman while we were gone that day , and they went in , and there was no signs of anything there-all the shutters shut , no smoke at all on the chimney back that was all lime-washed clean , and no three-legged stool in all that house ; and when the policeman asked father if he 'd seen the rohb*r and what he was like , then father had Aunt Lyddy tell , and the policeman shook his head up and down . Oh ho ! oh ho ! ' says he , I 've heard tell of him be-fore ! ' " And what did you hear ? ' says father . " No good , ' says O'Brien . It 's a ghost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ' always walkin ' this place . ' // " Stuff ! ' says my father to him . There 's no such thing as ghosts . ' * " Ah , thin , may the divil fetch ye for a black Protestant ! ' says O'Brien ; an ' he will that same ef ye do n't belave in spirits . But jest ye go to yer own praste an ' ask him an ' see what risponses ye ' 11 get out o ' that . ' " And so he went off quite angry , and father angry too , so he forbid Aunt Lyddy to mention the thing again , for he 'd not have us children scared with non*ense. but for all he was n't easy in his own mind , so finally he went to the Rev. Mr. Gassett , who was rector of the church we went to , and Mr. Gassett says to father : Mr. Dunbar , there 's many things in the world past explaining ; it behooves ye to have faith in the Lord , but I must tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In that house where you live , and in that very room where your child and sister s*w the apparition , I beheld its likeness in the flesh die with yells and cursings like one of the devils . His name was Gaspar Xerez , whereby I do take him to have been Spanish born ; but no man knew his history in this place , save and except ihat he built that lonesome house and there lived , paying all his moneys out in coin , both silver and gold , of foreign lands . And when death took him of a sudden and they called me after the doctor , both came too late , for we were there scarce five-and-twenty minutes when his soul departed this life , or this clay , and went unto its own place in a torrent of blasphemy . Yea ! he died as the fool dieth ; and many times since have I heard that his likeness hath walked in the place of his abode , but have never credited it . You say that both tour sister and daughter wist not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sir , as yet they know no more . ' " Let them be then ; ignorance is oft-times blessed . I advise you to leave that house , and even in your own mind ask no questions of the Lo*d , for inscrutable are all His ways . ' " But before father got home Aunt Lyddy had seized hold of Mrs. Gray , just then appeared from her visit , and told her what we had seen . Poor Mrs. Gray burst out crying at once . She said she was so glad somebody else had seen that man ; he had been the plague of her life since she had been there , and she never would stay in the house alone after sunset , as we had noticed . Only the week before her husband had seen him for the first time , and finally was listening to her trouble and making up his mind to move . Father came back in the midst of this talk and forbid Mrs. Gray speaking about the matter to us children ; but for all that he thought best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and nobody ever dared live in that house after . And that 's all the ghost I ever saw in my life , and I saw it as plain as I see you before my eyes this minute , neither scared nor sleepy , and me not knowing it to be a ghost all the time . *Vhat do you think of that , Miss  --  ? " I thought but one thing . The next story of life beyond , or rather after death , is a story of the last generation in part . On the old turnpike road from Hartford to Albany , some four or five miles west of the low mountain range that bounds the western edge of the Connecticut valley , there is a wild and curious formation of rocks , bearing half a dozen names in the country thereabout . A sharp ledge springs from the otherwise level fields , and at one end , severed from it by a small marsh , rises a jagged mass of rock , inaccessible save on one side , and presenting an aspect of savage nature so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that in any other country it would have been hung with legends as it is now with hoary moss . On its peak grow only a few dwarfed and scantleaved cedars , from whose brittle and grotesque boughs long sprays of gray // 203 moss float idly on the moaning winds ; now and then a snake basks on the precipice 's edge heated by intense summer suns , or a nest of young bats , disturbed from their sheltering covert , fly shrieking *nd staggering through the air , blinded , as a flight of imps might be , by heaven 's pure daylight . From this strange height , whose lift is but a few score feet above the smiling fields beyond it , yet whose front bears scars of time and climate , venerable as the mighty mountains of the North , the explorer looks down upon a pond that washes the abrupt precipice of the ledge on one side , and at its northern end degenerates into a low plashy marsh . Northward still of this pond the turnpike proceeds through a small village , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an old house known as Horsford 's tavern . In Revolutionary times taverns on all high-roads were of precarious profit , but this one had been less exposed than many others to the demands of the English troops , and had a good deal of custom from the go-betweens , express-riders , and despatch-bearers of the American army . Here , one day during th' height of the war , there alighted at night a handsome , slight young officer , evidently a foreigner , though he managed enough broken Euglish to demand supper and a bed ; and the sinisterfaced landlord , giving a surly response , sent out his two equally ill-looking sons , one to stable the horse and one to fetch in the saddle-bags . As Luke Miller threw this then universal baggage on the barroom floor , a little boy who stood in the corner waiting for his father 's bottle of rum remembered afterwards hearing a heavy chink , and that the stranger with much excitement of manner ordered them carried up to his own bedroom . When morning came , and the miserable old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the tavern , and asked , " What kem o ' that ere feller Jake sez stopped here las ' night ? " he was told with a growl that the stranger had gone on to Albany before daylight , and further interrogations were stopped with a gratuitous drink . But not long afterward messengers came to that tavern trying to trace Major Laborde 's route from hartford to Albany . He had left Hartford after dinner of a Tuesday , carrying ten thousand dollars in gold and bills of exchange , to pay the troops at Albany , and had never arrived at his journey 's end . Old Miller and both his sons swore that Major Laborde had left their house in the morning before dawn , and sundry people in the village testified to having been roused from their sleep that morning while it was yet dark by the sound of horses ' feet going westward at a heavy trot . Beyond Canton all trace was lost . Perhaps he had been swept away in fording some wild mountain brook , just then swollen by spring freshets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but fierce as any panther in its overflow , had borne him into the deeper pools of the Tunxis river ; or it might be that in his haste he had not delayed for food or rest , but come at night into the treacherous Naugatuck or Housatonic fords , and been swept seaward with the uprooted trees and broken bridges that were the yearly tribute of those rivers to the sea . At any rate the poor young Frenchman was gone , and neither trace nor hearing of him could be found beyond Canton village , nor did any suspicion alight on any spot or person as to his fate . But in a year or more , like a slight autumn mist creeping upward from a meadow at dawn , vague , intangible , having neither definiteness nor shape at first , there began to spread a feeling through Canton that some mystery hung about the Ledge . Boys who had fished there all their little lives for " pumpkin seeds " and shiners , began to take holiday in other regions ; oJder fishermen who now and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black holes of some tributary brook brought a gold and crimson spotted trout , were // observed to come home before sunset . And when this strange , shivery feeling of apprehension took words to itself , some one or two , bolder than the others , declared they had themselves seen at twilight the shape of a headless man , clothed in white , sitting on the pond shore in places inaccessible from the land side because of that plashy marsh , or from the water save by a boat . So the pond was deserted . In the mean time the Millers-if that was their namekept on still at the tavern , year after year expending the profits of their trade in buying land , and building a good house in the village , as they said for their father to live in , but in that house their father neither lived nor died . He was s*ized suddenly at the bar , dealing out rum bitters , with a brain-fever almost like sunstroke . The two sons carried him out to his bedroomfrenzied and howlhig , with their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lips . No nurse , no physician ministered to that brief but mortal sickness ; his sons alternately watched over him , and nothing was known of him among his contemporaries in the village till they*were summoned to his funeral . After this the brothers , being obliged to admit outsiders into the tavern as help , for Luke had taken to drink and could not be trusted , were known to be very quarrelsome , even sometimes coming to blows as was supposed . Still they accumulated money , and when they left the tavern , going to live in the house they had built , and Luke was also smitten with mortal illness , no human eye saw , no human hand ministered to him in all those weeks of agony and delirium , but those of his brother Mat . And when Mat himself , old , gray , morose , and penurious , yielded to the fate of man , no creature entered his chamber to the last hour but his patient , emaciated , heart-broken wife ; and with the yell that broke from his parting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was only recovered to sink into her grave a speechless and idiot pauper ; for their money had taken wings , their stock had died , their crops failed , their grain blasted , their barns burned . 4 Neither name , good fame , nor money remained to them ' ; for Luke had not been laid in his grave a year when a certain " shiftless " idler of the village , wandering about the marsh above the Ledge pond in search of boneset blossoms , found half buried in one of its black pools a saddle , so moulded , so sodden , so utterly rotted , that nothing was left to indicate its maker or owner , except that deep in one of the stirrup irons the Frenchman who wrought that now rust-eaten metal had cast his own name , which time had but half obliterated . It ran : " Jul otard , " but " Paris " was intact yet . This odd discovery , though it came to pass twenty years after the disappearance of Major Laborde , set the village tongues wagging mightily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maid even in all Canton daring enough to question Mat Miller of the past , and within six months the still sterner silence of inexorable death had frozen his lips forever , and the tale died out . But full fifty years after the gay and gallant young Frenchman came to his mysterious death my informant , a sensible , practical farmer , of the real sturdy New England type now so fast disappearing , a man who bas the best butter , the best poultry , the best wife in the township , told me that he remembered as a boy some ten years Qld , there came an Irishman to Canton who had been in this country but a short time , and wanted to get work as a farm hand . Irish labor was not so common then as now , and he readily obtained occupation . The story of Major Laborde 's disappearance had long died out of Canton gossip , and Tim Malony was gradually getting used to his new life in America , when one Saturday he asked leave to go fishing in the Ledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corn-hoeing was over and haying not begun ; so he was readily allowed a holiday , and started off alone with rod and // bait , hoping for a good three hours ' sport . By sunset he had a good string of roach and perch , he said ; but nobody ever saw them ! Just at dtisk , with glaring eyes and frothing lips , hatless , tremhling , and uttering inarticulate cries like a beast in pain , he burst into the kitchen of my friend 's father . Mr. D. supposed him to have a fit , but when his speech and sense returned he declared that he had been sitting quietly on the edge of the little scow that was the only boat kept on the pond , waiting for a nibble , not twenty feet from the shore , and drifting nearer all the time with the light motion a southerly wind gave the water , when looking up he saw about four yards before him , sitting on a tussock of swamp grass and reeds , with its feet apparently hanging into the water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to land or to Mr. D. 's he never knew , nor had he , or the little boy who forty years after told me the tale , ever heard that legend of the Horsford tavern or the haunted pond ; but old Mr. 1 ) . shook his head , and Tim took his knapsack next morning and left town . " Goold would n't timpt me , surr , to see the likes iv that ag'in ! " The Ledge stands yet in its drear and savage beauty against the sky , and at its feet the silvery pond still laps the shore with inarticulate murmur , rosy with faint tints of dawn , or silvered with the melancholy splendor of a waning moon , but still silent and wan as with some oppressive secret ; but never again has mortal eye , expectant or unconscious , beheld that ghastly and ghostly witness of crime which now shall never be avenged on earth , though it be judged in heaven . The last and most recent of these three tales I have to tell , I received from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relative of my own , a man in the prime of life , well educated and highly cultured , and a person of wonderfully sunny and buoyant temperament . Had he been nervous , hypochondriac , or melancholy of nature , there would be more chance to cavil at his story ; but he is a practical , hearty , cheerful man , an unbeliever in all sorts of spiritualism and supernaturalism , a man without superstition and without fear . He had lived and practised for many years in a large Western city , had grown up with its growth and identified himself with its interests , not infrequently extending his practice ten or twelve miles into the country about , though naturally preferring to confine it within city limits . A few years ago , when the increase of population had brought its natural increase of medical men , and he had given up to younger persons all his country practice except as consulting physician , he was called upon by an old German of the name of Eberstein , whose family he had attended when they first appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had since bought a farm in the country some seven miles out , and had employed a younger physician on finding Dr. T. unwilling to go so far . Today , old Eberstein was importunate enough . His daughter was very ill with fever ; Dr. Parker , who attended her , had said and thought that her illness would be tedious but not fatal , and in that persuasion had gone East to be married , leaving directions for her treatment , and would not be home for a week . In the mean time her disease had taken a sudden direction for the worse ; in fact its character had entirely changed as far as Dr. T. could discover , and assumed the aspect of malignant typhus . He was very unwilling to take up the case , but the old German was so unhappy and so resolute that the physician 's kind heart could not withstand him , and he promised to find his way out to the farm in the . course of a few hours . It was a brilliant autumn day , the air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that inefikble and sad perfume called out from fallen leaves and honeyed hut fading blossoms . Over the undulating fields of northern Ohio a faint mist // stole upward and shrouded the dazzling forest tints with friendly dimness , smitten here and there into glory by the level rays of a gorgeous sunset . And upon this solemn brightness of departing day arose a full harvest moon , slow wheeling above the eastern horizon its placid and mysterious , orb , and flooding with light which is not brightness and glitter that is not glow , all the unwilling gloom of lake and forest . Such nights are rare in the rank and poisonous West-happily rare , since their tempting beauty breathes a deadly breath : that riotous color of foliage and sky is the burning forerunner of more burning fever ; that mysterious moonlight lays upon its worshipper 's brow the long and pallid fingers of a living death that is called ague . The nightmare Life in Death is she , Who chills man 's breath with fear . Dr. T. had eyes to see and heart to feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had shaken hands with the awful spirit men call malaria and knew her power . He drove his good horse at full speed , and reached Eberstein 's farm in about an hour . Here he tied the animal to a post by the barn and went over to the house , not expecting to stay more than half an hour . The house was a neat two-story frame building , the lower story almost directly on the ground , having a deep cellar below , and a ' piazza running round its east and south sides . On the north side there were but two windows below stairs , one opening into the pantry , the other into the lower bedroom where the sick girl lay , from which also a door opemied northward , and another window to the east piazza , and still another door into the parlor , which occupied the southeast corner of the house , opening on the piazza , and through which the doctor approached the sick-room . The night was so warm as to be sultry , and , regardless of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breath of night , all the doors and windows were set wide , evidently to give air to the girl who lay motionless upon her bed , deserted of life as ashes are of fire , though yet there linger in their cold gray heap one leaping spark that presently flashes and is gone . All the family were gathered in the room , but not about the bed , and only on the southern and eastern sides of the chamber . Of various ages , all bore to each other that curious resemblance we call the mark of race , and that still more intimate and peculiar one of family ; tall , fair-haired , blooming , as were the living , their traits were moulded in the same mould with her fair but sunken lineaments who lay on that little bed , with damp masses of dead yellow hair trailing to the floor across her lifeless arm . Dr. T. proceeded to examine the state of his patient , . and found her rapidly sinking ; the fever had evidently been severe , though in its typhus stage brief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most powerful stimulants and aromatics only aroused a momentary flutter of the all but inaudible pulse as they were dropped into her blackened and parched lips . Already the deathsweat stood upon her sharply lined temples and about the pinched nostrils ; her great blue eyes were pale and rayless ; evidently the senses were fast deserting their outposts . After giving all the stimulus possible , with the habit if not instinct that possesses physicians to labor while life lasts , Dr. T. ordered hot applications to be made to the patient 's body , and taking the father 's arm gently withdrew him to the piazza to tell him his opinion . " And how long is it she shall live ? " inquired the old German , his voice trembling as he spoke . " Perhaps an hour , no longer , " was the doctor 's reply . " Then to her I must go ; come , Herr Doctor , come mid . " // " There are too many people there now , Eberstein ; why do you have them all in the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the old man . " I must go too . I know him ; my woman she know him ; but the leetle ones not so . I must be there . " " What do you mean , man ! " impatiently exclaimed the doctor , muttering to himself , " Too much beer ! " " It is the Watcher I mean ; he come aiway to the window when Von Eberstein die ; in Tcherman country we was Von . " " Stuff and nonsense ! do n't be a fool , man , and scare the girl to death with your trash ! " " Scared is Adelheid not to tall . She have seen the Watcher herself . Mein fader he have die in this land , and to the north window came the Watchcr , just so as in mine own country ; so as he shall to-night come for my girl , mein kleine kint ! " A great sob shook his broad breast , first sign of emotion ; and then through the parlor came his wife , a fair and placid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placid . " They not can warm her , herr Doctor . I think she will now go . " Dr. T. hastened in , observing as he passed to the bedside that the bed itself had been shoved aside , so that his patient 's countenance faced the north window . Passing behind it , he saw that every face was turned in the same direction ; every eye riveted on the sash , now closed , but filled with rather larger panes of . glass than those common to such structures . A slight exclamation of anger rose to his lips ; but the rapid reflection that the girl was now , and had been for some hours , past any injury from such a superstitious observance , silenced him ; and taking the nerveless hand in his , he felt her pulse , scarce perceptible even to his skilled fingers . Suddenly it gave one firmer beat , she opened her eyes and fixed them on the window . Across that wide , blank gaze flashed a sudden gleam of recognition , not to be mistaken in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow that gaze , and fastened his own on an appearance pressed close to the glass  --  a shape  --  a face - at least lineaments , so awful , so indescribable in their lurid , shifting , formless stare , so utterly and wordlessly horrid , that for an instant his own heart stood still , and the blood curdled in his veins , even as if that ghastly terror had been his own summons . A low moan , that would have been a shriek had not awe stifled it , burst from every lip . Dr. T. turned to look at Adelheid ; she lay back on her pillows qaite dead . He rushed at once to the northern door , not three feet from that window , and let himself out . Not a leaf moved , not a sound lingered in the dead silence ; broad and still the moonlight lay on those unshadowed stubble fields , and filled as with milk of the gods the jewelled cup of the blue firmament above : light , silence , everywhere ; not even a sign of life ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he went away from that house neither believing nor unbelieving , and told me the tale as I have told it , without note or comment ; leaving it as I shall leave it , without hope or attempt of explanation , a baxe but unden.iable fact . We are such stuff As dreams are made of ; and our little life Is rounded with a sleep ! ROSE TERRY .
