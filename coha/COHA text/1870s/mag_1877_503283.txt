AT intervals of varying length , the journals of the Anglo-Saxon races are given to discussing the question whether the present age be one of decadence or progress in dramatic art . Most readers of " The Galaxy " have seen some phases of this discussion , which starts up afresh after the arrival of every noted foreign actor or the production of a new play . It is at present confined to the English-speaking nations , and prevails more in America than England just now . In France there is no lively interest in the theme . The French dramatic authors seem to be pretty well satisfied themselves , and to satisfy their audiences ; their best claim to success being found in the fact that English and American dramatic authors of the present day almost invariably pilfer hom them . In the course of this perennial discussion we constantly meet with appeals , on the part of those learned gentlemen , the theatrical critics , to the " dramatic canons . " Such and such a play is said to offend against these " canons , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is shameful to be ignorant , but at the same time with a vagueness of phrase betraying a similar vagueness of definition . It has seemed to us that an inquiry into the nature of these canons may not be out of place at the present time . This we propose to determine by consulting the practice of those authors of former times whose productions still hold the stage as " stock plays , " so called , and of those modern authors still living whose plays are well known and famous , being still suecessfully acted . By such an analysis we may possibly settle something , especially if our inquiry shall call forth the actual experience of those living who have attained great success , whether as authors or adapters . The most obvious division of our subject is into tragedy , comedy , melodrama ; but inasmuch as it is plain that the laws of success in all these walks of dramatic art must contain much in common , we have preferred a different division for analysis , leaving the kind of drama as a subdivision common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but equally just division will be as to the canons regulating the subject , the treatment , and the production of a successful drama , in whatever walk . We propose to ascertain our canons from the successful plays , still holding the stage , of Shakespeare , Sheridan , Knowles , Bulwer , Dion Boucicault , Tom Taylor , Augustin Daly , and Gilbert , together with such single plays , like " The Honeymoon , " " Masks and Faces , " and a few others , as are better known to the public than their authors , vVhose sole dramatic successes they were . Ephemeral successes , however great , can not be safely taken as guides to a canon ; but an established success of long standing , however repugnant to our tastes , must be examined , even if it take the form of the " Black Crook . " The influence of the French drama on Anglo-Saxon art has been so decided that no safe estimates of canons can be made which do not take into account the works of Sardou , Dumas , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fortunately for our subject , the French work on simple principles , and will not confuse us any more than the Greeks , whom they imitate . Let us try , then , to ascertain our canons in their order , beginning with the subject of the drama . What subjects are fit for dramatic treatment , and are there any entirely unfitted therefor ? We find a pretty wide range in the // successful dramas of modern time . In tragedy we have ancient history , as shown by " Coriolanus , " " Julius C*esar , " " Virginius , " " Alexander the Great " ; medieval history , in " Macbeth , " " Richard III . " ; legendary stories , in " Lear , " " Hamlet , " " Othello , " " Romeo and Juliet . " In comedy and melodrama we have an almost infinite variety , as much so as in novel writing . History , legend , and pure invention claim equal right in the field . We have " The Tempest , " " As You Like It , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Night , " " Henry IV. , " " Henry V. , " " Merchant of Venice , " " The Wonder , " " The Honeymoon , " " Masks and Faces , " " London Assurance , " " School for Scandal , " " The Rivals , " " The Lady of Lyons , " ' Richelieu , " " Wild Oats , " " The Colleen Bawn , " " Arrah-na-Pogue , " " The Shaughraun , " " The Wife , " " The Merry Wives of Windsor , " " Under the Gaslight , " " Don Ca*sar de Bazan , " " American Cousin , " " Rip Van Winkle , " and the " Black Crook , " all well known and successful plays , many perhaps being acted this very night all over the Union and England . We are not here examining the question of the goodness or badness of these plays , their merits or demerits : we are merely recognizing them as well known plays , constantly being acted , and always successful when well acted . Of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acted are those of Shakespeare , Sheridan , and Buiwer , among the old plays , and those of Boucicault and Daly among living authors . Almost aJl playgoers are familiar with these works , and have seen them once or more ; and every new aspirant for histrionic honors has one or more of the plays of the first three in his list of test characters . If he be a man and a tragedian , he must play Hamlet , Othello , Richard , Shylock , Macbeth , Richelieu , Claude Melnotte ; if versatile , he must add Benedick , Charles Surface , Captain Absolute , and others to the list ; if a lady , she must be tested in Portia , Ophelia , Pauline , Lady Teazle , Juliet-who knows what ? Some very versatile ladies have tried all the light comedy characters , finishing with Lady Macbeth as an experiment . A short time ago there was quite an epidemic of Lady Macbeths , but that is over for the present . The stray sheep have returned to the fold . Let us return to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dramatic subject from these successful plays ? There is a limitation somewhere , and the first and most obvious is-time . A novelist can make the minute description of a life interesting . The most celebrated novels , such as " Robinson Crusoe , " " Vicar of Wakefield , " " David Copperfield , " " Pendennis , " " The Three Guardsmen , " and others , have been just such books , imitations of real biographies . But a play is limited in leagth to five acts , or six at most , and its time of acting has a practical limit of three hours , with the inter-acts . Each act is further practically limited to five scenes , and it is but seldom that it stretches over three , while the latter average is never exceeded and seldom reached in a five-act play . No scene can properly contain more than a chapter of a novel , so we find ourselves practically limited to a story which can be told inside of fifteen chapters , the further inside the better . The French , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canons , almost invariably limit their acts to a single scene , reducing their story thereby to only five chapters . A careful comparison of successful acting plays will generally end in bringing us to one obvious canon : I. The subject of a drama must be capable of being fully treated in fifteen chapters at most . The next limitation that we meet is in the nature of the story . A novelist can describe his hero and heroine and // the scenes in which they move . He can depict them in motion , and describe a long journey in strange countries , trusting to picturesque scenery and incident to help him out . He can give us a sketch of their former life , and tell how they fared after they were happily married . The dramatist can not do this . He must put his people down in a given place and leave them there till his scene is over , opening another scene or another act after a silent interval . He can , indeed , put a narrative of supposed events into the mouth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dull and prosy , and to be avoided . Shakespeare uses them sometimes , but only when he can not help himself , and always makes them short . The nearest instances that occur to us are , the description by Tressel to Henry VI . of the murder of Prince Edward , usually put now in the first act of " Richard III. , " and the story of Oliver in " As You Like It . " Sometimes a short story can not be helped , but if told , it is always found to be of a collateral circumstance not directly leading to the catastrophe . It generally is brought in only to explain the presence of a character on the stage in the successful drama . Sometimes it happens otherwise . For instance , Coleman makes Mortimer , in the " Iron Chest , " tell the whole mystery of his life in the form of a story instead of acting it . The result is a poor play , seldom acted , and generally to small audiences , being only valuable for some special features of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much to ask for acceptance of this second canon regarding the subject : II . The subject should be capable of being acted without the aid of narrative . Is it still possible to limit the subject , and do novels and dramas differ still further ? A third limitation will reveal itself , if we compare a typical drama , like " Much Ado About Nothing , " or " Hamlet , " with a typical novel such as " David Copperfield* ' or " Robinson Crusoe . " These latter depend for their interest on a series of adventures which befall a hero , sometimes entirely unconnected with each other , just as they happen to a man in real life , wherein he meets many and various scenes and persons . Neither possesses any sequence of events , depending on each other , such as pervades " Hamlet " ' and all acting plays . It is true that some few novelists , such as Wilkie Collins , write novels that depend on plot for their interest , but those typical novels which stand at the head of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as " Ivanhoe , " " Talisman , " " Old Mortality , " are antiquarian studies , with very slight plots ; Dickens and Thackeray 's best novels have no plot worth mentioning ; and where perfect plots are found , it is rare to find a lasting and enduring novel . In a. play , on the other hand , a plot seems to be absolutely necessary to interest the spectator , the more intricate the better . We have all seen Shakespeare 's plays so often , that we are apt to forget how intricate and involved many of his plots are ; and when we consider that most of his plots were taken from very bad novels which have utterly perished from sight , while the plays still live , we begin to realize by the force of contrast another canon relating to the subject , which is this : Ill . The subject must have a connected plot , in which one event depends on the other . When we come to restrict the dra* ' matic subject any further , we encounter more difficulty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should depend on either love or death , but we are met at once by instances of plays in which the real interest is almost wholly political , such as " henry V. , " " Richard III. , " or moral , such as " Lear . " Referring once more to the effect of contrast with // the novel for guidance , we find it very difficult to separate subjects proper for dramatic treatment any further than we have done , and almost impossible to lay down any absolute rule to which distinguished exceptions can not be quoted . It mig'at be said that the interest should turn on a single action , as it does in most plays , and especially in tragedies , but here we are met by " Much Ado About Nothing , " " The Honeymoon , " and other plays , where two or three plots progress side by side in perfect harmony . It seems , therefore , that any further absolute limitation of the abstract dramatic subject is impracticable , and we must be content with adding a mere recommendation for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The interest of the plot generally turns on either love or death , and generally hinges on a single action or episode . When we come to speak of the best subjects of dramatic writing , we are really approaching the domain of treatment , which is much wider and better defined . There it becomes a question for judgment and discretion , and much more certainty can be attained . Instead of considering all dramas , we narrow our search to the best only , judging them by the simple tests of success and frequency of acting , and finding what sort of subjects have been taken , and how they have been treated . Let us then come at once to the question , What is the best method of treating a given subject ? Here we are again confronted by a variety of decisions , some of which seem to conflict with others , but which all agree in some common particulars . In the dramas written , down to the time of Boucicault , it seemed to be assumed as a matter of course that every firstclass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five acts . All of Shakespeare 's , Sheridan 's , Knowles 's , follow this old rule , as inflexible and artificial as some of the French canons , but with the same compensating advantage , that author and audience knew what was expected of each , and troubled themselves little over the structure of their dramas . Of late years another custom has taken the place of the five-act play , and many if not most of the modern dramas , while of the same length as the old ones , are divided into four and even three acts . Especially is this the case with comedies , and those nondescript plays that are variously called " melodramas , " " dramas , " and " domestic dramas . " In the case of three-act plays , the number of scenes in each act is frequently five , sometimes six or seven , but the common modern practice restricts the last act , if possible , to a single scene . The number of scenes must of course depend on how many are absolutely necessary to develop the story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act has one great advantage . It permits of very much finer scenery being introduced than in a scene which is to be shifted , whether closed in or drawn aside . For instance , when the curtain comes down between each scene , the stage may be crowded with furniture , and those temporary erections called " set pieces . " There will always be plenty of time to remove these between the acts , and noise of hammering is of no consequence when the curtain is down . If there is more than one scene in the act , all this is changed . Let us say there are only two scenes . One of these must be a full-depth scene , but all the furniture and set pieces are restricted to that part of the stage which lies behind the two " fiats " which make the front scene . In that front scene furniture is inadmissible , without rudely disturbing the illusion . Let us suppose the front scene to be the first , and that any furniture is left on the stage . At the close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there stands the furniture . The old way to get rid of it is simple . Enter a " supe " in livcry , who picks up the one table and // two chairs . Exit , amid the howls of the gods in the gallery , who shriek " Soup ! soup I " as if they were suddenly stricken with hunger . Of course this spoils the illusion ; and the better the scenery , the more perfect the other illusions , the easier they are disturbed by such incongruity . Sometimes the set pieces in front , if there are any , and the furniture , disappear through trap doors . In the large city theatres , such as those where spectacular pieces are constantly produced , this method of changing a scene is common , but such theatres themselves are not common , and it costs a great deal to run them on account of the number of workmen required . Our present inquiry is directed to the ordinary theatre , with its stock company , simple scenery , and few traps . Of this kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such theatres at least it will always be best to keep furniture and set pieces out of the front scenes as much as possible , to preserve the illusion . If the front scene come after the full-depth one , the wisdom of this rule becomes still more apparent . A " supe " taking out furniture is not half as ludicrous as one bringing it in , and without a trap such a spectacle is unavoidable . The first canon offered by common sense is obviously sound : V. Keep furniture and set pieces out of front scenes , if possible . This rule being followed , will probably reduce the front scenes of a drama to the open air , woods , gardens , halls , streets , church porches , and similar places , where the attention will be concentrated on the actors , not the picture . The scope of a front scene is further restricted by the fact that you must bring your characters on and take them off , being deprived of that valuable ally to illusion , the " tableau . " If the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may indeed be discovered , but it can not close the scene . The most common place for a front scene is between a first and a third full-depth scene , to give time for the change that goes on behind . This change always makes a certain amount of noise , and the use of the front scene is to take off the attention of the audience . This intention must be hidden at any price , for , if perceived , it is fatal to the illusion . To hide it there is only one method always reliable , which is to rivet the attention of the audience on your characters , put in your best writing , and get up an excitement to cover the scene . If you have any brilliant dialogue , any passage of great emotion , any mystery to be revealed , put it in your front scene so that your design may not be suspected , but the scene appear natural . In brief the canon says : VI . Put the best writing into the front scenes . The next question that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of incident that should be treated therein . It is obvious that it will not do to put in a crisis or a climax at such a place . At its best a front scene is only a makeshift , a prepnration for the full scene . Its employment necessitates a loss of nearly three-quarters of the available space , and the tableau loses all its power , as developed in the full-depth scene . Its use is therefore a disagreeable necessity , so disagreeable that the French discard it entire ly . Mechanically it is only an introduction to the full scene , and the more it partakes of the same character intellectually , the less will it weary the audience . The best preparation an audience can have for a scene is to make them eager therefor , and the best way to make them eager is to leave them in suspense , so that they are impatient for the movement of the fiats that opens the next picture . A familiar instance of this employment of the front scene is found in the " Shaughraun , " by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represents the outside of a cottage with a // door in the right flat ; the peasants and other characters come in , talk about the wake , and enter the house one after another . In this scene it is also explained that the supposed corpse is not dead , but shamming , so that there is no tragic interest associated with the coming scene , but every one is anxious to see it . At last all the characters are off , the flats are drawn aside , and the celebrated Irish wake makes its appearance , taking the whole depth of the stage . The audience is satisfied , and the front scene has answered its end , as expressed in this canon : VII . Front scenes ought to terminate in a suspense , which the following scene will relieve . From this canon it follows that the front scene should deal only with explanatory and dependent matters , not the principal action of the drama . Sheridan , in " The Rivals " and the " School for Scandal , " opens his first acts with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the story . I am inclined to think that he had a reason for this which still prevails , in the noise made by the audience . The beginning of the first act of most plays is distinguished in the auditorium by much shuffling of feet , openingof doors , taking of seats , especially by those who take the reserved seats in front of the house . All this disturbs the audience and makes them lose any fine points at the beginning of a play , unless the actors strain their voices unduly . In a front scene the fiats immediately behind the actors serve as a sounding board for the voice , and reduce the volume of space to be filled by the speakers . The advantage gained in this way is balanced by the loss to the eye in losing the full-depth scene , wherefore this method of opening a play is not much in favor ; but its use in the cases mentioned leads to a general canon as to the first act of a play , which also recommends itself to common sense : VIII . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beginning of the first act . This rule , however safe and sensible , is hampered by the necessities of the subject , to which everything must be subordinated . Let us see how the greatest masters of dramatic construction in modern times open their first acts . Of these Boucicault comes first , facile prine*ps . We will take the " Shaughraun " and " Flying Scud " for examples . Both open in a similar manner : in the first a young woman , in the second an old man , engaged in household work , singing away at nothing particular . A quiet picture not requiring close attention . To each , enter a disturber , somewhat disagreeable , arresting attention . A short squabble , then more characters coming on , one or more at a time , till the stage is pretty full , and no flagging of interest . The act does not drag . Compare this with Sardon 's " Frou-Frou , " " Fernande , " and others . Sardon 's first acts almost invariably drag , and the success does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sardon almost always brings on his people in pairs , and takes them off together , leaving the first act a succession of dualogues , with very little action . Now take " The Lady of Lyons , " an old success , which nowhere drags . It opens with a picture , mother and daughter , doing nothing particular . Enter disagreeable Beauseant , who makes an offer and is rejected . A mild excitement at once arises , shut in by a front scene , short , lively , and spirited , where Glavis and Beauseant plot for revenge on Pauline . The scene ends in suspense , the actors having gone for Claude Melnotte , and the fiats draw aside , revealing Melnotte 's cottage and introducing the hero . By this time the audience is quiet and can take the fine points , so the third scene of the first act can be made exciting . There is thus no flagging of interest in either Bulwer or // Boucicault . One does the thing in three scenes , the other in a single scene , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : IX . Open the first act with a quiet picture , and bring in the disturbing element at once . Having aroused attention , bring on all your characters , and end with an excitement . Avoid bringing on characters in pairs in this act . The first act of a play is always surrounded with difficulties . The interest of the audience has to be aroused , and all the characters brought in . Every part of it must hang together , and the attention must be excited more and more as the act progresses . This rule applies to the whole play likewise , but in the first act it is especially necessary , because there are so many things to divert attention , and the object of the act is to catch it . After a certain period it must flag , and the object of the dramatist must be to close his act before that dreadful peri od . The office of the first act is to prepare for the second ; therefore it resembles the front scene in one important principle-it should end in suspense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ending as it should in a full scene , it has the advantage over the front scene that a tableau is possible , and should be used . This tableau must be natural , and must come , as all tableaux come , out of a climax , but the climax must not be complete . It must leave the audience in suspense , and give them something to talk about in the interact . It must not be too long delayed , or the act will drag . These and various other reasons have led to this further canon , generally ob-served : X. The first act should be the shortest , and as soon as a partial climax is reached the curtain should come down . The tableau and action should indicate suspense and preparation . This general rule indicates that the villain should be temporarily triumphant , if the play is to end in his discomfiture . If his first scheme fails in the first act , it is difficult to arouse interest in the nominally imperilled innocence which is left in danger . The structure becomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been violated . No rule is so safe in dramatic writing , as also in acting . The end is-illusion . The rule of putting only suspensory and preparatory action in the first act is universally followed by Shakespeare and all other successful writers of plays , and is better settled than any other . The first act occupies the office of the first volume of a novel , explaining all the story . Very frequently , in the modern French drama especially , it assumes the form of a prologue , the action transpiring at an interval of several years , sometimes a whole generation , before the rest of the play . Only one instance of this character is found in Shakespeare , in the " Winter 's Tale , " where the action of the drama demands a prologue , but it is quite common in modern times , while another custom of Shakespeare's-that of dividing a historical play into two " parts " - has quite gone out of fashion . Its only modern example is that of Wagner 's opera of the " Niebelungen Ring , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chinese and Japanese have a strong taste for this kind of play , but the practice has vanished from Anglo-Saxon civilization . It must be confessed that the employment of a prologue is rather a clumsy way of opening a play . It is too apt to be complete in itself , and to join clumsily to the rest of the drama . Besides this , it is hard to preserve the illusion that the small child who appears in the prologue has developed into the good-looking young person who is the heroine of the rest of the play . The " Sea of Ice " is a familiar instance of this sort of thing , where the same actress who personates the mother in the first act , and gets drown- // ed , blossoms into a girl of eighteen in the second act , supposed to be her own daughter , last seen as a small child . In " Winter 's Tale " there is nothing of this . The supposed Perdita of Act I. is merely a rag baby , and mother and child reappear together thereafter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is limited to a year or two , this objection does not apply ; in fact such pro . logues are quite common and useful . The fanciful and magic prologue to the " Marble Heart " is a very happy instance of conquest of the difficulties inherent in long separated prologues . The wrench is so sudden from a Greek sculptor to a French sculptor , from Athenian dresses to Parisian , that the main interest of the play lies in the identification of the ancient characters in the new dress , and the very fanciful absurdity of the plot lends it an air of reality essentially dramatic . The end is illusion , and illusion it is . There is little more clear and positive to be said about the first act . Study of the best models will reveal many points inherent in all , but no general rules so clear as those of brevity , action , and suspense . The practical limit of time is from fifteen to thirty minutes , the medium of twenty being common to mono-scenic acts , but on this no positive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and only this general rule is partially true , that no interest can carry an audience through a first act of forty-five minutes . We next come to the middle acts of the play , and here again general rules are hard to find . The number of acts varies so much that nothing positive can be said except as regards fixed lengths of drama . Treating all between the first and last acts as a whole , the first certain rule that meets us is this truism : XI . From the second to the last act the interest must be regularly increased , and each act must end in suspense , leading to the next . Without an observance of this rule no play can ever be permanently successful as a general thing . There have been some poor plays with little interest , that have been bolstered up for a time by the force of a single character , portrayed by a peculiar actor , but in that case the play becomes a mere star play , " not amenable to the common rules , and useless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Of such are those multiform dramas , constantly varying , of which Mr. Sothern makes Lord Dundreary and Sam the central figures . The actor found he had made a lucky hit in his character , and he hired out the work of altering the play to any sort of literary hacks , so that he himself is really the creator of the plays , and when he dies they will die . In the " American Cousin , " as it was first played , the interest lay entirely in Asa Trenchard , and the drama was very skilfully constructed , with ascending interest , to develop the ideal Yankee . In that part Jefferson made his first public hit . As soon as he found that Dundreary had stolen the play from its hero , Jefferson was wise enough to drop the contest between high comedy and broad farce , in which the latter must conquer when they come together . By taking up the ideal Dutchman ( or rather German , as he makes it ) in Rip Fan Winkle , he created a part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably die with him . No one else has succeeded with it to the same degree , and " Rip Fan Winkle " stands as a model of a successful star play , wherein all the interest hangs on a single character . It is not the intention of this article to enter into the question of what constitutes the interest of such plays as " Rip Fan Winkle . " To do so would be to enter into a field where everything is uncertain , and where judgment is only an expression of individual liking . The main elements of the success am pear to be humor and pathos , those twin brethren of genius whose identity and individuality are frequently so // inextricable from each other . Both crc drawn in broad , simple lights and shadows , so that the simplest audience can take the points , while the most cultivated members of that audience are studying the delicate touches of the actor . The contrast between  --  but we must refrain from the digression , however tempting . We are examining the dramatic canons , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those relating to construction , not to sources of interest . In the kingdom of invention genius is supreme ; and amenable to no rules . Each writer must work out his own salvation . Constructively it is obvious that the number of acts in a play must be regulated by the number of natural episodes in the action of its subject ; and the perfection of its construction is tested by the liberties that can be taken with the acts and scenes . Of late years it has become the fashion to alter and remodel Shakespeare 's and other old plays , by changing scenes and acts , cutting out and putting in . To an ardent worshipper of Shakespeare as read , these alterations frequently appear desecrations , but there is little question that they were and are improvements . The construction of many of Shakespeare 's plays is decidedly faulty , and the nature of the improvements made by managers and actors is best illustrated when the original play unaltered is tried against the adaptation . The acting edition of " Richard III . " is a familiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being a shrewd old actor and manager . His edition holds the stage today , and always succeeds , where the original " Richard " fails . In this matter of construction the chances are all in favor of the improvement of a work by a shrewd adapter . His attention is directed to only one thing , the successful presentation of the play . He is not an artist so much as a workman . He creates nothing , he only alters and improves . He may be perfectly incapable of creating an ideal character , while yet he can make its language more compact , can concentrate its action . Such an adapter is a skilful gardener . He can not create the fruit tree , but he can prune it , and stimulate it to the perfection of fruit-bearing . The French stage has been a prolific nursery for these skilful workmen , and they have managed to extract splendid successes from their work . It is by comparing their English adaptations with a simple translation of the work that one best sees the improvement . For instance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a plot and incidents so repulsive in the original that its translation failed in London in spite of its weird power . Adapted and cleansed by a clever American author , it was the , great success of last year in New York , and is now running a fresh career of success . Another instance that occurs is Sardon 's " Fernande . " It was altered and adapted in New York by Augustin Daly , and succeeded . Another version by Mr. Sch*nberg , then of Wallack 's , a straight translation , failed to secure a hearing in Boston , and ended in a lawsuit . This was not for want of merit in the translation , which was excellent , but , as appears from a comparison of the two plays , simply because Daly had improved on Sardon . The alterations were small , but masterly , and showed that Daly understood his business . In Sardon s play there appears a certain character , a young count ( I forget his name ) who comes in at the beginning of the first act , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some very important business to do , but he appears nowhere else . Of himself he does not aid the plot , but his last action is indispensable . In the original play also appears the Spanish Commander , a mere sketch in the first act . Daly suppressed the Count altogether , gave his best business to the Commander , and brought the latter in all through the play . The result was one good character instead of two poor ones , and indicates a canon which can be confirmed by many // other instances . This canon shapes itself something like this : XII . Concentrate the interest on few characters , and avoid numerous unimportant parts . This canon rests on the necessities of a stock company , as those before rest on the nature of scenery and audiences . Every company has its leading man , leading lady , low comedians , old man and old woman , and those ordinary characters which all playgoers know by heart . If the play does not fit these , it will not succeed . The appreciation of this fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Daly , and Lester Wallack as pht*y writers . They know the exact capacity of their stages and companies from long experience , and write their plays to fit them . With even ordinary talents they would have a great advantage to start with over writers . of greater genius , writing with vague ideas of what the manager wants . As managers they know exactly what they want , and what their companies can do . To a youag writer the difficulties are all in the start , unless he be an actor , or so closely related to actors or managers as to be able to get behind the scenes at all times , and become familiar with scenery , traps , machinery , rehearsals , and all the details of the lnt8iness of theatricals . In former times , especially two centuries ago , the task of writing a good acting play was far easier than now . Scenery was simple , access behind the scenes easier-there was not such a wall of separation as now exists between actors and audience in a first-class city theatre . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was confined chiefly to actors , managers , and those men of fashion who were given to haunting the green room . In the present day no amoynt of talent in a writer seems capable of overcoming the difficulties of technical construction of a drama . It is rare to find an author of acknowledged talent in other departments , especially in America , distinguished as a dramatist , and when one of them tries his hand at playwriting he fails , not from lack of good dialogue and literary finish , but solely from lack of knowledge of the business of the drama , the limitations of actors and scenery , and the technique of dramatic construction . There is more hope to the American stage in the future in the production of such undeniably original if mechanically faulty plays as Bret Harte has given us in the " Two Men of Sandy Bar , " than in the rapid carpentry and skilful patchwork of hosts of French adaptations , whether they run ten or five hundred nights . Our ilartes and our yet unknown writers daily coming to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their heads , lack only technique and the custom of the stage , which no one can give them but the managers and actors , who shall welcome them as t*pprentices to learn the trade . That thes*e latter will find it to their advantage in the cad to encourage a cordial alliance between the men of the quill and the men of the sock and buskin , follows from a simple calculation . If men of confessedly small talent and low character , such as the host of lesser playwrights who furnish pabulum for the outlying theatres , can write fair acting plays , simply by using mechanical knowledge and stolen materials , it is probable that men of original talent , already experienced writers in other branches of literature , will end by producing much better and fresher work , when they are offered and have enjoyed the same technical advantages .
