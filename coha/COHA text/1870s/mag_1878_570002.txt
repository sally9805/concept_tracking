ARTICLE VJ. - DALE 'S LECTURES ON PREAChING . Nine Lectures on Preaching . Delivered at Yale College , New Haven , Conn . By II . W. DALE , D.Th , Birmingham . Immo vero audi quod dicis , quicumque dicis ; et qni vis te audiri prior te audi. - Augustine . A. S. Barnes &amp; Company , New York , Chicago , and New Orleans . 1878 . THE first of the Yale lecturers on Preaching , in order of time as of genius , was , as is well known , Mr. Beecher . In his three remarkable series of lectures he struck at the heart of the matter , the motives , affections , inner springs , regarding preaching as a living force exerted upon living men . While he approached his subject chiefly from the human side , it was nevertheless upon that side of man 's nature which is open to divine inbreathings of life and power . Thongh by no means faultless , nor without points accessible to criticism , yet in originality , brilliance , suggestiveness , force , and fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plain , evangelical prelections of Dr. John Hall , massive in practical common sense , iu sober simplicity and kindly instruction -- just as good as gold . After him IDr . William Taylor threw in still more of the spice of sagacious wisdom , drawn from his own wide experience , and enforced with earnest eloquence . Then Mr. Phillips Brooks , in a strain of " sweetness and light , " fervent but at the same time smooth in its flow , set forth the ideal of the preacher , as a personality inspired by the truth , teaching others by his own manly Christianity , without a shred of cant or vulgarity , and while a gentleman and a scholar as he should be by his profession , yet infinitely more by the grace of God a man consecrated in all his faculties to a divine and exalted service . Something perhaps was lacking in all these lectures ; something was left nnsaid that might have been said ; but a Yale literature of homiletics of considerable value has sprung up . It is not purely scientific nor was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspirational . It is suggestive and concen // trated . It is drawn from experience rather than from philosophy . The regular instructors in the science of Homiletics in our seminaries must be content to dig channels of irrigation after these fertilizing tempests have passed over ; and they have their work in developing patiently the principles of the great art of preaching , of fixing in the minds of young men life-rules by which they should be guided , and by training young men themselves as individual minds , awakening the dormant powers of one , subduing the false methods of another , cultivating without destroying wild overgrowth , establishing in solider ways of thinking , and leading to deeper spiritual springs . Dr. Thomas Skinner is reported to have said that the homiletical instructor has a harder task than the teacher in any other department of a theological sebool , because his work so constantly taxes the inventive powers , and because he labors in a field where every one is a self-appointed critic . Stilt the field is a rich one and he who ploughs and h ewho @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Dale , of Birmingham , the fifth and last of the Yale lecturers , who has just finished his course and returned to England , has carried back with him the best wishes of those who learned to know him and heard him speak . It is superfluous to say he is a man of marked power in the f ) ulpit and on the platform . His address upon " British Politics " given iii New Haven , was a masterly piece of masculine eloquence , condensed in fact and thought , electric in force . lie has fairly won the right to speak upon this theme as being himself a recognized leader of the radical wing of the Libera.l party in Englandof the somewhat noted " Manchester school of politicians " - and in close accord with John Bright and other prominent Liherals . Bold and aggressive , everywhere fighting in the front , a popular tribune unflinching in his advocacy of the most advanced views of reform in politics , education , and the question of the disestablishment of the English Church , however we may differ with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courage , his character , and his power . While a public man and in fact an active politician , a probable candidate , it is reported , for a membership of Parliament , he is free from the bitterness engendered by political strife , a cultured and genial gentleman , and // an earnest evangelical minister doing an immense deal of solid professional work . His studies , which have borne fruit in his recent work on the " Atonement , " show him to be as independent in his theology as in his polities , and prove him capable of careful scientific thinking . He is a worthy successor in the pulpit of John Angell James , and as a preacher holds together a stated congregation of some three thousand hearers ; and he is thus in many ways well fitted to speak to theological students on the subject of preaching . His introductory remarks are so graceful that we quote them in full " In preparing these lectures , one consideration greatly relieved the anxiety from which it was impossible that I should alto , ether escape . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see the monuments and memorials of ancient life and manners . You care very much more for the Cathedrals of Canterbury , Lincoln , and York , than for the new Houses of Parliament at Westminster . The Warwickshire lanes in which Shakespeare courted Ann Hathaway three hundred years ago-lanes with hedges which are as green to-day as they were in Shakespeare 's time , and in which the same wild roses were growing last summer that he picked to make a wreath for her hair-are more attractive to you than the best railway line in the country ; and to you Shakespeare 's house at Stratford-on-Avon is more interesting than any of the splendid mansions built for successful merchants and stock brokers at South Kensington or Knightsbridge . Nor is your interest wholly absorbed in those ancient buildings which are attractive for their stately and noble architecture , or in those places which have the charm of association with famous names . Rude cottages by the roadside , or on village greens , cottages in which successive generations of obscure peasants have lived and died , and in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time of the Commonwealth ; sleepy country towns lying remote from railways , and almost untouched by the life and stir of the present century ; these also interest you , for at home you have nothing old except the rocks , the mountains , the stars , and the sea . This seems to me to explain why an Englishman was nominated to this lectureship . Freshness , originality , brilliance-these the Theological Faculty and CorPoration of Yale could find in abundance in this country . An Englishman was sent for , that for once you might have the opportunity of listening to lectures containing nothing fresh , nothing that should have the look of novelty , nothing but what has been familiar to men for hundreds of years , nothing but what was trite and commonplace . " Something fresh nevertheless he brought us . No one will soon forget it who heard his effective delivery of the overwhelming sarcasm of the prophet , in the passage : - " Who hath formed a god , or molten a graven image that is profitable for nothing ? - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coals , and fashioneth it with hammers , and worketh it with the strength // of his arms , " etc. ,  --  a white-flame of scorn seemed to leap from these old words written two thousand years ago . The Bible was lighted up anew when he brought out so finely the argument of St. Paul , in IRomans v , 10 ; it was perceived that he had read the Scriptures sympathetically . He has the true Theologische Geist . He was impressive when he said to the young men " You are Christ 's servants-His slaves , ' to use the title by which St. Paul delighted to describe himself . The work he has given you to do just now is your university work . Morning by morning , when the class-bell rings , the tale of bricks ' should be ready . You may sometimes feel your work wearisome , and may be ready to think it unprofitable . There is nothing cheerful and exciting in Hebrew paradigms . The intricacies of the Gnostic heresies may sometimes seem very dull . But if you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you must also think that He meant you to do the work of the university heartily . For a student to be careless in getting np his Hebrew verbs , or the chapters set him on Church history , is a sin ; just as it is a sin for a preacher to be careless in preparing a sermon . Whatever work a Christian man does , is work that has to be done for Christ ; and if we are negligent in the doing of it , we ought to confess our sin with sorrow and shame , and to ask Christ 's forgiveness . " IDr . Dale emphasizes in his first lecture the study of dogmatic theology . We quote again his words " The gradual development through successive generations , of vast theological systems is at least as noble an object of investigation as the gradual formation of the material world beneath our feet . These systems have also their fauna and their flora , and perpetuate the memory of types of human life and thought-some of them beautiful , some of them terrible , some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in them the craters of extinct volcanoes , which once poured out rivers of flame and clouds of smoke that darkened the very heavens . They have had their glacier periods and their periods of torrid heat . The history of the evolution of the Calvinistic theory of the Divine government during the ages that lie between Augustine and Francis Turretin is quite as remarkable as the history of the formation of the tertiary strata ; and a sentence of the Athanasian creed , with the impress upon it of the subtle theories and protracted controversies from which it derived its precise form , is quite as curious a subject of study as a remarkable fossil in the limestone . " And to mass the lecturer 's thoughts together " But the craving of knowledge of this kind opens a peril . When a young man of any brightness begins to preach he is likely to think that infinite doctrinal changes are necessary in the Church . He smites the errors of the church a little harder than the errors of the world . Research unsettles - In regard even to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there may arise profound questions whether the eternal relations of the eternal Son of God to the eternal Father have been yet rightly defined ; whether the incarnation affected // these relations ; whether in the Trinity there are relations of supremacy and subor lination ; whether the Lord Jesus is in any true sense the root of the whole human race ; whether the hicher life in men which is tha result of their union with Christ , reveals itself in those that refuse to believe in him ; and whether this divine life is wholly absent from those who are not in the highest sense in Christ ; such questions , and similarly deep questions upon other fundamental doctrines will inevitably assail the honest investigator ; for though it is possihie that before you leave this university yen may have arrived at definite conclusions on some of these great and difficult theological prohlems ; hut if you have settled them all , and if you begin your ministry with your theological system completely developed , there must he a vast and inexplicahie difference between the present position of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that no such difference exists . The disorganization of the older systems of theological thought is as complete among you as among us ; the work of reconstruction as no further advanced on this side of the Atlantic than on the other ; the theological students of Yale have the same perplexities and uncertainties as the Theolo8ical students of the old country ; and you will have to begin to preach while the great task of organizing your theological studies is still unfinished . But in settling these grave questions the investigations ought to be carried en in the silence of the study . Let them not he paraded in the pulpit . A minister should not write a sermon to clear his mind on a subject . ' He should say nothing till he has something to say . Nor even when he has reached a satisfactory conclusion is it necessary that he should make known his discovery in his next sermon . The world can wait a fortnight . lie must have time to revise his position in new moods , time to cool and regain his intellectual humility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up your theology in private , and not to perplex your congregations with speculations which are only half finished , with theories which are in process of formation . Let one ask himself not how many errors he can confute , hut how many positive truths he has to teach . " If this advice of our lecturer should be followed , we should not only have in Amei-ica less crude and half-baked theories advanced in our pulpits , but fewer new ones . Truth has divine newness , but his thinking is profound who discovers an entirely new truth . Yet let no student be deterred from independent search . A true theologian is always a student . Old truths may have as many new aspects as the old hills . But what has Dr. Dale told us that is new about preaching as exemplified by the modes practiced in England among the Non-conformist , and especially the Puritan Churches , of which he is so able a representative ? We did not look to him to tell us of the mellow culture and the dignified worship of the Anglican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in some sense the opponent of that Church . But had be any . thing better to give us front the old world ? The fact is that // what is new and even revolutionary in thought in England has , in many respects , grown to be familiar truth to the American religious mind . Thus the subject of " The intellect in relation to preaching , " which was discussed in the second lecture , has no strange sound here in America . We have dull preachers , and here as elsewhere " dullness is sacred in a sound divine . " We have also our " unfulfilled prophecies . " But from the day of Jonathan Edwards , intellect has been enthroned in the New England pulpit . The little tempest about the comparative merits of American and English pulpits that Dr. MeCosh evoked , has its only slender basis in the fact that New England preaching tends to a too exclusively intellectual treatment of divine truth , while the more Biblical method and plain pointed earnestness of English preaching seems to give to it a greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the writer of the present Article has had excepting in the case of a few of the commanding academic minds belonging to the Established Church , he has never discovered the intellectual superiority or even equality of the English to the American pulpit , but he has been charmed by the manly oratory , and by the direct , oftentimes moving and beautiful address , of the best English preachers . Dr. Dale favors extemporaneous preaching . He thinks that " the overwhelming weight of argument is on the side of extemporaneous preaching ; " while , like many with us who think the same , he preaches from written notes . Whenever he spoke without notes , as in his political address , he was decidedly the more effective . He proved his theory against his practice . Nothing that he could say after that to qualify and modify his theory was of the least avail to those who heard him speak without a rag of manuscript before him , a free man in possession of all his powers , a giant unbound . As we are thoroughly at one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ triumph in this case of the true method of preaching , and only hope that it will gain new credence and popularity . Our author is more than commonly urgent in his counsel that ministers , with all their parochial work on their hands , should take an active interest in public matters outside of the pulpit ; advice , which the readers of this Journal and the men // and ministers of Congregational churches in America who have never been recreant to the State in periods that tried men s souls , will not dissent from . " In your Pastoral preaching you ought not to omit to illustrate the law of Christ in relation to public duty . Perhaps you have sometimes met good people who informed you in a tone of spiritual complacency that they have never been in a polling-booth . They do not seem to understand that the franchise is a trust , and that it imposes duties . A Secretary of State might as well make it a religious boast that he habitually neglected some of the work belonging to his department . The duties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duties of an official politician , but neglect in either case is a crime against the nation . I think it possible that the time may come whe.n men who refuse to vote will be subjected to church discipline , like men who refuse to pay their debts . The plea that the discharge of political duty is inconsistent with the maintenance of spirituality ought to be denounced as a flagrant piece of hypocrisy . It is nothin , , else . The men who urge it are not too spiritual to make a coup in cotton or coffee . " Ministers preach better , he contends , who face men squarely in public discussions , who grapple with every-day questions . " If he had to persuade discontented rate-payers that the School Board had not spent too much in the school buildings , or paid the masters and mistresses too well ; or if he had to convince them that it would be worth their while to have the streets better paved , better swept , and better lighted ; that the health of the town would be improved if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a scheme for a new street would soon repay the capital spent upon it ; if he had to expose the misrepresentations , correct the figures , demonstrate the groundlessness of the fears of the hostile party , and so carry the vote and fire the zeal of meeting after meeting for his own candidate ; he might learn some lessons about preaching worth knowing . To carry the vote and fire the zeal ' of our congregations. - this , gentlemen , is our true business . ' We venture one suggestion , and that is that our friend can not judge all men by himself , for he is a man of war . " He loves to fight , but all do not . Some ministers accomplish a great deal of good by keeping to their peculiar work . They work in private like the silent forces of nature sowing seeds deep in the hearts of their people , teaching righteousness not only by word , but more even by their unconscious influence . The vote they carry will not be proclaimed until all things are made known ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the altar seen by no eye but God 's . But if a minister has a clear call to public life , he must follow it , just as if be had a call to be an author , or to pursue a physical science , or to hive bees . We do not , indeed , believe that a hard-working minister // will find much time to read profoundly on the rugged science of Political Economy , but he should be intelligent in regard to political affairs , and be ready also to teach others , and , above all , to lead when the time comes in prompt action for the furtherance of sound political principles . Ministers become priestdwarfed epicenes who lose sight of the great ends of true righteousness and freedom in the State . Among English Independents , now as in former days , ministers are more the familiar counsellors of the people in matters civil as well as religious , less ecclesiastics in fine , than our Congregational pastors . They can do things that it would be strange for our clergymen to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closely identified with their flocks in every sort of interest . They are forced to do this by the social pressure of the dominant class outside of them . It may be that we can learn a lesson from them and be driven out of our studies to go among the people . We should become less bookish and more facile in dealing with common men . Dr. Dale has uttered a timely word . We doubtless ned it . The V 11th Lecture , upon " Evangelical preaching , " is , in our opinion , the best in the book . It comes closest to the point . It begins some way off on apologetic preaching and the relations of religion to science , but , before closing , deals with the deeply practical question of conversion . Dr. Dale in his lectures does not exhibit what might be called intuitional power ; or insight into the true philosophy of preaching , as a spiritual force fitted for the conversion of men ; but he sets forth the truth that means adapted to success should be employed in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the want which neither he nor the lecturers who have gone before him have fully met . As to the preliminary matter of Science and Religion , the keenest apologies for Revelation have come from this side of the water , while by far the ablest scientific attacks have sprung from the other side . Both parties now seem to be holding truce from mutual exhaustion , or , we might hope , new-born mutual respect . Now is the time for words of wise counsel . Dr. IDale is admirable in what he says here . He tells us that science has its own field and must keep to it . // " As soon as we enter into the sphere of moral freedom we ascend to heights which are beyond the wing and beyond the vision of scientific speculation ; for science knows of no laws which are not uniformly obeyed , and in morals we have to do with laws which we are free to obey or transgress . There is no reason , gentlemen , of being afraid that the splendid scientific triumphs of our time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will stand in the way of our work . The whole region of human nature to which we appeal science leaves quite untouched . " . . . " To attach weight to a many s views on the authenticity of the four gospels , or on any questions of religious truth and duty , because he is a distinguished geologist , chemist , or biologist , is just as preposterous as to attach weight to a man's views on geology because he is a profound theologian . ' On the other band , however , he tells us that religion also has its own field and must keep it . " As religious teachers you have absolutely no authority over questions lying within the province of science . At no point in the working out of any scientific problem have you-as religious teachers-any right to interfere . You have no right to ask for any consideration of the interests of religious faith in the settlemeat of any scientific question . " Here we see light . It is the light of common sense . There are two distinct and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfaction to have the English practical mind pronounce itself certainly in this matter . " You offer an equal insult to the integrity of scientific men when you betray any wish that in their scientific inquries they should be influenced by the way in which it is supposed that their conclusions might affect the authority of Divine revela. tion . It is a part of their religious duty to settle scientific questions on scientific grounds , and on scientific grounds only . For you to wish them to work under a bias , is the indication of a flaw in your intellectual honesty , and a decisive proof of a want of courage and firmness in your religious faith . " Truly this is refreshing . He goes on to say " To what extent it is our duty to discuss in the pulpit modern speculationspartly scientific , partly philosophical-which are hostile to the Christian Faith , is a question which every man must determine for himself . You must determine it by considering your own resources and the character of your congregation . If you touch controversies of this kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which you are attacking , and that you have mastered the grounds on which they rest . " What could be more sensible ! When a Yale theological student , who is here addressed , goes into the Peabody Museum as he ought to do , and looks into the microscope of the mineralogist who is exploring the heart of the most ancient rocks , the regions of creation before life was , and under the skillful guidance of the teacher catches glimpses of those hidden laws of // force which made the crystal and compressed the flashing light into the jewel ; when he goes to the case where may be seen the specimens of the successive periods through which the four-toed pre-historic horse came to have one hoof and aggrandized to his present size ; when he looks through the telescope of the Sheffield Observatory and finds amid the infinite spaces of the heavens what was an indistinct patch of light resolving itself into stars and perhaps worlds in the process of their formation , he ought riot to be disturbed by any preconceived theological theory , in receiving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Dr. Darwin , hasto impart to him regarding the laws of creation . He should be stimulated by the untiring energy of scientific men in their investigations , their martyr-like consecration to truth , to brace up the loins of his perchance loose-girded mind to more severe study and research-for , to meet such men with anything but equal weapons is to suffer defeat . At the same time when with malignant fires and engines of destruction the scientific host passes over into his sphere , and propounds theories confounding mind and matter , transmuting mental into physical forces , and proclaiming the doctrines of nescience and nihilism , then he has a right to diive them back in " hideous rout " to their own domain . The lecturer further on in this chapter , when treating of more spiritual themes , remarks : " Whether the opinion is sound which is held by very many persons just now that in nearly all cases it is the love of Christ that originates religious thought and life , seems to me very doubtfuL ' But we ask if Dr. Dale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be " originated " - by whatever just and terrible use of the law to arouse the consciousness of sin-that there is any doubt but that the love of Christ is the final power of salvation ? Does a man , according to the New Testament or Christian experience , enter the kingdom of heaven by any other door than faith in the love of God as manifested in Christ ? Must the sinner not heartily love the love that redeems him from the condemnation and power of sin , in order to become God 's child by faith ? In the same interesting chapter it is said : // " I know that to preach the Gospel so as to reach the hearts and consciences of men , we need a special gift of the Holy Ghost ; this gift we ought to seek in earnest prayer . I know , too , that preaching even of an apostle will he powerless apart from the direct action of the Spirit of God upon the souls of men . " This is a reverent confession . Sometimes , however , such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon preaching and into sermons themselves , as a word that must be said , as a kind of saving clause , while the whole drift is the other way . In the oft-quoted passage , " I have planted , Apollos watered , but God gave the increase , " the comment is made that of course it is God who gives the increase . This is a matter to be taken for granted . There is no need of dwelling upon an admitted truth like that , but the other portion of the verse , setting forth human agency , is the important one for us . Paul and Apollos must do their husbandry faithfully and with diligence as means to an end , and God wilibless the means . That is true ; but where is the stress of the passage ? It is in this , that man , whatever he may do , is as nothing , but the converting power is God . " Who then is Paul , and who is Apollos , but ministers by whom ye believed* even as the Lord gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sets forth the place of ministers , and the work of preaching in its great end of conversion , better than this . They are but instruments in God 's hands . God is the originating and renewing energy . With him is the power , with him is the life . Preachers are to preach in a supreme faith on the power of that Divine Spirit who is able to produce new and holy life in the soul . " The wisdom of this world is foolishness with God . " Preachers must enter into the very will of God , and work in and with that will ; and here is the divine philosophy of their success . It is a spiritual work . While every intellectual faculty , every skill , every acquisition - logic , sound learning , eloquence , imagi nation , persuasionought to be employed ( a sermon should abound as did Baxter 's sermons in reasons and motives ) and all have their use , yet it were vain to depend upon these for the conversion of a single soul ; it were vain to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will produce the result , without the just humility of faith in a divine creative energy , without the constant and expectant guidance of the Spirit in his own spiritual work , and a practical looking to Him for success in it ; even as the farmer // knows that his agency consists in ploughing the ground and sowing the seed , but the Lord makes the harvest . There is everything in having a conception and met ? iod of preaching that is Scripturally true and that takes into it the right factors of success-that takes God into it . The writer of this Article has long been exercised on this question of conversion in a practical rather than strictly theological point of view , and is glad that Dr. IDale has referred to it ; it may bring back to profounder ideas of preaching and to primitive apostolic methods . This is a subject of infinitely more importance than style , or rhetoric , or the composition of sermons . Where is the power of a new life and righteousness in the sinful souls of men ? What is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the stultification of my moral freedom . I am free to choos* , or to reject , eternal salvation . It is held out to me in Christ , will I grasp it or lose it ? Man can not wait passively for God to convert him , as if he had no manner of power of his own , and in this event no kind of responsibility . He is exhorted , nay commanded , to repent , to believe , to seek Christ , and enter by storm his heavenly kingdom . The theology of passivity is the theology of stupidity and death ; the theology of freedom is the theology of the world 's regeneration . Thank God we are Christians and not Turks in this . Yet , on the other hand , nothing can be done without God 's presence , aid , and power . " Without me ye can do nothing . " Faith itself is " the gift of God . " " It is not of him that willeth , but of God that showeth mercy . " " Ye must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the will of the flesh , nor of the will of man , but of God . " It is a matter of universal consciousness that our mere human resolution , or will , broken in an hour , is not enough for the great act of conversion which changes character and destiny-that " in us , that is in our sinful flesh , dwelleth no good thing " - that life , physical and spiritual , is from God , and that new , holy life can not be self-originated in a nature dead in sin . We feel that in so great a thing as conversion , there must be power from outside , from a creative and divine source . Therefore we are not inclined , as some are , to say to the sinner " You can be a Christian as easily as you can turn over your hand-you have but to will to be one and you are one . You // can join the kingdom of heaven as readily as you can join a debating-club-it depends entirely upon yourself . " While a free , self-determining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , yet on account of our weakened and sinful condition , the Holy Spirit , who is also the Spirit of Christ , or Christ himself present and working , is everywhere in the world seeking to aid our spiritual welfare . Preachers are the media of this Spirit seeking to save men . In varied and hidden ways Christ is always pleading with men , attracting , drawing them to a higher life . He is the light that lighteth every man . He strives in every soul ; he forgets none ; and in times of religious awakening , he is seeking men with extraordinary energy and directness . He actually is the One who convinces men of sin , of righteousness and of judgment , and brings home to the heart the truth , the preached truth , with converting power , awakening in the sinful heart the new disposition to listen to the truth and obey it . Therefore the Holy Spirit is primary in conversion , and whenever the human soul responds willingly and freely to this call of Christ , acknowledges its sin and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saviour from sin-whenever the finite will is changed by , and voluntarily adopts as its own , the will of the Infinite , then " the union-point is reached , and man turns to God and lives . " It is no trivial and common crisis . It is the turning point of the life of the soul-God and man are involved in it . The influence of the Holy Spirit is felt imperially and supremely in it . Then ( as in Mr. Moody 's revival and inquiry meetings ) even a nod of the head may be enough , because this denotes the inward yielding of the human to the divine will . This therefore is my philosophy of conversion as far as I have been able to arrive at one , that God works in man and man with God ; that God draws and man obeys the attraction ; that actual conversion consists in the consentaneous and free action of both the divine and the human wills in the moment of the change . There can be no fear that so long as these great questions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wherein it becomes assimilated with the divine , stir men , that the power of the preacher of truth will wane . Men may say that they prefer to stay at // home on Sunday and read the best thoughts of the best minds on religion , and that they can select for themselves what is best , but when a preacher of power , a man " filled with the Holy Ghost , " arises , they must hear him . It is not in the profoundness of his thought , nor in his intellectual force , that he draws them , it is the divine power that speaks through him , it is the living impulse of will , of love , of personal and spiritual influence directed and made use of by the Spirit of God , which goes forth from him and his message-which no book ever had . How great and glorious is the work of the true preacher of Christ ! He should work for the highest and largest success because he thus works " more in fire than in frost . " He wields @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He has hope in the inexhaustible powers of the Gospel , which is the love of God to sinners ; and he will not give way to a faithless despair for any soul , nor be like the unbelieving stewards of God 's word whom Dr. South ( though he himself is hardly to be called an evangelical preacher ) describes , as " those inexorable spiritual Catos , those parsimonious dispensers of mercy ; perhaps out of fear , upon the knowledge of their own wickedness , lest there should not be mercy enough for themselves . " There are many excellent and wise words in these lectures upon which we have thus briefly commented , which we should like to have noticed . Their style , if indeed it be not characterized by what the Germans call " inwardness , " yet it is objectively clear and oftentimes strikingly beautiful ; it is English instead of German ; it is practical , robust , cultured , and serviceable . The honored lecturer may be assured that he left the green shores and misty skies of England and came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England .
