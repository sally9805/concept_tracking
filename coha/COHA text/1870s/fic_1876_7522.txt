Gilder , Richard Watson , 1844-1909 : AT THE PLAY . ( SALVINI. ) from The new day ( 1876 ) I saw Othello crouch across the stage With quick , hot breaths , arched neck , and eyes all white , And fingers curved to claws before my sight ; I heard his sob and scream of brutal rage , When , like a tiger leaping from a ledge Upon his prey , quick as a flash of light He leaped on Iago : then in shivering fright I saw him cower , as against the cage A tiger springs , then cowers tremulous . So sits my soul apart ,  --  as I do here , Beholding Shakespeare 's thought before me move ,  --  Calm doth my soul behold my passion thus Beat vainly ' gainst expression . Voice nor tear Can tell the wild , great agony of my love . Gilder , Richard Watson , 1844-1909 : " THERE WAS JOY IN ALL . " from The new day ( 1876 ) There was joy in all , but I might not win @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wood , On fair green grass that the sun made white ; Beyond the river the mountain stood ,  --  Blue was the mountain , the river was bright : I looked on the land and it was not good ; I loved not the land , for thou wert not in it .
