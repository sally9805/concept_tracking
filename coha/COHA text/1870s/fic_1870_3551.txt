One of Mrs. Allen 's bay windows stood open . Between the ivies , tuberoses , and lilies , you caught a glimpse of gilded walls and rare paintings . Better than all , you saw four young faces looking out at a snow-storm ; Dotty with eyes like living diamonds , Prudy fair and sweet , Horace lordly and wise ; and the little one " with dove 's eyes " following every motion of his head , as if she were a sunflower , and he the sun . " Please shut the window , quick , Horace ; the plants will freeze , " said Prudy , drawing in her powdered head . " Things do n't freeze in cloudy weather , Prue ; but you children will catch cold ; so here goes . " " O , Hollis , do n't those snow-specks look like little bits o ' birdies , athout any wings or any feathers , too ? " " Droll birds they would be , " said Aunt Madge . " That reminds me of an old riddle , children , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Lit on the castle wall ; Came a knight breathless , Ate it up toothless , Rode away horseless . ' " " Why , auntie , the ' bird featherless ' must have been the snow ; but who was the knight ! " " Who rides over the sky without any horse , Dotty , and melts snow by shining on it ? " " O , the sun -- the sun ! " " Hollis , I want to ask you sumpin . Does those snow-specks fly down out o ' heaven ? Does the little angels see ' em ? " " No , Topknot ; they only come from the clouds ; they are nowhere near up to the little angels . " " Not half so near as you are , Goldilocks , " said Aunt Madge , brushing back the child 's soft hair . " I hope you do n't mean Fly 's going to die , " cried Dotty , in sudden alarm , remembering how crossly she had spoken to the child two or three times since they had been in New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we are told , in the Bible , there are ' ministering spirits , ' and we believe they watch over good little children . " " O , my shole ! " said Fly , folding her tiny hands , and raising her eyes to the top of the window . " Nice , pretty little spirricks out there , only but I ca n't see ' em . " " No , Miss Eyebright ; not even you . Wait till you go where they live . " " Wisht I could go up there now , a-visiting ; stay all night , and three weeks and then --  " " Hush , Fly Clifford ; you 're the wickedest girl to talk , " said Dotty . " I should n't ever expect to go to heaven at all , if I said such things as you do.  - -  O , auntie , I am so sorry it storms ! Maria and her mother wo n't come -- will they ? " Maria Brooks was a little blind girl with whom the family were just making acquaintance . A few days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her " freckled doggie , " Fly , lost on the street , had spied her , and been attracted by the dog , and Maria had persuaded the child to go home with her . Afterwards Mrs. Brooks had taken Fly back to Colonel Allen 's ; and in this way Aunt Madge had learned about Maria 's blindness , and had offered to take her to a physician who could help her , if any one could . " Yes , Dotty ; I presume they will come to-day , for Maria can hardly wait to have the doctor look at her eyes . " " Of course they 'll come , " said Horace ; " who ever heard of brooks minding the weather ? Rain water agrees with ' em . " " If you please , Mrs. Allen , " said Nathaniel , appearing at the door , " I --  " " O , they 've come -- have they , Nat ? " asked Horace . Horace was already well acquainted with the waiting man , and called him Nat , though he was a very sober @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as stiff as a cactus . Nat only replied by handing Mrs. Allen a letter , with a hesitating air , as if he would much rather not do it . " A despatch ! " cried Mrs. Allen , turning rather pale . Dotty Dimple and Flyaway crowded close to her , and overwhelmed her with questions . " O , what is it ? " said one . " Who wroted it ? And why did n't Hollis bring the camphor bottle athout my asking ? " said the other . But the older children knew better than to speak just then . As soon as Mrs. Allen could get her breath , she said ,  --  " Do n't be frightened , dears . It is only a message from your Uncle Augustus . He ca n't come home to-night , as we expected . He says , ' One of my old attacks . Nothing serious . Can you come ? ' " " O , is that all ? " said Dotty , and ceased fanning her auntie with a book-cover . " O , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off patting her cheek with a pencil . " But , children , " said Horace , " do n't you understand Uncle Augustus is sick -- wants auntie to go and take care of him ? " " Why , he ca n't have her . " " Indeed , Miss Dot , and why not ? " " She 's got company , you know . " " There , little sister ! I would n't think that of you ? Poor Uncle Augustus ! " " But he says he is n't serious , " said Dotty , looking ashamed . " Auntie , you do n't think he 's serious -- do you ? " " No , dear ; he 's suffering very much , but I am not in the least alarmed . He has had just such attacks as this ever since he came out of the army . He is at a hotel in Trenton , New Jersey , and needs some one to wait upon him , who knows just what to do . I am very sorry to go and leave my company , Dotty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go , " cried Dotty . " I dislike particularly not to be polite . " " O , auntie , you will be ' tic'ly polite , " cried little Echo . " Please let me go , too ; I wo n't make no noise . " " How long do you think you 'll have to stay , auntie ? " said Prudy . " I can not tell , dear . These attacks are usually short , and I think quite likely your uncle can come home to-morrow night ; but he may not be able till next day . " " How he 'll feel if he ca n't be here to Christmas ! " said Dotty ; " and so much greens and things in the windows ! " " Yes ; and how we shall both feel to know our little friends are keeping house by themselves ! " " Keeping house ? O , may we keep house ! " exclaimed Prudy , her eyes suddenly brightening . " Why , yes , my child ; you may be the lady of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Horace the lord . " " But may I cook the dinners , and not ask Mrs. Fixfax ? Because I really do know a great deal , Aunt Madge . You 'd be surprised ! I can cook cake , and pie , and biscuit , and three kinds of pudding . Please , this once , let me manage things just as I want to . " " Just as we want , you mean , " said Dotty . " I can make gingerbread as well as you can . " " And I shaked a table-cloth once , " put in the youngest . " Only I sha n't be here if my auntie tookens me off . " " Yes , auntie , " said Horace ; " let the girls manage . They 'll get up queer messes , but ' twill be good fun . " " Do you believe it ? " said auntie , thoughtfully . And there entered her brain , at that moment , a singular scheme , which , to almost any other woman , would have seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a failure . I 've a great mind to make an arrangement with Mrs. Fixfax to have them keep house in her room . " ( Mrs. Fixfax was Mrs. Allen 's housekeeper . ) " The novelty will amuse them . Of course they will waste flour and sugar , but not very much , probably , and Mrs. Fixfax will be on the watch to see that they do n't get too hungry . It will tax her severely , but I can pay her for her trouble . Really , the more I think of it , the more I 'm inclined to try it . They say I 'm foolishly indulgent to children . Perhaps so ; but I do want them happy when they come to my house visiting . " " Have you thinked it all up ? " asked Fly , peeping into her auntie 's face ; " I wo n't ' sturb Uncle ' Gustus . " " Yes , chickie ; I 've thinked of talking to Mrs. Fixfax about letting you all keep house ; that is , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Trouble ? " said Prudy ; " why , I should think it would be a real help , auntie . She has so much care , you know . And if I got the meals for us four , the cook could rest , too . " Aunt Madge only smiled at this . There were five servants in all : John , the coachman ; Nat , the waiting-man ; Mrs. Fixfax , the housekeeper ; Rachel Fixfax , the chambermaid ; and Patty Diggles , the cook . They were all remarkably faithful , except pretty Rachel , the housekeeper 's daughter , who was rather gay and flighty , and had been something of a trial to her mistress . Aunt Maude went into the kitchen dressed for her journey . Mrs. Fixfax had just returned from market , and was talking with the cook about the dinner . " That is a fine plump turkey , " said Mrs. Allen ; " I wish I were to help eat it ; but I came to tell you , Mrs. Fixfax , that Colonel Allen is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and leave you with the care of these children . " The housekeeper , who was a fat , comfortable-looking woman , twice as large as her mistress , said , " Indeed , mum ! " hoped Colonel Allen " was n't sick to speak of , " and shook her broad sides with laughter at the idea of taking care of Fly . " I 'll give up going to church to-morrow , mum ; for , light as the child is , I can but feel as if you was sitting a ton 's weight on my shoulders . And I promise to keep her alive if the Lord 's willing . " " You will hardly be obliged to give up your whole time Mrs. Fixfax . I shall absolutely forbid her going out of the house , unless you , or some other grown-up person , has charge of her . And really , with John , Nathaniel , and Patty to keep guard , I do n't see what mischief can befall the little creature . " " We 'll all do our best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I have perfect faith that you will . There is one more favor to ask . These children have had a strange visit thus far , and if I go away and leave them , I fear they will feel rather forlorn . Can you consent to let the little girls ' keep house , ' as they call it ? That is , cook their own meals , and set their own table ? " The cook , who was stuffing the turkey was so surprised that she spilled a handful of sage over her apron . She would not have dared say the words , but her thoughts ran like this : " Pretty doings , indeed ! What does Mrs. Allen mean by letting children come into the kitchen to bother me ? " But Aunt Madge had not finished speaking . " Mrs. Fixfax , there is a little old cooking-stove in the attic . Do n't you remember you had it in your room when you were nursing Rachel through that fever ? " " O , yes 'm , so I had ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if you say so , " said the obliging housekeeper ; " and I 'll carry up flour and sugar , and what not , and move out my own things , so the children can have the room pretty much to themselves . " " No need of that , Mrs. Fixfax , " spoke up the cook , very pleasantly . " Let ' em come right into the kitchen . I should admire to see ' em enjoy themselves . " Patty Diggles was a singular woman . She was always full of polite speeches , just a minute too late . " Thank you , Patty ; but I think the children may feel more at home in Mrs. Fixfax 's room , with no one to watch them . And now , good bye . I hope to come back to-morrow . " Mrs. Fixfax left the kitchen to find Nathaniel , and get him to help her move the stove . As soon as the business was over , Nathaniel came into the kitchen , and held up his sooty hands for Patty to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Some folks know how to feather their own nests , " said she . " Why , what have I done now , Patty ? " " Not you , but Mrs. Fixfax ; she 's going to wait and tend on those children , and of course she 'll get a splendid present for it . I should admire to have the little dears round me in the kitchen ; but she spoke up , and took the words right out of my mouth . " The young man laughed in his sleeves , as he turned them back to wash his hands . He took care not to express his mind , however . He had a few fixed ideas . One was , that Mrs. Allen could do no wrong ; and another was , that he must never bandy words with Patty Diggles , because Mrs. Allen had strictly forbidden it . CHAPTER II . PRIDE AND ORANGES . While Mrs. Fixfax was making her room ready for the little housekeepers , Aunt Madge went to her own chamber , and locked up her best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her with some curiosity . " Are you afraid of burgalers , auntie ? " asked Dotty . " Because , if you are , we sha n't dare stay here . " " No , Dotty . I only thought , if you should play keep house , it might be rather amusing to come in here , and dress up in some of my old finery . You are welcome to whatever you can find , for I have locked up all that is worth much . " " O , you darling auntie , wo n't that be splendid ? Now we sha n't feel half so sorry about your going away . " " Sorry ! " said Mrs. Allen , with a mischievous smile . " You are so delighted you do n't know what to do . " " There , auntie , that is n't fair , " laughed Prudy , " when we 've been trying our best to cry . But somehow , how can we , when Uncle Augustus is n't very sick , and you 're coming right back ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at that ruffled pillow-case , and thinking what a splendid cap it would make for an old lady , tied down with black ribbon ! " " A pretty uproar we shall find when we get back , Miss Prudy ; but I am prepared for that . Only promise one thing -- keep that baby in the house . Flyaway , darling , will you remember not to go out of doors ? " " Yes , um , I 'll ' member , " replied Fly , winking her eyes solemnly . She had expected , till the last minute , to go with her auntie . " There is one thing I regret . If Mrs. Brooks and Maria come , they will be very much disappointed . Tell them I 'll try to attend to them the day but one after Christmas . And now , good by , children . You know you 're as dear to me as the apple of my eye . Do take good care of yourselves , and be good . " " The apple of your eye appears to be split in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the strength of that joke , Mrs. Allen started on her journey to Trenton . " Now I suppose I 'm to be the head of the family , " said Prudy , with a majestic air . " We are the two heads , if you please , mum , " said Horace , striking an attitude . " What am I , then ? " asked Dotty . " You ? The foot . You must run and tend . " " H 'm ! " " What am I ? " asked Fly . " Why , the little finger , pet . All you have to do is to curl up in one corner . " " H 'm ! " responded Fly , looking at Dotty 's solemn face , and trying to draw her own down to exactly the same length . " Pretty well , I should think , " said Dotty , as soon as her injured feelings would allow her to speak . " What have I done to be put down to the bottom of the foot ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to manage a house ; and I am older than you . " " But you ca n't make a bit better gingerbread , Prudy Parlin ! If I 've got to be your hired girl , I wo n't play . " " So I would n't , " said Horace . " I 'd show ' em what I thought of such actions . " Upon this there was a little whirlwind , which spun Dotty out of the room before you could count two . " They stand very high in their own self-esteem . He 's a hero , she a hero-ess ! They think I like to be laughed at . She said it only took one woman to manage a house ; but she never made any fuss when Horace spoke up , and wanted to help . It 's me that ca n't manage -- just because it 's me . Who wants Horace for the head of the family ? He do n't know more'n the head of a pin ! When 'd ever he make ginger-bread ? " By this time Dotty had reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prudy would n't ' low three heads to it , I s'pose ? O , no ; for then I could be one ! If I was a great boy , with a silver watch , that was n't her own sister , she 'd let me ! Yes , if I had five heads , she would n't have said a word . " Dotty paced the floor restlessly , with her hands behind her . " I sha n't go back . Let ' em keep their old house . I can keep house my own self up in this room -- wish I 'd brought Fly -- she 's too good for ' em . Wish I had n't come to New York to be imposed upon . " As Dotty was crossing and recrossing the room , her eye fell on one of the illuminated cards on the wall , printed in red and gold , and wreathed with delicate lilies of the valley --  " God resisteth the proud , but giveth grace to the humble . " The angry child stopped short . " Who put that there ? What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . I would n't have thought that of auntie . " Dotty turned away ; but the words followed her across the room like the eyes of a portrait . " ' God resisteth the proud . ' Well , who said I was proud ? People are so queer ! Always think it 's me wants the best things . ' Giveth grace to the humble . ' There , I s'pose that means Prudy . She 's just as humble ! Never wants to take the best parts when we play . O , no ; Prudy 's humble ? Prudy 's a hero-ess ! ' " But scold as she might , those burning red words were looking right down into Dotty 's soul . Though she shut her eyes , there they were still . " ' God resisteth the proud . ' Am I proud ?  - -  Yes . Does God resisteth me ?  - -  Yes , for the Bible ca n't lie . What is resisteth ? Something that makes you feel bad , prob'ly . That 's why I ca n't be happy . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast , set her teeth together , pinched her neck , and swallowed . " There , it 's going down my throat like a pill ,  - -  its gone ! Am I proud any more ? No -- for I really do n't s'pose I can make gingerbread quite so well as Prudy ! I never made any but once , and then Norah took it out of the oven and put in the ginger and molasses . No , I 'm not proud . I do n't want to keep house . I should n't know how . It would be very much better to go back and behave , for I ca n't stay here without being lonesome . " Dotty looked again at the red and gold text . " How different it seems to me now I 'm humble ! People need n't be proud if they 'd swallow it down like a pill . " Dotty 's reasoning was rather mixed ; still it is worthy of notice , that she was doing a remarkable thing for her , as she slowly walked back to her auntie 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been suffering . She could never bear to have her young sister angry , and , if it had not been for Horace , would have gone to her with all sorts of promises -- anything for peace . " She 's an outrageous little tyrant , Prue . She ought to have a sound whipping . " " O , Horace , " said Prudy , quite shocked ; " she ca n't help her temper ; she has to be humored . " " Poh ! that 's just what ails her ! Been humored to death . " " But , Horace , ca n't we change our play , somehow ? It never will do for me to try to order her about . " " Nonsense , Prue ! But if you 're going to be so fussy , you might keep boarding-house , and have her for lady boarder . " Prudy 's brow cleared . " Just what 'll suit her , Horace ! A lady boarder is so fashionable ,  - -  like the one they had at Mrs. Penny 's ,  - -  always washing out laces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then Miss Dimple appeared at the door with an uncertain smile . " I -- I -- thought --  " " O , how kind of you to come back to us , my Lady Magnifico ! " cried Horace , bowing himself double . " Your landlady was afraid you objected to your boarding-place . " " You see , " said Prudy , eagerly , " we are making believe I keep boarders . I 've ' seen better days , ' or something of that kind , as they say in story-books -- O , seems to me my husband died . " " Yes ; I saw his death in the papers , " said Dotty , briskly ; " so you do n't want me for your hired girl -- do you ? " Then she thought , " How glad I am I came back ! It 's always better to be humble ! " and added aloud , with a fine-lady drawl ,  --  " No , mim ; it 's not the style I 've been subject to . I was necessiated to leave you , mim , because I ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That sounds so like Mrs. Pitkin Smith ! " said Prudy , laughing . " She used to board at Mrs. Penny 's , Horace . Come , let 's go and dress in our costumes . I 'll be Mother Hubbard ; and Horace , you go into uncle 's dressing-room and see what you can find . " Illustration : Little Miss Fly . CHAPTER III . BORROWED JEWELS . " Of course I must take the best things , " said Dotty ; " for I 'm to have the best part . " So she chose a blue poplin dress , a pink sash , a scarlet bow , and a green pin . The dress was half a yard too long , and she caught it up in front with some artificial flowers she found in a box . Her head she surmounted with an old chignon , which bobbed back and forth , as she walked , like a pedler 's pack . " O , see , Prudy , " said she ; " here is auntie 's jewel cabinet . What cunning little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't touch it , Dotty . I saw auntie look it up in her safe once ; but I suppose she took it out again to get her watch . " " No , she did n't ; here 's her watch , " said Dotty , swinging open one of the little drawers . " That 's her other watch , Dotty . She says it needs mending . " " Then I 'm going to wear it ; it is just as good for a lady boarder , as a whole one . " " Do n't , Dotty ; that 's the watch Uncle Augustus gave her when they were married , and she thinks the world of it . " " Well , he gave her the other one too -- did n't he ? " " Yes ; last Christmas : do n't you know how she found it in an orange ? " " O , I remember . And she ought to think the most of that one , Prudy , because she loves him better now than she did when he gave her this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's of no consequence to you if she does , or if she does n't , Dotty Dimple . What right have you with that cabinet , I should like to know ? Shut it right up this minute . O please do , Dotty . " Dotty 's contrary spirit began to rise . She opened every one of the drawers , and poured out the glittering jewels . Of course Fly was on the spot in a twinkling ; but Prudy caught her , and playfully pinned her little arms down to her sides ; so her prying fingers had no chance to do mischief . " Did n't auntie tell us to dress up in her old finery ? " said Dotty , thrusting the watch into her girdle . " Old finery , Dotty Dimple ! " " And is n't this old ? ' You 're welcome to whatever you can find ; ' that was just the words she said , Prudy Parlin . " " O , how many ways there are for people to do wrong if they want to ! " cried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started , Dotty -- Will you , or will you not , put up those things ? If you do n't , it 's my duty to call Horace , and --  " " ' Fore I 'd be a tell-tale ! " said Dotty , slipping off half a dozen rings in haste . " There , I wo n't wear but just two -- one on each thumb . Who wants the old watch ? Tick 's all out of it . You do n't know , Prudy , how tight those rings fit . I could wear ' em on my forefinger , but I sha n't , you make such a fuss . " Prudy answered by a look of unutterable contempt . " I suppose , " said she , speaking with a vehemence quite unusual to her --  " I suppose you know auntie 's jewels are worth more money than father has in the world ! If you lose one of them , I do n't know who 's going to pay for it ; that 's all . " Dotty looked amazed , but answered coolly ,  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as nice things as the governor 's wife . " She was sure she was very humble , since swallowing her pride like a pill ; but somehow she was determined not to take off those rings . " Prudy need n't speak so sharp to me ! I did n't care about wearing ' em in the first place ; but now I 'll do it to show her what 's the use to preach ! " Prudy , having done her duty , said no more , but proceeded to look over her auntie 's wardrobe in search of a dress . " I s'pose she thinks I 'm the awfulest girl , " mused Dotty , fluttering in and out of the closet . " I s'pose she 's thinking about that rag-bag last summer -- how Jennie Vance no business to take those three dollars out of the saddle-bag pockets ! Grandma said , ' You 're welcome to all you can find . ' Well , but that did n't mean for Jennie to steal ! Prudy need n't go to thinking this is the same kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stealing is pretty different from borrowing . " Dotty viewed herself in the glass with secret satisfaction . She really looked like a Fourth of July fantastic ; but we do not see ourselves as others see us . " She wo n't be the least help to me about the house , " thought Prudy , with a feeling of envy . " I shall have every single thing to do ; and I declare I do n't know what to get for dinner . " She chose the worst looking wrapper her aunt 's wardrobe afforded , and a gingham apron with pockets . Quite good enough for a woman keeping house without a servant . And as she had decided to call herself Mother Hubbard , she made an ample cap , by folding a " pillow-sham , " and putting two of its ruffled edges around her face for a double border . Then , with green spectacles at her nose , a bunch of keys at her waist , and a pair of high-heeled slippers on her feet , she went to the door , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't she in there ? " responded Horace , appearing on the landing , " You did n't think I had her with me -- did you ? " As Prudy wisely remarked , " How many ways there are for people to do wrong if they want to ! " Seeing her betters disagree , little Fly had taken her turn at pouting . " They do n't say nuffin ' ' bout fixin ' me up . Goin ' to let me go to the party in my old clo'es ? Wisht auntie 'd tookened me with her . Might just 's well not ! Might a ' worn soft slippers , and not ' sturbed Uncle ' Gustus ! " Fly wafted herself to the top of the bureau , and gazed down on the girls in stern displeasure . But she might as well have scowled at empty air , for no notice was taken of her . Dotty was giving an extra touch to her chignon , and Prudy trying on her cap . " Hark ! What 's that ? " It was the street-cry away off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guess I 'll go see what 's the matter with that man , " thought Miss Fly . " Guess he 's got hurted . " She slid down from the bureau , and stole softly out of the room backward ; but her feet made no more sound on the carpet than the fall of a rose-leaf , and neither of the girls looked up . " For course I sha n't go ou'doors , ' cause I solomon promised I would n't , " said she , pattering down the basement stairs . The fact was , she had no idea any one would let her go . But it so happened that thoughtless Rachel was the one who unlocked the basement door , and it was an easy thing to slip out behind her . " ' Cause I spect she 'll send me ri ' back . " But when Rachel looked around , and saw the pretty child with her fair hair blowing wild , she only laughed and went on gossiping with the orange boy . She saw no harm in letting Fly hop about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself felt chilled by the keen wind ; then she drew the little girl into the house , and shut the door against the snow-storm , saying ,  --  " Why , how happened you out here , little Miss Fly ? " " She sawed me the whole time ; she ought to sended me in , " thought Fly , dancing up and down to shake off the snow . " Twas n't me was naughty ; ' t was the rest the folks . They did n't pay no ' tention where I went to . " But though she pretended to herself that she had done no wrong , she did not wish to be found out , and crept very softly up stairs , even as far as the cupola , and looked out of the windows with all her might . " Cold room up here , athout no fire , " thought she , by and by , with a shiver ; and just then she heard the girls calling . " Here I is , " a voice replied , far up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You have n't been ' up attic ' all this time , Topknot ? " " Well , you ought to paid ' tention where I 's going to , " returned Fly , sharply . " Nobody knows what I 'll do next -- auntie said there did n't ! " Horace laughed . " Come , fix her up , girls ; she 's my baby . " " I thought you were the ' Man in the Moon , ' " said Mother Hubbard , " and he is n't married . " " I 've been a widower some time , " sighed Horace , laying his hand on the left pocket of his blue swallow-tail coat . His costume was as droll as the girls ' ; for Uncle Augustus , who had figured the week before in some private tableaux , had a full Brother Jonathan suit . " The man in the Moon , if you please , Mother Hubbard , come down to inquire the way to Norridge . " " Ah ! I 'm afraid you 've ' come down too soon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rubbed his upper lip thoughtfully . " Will you inform me , ma'am , where I can get a boarding-place ? I 'm sort of turned round . Growing place . Last time I was down , there were only a few houses here ; now it 's pretty thick settled back of the meeting-house . " " I 'll take you , " said Mother Hubbard , putting her handkerchief to her face . " How would my dog feel if he knew I had come to this ! " " Come to what , ma'am ? " " Why , to New York , to take boarders . " " Are you in indigenous circumstances , madam ? And have you seen the first society ? If so , I may possibly conclude to come too , " said Dotty , sweeping forward , and losing a hair-pin out of her chignon . " O , what a fascinating creature ! " said the Man in the Moon , making an eye-glass of his thumb and forefinger , and gazing at the lady boarder . " Are you a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't say nuffin ' ' bout fixin ' me up ! Guess I sha n't go to the party ! " exclaimed Fly , opening and closing her eyes in token of outraged dignity . Prudy took her into auntie 's room , and proceeded at once to robe her in her own night-dress , with a lace night-cap , and a cologne-mat for a bib . " Hollis did n't say for me to be such a long baby , " sniffled Fly , trying in vain to clear her feet from the trailing skirt . " This is your slip , dear . You 're only a baby -- mus n't try to walk . " " Then my papa must carry me down stairs , " said Fly , entering into the spirit of the play . " You tell him so -- I ca n't tell him , for I ca n't talk . Argoo-goo . My teeth have n't camed . " " If you please , Master Clifford , " said Nathaniel , appearing at the head of the stairs . Then he stopped short with surprise , hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too dignified to laugh aloud , added , with a grim smile ,  --  " The woman that brought Miss Fly home the other day is down in the dining-room , and says , ' Can she see one of the family ? ' " " A little girl with her , Nat ? " " Yes , sir ; the blind girl is with her . " " And the freckled doggie ! " asked " the long baby , " suddenly raising her head from her father 's shoulder . " I meant to told ' em to bringed that doggie . " " Let 's all go down and see , " said Mother Hubbard . When they entered the dining-room , Mrs. Brooks started up in dismay . She had left her sick husband , and come a long distance through the storm , only to find Mrs. Allen gone , and a parcel of children decked out like circus-riders . It seemed like a cruel mockery . " Beg pardon , " said she . " Maria , we 'll go home now . " Maria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tears which would find their way through her closed eyes . " You poor dear girl , " said Mother Hubbard , going up to her , and taking her hand . " My auntie was so sorry to go off to-day , just when you were coming ! but she had to , for Uncle Augustus is sick . And it looks funny to you -- I mean to your mother -- to see us dressed up this way ; but auntie said we might , just to keep us from being so lonesome . And Mrs. Brooks , she wants you to call again the day after the day after to-morrow . She thinks she 'll be home then . " " Yes 'm , " struck in my Lady Magnifico ! " She thinks she 'll come then with Uncle ' Gustus . He is n't much sick . If he was going to die , we would n't dress up so , certainly . " " No , " replied Mrs. Brooks , smiling . " It 's just as well ; my Maria must have patience ; that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " have n't I had it , and had it ?  - -  But I do suppose God will attend to me when He thinks best . Is this what they call waiting on the Lord ? " " When you come nex ' time , I hope you 'll bring that doggie , " said Fly . Then they went away , and the last thing Maria listened to was Fly 's melodious voice ; and the last thing Fly looked at was Mrs. Brooks 's nose moving up and down . CHAPTER IV . GOING TO HOUSEKEEPING . It was nearly noon before Mrs. Fixfax had made her room ready for housekeeping . She turned up her bed into a press that stood beside the wall , brought in a high chair , a small rocking chair , two ottomans , some pictures and picture-books , and nearly all the curiosities she could find in the house . A cunning little cooking-stove , highly polished , was set against the chimney , and the drollest shovel and tongs seemed to be making " dumb love " to each other across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was a pair of brazen-faced bellows , hanging , nose downward , on a brass nail ; a large table in one corner , with a cake-board on it , and near it a cupboard made out of an old clothes-press , with dishes in it , and flour , sugar , raisins , spices , rolling-pin , " aerating egg-beater , " yellow bowls , wooden spoons , and everything that could be needed in cooking for a very large family . There were five rugs spread on the carpet , and a large oilcloth under the stove . Last , but not least , Mrs. Fixfax brought Mrs. Allen 's tortoise-shell cat , and set her in a stuffed chair by the west window . Then she called the children ; and Mother Hubbard and Lady Magnifico rushed in , followed by the Man in the Moon and his baby . " Good morning , all ; I hope I see you well , " said Mrs. Fixfax , as sober as Nathaniel himself . " This room is yours as long as you like . Make yourselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much , " replied Mother Hubbard , bobbing her head , while the " pillow-sham " ruffles waved this way and that , like a field of ripe grain . " Whenever you want anything , just ring this bell , and I will come ; or , if you ring the other one , it will bring Rachel . And , Miss Prudy , here is the ' Young Housekeeper 's Friend ; ' perhaps you would like to look it over . " Mother Hubbard blushed to her cap-border , and took the book with another " Thank you ever so much , " but did not know what else to say to such a dignified woman . The truth was , Mrs. Fixfax was trying so hard to keep from laughing , that her manner was rather stiff and cold . " I have left the ventilator open , " thought she . " The children are full of talk , and I do n't want to lose a word . Besides , Mrs. Allen would consider it safer for me to know all that 's going on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Lady Magnifico , as Mrs. Fixfax 's stately form disappeared . " She is n't as pretty as the new Miss Fixfix . ' Spect she 's got the toothache , " suggested the talking infant , who was trying to lie and coo on a rug , but was unable to do it . " Well said , little Toddle ; false toothache , hey ? " " Are they false , Mr. Moony ? Then that was why she puckered up her lips so funny , " said Mother Hubbard ; " it was to keep ' em in ! " " Yes ; and take her , teeth and all , her face has about as much expression as a platter of cold hash . I 'll leave it to you if it has n't , Prue . " " Why , there , Miss Fixfix never asked me to kiss her one time , " said Fly , with sudden astonishment . " Reckon you 'd have wanted a lump of sugar after it , Topknot . " The good-natured housekeeper shook with laughter as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What a terrible creature this Miss Fixfix is ! " thought she . " Well , if they 've got such an idea of me , I wo n't try to change it . Not for the rest of the day , at any rate . I 'll keep my distance , and let ' em work . " Mother Hubbard began to look about her with the mien of a housekeeper . " Let us see : what are we burning here ? " said she , taking off a stove-cover . " Wood , I declare . Mrs. Fixfax is afraid I could n't manage coal ! " " And here 's a ' normous big box full of sticks , " said Lady Magnifico . " I did n't s'pose wood grew in New York . What now , Mr. Moon ? Do n't I know wood is sawed out of trees ? Well , what you laughing at , then ? " " Laughing , my lady ? Why , who can help it , to see such a jolly room , big enough to hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Wonder if Mother Hubbard notices it 's just going to strike twelve ? " Prudy looked up , but did not take the hint . " I 'm so glad I remembered to bring that clock . I always used to tell my dog I prized it as much as he did his dear little tail.  - -  Why , what 's burning ? That child has scorched her slip . Do take care of her , Mr. -- what may I call you ?  - -  while I look over this cupboard . " " Call me Dr. Moonshine , if you want to . " " I 'm glad I was so thoughtful as to order sugar , " continued the landlady . " It 's excellent to drop medicine on . What 's this in a bowl ? Ice-cream ? " " Why , do n't you know what that is ? " said Lady Magnifico , sweeping along to the cupboard , and dipping in her dainty finger ; " that 's condemned milk . ' " Condensed milk , her ladyship means , " said the doctor , " boiled down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a custard for dinner , you 'll have to put in a tea-kettle full of water . " This was the second hint the young man had thrown out concerning dinner ; but Prudy was not to be hurried . " What 's this in a little caddy ? O , it 's rice . No ; it 's what Dotty used to call coker whacker . " " What does she call it now , may I ask ? " said the doctor , with an irritating smile . " Patti-coker -- what you s'pose ? " was the rash reply . Poor Lady Magnifico ! Little tingles of shame ran down her fingers as soon as she had spoken , for she saw , by the glances between her landlady and the doctor , that she had made another mistake . " O , I like to keep house , " cried Fly , holding up her trailing robes , and dancing over a carpet seam . " What 's this goldy thing ? " " Bellows , Toddlekins , to blow up the fire . See me fill out their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let me blow ' em ! " There was a second dash upon the stove , and another scorch in the slip . " There ought to be a fence built round that stove , " said the anxious father . " Come , Mother Hubbard , have you seen all there is in the cupboard ? Ca n't you give this poor old dog a bone ? " " Well , here I am with the care of the family on my shoulders , " thought Mother Hubbard , winking fast behind the green spectacles , and recalling uneasily the couplet her father often repeated :  --  " Think well before you pursue it ; But when you begin , go through it . " " Now what 'll we have for dinner ? " Lady Magnifico was walking languidly about , admiring herself in the mirror , Dr. Moonshine rummaging an old closet , and Baby pulling out the bureau drawers . " They have the easy part . But never mind ; I 'll show them what I can do . Mother says I have a great deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I make pickles all one vacation ? " Then Prudy sat down with the " Housekeeper 's Friend , " and began at the first page to read . Half an hour passed , and no signs of her moving . " I 'm hunger-y , " whispered Baby , taking a sugar-coated pill out of a box , and touching it with her tongue . It was sweet till her teeth went into it , when out rolled the little ball upon the floor . " O , my shole ! How bitter ! " groaned she , wiping her mouth on a lace cuff . " ' Spect that 's a pill , and they cooked it in sugar ; but I sha n't eat it . " " Little daughter , what are you doing there ? Must n't meddle with other folks ' things . " Dr. Moonshine sneezed as he spoke , having breathed some of the " dust of ages " into his nose off a top shelf , where Mrs. Fixfax kept a few herbs . Ten minutes more . The doctor stepped down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gazed hard at his landlady . She was turning the sixteenth page . " My Lady Magnifico ! " " Sir ? " " My lady , do you happen to have such a thing as a peanut in your pocket ? " My lady shook the cat out of the armchair , and seated herself . " It is n't polite to carry round peanuts . " " I was only thinking , " continued the doctor , with a side glance at Mother Hubbard , " how nice a peanut would be to keep anybody from fainting away . " Mother Hubbard started from her chair . " What unfashionable boarders ! You do n't expect dinner in the middle of the day , I hope ! In the city of New York we do n't have it till five or six o'clock . I 'm afraid you came down too soon , Dr. Moonshine . " " Afraid I did . Wish I was ' the man in the South . ' I 'd like to ' burn my mouth ' on a little ' cold plum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but I 'll give you a lunch . What say to omelettes and coffee ? " " Excellent , " said Dr. Moonshine , reviving . " Exquisite , " drawled my lady . " Exquit , " quoth Fly . " Only there is n't any coffee , " said Mother Hubbard , going to the cupboard . " Call it tea , " said the doctor , " and hurry up . " " No , chocolate is better . How do you make chocolate ? " said the landlady , turning to her cook-book . " I do n't know , and do n't care , " fumed the doctor . " Baked in a slow oven , most likely , with a top crust . Let the chocolate slide . " " Well , I will . And now I 'll make the omelette . Eggs ? yes ; there are eggs enough ; but dear me , where 's the milk ? This condemned kind my lady tells about wo n't do to make omelettes . I should n't dare try it . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ butter . I 've got past being particular . " " O , Dr. Moonshine , such biscuits as I 'm going to bake for you at five o'clock ! But now I really ca n't find a speck of bread ! " " I 'll warrant it ! I always heard that when old Mother Hubbard went to her cupboard she found the shelves were all bare . " " Then you need n't have come here to board . Wo n't crackers and raisins do ? " They had to do ; and the boarders tried to be satisfied in view of the coming dinner . All the afternoon Mother Hubbard spent between the cake-board and the mouth of the oven . " Queen of the rolling-pin , ca n't you hush up this fire ? " said Dr. Moonshine , looking at the thermometer ; " we 're nearly up to ' butter melts , ' and I suppose you know that 's ninety degrees . " " Dr. Moonshine , " replied Mother Hubbard , nervously , " I ca n't help it if the butter does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Papa , pin up my dress , " said the baby . " I want to do sumpin . I want some pastry to paste a book with . " " You 're a real failure , Toddlekins . Your teeth have come , and you talk and keep talking . I 'm afraid Mother Hubbard will charge me full price for your board . You hear what she calls for , ma'am ? Can you make her a little paste ? Here 's an old Patent Office Report ; and I 'll run the risk of her spoiling it . I 'll cut some pictures for her out of these papers . " " Lucky I do n't keep a file of my newspapers , " thought Mrs. Fixfax , listening from the next room . " If I did , those children would hear from me . " " Yes , I 'll make her some paste , " said Mother Hubbard , dropping the aerating egg-beater , and setting the spice-box on the stove . Dr. Moonshine laughed . Mother Hubbard had never dreamed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spice-box , and setting a kettle on the stove , boiled paste enough to paper the walls of a room . Meanwhile Fly was making free with the nutmegs and soda , and the little cook could not remember how far along she had got with the cake . " Children do n't annoy you , I hope , " said the doctor , seating the baby at the side of the table , opposite Mother Hubbard , and giving her a stick with a rag wound around the end of it , in order to paste pictures into a scrap-book . " Thank you , doctor . I never did like children half as well as dogs , " replied Mother Hubbard , forcing a smile . Then she tasted her cake slyly , to make sure whether she had put the butter in or not . " Madam Hubbard , mim , " said Lady Magnifico , " may I trouble you for a glass of water ? " " Mamma Hubbard , may I have a hangfiss to wipe off the pastry ? " Old Mother Hubbard went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lady ; to the closet , and found a rag for the baby . By that time she smelt something burning ; it was eggs . She had left the patent egg-beater on the stove by accident , and its contents were as black as a shoe . " O , what a frightful , alarming odor ! " cried Lady Magnifico . " If somebody does n't throw up a window ! Madam , do tell us what 's afire now ! " " Mother Hubbard 's got a dumb chill , " said the doctor ; " she wo n't speak . " But Prudy was saying under breath , " Please , God , let me keep pleasant . They do n't mean any harm , and I should be ashamed to get angry just about a play . " " What ails you , Mother Hubbard ? ' You look as blue as the skimmiest kind of skim-milk . ' " " Do I ? Well , no wonder , with such troublesome boarders . Suppose you and my lady go down to the parlor . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . I 'll call you when dinner is ready . " " Agreed ! Sharp five , remember . " " There , " said Mother Hubbard , taking off her spectacles ; " now I can cook . " Could she ? " Little folks we is to keep house -- is n't we ? " buzzed the little torment that was left behind . " Hush ! do n't you talk , Prudy . When you shake the table , then I make blots with my pastry . " Prudy said nothing , but thoughtfully tasted the cake again . How could she tell whether she had left out the soda ? " Are you blind of your ears , Prudy , Ca n't you hear nuffin what I say ? Rag 's come off the stick . Please to tie it on . And I want to eat some o ' that dough . " Mother Hubbard did her blundering best ; but ill luck seemed to pursue the cooking . " Need n't call that book the ' Young Housekeeper 's Friend . ' It 's an enemy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in great excitement . " Wood is hotter than coal , too . Mrs. Fixfax must have given it to me to plague me . How it does burn things up ! I hope beefsteak is cheap . I wo n't ask anybody to eat this , all covered with ashes . I 'll never try to broil any again on top of a stick of wood ! I wo n't try that ' steamboat pudding . ' Sounds as if ' t would burn , and I know it would . Let ' em go without pudding . " After the most tiresome afternoon she had ever spent in her life , Mother Hubbard went down with Fly , whom she dared not leave by herself , to call her boarders to dinner . CHAPTER V. MOTHER HUBBARD 'S DINNER . This was Mrs. Allen 's " reception-day , " the day on which she always staid at home , that her friends might be sure of finding her in . " Not at home , " Nathaniel had kept saying to visitors that afternoon . But one of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the answer . " Are the children here ? " demanded she . " Those nieces and nephews ? " Nathaniel did not know exactly what reply to make ; so he invited the lady into the parlor , and went to inquire . Dr. Moonshine and Lady Magnifico were in the drawing-room , looking over engravings . " Gnat , gnat , you troublesome insect , " said the doctor . " I heard auntie tell you we were not to be disturbed . " " But what could I say ? " asked the insect , humbly . " I could n't tell her ' not at home . ' " " You must say , ' Beg to be excused ; ' those are the proper words , " said my lady . " Yes , " added the doctor ; " go , there 's a good gnat , and sting ' em like sixty , if they do n't start quick . " Nathaniel obeyed , looking as dignified as ever , though nothing but a strong sense of propriety kept him from smiling . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parlor , dragging Fly , who was pinned to her skirts . Mother Hubbard was flushed and excited , her nose dusted with flour , her cap pulled entirely over her forehead ; and she was saying , in a loud tone , " I ca n't take any peace of my life , Fly Clifford , you know I ca n't , unless I get you fastened somehow . " " I do n't ' low folks to fassin me , " responded Fly , shaking her lace cap in a blaze of wrath ; " the next that fassins me , I 'll scwatch who did it ! " It was not at all like either of the children to talk in this way , any more than it was like them to be dressed in such ridiculous costume . The effect upon the lady visitor was quite startling . She started , smiled , rose from her chair , and held out her hand . " Now tell me if this is n't Miss Prudy Parlin . I have seen your picture , my love . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flour and furbelows , not to mention the green spectacles ! Prudy quivered like a frightened mouse , but could not get away , for a trap was sprung upon her ; a steel-gloved hand was holding her fast . " I am Madam Pragoffyetski , a Polish runaway . You may not have heard of me , but I know all about Prudy and little Thistledown Flyaway . " " Nicely , thank you , m 'm , " responded Miss Fly , in a voice as faint as the peep of a chicken ; at the same time darting forward and tearing a piece out of her slip . " If she runned away I 'd be ' shamed to tell of it . " " How awful for her to come here ! " thought Mother Hubbard , stealing a timid glance at the lady 's ermine muff . " She looks nice , but I do n't want anything to do with such people . " " Do n't be afraid of me , dears , " said the lady , laughing ; " I call myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admirer of yours , and my dear friend , your auntie , has promised me a visit from you . I came on purpose to ask you , and your sister , and your cousins to my house to dinner to-morrow . Will you come ? " Mother Hubbard gazed doubtfully at the steel-colored glove . What could she say ? " Thank you ever so much , Mrs. -- Mrs . Pradigoff , but Fly is not allowed to go out . " Flyaway was greatly chagrined . " Well , I -- I solomon promised , " said she , casting down her guilty eyes , as she remembered the orange man ; " I solomon promised I would't go ou ' doors , athout somebody lets me . " " There 's a tender conscience for you , " laughed the Polish lady . " Why was she not to go out , Miss Prudy ? " " Because she is so quick-motioned , ma'am . Before you know it she 's lost . That 's the reason I pinned her to my dress . You see , ma'am , we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if her quickness is all the trouble , I 'll take the responsibility that she sha n't get lost . I 'll bind her fast with a silken chain . Really , children , my heart is set on your coming . My house is full of things that make a noise -- a canary , a paroquet , a mocking-bird , a harp , a piano , and a guitar . And --  " Mrs. Pragoff did not add that she had invited a little party to meet them . She was afraid of frightening the timid souls . " Would you like to come , Miss Prudy ? Tell me honestly , now . " There was no need to ask Fly . She was dancing for joy -- the absurd little image . " O , yes 'm ; I 'd be delighted , " replied Mother Hubbard , a smile lighting up her face even to the floury tip of her nose . " And I think Horace and Dotty would , too . Shall I go and ask ? " Yes , Horace and Dotty were both pleased with the idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , doubtfully ; " but she talks our language beautifully . She 's a dear friend of auntie 's , too . " " What I object to , " said Horace , " is taking Toddlekins ; but I may possibly hire her to stay at home . " It was finally decided that Mrs. Pragoff should call next day and take the children to church with her , and thence home to a Christmas dinner . She laughed , as she rolled away in her carriage , thinking what droll figures they were , and how Prudy blinked through her glasses . " So I sha n't have to cook but one meal more , and that will be breakfast , " thought Mother Hubbard , her tired heart leaping up with something like joy . They sat down to dinner at last . " Tea urn been standing on the table all this while ? " asked Dr. Moonshine , resuming his critical manners ; " ' t would take the tea some time to freeze on here , Mrs. Hubbard , if that is what you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to hear . " She 's blind of her ears , papa ; you have to speak loud . " " What makes your child 's face so red , doctor ? " asked the landlady , pouring hot water till it overran the cup ; " do n't the darling feel well ? " " Yes 'm , pitty well ; only but the white tea gets in my cheeks and makes ' em too hot . " " White tea , I should think , " remarked Dr. Moonshine ; " why , Mother Hubbard , the tea-leaf in your urn must feel rather lonesome . " Mother Hubbard took off the cover and peeped in . " None there , as true as you live ! I 'll jump right up , doctor , and stew two or three handfuls . " " Do n't rise for me , ma'am ; do n't rise for me . We 'll swallow the will for the deed , ma'am ; the will for the deed . " " It 's always so , doctor , " said Lady Magnifico @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swallow these mistakes from time immortal . " Her ladyship meant " immemorial . " She was surprised at the ease with which she used large words . " All the mistakes are owing to the eccentricity of genius , " said the doctor , bowing to Mother Hubbard . " Our landlady is what is called ' absent . ' Here 's a health to our absent friend . " " You 'll have to excuse the biscuit , " said Mother Hubbard , nervously . " I mixed ' em too tight , and I think the flour 's half corn , they look so yellow ; it ca n't be all soda . " " I presume not all soda ; some mixture of flour and water . But where are they , ma'am ? " " O , I put them in the cupboard . I thought you 'd like crackers better . " " But these are the mizzerble kind , that do n't split , " said Lady Magnifico , in tragic tones ; " I told you so to-day noon . " " Stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sour , " cried the youngest , determined to scowl as hard as Dotty did , if it was a possible thing . The worried landlady passed the sugar , and the small boarder corrected the sourness of her white tea with three teaspoonfuls , heaping measure . " My little Toddlekins is eating nothing . " said the doctor . " I hope her red cheeks do n't indicate fever . " " There 's great quantities of sickness just now among children , " said Lady Magnifico , crooking her little finger genteelly . " Nervous Exhaustation is going about . " " Nervous what , my lady ? " " Exhaustation . I am well acquainted with a lady in the first society that had it dreadfully . She called in twenty-five doctors , if my memory preserves me right ; and then she like to died . " " You know it for a fact , my lady ? I hope it wo n't come here ( or the doctors either ) . Is it catching , Dr. Moonshine ? " " Well , yes , Mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goes hard with ' em , too . " " Ah me , then I 'll never dare go out , " drawled Lady Magnifico , looking at her rings . Here Mother Hubbard timidly passed the cake . " White Mountain ; but I suspect it 's a poor rule . " " A poor rule that do n't work both ways , hey ? If this was ever white , ma'am , ' twas n't a fast color ; faded to a rusty black . And as to it 's being a mountain , ma'am , it looks to me like a pretty hollow valley . " " I 'm so sorry , doctor ! But your little girl dusted my soda over the cat , and that was why the cake did n't rise . " " Just so , ma'am ; but did the cat rise ? " " O , Dr. Moonshine , I see you 're making fun of my cooking . And now I 'll tell you something more . I got the butter ready , and forgot to put it in , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Never mind , " said the doctor , very amiable as long as he could make his joke . " It is pretty tough cake , ma'am ; but it 's always tougher where there 's none . " " There 's one thing about it , " said Mother Hubbard , a little relieved ; " it 's sweet in the middle , and you need n't eat the bitter part , where it 's burnt . " " It 's my practice to mix the bitter with the sweet , " said the doctor , waving the butter-knife . " In this way , Mother H. , your black-valley cake is almost as good as pills . " " I ate a pill , " observed Fly , " and ' t was worser'n this ! " " You ate a pill , child ? When ? Where ? I 'll warrant that 's what ails you . " " No , it do n't ail me now . I spitted it out . " After nibbling a few crackers , and the inside of the cake , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than when they had sat down . " What is home without a mother ? " sang Horace , in a plaintive voice ; and Dotty joined in , with emphasis . Prudy looked as low-spirited as the " black-valley cake . " " I hope Uncle Augustus will be able to come home to-morrow . I declare , we are real cruel not to feel worse about his being sick away off there in a hotel . " " You 'd better believe he gets things to eat , " responded Lady Magnifico , aside to the doctor . " I 'd rather be some sick than have a landlady that 's purblind and purdeaf , and such owdrageous poor cooking ! Glad I 'm going out to Christmas dinner . " CHAPTER VI . PRUDY IN A NEW LIGHT . Mother Hubbard was heated , and tired , and hungry , and cross . It was all very well for a lady boarder to loll on an ottoman , play with her rings , and find fault . It was all very well for a gentleman boarder to fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know how every word cut like a lash . When the doctor said , carelessly , " Some people think themselves great cooks , my lady ; but the proof of the pudding 's in the eating , " why , that speech was " the pin in the end of the lash . " Prudy saw now that she had pretended to know a great deal more than she really did . Pretension is very apt to get laughed at . She had always scorned Dotty 's self-conceit ; but had n't she shown quite as much herself ? Making her auntie suppose she understood cooking , and putting Mrs. Fixfax to all this trouble for nothing ? How horrified auntie would be , and the housekeeper too , if they should dream that this little family was starving , with a cook-book lying open on the floor ! " But I declare , it 's real mean in you two to make fun of me , " cried the young landlady , tipping the sugar-basin plump into the dish-tub ; " you could n't get any better supper yourselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Surprised at the sharp sound of her own voice , dismayed at sight of the wet sugar , and completely discouraged by the aspect of things in general , Prudy burst out into a sort of frenzy . She was ashamed of herself , but she could n't stop . " You think I can bear everything -- you and Dotty both ! People are careful what they say to Dotty , for her temper 's just like live coals ; but they talk to me , and say anything ; anything they 've a mind to . " " Why , Prue , " exclaimed Horace , as astonished as if Mother Hubbard 's dog had spoken ; " why , Prue ! " " Yes , you think it 's awful if I speak ; but sometimes it seems as if I should bite my tongue out . " " Do n't , Prudy , " exclaimed Dotty , looking on with awe and alarm , as if there had been a sudden eclipse of the sun ; " I did n't mean to . " " Do n't Prudy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and I 'll give you sumpin what I buy . " There is an old saying , " Beware the fury of a patient man . " Prudy had tried all day to " Smile and smile , While secret wounds were eating at her heart ; " but now she could scarcely bear the touch of little Fly 's hand . She did not care what she said , if she could only find words bitter enough . " I always have to bear , and bear , and bear . Nobody else does . I 've noticed how different it is with Susy . She frets , and then people let her alone . And Dotty , how she tosses up her head like Aunt Martha 's horse Lightning-Dodger ! Have n't I always pacified Dotty , and humored her ? Had to alter the play to suit her . And what does that child know or care , any more than if I was a common sister , that had n't been giving up , and giving up , and giving up , ever since she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teeth chattered , and the sharp words seemed to rattle out like hail-stones . Horace had never seen her in such a mood , and was half inclined to run away ; but when she took her hands down from her face , and he saw how pale she was , his heart was moved . " Come , Prue , you 're sick abed ; that 's what 's the matter . Lie down , and let that lazy Dot take off her diamonds , and go to work . " Prudy dropped upon the sofa and covered her face with her handkerchief , while Dotty , strange to relate , actually slid the rings off her fingers and thumbs , and began to put away the crackers . " O , dear , " thought Prudy , blushing under the cap-border , spectacles , and handkerchief ; " what did possess me to talk so ? I had been holding in all day ; why did I let go ? If I ever do let go , I ca n't stop ; and O , how shameful it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good as for a bird to sing ; but it was not so . She had a great deal of human nature , after all . She liked her own way , but she never had it unless Dotty was willing . Was that a pleasant way to live ? If you think so , dears , just try it . The secret of Prudy 's sweetness was really this : In all trials she was continually saying , under breath , " Please , God , keep me from doing wrong . " She had found that was really the only way -- the only safe way . " Everybody calls me amiable . They would n't if they knew how I have to grit my teeth together to keep from scolding . I like to be called amiable , but nobody 'll do it again ; and Horace sees now I 'm not the girl he thought I was . " All Prudy 's hail-stones of wrath had melted into tear-drops , and she was sobbing them into her handkerchief . She did not clearly know whether she was crying because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she " was not the girl he had thought she was . " " Bless your dear little soul , " said Dr. Moonshine , kneeling before her , while his blue swallow-tails swept the floor , " you 've told the truth . Everybody knows Dot 's a spitfire , and you 're an angel ; and she does impose upon you most abominably . " Dotty stood staring , with a plate in her hand , too much astonished to defend herself . " And I 'm ashamed of firing so many jokes at you , Prue ; I am so . I 'm a great joker ( he meant a great wit ! ) , but this is the first time I ever mistrusted you cared -- you always take things so like a lamb , or you 'd better believe I would n't have done it . For there is n't a girl in the world I like so well as I do you , nor begin to . " " O , Hollis , " moaned the little one , stirred by sudden jealousy . " Hullelo ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jewel ; that 's generally understood . When I say I like Prue , I mean next after you . " The jealous Fly was satisfied , and folded her little wings against Horace 's breast . Prudy felt greatly soothed , but her cap-strings were still shaking , and she could not trust her voice to speak . Nothing more was said for some time . Dotty clattered away at the dishes , kitty purred by the stove , and Horace rocked his little sister , who clung about his neck like an everlasting pea . Presently he stopped rocking , and exclaimed ,  --  " Why , what 's the matter with my Toddlekins ? What makes her breathe so short ? " " My froat 's short ; that 's what is it , " replied the little philosopher , closing her eyes , as if she did not choose to talk . " But how does your throat feel , Topknot ? " " Feels bad ; why ? " " Girls , this child has a sore throat , and a high fever . Her hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dish-cloth tragically . " She 's going to have the measles ; you see'f she do n't . " " Hush ! " said Prudy , springing up , and tucking back her sleeves . " Let 's give her a warm bath . That 's what mother does when we are sick , before ever she sends for the doctor . " " I 'd ravver have a turkey-wash , " said Fly , rousing a little , and then dropping her head again . " There , she 's lost her senses ; I knew she would , " said Dotty , walking the floor . " Do stop that , Dot . She has her senses as clear as you have . When she says turkey-wash , she means a Turkish bath ; it takes me to interpret . She had a very gentle Turkish bath once . Liked it -- did n't you , Fly ? Ca n't you rub her real hard with a crash towel , girls ? That will be almost as good . " " Of course we can , " said Prudy , forgetting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be nicer than this little bathroom , with the silver faucets and ivory tub . Come , Fly , and have your turkey-wash . ' Twill make you feel a great deal better . " After a nice bath , at which Prudy and Dotty presided , the little one was dressed in her nightie , and set on her brother 's knee again . " Prudy said I 'd feel better to be baved , " said she , looking thoughtfully at the gas-light ; " but now I was baved , and I do n't feel any diffunt ; I feel just 's I did by-fore . " " When can she have taken such a cold ? " said Horace ; " do n't you see , Prue , she ca n't breathe out of her nose ? " Then Fly remembered the orange-man , and something made her face grow red in a minute ; but it was not the white tea . " Pitiful about my signess , " sighed she , and thought she would never , never tell of her own disobedience . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am glad Fly always minds , " said he , looking straight into the little guilty face . " For God sees everything she does , " whispered he , solemnly . Horace never spoke of such subjects to other people ; you would not suppose they were much in his mind ; but to this precious little sister he gave his best thoughts , so far as he could make her understand them . " For God sees everything she does . " Fly did not speak for as much as a minute , and then she said , timidly ,  --  " Hollis , I want to ask you sumpin ; does God wear spetticles ? " " No , dear ; no , indeed . " " O , I thought He did . " " But He sees us in the light and in the dark , Topknot . " The child winced . " Can He see Hisself athout looking in the glass ? " " Yes , I suppose so . " " Then , when I go up to God , I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and two to see other things . O , dear , I 'm so sick , I guess I will go up to God . " The housekeeper was listening from the next room . " That child 's voice is growing hoarse . I must go and look into this business , " thought she . She knocked at the children 's door . " I came to ask if I can do anything for you , young ladies . " Mrs. Fixfax had heard a great deal of the play , and had been in a state of amusement all day , without seeing the actors ; and when she caught sight of them now , she had to twist her mouth very hard , " to keep her teeth in . " The magnificent Lady Magnifico , the ridiculous Dr. Moonshine , and the becapped Mother Hubbard , all replied in chorus , " O , yes 'm , we were going to ring for you . Do you see what ails the baby . " Mrs. Fixfax approached the child in such a tender , motherly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face to " a platter of cold hash . " She had a strong , sensible look , as if she were capable of carrying a whole hospital full of children through all sorts of diseases ; and Prudy and Horace , who had begun to have an unpleasant feeling of responsibility , were greatly relieved . " You do n't think it 's anything but a cold -- do you , Mrs. Fixfax ? I do n't know much about sickness . " Mrs. Fixfax allowed herself to smile this time , as her eye rested on the Mother Hubbard cap . " No , I do n't see anything alarming yet . If this was my child , I should just gargle her throat with salt and water , wrap a pork rind round her neck , and put her to bed . " Fly objected to nothing , if she could only sleep with her own brother Hollis . When told she might do so , she tried to clap her hands ; but her heart was heavy , and her throat was sore ; so all she could do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my dears , how do you enjoy housekeeping ? " asked Mrs. Fixfax , carelessly , as she attended to Fly 's throat . " No -- ot very much , " returned Dr. Moonshine , faintly ; for no one else seemed ready to speak . " Rather hard on the head of the family . Do n't you say so , Prue ? " But Prudy could not answer , on account of a throbbing at the roots of her tongue . " I see you have been taking an early dinner , " contined Mrs. Fixfax , very coolly , as if she had no idea the children before her were half starved . " Ye -- es 'm . " " So , perhaps you would n't object to going down and finishing off on roast turkey ? I ordered the table set for you . " " You did ? O , thank you , ma'am ! " cried Lady Magnifico , ready to throw herself on the housekeeper 's neck . " I never object to roast turkey myself , " said the doctor , his eyes gleaming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought she should relish a good dinner as well as her boarders . They all went down but Fly , who was by this time fast asleep in Mrs. Fixfax 's arms . " I reckon the servants thought we 'd been wrecked on a desert island , by the dash we made at that turkey , " whispered Horace , as they returned to the housekeeper 's room . " How good you were , Horace Clifford , not to tell Mrs. Fixfax about my awful cooking . " " And I did n't tell , either , " said Dotty . " But was n't it mizzerble ? " As if Mrs. Fixfax did n't know , and was n't that very minute laughing over the " tight biscuit " and low-spirited cake ! CHAPTER VII . A FLY IN TRINITY CHURCH . The children went to bed that night cheered by a remark which Mrs. Fixfax dropped as if by accident . " The cook is to fry buckwheat cakes in the morning . I dare say you would like omelettes , too . Do you drink chocolate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to eat down stairs , " thought Prudy . And now her troubles were over . Life bloomed before her once more like a garden of roses . Horace did not rest remarkably well . In the first place , the bed was too warm . Mrs. Fixfax had rolled Fly into a big bundle , with nothing out but the end of her nose , and was toasting her with soapstones . " Buried alive , " Horace said , " with gravestones at her head and feet . " " I 'm all of a personation , " gasped the child . " My mamma never did me so , Hollis . She gave me little tinty tonty pills ,  - -  sugar clear through , not the big ones Miss Fixfix eats . " " Well , lie still , Topknot , and do n't roll towards me . " For an hour or two Fly lay gasping ; then she said , softly ,  --  " Hollis , Hollis , is He looking now ? " " Yes , dear ; but do n't be afraid of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if I was n't naughty . When I 'm good I 'm willin ' He should look . " " Naughty , Topknot ? " " Yes , Hollis ; I solomon promised I would n't go ou ' doors ; but that new Miss Fixfix , she let me gwout , athout nuffin on my head , ' n ' I got a awful cold . " " O , little Fly ! " " I know it , Hollis . I was defful sorry all the time . I ate ollinges , too ; so for course I got the sore froat . " " I 'm glad you told me , Fly ; now I know what ails you . But you must n't ever disobey again . " " Yes , um , " said Fly , rolling towards her brother , and crying till the tears ran down on the flannel which was bound around her neck . A few moments after she whispered ,  --  " Now I do n't feel any ' fraid , Hollis ; I 've telled God . I feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should look . " " Well , then , dear , that 's right -- go to sleep . " " And now , Hollis , do you s'pose He 'll send my spirrick back to me ? " " What are you talking about , Topknot ? Your spirit 's in your body , child . Go to sleep . " " No , it is n't in my body , too ! I want my nice good little spirrick to come back , " murmured the child . " Auntie said ' t would stay to me if I 's good . " Fly was thinking of her unseen guardian angel . It was a troubled night for Horace . Fly waked him no less than three times , to ask him if she had the measles . " No , child , no ; do n't wake me for that again . " " Well , you ought to not go to sleep ' fore I do . You 're a fast boy , Hollis ! " Morning came , and Fly was rather languid , as might have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see , " mused Mrs. Fixfax , " where she caught this dreadful cold , unless it was your keeping the room so hot yesterday , children . " Fly hid her face in her brother 's back hair , for she was riding pickaback down stairs . " And can we go to see that Poland lady ? " said Dotty . " If you asked me , I answer , No , " said Horace , bluntly . " At any rate , Fly must n't stir a step out of the house to-day . " " I did n't ask you , Horace . I asked Mrs. Fixfax . She is the one that has the care of us . " " I really do n't know what to say about it , " replied the housekeeper , hesitating . " We will wait and see how she seems after breakfast . " " Rather a cool way of setting my opinion one side , " thought Horace , indignantly . Fly ate only two small buckwheat cakes , but seemed lively enough , as she always did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't suppose it is exactly the thing , after steaming her so , " said Mrs. Fixfax , as if talking to herself , she did not even look at Horace ;  --  " but really I do n't know what else to do . I could n't keep her at home unless the rest of the children staid ; and if I did I presume she 'd get killed some other way . She 's one of the kind that 's never safe , except in bed , with the door locked , and the key in your pocket . " " Let her manage it to suit herself , " thought brother Horace , deeply wounded ; " she knows my opinion . " When Madam Pragoffyetski came , the housekeeper went down to the parlor to introduce the children -- a step which Horace thought highly unnecessary . He was charmed at once with the foreign lady 's affable manners , and would have liked to go with her , if only Fly could have been left behind . Mrs. Fixfax explained that the child had been sick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We thought last night she was in danger of her life , " said Dotty . " You expected she was going to die , Horace ; you know you did . " " Well , I was n't going to , " returned Fly , coughing . " I knew I should live -- I always do live . " " What was the matter ? " said Mrs. Pragoffyetski , in alarm ; for she knew as much about children 's ailments as she did about the volcanoes in the sun . " Only a little sore throat , " answered the housekeeper , still looking anxious , and not at all sure she was doing right . " Yes 'm , sore froat . And Dotty wanted me to have the measles , too ; but I would n't . " " That is right , " said Mrs. Pragoffyetski , with a musical laugh . " Indeed , your little cousin was cruel to ask such a thing of you . I 'm glad you did n't do it . " They took a street-car , and Dotty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gay sights all the way . But no ; the shops had their eyes shut . Yesterday how quickly everybody had moved ! Now , men and women were walking quietly along , and there was no confusion anywhere . " How strange ! " said Prudy . " I should think it was Sunday , only the boys are blowing tin trumpets . " " Yes ; and the babies are going to visit their grandmammas , " said Mrs. Pragoff ; " look at the one in the corner in its nurse 's arms , with a point-lace bib under its chin . That pretty blanket , embroidered so heavily , must weigh more than the baby . " Dotty kept her gaze steadily fixed on the streets . " It seems so funny for a steeple to be preceding from the middle of those stores . ' Tis n't a very pious place for a church ! " " Now I hope Dotty is n't going to be pert , " thought Prudy . " I know what street that is , down there , " added Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; " that is Wall Street . Did they use to have walls both sides of it ? Horace , you scared me so yesterday , I like to screamed . You said there were bulls and bears growling all the way along ; but there was n't a single bear , only a stuffed one sitting on top of a store , and he was n't alive , and not on this street either . " Here Prudy gave her sister 's little finger a squeeze , which was meant for " hush ; " but Dotty never could understand why it was not proper at all times to say what she had on her mind , especially when people listened so politely as this Polish lady . " Mrs. -- Mrs . Pragoff-yetski , I hope you 'll excuse me , but I ca n't remember your name . " " That is it ; you have it exactly ; but never mind about the last part , my love . Pragoff is enough . " " Yes'm.  - -  Well , I was going to ask you , Mrs. Yetski , will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into church ? O , you do n't know how funny she acts , or you never 'd dare take her . I would n't laugh in church for anything in this world ; but Fly always makes me . " " Does she , indeed ! Ah me , that is very unfortunate ! " said the queenly lady , looking down on little Miss Toddlekins as if she were actually afraid of her . She took care to put Dotty out of harm 's way , by placing the untamable Fly between Horace and Prudy . The interior of Trinity Church was so magnificent , the Christmas decorations so fresh and beautiful , and the service so imposing , that no one thought of such a thing as smiling . " How could I have been so impatient , yesterday ? " thought Prudy , as she listened to the plaintive chant , " He was a man of sorrows , and acquainted with grief . " " Why , if you only think of that , how our Saviour had trouble every minute , it does n't seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and children have a good time or not . " Here , as they were about to seat themselves at the close of the chant , Fly , who , in spite of her brother 's warnings , had been tilting back and forth on a stool , suddenly tipped forward , and hit her nose furiously . Blood flowed from the wound ; and the sight of it , together with the pain , made the child frantic . She forgot where she was and screamed . Poor Mrs. Pragoffyetski ! Though a good woman in the main , she was rather proud of appearances , and had just been thinking the four children did her credit . But now ! The shrill cry of distress called everybody 's attention to her pew . The whole audience were looking up from their prayer-books in astonishment . " Tut , tut ! My dear ! My love ! Hush , my babe , lie still ,  - -  O , ca n't you stop crying ? " Horace , too , was trying to quiet the child ; but Fly sincerely believed she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for proprieties ? " O , my shole ! " piped she aloud , plunging both hands into the stream of blood , and afterwards into her hair . Thus , by the time Mrs. Pragoff and Horace got her into the aisle , she looked as if she had been murdered . " I wish I was twenty-one , " thought Horace , bitterly . " Mrs. Fixfax had no business steaming this child . I believe it has gone to her brain . " The party of five marched out of church , for Mrs. Pragoff did not wish to make a second sensation by coming back after Prudy and Dotty . " I never go with Fly but I get mortified , " thought Miss Dimple ; " and now , O dear , I sha n't hear those Christmas chimes ! " But Prudy was thinking how sorry she was for Mrs. Pragoff and Horace . They all went into a druggist 's , and , after a few minutes spent in the use of a sponge and water , poor Fly ceased to look like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When they reached Mrs. Pragoff 's , she was placed on a sofa , and for once in her life lay still . Horace bent over her with the wildest anxiety , thinking some terrible crisis was coming . As soon as she felt a little better , she began to cry . " O , darling , what is it ? " said he , glad to see her in motion once more . " Cause my Uncle ' Gustus is sick . " " Poh , " said Dotty ; " crying about that ? See ! I do n't cry . " " Well , you do n't love Uncle ' Gustus so hard as I do , " said Fly , with another burst . Mrs. Pragoff looked on with interest , and tried to remember whether she had ever heard that children shed tears when they were " coming down " with scarlet fever . This elegant mansion was a very interesting place to visit . To say nothing of things which " made a noise , " there was no end of curiosities from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was so truly well-bred that the children soon felt at home . Dotty was deeply engaged in examining a sea-horse , when Prudy suddenly whispered ,  --  " Dotty , what did you do last night with those two rings ? " " Rings ? What rings ? " Then a look of absolute terror spread over Dotty 's face . She remembered slipping off her auntie 's rings when she washed the dishes ; but where had she put them ? " Why , Prudy , I persume I left ' em in -- in -- where I ought to leave ' em . " " O , I 'm glad you did , " returned Prudy , quite satisfied , for she was listening with one ear to the liquid notes of " The Wandering Sprite . " " Why did n't Prudy Parlin ask me before ? " thought Dotty , in much agitation ; " and then I could have gone all round and looked to see if I 'd put them in the right place . " Illustration : " DOTTY DIMPLE , YOU HERE ? " CHAPTER VIII . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after this , what happened . She cared nothing about the elegant masters and misses who dropped in to dinner , though Prudy was too frightened to speak ; nothing about the paroquets , and dried butterflies , and Japanese canoes she pretended to look at ; nothing about the chatting and laughing , and very little about the Christmas plum-pudding , the oyster-pies , and ice cream . Dotty had no heart for any of these things . She was thinking continually , " Where are those rings ? " Fly did not dine , and Dotty had begged to stay with her . " No , " said Mrs. Pragoff , patting Miss Dimple 's cheek with her dainty hand , which did not look as if it had ever been soiled with anything coarser than rose leaves ; " I am glad to see you so kind to your dear little cousin ; but she is asleep on my bed , and does not need you . " Prudy sat at her hostess 's right hand , and in spite of her bashfulness , was as happy a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has not had the care of a family can imagine the relief she felt now the cooking was off her mind . But Dotty was wringing her hands under the table-cloth , and thinking , " I do n't want to see anybody . My heart is certainly broken . " " Why , Dot , what 's the matter ? What are you scowling at so ? " said Horace , in a low tone . Upon that Dotty began to smile . No one must know her heart was broken , for fear the question might arise , " What broke it ? " Of course her smile was a make-believe , nothing more nor less than a simper . The large boy across the table looked at her in surprise . " Handsome as a picture , " thought he , " but no brains . " " O , my sorrows ! What 'll I do ? I ca n't remember whether I put those rings in my blue pocket , or carried ' em up stairs . Seems to me I dropped ' em in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ em in a book , but we flew round so when Fly was sick , that I should n't wonder if they got into the wood-box . " All the while Dotty went on simpering and saying , " If you please , sir , " every time a dish was passed her . Her singular behavior surprised Horace , and when she took three olives , which she very much disliked , and immediately afterwards tucked them under her plate , he said ,  --  " Dot , I believe you are crazy . " It was an unfortunate remark . A little more , and there would have been a scene at the table ; but Dotty , with all her self-control , forced back the tears . " Wonder if he wanted to make me cry , " thought she ; " but I wo n't cry . And he need n't think he can make me ' mad ' either . S'pose I 'd show temper right before these people ? " On the whole , Dotty contrived to keep up appearances , and no one but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspected her of being an idiot . But the moment dinner was over , she stole away from the party , and found her way up-stairs to Mrs. Pragoff 's room . There , on the outside of the bed , lay Fly , half undressed , and still very pale . " Gas-light makes folks look gas-ly , " thought Dotty , " but she is n't much sick , or Horace would n't have eaten any dinner . There , when I first got a peek at this bed-quilt , I thought it was so queer ; and now I 'm going to see what it 's made of . " Instead of a common coverlet , the bed was adorned with two enormous crimson satin cushions stuffed with swan 's down . The cushion on the lower half of the bed was two feet deep , to cover the lower part of the body , and the one at the upper part not quite so thick , for it was to cover the shoulders . Then a sheet of the finest linen was turned over at the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The pillows were of crimson silk , the bedstead enormously high , and carved all over with figures of gods and goddesses . Dotty stood gazing with surprise , and almost forgetting her trouble . " She must have brought it over from Poland when she ran away , only it 's so heavy . But then I do n't s'pose she ran on foot . Came in the night , in the cars , prob'ly . Poland 's up by the North Pole . I 'm going to ask auntie about it . " But the moment auntie came into her thoughts Dotty was wretched again . She went to a window , drew back the damask curtain , and gazed out . " The night came on alone , The little stars sat , one by one , Each on his golden throne . " " Those stars twinkle like auntie 's rings . Let 's see : one was full of little pieces of glass , about as big as raspberry seeds . I should n't think glass would cost much . And the other was red , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . That ca n't be so expensive , should you think , as a string of beads ? " Dotty tried hard to comfort herself , but could not stay comforted . " You do n't s'pose auntie 's jewels cost more than my papa is worth ? How he must feel to be so poor ! If he has to pay for those rings , we sha n't get enough to eat . Have to live on crackers and olives . And when we come to the table , father will look at me , and say , ' This is on the account of your naughty conduct , child ! ' O , dear ! I ca n't speak one word , for it will be true , what he says . Grandma Read will have enough to eat ; Norah will set it on her end of the table . Grandma is rich ; I 've seen her counting over bills in her desk ; but how could I ask her for any , when she 'd look right in my eyes , and say , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thy thumbs ? ' " Well , I know ' twas n't right ; but ' t was Prudy 's fault some . If she had n't told me not to so hard , I persume I should n't . What made her speak up , and get me started ? " O , did you ever see such a beautiful string of beads ? One , two , three ,  - -  I guess there are a thousand . " Dotty threw the necklace over her head , and the air became as fragrant as a garden of spices . " I do n't mean to meddle with other peoples ' things any more ; mother has taught me better . But there 's one thought keeps coming into my mind : Is n't it wicked to have so much jewelry ? The ' postles did n't wear any , nor Job did n't wear any , nor Moses . " Well , nor auntie do n't , either . Nothing but a watch and wedding-ring . Horace says that 's so queer . " Now , what 's the use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I do n't believe auntie knows how many rings there were in that casket ! " This was a new idea . Dotty 's eyes began to sparkle . They would have made a jeweller 's fortune if he could have put them in a gold setting , and sold them for sapphires . " The rings are somewhere round . I 'm sure I can find them ; but if I ca n't , will it be very wrong not to tell , when ' twould n't make the least difference , and auntie never wears ' em ? Ought never to have ' em at all ; ought to have the ornaments of meek and quiet spirits , instead of rings . " Prudy would think ' t was awful not to tell ; but Prudy ca n't say anything to me . Did n't she get mad yesterday , real , shaky mad ? ' T was a great deal wickeder for her than it is for me -- her disposition is real good , and mine was born awful . So Prudy ca n't say a word to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who wants to eat olives and fried pork ? Prudy would n't like it any better'n I do . She would think she 'd tell , but p'haps she would n't any quicker'n me . " All just for two old rings , that never did me any good , and did n't have much of a time keeping house , either . " " Dotty Dimple , you here ? " said Prudy , appearing at her sister 's elbow , like an accusing angel . " Why , I 've been hunting you all over the house . You must n't wear that on your neck ; it is a rosary ; it does n't belong to you . " " Prudy little knows how my heart 's broken , " thought Dotty , " or she would n't talk about beads . And me wanting to go home so I could ' most fly , just to find those rings . " " I have been hunting for you , " repeated Prudy . " Mrs. Pragoff sent a man over to Uncle Augustus 's to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they did n't . There was a letter that uncle was n't able ; but they 'll come to-morrow afternoon . " " That 's splendid , " thought Dotty ; " now I 'll have to-night and all to-morrow forenoon to hunt . " " And then Mrs. Pragoff said we might just as well stay here all night as to go home , " continued Prudy . " O , dear , dear ! we 're not going to stay here . Prudy Parlin ? Why did n't you come and ask if I was willing ? " " I did hunt for you , Dotty , but I could n't find you . I thought you 'd like to stay . They are playing so beautifully down stairs . I 'm just proud of Horace ; he acts like a little gentleman . " " I do n't care how Horace acts , and I do n't want to play with people that have their hair frizzed . I want to go back to auntie 's . ' " But you ca n't , Dotty . Mrs. Pragoff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dotty rolled herself up in the curtain , and screamed into the folds of it . " Why , Dotty , what am I going to do with you ? Please come down , and behave . " " O , Prudy , I do n't want ever to go down again . I do n't want ever to see folks , or behave , as long as I live . " " But , Dotty , all these little boys and girls came here just to see us . It is our Christmas party . You 'll mortify Mrs. Pragoff . You know how Fly mortified her this morning . Please do n't be contrary . " Dotty unrolled herself from the curtain with a triumphant smile . " You need n't say anything , Prudy Parlin ! You got mad your own self , I s'pose you know ! " Prudy 's eyes dropped suddenly . " But , Dotty , why do you want to go back to auntie 's to-night ? " " I want to go for something particular . I --  " Prudy 's mouth was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something the wrong way . " " O Dotty , not a pin ! " " No ; what you s'pose ? Guess I 've done something to my windpipe . Wish you would n't talk . " Prudy , in spite of her vexation , could not help smiling at Dotty 's fierce grimaces , of which she got a vanishing view as the child went into the curtain again . " If we do n't go home , Prudy , I 'll have to go right to bed . I do n't feel like sitting up . " " Then I must ask Mrs. Pragoff where we are to sleep . " And next minute Prudy was half way down stairs , thinking ,  --  " What 's gone wrong ? I never can find out by asking her . She do n't think or care how impolite she is , and how hard she makes it for me . " It was a very brilliant party , composed of some of the most refined and accomplished little people in the city of New York . Such fine dresses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mamma had sent a thin summer dress in the trunk . It was dreadful to have to wear woollen , high-necked and long-sleeved . It cost her a great effort to cross the room . She felt as awkward as a limping grasshopper in a crowd of butterflies . But reaching her hostess at last , she timidly whispered ,  --  " My sister says she is n't very well , Mrs. Pragoff , and that 's why she stays up stairs . If you please , perhaps she 'd better go to bed . " Prudy was very much ashamed to say this ; but politeness required her to make some excuse for wayward Dotty 's behavior . Of course Mrs. Pragoff went up stairs at once . At the sound of her steps , and the words , " You poor , forlorn little dear , " Dotty came out of the curtain , looking as miserable as could be desired . " I am so sorry , darling ! I wished you to become acquainted with these nice little gentlemen and ladies . " " But I -- I -- it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throat , too ? O , my love ! " cried Mrs. Pragoff , seeing a dreadful vision , with her mind 's eye , of two cases of scarlet fever . She was a childless widow , and children puzzled as well as interested her . She did not know what to make of Dotty 's confused statement that she " was n't sick and was n't well , " but undressed and put her to bed as if she had been six months old , resolving to send for the doctor in the morning . " What have you on your neck , precious ? O , that rosary . It is one of my curiosities . Do you fancy it ? " " Here is the box in which it belongs . I give you the box and the beads , my charming dear , for a Christmas present and a consolation . See the card at the bottom of the box :  --  " ' Life is a rosary , Strung with the beads of little deeds Done humbly , Lord , as unto Thee . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rosaries , darling , and all your little deeds as lovely as these beads . " And now , good night , and may the Christ-Child give you your dreams . " As soon as Dotty was alone , she covered her head with the bed-clothes , and made up faces . She wished she could push herself through the footboard , and come out at Portland . She never wished to set eyes on the city of New York again , or anybody that lived in it . CHAPTER IX . TWO LIVE CHILDREN . As Dotty lay tossing on her bed , she heard the laughing , and the lively music of the piano , and began to find she had missed a great deal by not going down stairs . Horace and Prudy were getting a taste of fashionable society . True , Prudy did tire of the fixed questions , " How do you like New York ? Have you been in the Park ? " asked by girls in pink , and girls in blue , and boys in wondrous neck-ties , with hair parted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pragoff proposed games . How could such exquisite children play without tearing their flounces and deranging their crieped hair ? But games were a relief to Prudy . When she was playing she forgot her thick winter dress , and appeared like herself . " I do n't believe Dotty can get to sleep in all this noise . Here 's a nice chance to slip out , and I 'll run up and see . " She was not quite sure of the room , but the words , " Is that you , Prudy ? " in an aggrieved voice , showed her the way . " How do you feel , darling ? " " Feel ? How 'd you feel going to bed right after dinner ? " " But you said you were sick . " " Well , yes ; my -- windpipe ; but that 's done aching . I can talk now . You get my clothes , and I 'll dress and go down stairs . " " Why , Dotty , I 've excused you to Mrs. Pragoff , and it would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Mother went down once with her head tied up in vinegar . Besides , it shakes me all over to hear such a noise . And it 's not polite to stay away when the party 's some of it for me . " Prudy resigned herself to this new mortification , and helped the child dress . Dotty went down stairs with such an appearance of restored health , that Mrs. Pragoff was quite relieved , and gave up her fear of scarlet fever . But Miss Dimple 's friends were all sorry , half an hour afterwards , that she had not staid in bed . Among other games , they played " Key to Unlock Characters ; " and here she proved herself anything but polished in her manners . The key coming to her as " the girl with the brightest eyes , " she was told , in a whisper , to give it to the person of whom she had such or such an opinion . The little boys were interested to know which one of them would get it , for it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any of the boys ; she quickly stepped up to a young girl with frizzes of hair falling into her eyes , and gay streamers of ribbons flying abroad . Little miss took the key with an affected smile and a shake of her shaggy locks , never doubting she was receiving a great honor . But when , at the close of the game , the players explained themselves , Mallie Lewis was startled by these words from the little Portland girl :  --  " I was told to give the key to the most horrid-looking person in the room , and I did so ! " Dotty had not stopped to reflect that " the truth should not be spoken at all times , " and is often out of place in games of amusement . But to do her justice , she was ashamed of her rudeness the moment the words were spoken . Prudy was blushing from the roots of her hair to the lace in her throat . " Why had n't Dotty given the key to Horace or herself ? Then nobody would have minded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though more brilliant than you are , has not your exquisite tact . Mrs. Pragoff tried to laugh off this awkward blunder , but did not succeed . The moment Dotty could catch her ear , she said , in a low tone ,  --  " I 'm so sorry , Mrs. Pragoff-yetski . Will it do any good to go and tell her she made me think of a Shetland pony ? " Mrs. Pragoff laughed , and thought not . But afterwards she took Mallie into a corner to show her some " seven-years " African flowers , and said ,  --  " Mallie , dear , I wish you would n't veil those bright eyes under such fuzzy little curls . That was why you got the key . Dotty Dimple is n't used to seeing young ladies look like Shetland ponies . " Mallie 's face brightened , or that part of it which was in sight . O , it was only her hair the country child called horrid ! After this she actually allowed Dotty to sit beside her on the sofa , and look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once owned . Miss Dimple was remarkably polite and reserved . " Safe as long as she stays in a corner , " thought Horace ; and he took care to keep her supplied with books and pictures . He enjoyed the party , not being overawed , as poor Prudy was . Was n't he as good as any of them ? Better than most , for he did n't have to use an eye-glass . " These fellows are got up cheap . What do hair-oil and perfumery amount to ? " The boys , in their turn , looked at Horace , and decided he was " backwoodsy . " Nobody who sported a silver watch could belong to the " first circles . " However , when he allowed himself to be " Knight of the Whistle , " and hunted for the enchanted thing which everybody was blowing , and found at last it was dangling down his own back from a string , and they were all laughing at him , he was manly enough not to get vexed . That carried him up several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too , I confess . As for Prudy , the girls could not help seeing she had no style ; but the boys liked her , for all that . If they had only known what their hostess thought , there would have been some surprise . " These little misses look to me like bonnet flowers made out of book-muslin . Prudy , now , is a genuine , fresh moss rose bud . There is no comparison , you dear little Prudy , between artificial and natural flowers ! " Mrs. Pragoff was called a " finished lady . " She was acquainted with some of the best people in Europe and America . What could she see in Prudy ? The child was not to be compared with these exquisite little creatures , who had maids to dress them , and foreign masters come to their houses and teach them French , music , and dancing . Why , Prudy did not know French from Hebrew ; she had only learned a few tunes on the piano , and could not sing " operatic " to save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foot . What was the charm in Prudy ? Just one thing -- Naturalness . She was not made after a pattern . " It was a great risk inviting them here , and that youngest one seems very delicate ; but let what will happen , I make a note of this : I have seen four live children . " Live children indeed ! And here comes one of them now -- the unaccountable Fly , darting into the room very unexpectedly , rubbing her eyes as she runs . " Why , Topknot ! " cried Horace , making a dash upon her ; for her frock was unfastened , and slipping off at the shoulders , and her head looked like a last year 's bird 's nest . " Scusa me , " whispered the " live child , " very much astonished to see such a crowd . " But you ought not to come down here half undressed , you little midget ! " " What if I wanted to ask you sumpin ? " stammered the child , more alarmed by her brother 's sternness than by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I mus ' have my froat goggled ; have some more poke-rime round it , Hollis ! " added she , in a tone loud enough to be heard by half the party . Think of mentioning " poke-rime " in fashionable society ! " Tell her she must dance ' Little Zephyrs , ' or you 'll send her right back , " suggested Prudy , who was famous for thinking of the right thing at the right time , and so making awkward affairs pass off well . " Yes , Fly , come out in the floor , and dance ' Little Zephyrs ' this minute , or you must go back to bed . " Anything for the sake of staying down stairs . Hardly conscious of the strange faces about her , the child flew into the middle of the room , rubbed some more sleep out of her eyes , and began to sing ,  --  " Little zephyrs , light and gay , First to tell us of the spring . " She seemed to float on air . There was not a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tuft of hair a-top of her head to the soles of her twinkling boots . Now here , now there , head nodding , hands waving , feet flying . " Encore , " cried the delighted hostess . " Please , darling , let us hear that last verse again . " Mrs. Pragoff was curious to know what sort of jargon she made of the lines ,  --  " Where the modest violets grow , And the fair anemone . " Fly repeated it with an exquisite sweetness which charmed the whole house :  --  " Where the modest vilets grow , And the fairy men no more know me . " " The fairies do all know you , darling . " exclaimed Mrs. Pragoff , kissing her rapturously . " Your feet are more light than a faery 's feet , Who dances on bubbles where brooklets meet . " " There ! Dancing on bubbles ! " said Prudy aside to Horace . " That 's just what I always wanted to call it , but never knew how . " On the whole it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason to regret having given the little party . Everybody went to bed happy but Dotty , who could not shut her eyes without seeing the blaze of two rings , which burned into her brain . CHAPTER X. RIDING ON JACK FROST . Fly slept in a little cot beside her hostess 's bed . Mrs. Pragoff , poor lady , reclined half the night on her elbow , watching the child 's breathing ; but , to her inexpressible relief , nothing happened that was at all alarming . Fly only waked once in the night , and asked in a drowsy tone , " Have I got a measle ? " But just as Mrs. Pragoff was enjoying a morning nap , a pair of little feet went pricking over the floor , towards the girls ' room , but soon returned , and a sweet young voice cried ,  --  " O , Miss Perdigoff , I ca n't wake up Dotty ! " " Ca n't wake her , child ! " " No 'm , I ca n't ; nor Prudy ca n't : we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at once , with a new cause for alarm . " Why , what does this mean ? Did you try hard to wake her ? " " Yes 'm ; I shaked her . " Mrs. Pragoff now remembered , with terror , that there had been a little trouble with Dotty 's windpipe . Could she have choked to death ? Rising instantly , she threw on her wrapper , and was hurrying across the passage , when Fly added ,  --  " ' Haps she 'll let you wake her ; she would n't let me ' n ' Prudy . " " You little mischief , is that what you mean ? She wo n't let you wake her ? " " No 'm , she wo n't , " replied artless Fly ; " she said she would n't be bovvered . " Mrs. Pragoff went to bed again , laughing at her own folly . Dotty , it seems , was feeling very much like a bitter-sour apple . It had always been a peculiarity of hers to visit her own sins upon other people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter was , but knew , from experience , it was safest to ask no questions . " I 'm going back to auntie 's , this morning . " " Why , Dotty , Uncle Augustus and auntie wo n't be home till night . Mrs. Pragoff said she would take us to the Park and the Museum , you know . " " I do n't care how much you go to parks and museums , Prudy ; I want to be at home long enough to get my hair brushed and put away my things . " Prudy looked up in surprise ; but the rousing-bell sounded , and both the little girls had as much as they could do to get ready for breakfast . When Mrs. Pragoff met them in the parlor , she saw two lovely dimples playing in Dotty 's cheeks ; for the child was old enough , and had pride enough , to conceal her disagreeable feelings from strangers . All very well , only she might have carried the concealment a little farther , and spared poor Prudy much discomfort . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ younger sister 's temper was greatly improved . For a year or two she had scarcely been known to get seriously angry , and Prudy did not mind a sharp retort now and then , or even an hour 's sulks . While Dotty sipped her chocolate from a cup so delicate that it looked like a gilded bubble , she was wondering how she could get home . She did not know the way , and could not ask any one to go with her without making up an excuse . " I could say I am sick , but that would n't be true , and me eating muffins and honey . I 'm afraid ' twas n't quite true last night . I did feel rather funny , though , in my windpipe , now honest . " There seemed to be no other way but to wait and go home with the rest of the children . Dotty tried to think there might be time enough , after all , to find the rings . They started for the Park . " May I depend upon you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your little sister ! " said Mrs. Pragoff , fastening her ermine cloak with fingers which actually trembled ; " I confess I have n't the courage ; and I see you understand managing her perfectly . " Of course Horace always expected to take care of Topknot . He would gladly have done a much harder thing for a lady who was so polite , and appreciated him so well . Mrs. Pragoff gave a hand to Prudy and Dotty , saying gayly , as they all five took a car for the Park ,  --  " ' Sound the trumpet , beat the drum ; Tremble , France ; we come ! we come ! ' " There was just enough snow to whiten the ground , but none to spare . Everybody was determined to make the most of it while it lasted , and the Park was full of people sleigh-riding . It was really a wonderful sight . There were miles and miles of sleighs of all sorts , shaped like sea-shells , cradles , boats , water-lilies , or any other fanciful things . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they looked like long lines of rainbows . Many of the horses had silver-mounted harnesses , and on their necks stood up little silver trees , branching out into sleigh-bells , and sprinkling the air with merry music . " See , children , let us ride in this beautiful sleigh ; it is shaped like a Spanish gondola , and we ought to have music as we float . " " Fly can sing the ' Shepherd 's Pipe coming over the Mountains , ' " said Dotty ; and forthwith the child began to warble the softest , sweetest music from her wonderful little throat . Dotty queried privately why it should be called the shepherd 's pipe : how could a shepherd smoke while he sang ? " O , how beautiful ! " said everybody , when the music ceased . They meant that everything was beautiful . The air was so balmy , and the sky so soft , that you might fancy the sun was walking in his sleep , writing his dreams on the white clouds . " Splendid ! " exclaimed Fly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flying-fish , and trying to dive head first out of the gondola . " Tell me , children , if you do n't think our Park is very fine ? " " Yes 'm , " was the faint reply in chorus . " Why do n't you say , ' We never saw the like before ? ' " " O , we have , you know , ma'am , " said Prudy ; " it 's just like riding round Willow-brook . " " Fie ! do n't tell me there 's anything so beautiful in Maine ! I expect you to be enchanted every step of the way . Look at this pond , with , the swans sailing on it . " " O , yes ; those are beauties , " cried Dotty ; " I never saw any but cotton flannel ones before . But do you think the pond is as pretty as Bottomless Pond , Prudy , where Uncle Henry goes for pitcher-plants ? " " You prosy little creature , " said Mrs. Pragoff , laughing ; " I am afraid you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should . " Dotty thought this was certainly a jest . " Pity there 's so many . Why do n't they hire men to dig ' em up by the roots ? " Horace smiled on Dotty patronizingly . " They 'll do it some time , Dot . The Park is new . Things ca n't be finished in a minute , even in New York . " Mrs. Pragoff smiled quietly , but was too polite to tell Horace the rocks had been brought there as an ornament , at great expense . " I like the Park , if it is n't finished , " said Prudy , summoning all her enthusiasm ; " I know you 'll laugh , Horace , but I like it better for the rocks ; they make it look like home . " The ride would have seemed perfect to everybody ; only a wee sleigh passed them , drawn by a pair of goats , and Fly thought at once how much better a " goat-hossy " must be than a " growned-up hossy , that did n't have no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that at last she could contain herself no longer . " There was little girls in that pony-sleigh , Miss Perdigoff , with a boy a-drivin . ' ' Haps they 'd let me go , too , if you asked ' em , Miss Perdigoff . My mamma do n't ' low me to trouble nobody , and I sha n't ; only I thought I 'd let you know I wanted to go , Miss Perdigoff . " Mrs. Pragoff laughed heartily , and thought Fly should certainly have a ride , " ahind the goat-horses ; " but it was not possible , as the cunning little sleigh was engaged for hours in advance . A visit to the Zoological Gardens comforted the little one , however , after she got over her first fear of the animals . There they saw a vulture , like a lady in a cell , looking sadly out of a window , the train of her grey and brown dress trailing on the ground . Horace thought of Lady Jane Grey in prison . There was a white stork holding his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . A red macaw peeling an apple with his bill . Brown ostriches , like camels , walking slowly about , as if they had great care on their minds . Green monkeys biting sticks and climbing bars . A spotted leopard , licking his feet like a cat . A fierce panther , looking out of a window in the same discontented mood as the vulture . " See him stoop down , " said Dotty ; " he makes as much bones of himself as he can . " A horned owl , with eyes like auntie 's when she looks " ' stonished . " An eagle , with a face , Horace said , like a very cute lawyer . A " speckled bear , " without any spectacles . A " nelephant " like a great hill of stone , and a baby " nelephant , " with ears like ruffled aprons . An anaconda that " kept making a dandelion of himself . " A great grizzly bear hugging a young grizzly daughter . " Who made that grizzle ? " asked Fly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I would n't !  - -  Miss Perdegoff , which does God love best , great ugly grizzles or hunkydory little parrots ? " " O , fie ! " said Mrs. Pragoff , really shocked ; " where did a well-bred child like you ever hear such a coarse word as that ? " " Hollis says hunkydory , " replied Fly , with her finger in her mouth , while Horace pretended to be absorbed in a monkey . Mrs. Pragoff turned the subject . " Tell me , children , which do you consider the most wonderful animal you have ever seen ? " " The lion , " replied Prudy . " The whale , " said Dotty . " Which do you , Mrs. Pragoff ? " " This sort of animal , that thinks , " replied the lady , touching Dotty 's shoulder : " this shows the most amazing power of all . " " You do n't mean to call me an animal , " said Dotty , with a slight shade of resentment in her voice . " Why , little sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't you know we are all animals that breathe ? " " O , are we ? Then I do n't care , " said Dotty , and serenely followed the others up stairs , " where the dried things were . " Next they went to Wood 's Museum , and saw greater wonders still . The " Sleeping Beauty , " dreaming of the Prince , with lips just parted and breath very gently coming and going . Dotty would not believe at first that her waxen bosom palpitated by clockwork . There were distorted mirrors , which Horace held Flyaway up to peep into , that he might enjoy her bewilderment when she saw her face twisted into strange shapes . The Cardiff Giant , which Horace said " you might depend upon was a hoax . " An Egyptian dromedary , which Fly " just knew " had a sore throat ; and a stuffed gorilla in " buffalo coat and leather gloves . " Then they had a lunch at Delmonico 's , quite as good , Prudy admitted , " as what you found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dismay , they went to the Academy of Design , and criticised pictures . The statue of Eve Horace regarded with some contempt . " No wonder she did n't know any better than to eat the apple ! What do you expect of a woman with such a small head as that ? Look here who do you suppose was Eve 's shoemaker ? Cain ? " " Shoemaker ? Why , Horace , she 's barefoot . " " So she is , now , Dot ; but she 's worn shoes long enough to cramp her toes . " " Strange I never noticed that before , " said Mrs. Pragoff . " I think the sculptor ought to know your criticism , Master Horace . " " She 's a woman that understands what a boy is worth , " thought Horace , very much flattered . " Tell you what , I never saw a more sensible person than Mrs. Pragoff . " " Now , dears , shall we go to Stewart 's ? " " O , no 'm ; please do n't , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , checking herself , " their curtains are all down ; and do n't you s'spose Mr. Stewart and the clerks have gone off somewhere ? " Mrs. Pragoff laughed , but , concluding the child was very tired , proposed going home ; and , to Dotty 's great joy , they started at once . " I shall so grieve to part with you ! " said Mrs. Pragoff , as they went along . " I wish you were mine to keep , every soul of you . " But Dotty noticed that while she spoke she was looking at Prudy . CHAPTER XI . THE JEWEL CABINET . Alas for the diamond and the ruby rings ! New York is " a city of magnificent distances , " and by the time the children were safely at home , there was a great stir through the house . Colonel Allen and wife had come . Too late now to think of hunting for anything . " Where are my little folks ? " rang Uncle Augustus 's cheery voice through the hall ; and in he came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were as black as ever , and he carried just as much flesh on his tall , large frame . Somehow , he cheered one 's heart like an open fire . So did Aunt Madge . There was n't so much of her in size , but there was what you might call a " warm tone " over her whole face , which made you think of sunshine and fair weather . So in walked " an open fire " and a " ray of sunshine , " and " took off their things . " Of course there were laughing and kissing ; and Fly , without being requested , hugged Uncle ' Gustus like a little " grizzle . " " Sorry I cried so ' bout you bein ' sick . Did n't ' spect you 'd get well . " " Beg pardon for disappointing you . How many tears , did you waste , little Crocodile ? Why , children , you 're as welcome , all of you , as crocuses in spring . But no ; it 's you who should bid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and auntie and I have come visiting ? " " O , no , no , no , " cried Prudy ; " we 've got all over that ; and I tell you , auntie , now you 've come home , I feel as if an elephant had rolled right off my heart . " " Why , I hope nothing serious has happened , " said Mrs. Allen , looking at the pile of nutshells Fly had just dropped on the carpet , and at Dotty 's cloak , which lay beside Horace 's cap on the piano-stool . " Yes 'm , there is sumpin happened , " spoke up Fly from the floor , where she sat with " chestnuts in her lap , and munched , and munched , and munched . " " I 've had the fever , but I did n't die in it . " " She was n't much sick , auntie ; but it frightened us . Mrs. Fixfax rolled her up six yards deep in blankets , and we thought ' what is home without a mother ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know the least thing about cooking , for all I pretended . I tell you , auntie , it 's very different not to have anybody to ask how to do things . " " Such messes , you ought to seen ' em , auntie , " struck in Dotty , without the least pity . " Pshaw ! we did n't starve , nor anywhere near it , " cried Horace . " I would n't say anything , Dot , for Prue worked like a Trojan , and you dawdled round with rings on your thumbs . " At the mention of rings , Dotty blushed , and stole a glance at Mrs. Allen . " See , auntie , " said she , taking off her rosary , " this is my Christmas present ; but it does n't make me a Catholic -- does it ? " " How beautiful , my child ! A full rosary of one hundred and fifty beads . It is called ' a chaplet of spiritual roses . ' Red , white , and damask . Pray , who could have given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from Poland . Now do n't you know ? Sleeps with a feather bed over her , covered with satin . " " Mrs. Pragoff ? You have n't been to her house ? " " Yes 'm , we did , and to her church in Trinity ; and she made a party for us , and we staid all night . " " That 's a remarkable joke , " said Colonel Allen , rubbing his hands . " She must have had a bee in her bonnet with all these rollicking children round her . " " No 'm , she never ; but I had the nosy-bleed on the pew-quishon awful . Had to be tookened home . Did n't eat no supper . " " You do n't tell me there was a scene in church , " cried Aunt Madge , looking at Uncle Augustus , who rubbed his hands again , and laughed heartily . " How happened you to go , Horace ? " " It was n't my doings , auntie . Topknot had been lying in a steam all night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go out of the house ; but no attention was paid to what I said . Notice was served on me to take the little thing off visiting , and I had to obey . But I tell you I was thankful she did n't do anything worse than to bump her nose , though she did scream murder , and we followed her out in a straight line . " " And this transpired at Trinity Church , " said Colonel Allen , intensely amused . " Rather severe for a woman who worships Saint Grundy . " " Saint who ? I thought she was queer , or she would n't run away , " said Dotty , much shocked . " Fie , Augustus ! " said Aunt Madge , who was laughing herself . " I would n't have had this happen on any account . Mrs. Pragoff asked me , before the children came , if I would let them visit her ; but I gave her no decided answer ; thought , perhaps I might go with them just to drink tea . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! And her house so full of elegant little trifles ! How much did Fly break ? " " Nothing , auntie , " replied Horace . " I did n't let her stir but I was after her . I flatter myself I saved considerable property . " " There , Margery , do n't mind it , " said Uncle Augustus . " Mrs. Pragoff needed all this mortification to humble her pride . Come here , Fly ; here 's a bonbon for you . They say you are going about doing good without any more intention of it than the goose that saved Rome . " " That reminds me to inquire , " said Aunt Madge , " if Fly 's blind girl came that day ? " " Yes , auntie , and she was so sorry you were gone ; but they will be here again to-morrow . " " It was too bad to disappoint her , " said Aunt Madge , with such lovely pity in her face that Prudy seized one of her hands and kissed it . " I tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I always thought Mrs. Pragoff must be queer as soon as I heard she came from Poland , where grandma 's cropple-crown hen came from ; do n't you remember , Prudy ? the one that hatched the duck 's eggs . But I did n't know she worshipped things . Only I noticed that she did n't buy any black pins when those pitiful little boys ran after us , and said , ' O , lady ! please , lady ! ' I thought that was mean . " " Miss Dotty Dimple , come sit on my knee , and let me explain . Mrs. Pragoff is no heathen . She only loves to dress elegantly , and your auntie and I sometimes think she cares too much about it , and about what other people say . That was what I meant by her ' worshipping Saint Grundy ; ' but it was ill-natured of me to criticise her . As for the black pins , she is a remarkably benevolent woman , Puss ; but she ca n't buy black pins all the time ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Fly , what now ? " The child had snapped her bonbon , and , instead of candy , had found a red paper riding cap trimmed with gold fringe ; with this on her head , she was climbing the drop-light , a la monkey . Fortunately the gas had been lighted only in the chandelier ; but three inches more , and Fly 's gold tassels would have been on fire . Uncle Augustus rose in alarm ; but Horace laughed , believing the little witch could be trusted to keep out of fire and water . After dinner , as they were returning to the parlor , Uncle Augustus said to his wife ,  --  " Between us , Margery , I do n't believe you 'd dare invite that little will-o ' - the- wisp here again without her mother . " " Never , " returned auntie , laughing ,  --  " ' Till a ' the seas gang dry , my dear , And the rocks melt wi ' the sun . ' " They all sat chatting around the parlor fire ,  - -  Uncle Augustus always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unobserved , and went round the house hunting for the lost rings . She went first to auntie 's chamber , and looked in the blue pocket ; but it was empty . The wardrobe and closet had been restored to perfect order , and the jewel cabinet was not to be seen . Then she went slowly along to the housekeeper 's room , and knocked , with her heart in her mouth . " How do you do , Mrs. Fixfax ? Is n't it nice to get that old stove out ? I thought you 'd let me come in and look to see if I've -- I 've left anything . " " Certainly , dear . What have you lost ? " Mrs. Fixfax went on with her reading , and did not seem to hear Dotty 's muttered answer about " running round so when Fly was sick . Did n't know but she 'd put -- was n't sure.  - -  Guessed not . " " Why , you see , " said Dotty , to herself , as she left the room with downcast eyes , " it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stove 's gone . Nothing in the bathroom but soap and towels . I believe auntie 's cat has swallowed those rings . " She went back to Mrs. Allen 's room , turned the gas higher , and looked mournfully at herself in the glass . " Shall I tell her the truth , that they 're gone , and I lost them ? Would my dear Aunt Madge go and take all father 's money away ? Mother says we must do what is right , and God will take care of the rest . " Just then Fly entered , followed by Mrs. Allen . " You here , Dotty ? I see my chamber is in excellent order . Let me look at the drawers . What ? My jewel cabinet ? Did n't I lock that in the safe ? All right , no doubt , but I 'll examine it . " She wheeled up a little easy-chair , sat down , and poured the jewels into her lap . What were Dotty 's feelings as she stood there looking on ? The gas-light seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Dotty could not help gazing . Why , what was that ? Did her eyes deceive her ? That ring with glass raspberry seeds ! And , O , was it possible ? The one like a drop of blood with ice frozen over it ! Both there . She learned afterwards that Mrs. Fixfax had found the rings in the bottom of the ivory bathing-tub , where Fly had had her " turkey wash . " Hark ! Auntie was counting : " One , two , three , four . All safe . Not that I supposed any one would meddle with my cabinet , of course . " " Auntie , " burst forth Dotty , her face tingling with shame , " I did . I wore two of those rings , and lost ' em off my thumbs . I do n't see how they ever came back in that cabinet , for the only thing I know certain true is , I never put ' em there . O , auntie , if I had't found ' em , I was ' most afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so poor . " " Child , child , you would n't have deceived me ? I could bear anything better than that . And , Dotty , I do n't believe it of you . You would have told the truth . " " Yes , auntie , I do guess I should . It 's better to eat fried pork than to act out a lie . " What the truth had to do with eating fried pork , Aunt Madge could not imagine ; but she assured Dotty she fully believed her when she promised not to meddle in future ; and the child bounded down stairs with a heart like a bubble . Fly had come up to go to bed . " I 've found sumpin , " cried she , peeping into a basket behind the door . " It 's got eyes , and I know it 's a doggie . " " You little rogue ! I did n't mean you should see that dog to-night . " " O , it 's no matter ' bout me . If Dotty 'd seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The quick-witted child knew just as well then as she did next morning , that the dog -- a King Charles spaniel -- was intended for her . Mrs. Allen was so amused that she could scarcely sing Fly 's by-low hymn :  - -  -  " Sleep , little one , like a lamb in the fold . Shut from the tempest , safe from the cold ; Sleep , little one , like a star in the sky , Wrapped in a cloud , while the storm-wind sweeps by . " It was quite as hard to keep a grave face when Fly added to her evening prayer the petition ,  --  " God f'give me speakin ' a naughty word ' fore Miss Perdigoff . " " What naughty word , darling ? " " Hunkydory , " replied Fly , with a deep sense of guilt . Not that she thought it wrong to use a coarse word , only wrong to use it " ' fore Miss Perdigoff . " Aunt Madge entered into a short explanation of the true nature of right and wrong ; but her words were thrown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nook and corner of Fly 's little mind . CHAPTER XII . " FOLDED EYES . " " Folded eyes see brighter colors Than the open ever do . " It stormed next day ; but as " brooks do n't mind the weather , " Maria and her mother appeared again . When Aunt Madge went down to see them , Maria was sitting near the dining-room door , the scarlet spots of excitement coming and going in her cheeks . She could think of nothing but the wonderful , unknown doctor , who would know in one moment whether she could ever see or not . " We had n't ought to have come in this snow-storm , ma'am , " said Mrs. Brooks ; " but poor Maria , she could n't be denied . She said she must come , whether or no . But of course we do n't hold you to your promise , ma'am , and I hope you do n't think we 're that sort of folks . " While Mrs. Brooks was talking , with her nose moving up and down , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quick ears eager to catch the first sound of her voice . What if the word should be No ? But Aunt Madge was never known to break a child 's heart . " Who minds a snow-storm ? " said she , gayly . " I love it as well as any snow-bird . I am very sorry you were disappointed the other day . I 'll have my wraps on in two minutes . " The children watched from the bay-window as John came round with the carriage , and the three ladies got in . " She 's a rare one , " remarked Horace , with a sweep of his thumb . " Who ? Maria ? " " No , Dot ; the one in front ; the handsomest woman in the city of New York . Tell you what , ' tis n't everybody would go round and look up the poor the way she does ; and she rich as mud , too . " " Why , Horace , that 's the very reason she ought to do it . What would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Poh ! " said Horace , with a look of unspeakable wisdom . " Much as you know , Prue . Rich people are the stingiest in the world . The fact is , the more you have , the more you do n't give away . " " O , what a story ! " said Dotty . " The more I have , the more I do -- I mean I shall , if I ever get my meeting-house full . " Horace laughed heartily . " What 'd I say now , Horace Clifford ? " " I was only thinking , Dot , that 's what 's the matter with everybody ; they 're waiting to get their meeting-houses full . " Dotty did not understand the remark , but thought it safe to pout . " I ca n't help thinking about that poor Maria , " said Prudy . " Do you suppose , Horace , the doctor can help her ? " " Yes , I presume he can . It will probably take him about five minutes , " replied Master Horace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his days . " But do you suppose he 'll do it for nothing ? Not if he knows it . He 'll see the carriage , and find out auntie has money ; and then wo n't he make her pay over ? Just the way with ' em , Prue . He 's one of these doctors that 's rolling in gold . " " Rollin ' in gold , " repeated Fly , thinking how hard that must be for him , and how it would hurt . But Horace was quite mistaken . The doctor did not say one word about money . He asked Mrs. Brooks to tell him just how and when Maria had begun to grow blind . And though she made a tedious story of it , he listened patiently till she said ,  --  " Now , doctor , I am poor , and we 've been unfortunate , and I do n't know as I shall be able to pay you , and I --  " " No matter for that , my good woman . I sha n't charge you one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money . It 's my business to talk about eyes . Lead the child to the window . " The scarlet spots in Maria 's cheeks faded , leaving her very pale . She held her breath . Would the doctor ever stop pulling open her eyelids ? It was not half a minute , though . Then he spoke :  --  " Madam , are you willing to do exactly as I say ? Can you both be patient ? If so , I have hope of this child . " Maria swayed forward at these words , and Mrs. Allen caught her in her arms . Mrs. Brooks ran around in a maze , crying , " We 've killed her ! we 've killed her ! " and wildly took up a case of instruments , to do , she knew not what ; but the doctor stopped her , and dashed a little water in Maria 's face . When the dear little girl came out of her swoon , she was murmuring to herself ,  --  " I thought God would be willing ! I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any one heard her . Mrs. Brooks rushed up to her . " You are the best man alive , Maria , " said she . Then she turned to the doctor , calling him " my dear little girl , " and might have kissed him if he had not laughed . " Why , I beg your pardon , sir , " cried she , blushing . " I do n't believe I know what I am about . " " I do n't believe you do , either , so I 'll give my message to this other lady . I want the little girl to come again to-morrow without fail . It is well I saw her so soon . A few weeks longer , and she could not have been helped . " " You do n't say so , doctor ! And I never thought of coming . I should n't have stirred a step if it had n't been for this good , kind Mrs. Allen . O , what an amazing world this is ! " " And you know , Mrs. Brooks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have heard of you if my baby niece had n't run away . As you say , it is an amazing world ! " " And there 's One above who rules it , " said the doctor , as he bowed them out . " Yes , there 's One above who rules it , " thought happy Maria , riding home in the carriage . " If I 've asked Him once , I 've asked Him five thousand times , and somehow I knew He 'd attend to it after a while . " " O , what did the doctor say to her ? What did he do ? " cried the children , the moment their aunt appeared in the parlor . " He says he can cure her if she will only be patient . " Prudy screamed for joy . " O , dear ! why did n't he cure her right off ? " cried Dotty . " We s'posed she was seeing like everything . " " Why , child , do you expect things are going to be done by steam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would take about five minutes . " Well , if he did n't had no steam , he could ' a ' tookened the sidders , and picked ' em open , " sniffed Fly , who had great contempt for slow people . " Ah , little Hopelover , " laughed auntie , " you 're like us grown folks all the world over , scolding about what you do n't understand . " * * * * * A few more days were spent in uninterrupted happiness . Fly declared " Santa Claus is a darlin ' , " when she received the King Charles spaniel , which , by the way , had not been purchased without the full consent of Horace , who was even willing , for his little sister 's sake , to take him home in the cars . The youth , in his turn , was made happy by the gift of a silver-mounted rifle ; while Prudy rejoiced in a rosewood writing desk , and Dotty in a gold pen . " All 's well that ends well . " Uncle Augustus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good as most fairy stories . Fly had the kindness to " stay found " for the rest of the visit , and did not even take another cold . Dotty was unmixed sweetness . Maria came every day with such a beaming face that it was delightful to see her . Mrs. Pragoff asked for all their photographs , and gave the Parlins some Polish mittens to carry home to their mother . " I s'pose you know , " said Dotty , privately to Prudy , " there 's not another girl at my school been to New York , and treated with such attention ; but O , I tell you , I sha n't be proud . I shall always love Tate Penny just the same . " When the day came to separate , it went hard with them all . " Just as we got to having a good time , " said Dotty , her face in a hard knot . " But we shall all meet next summer , " said Prudy , hopefully . " I do n't want to wait , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back hair and the rest of her body .
