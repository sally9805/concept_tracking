VIII. - Thatcher 's Indian Biography . Indian Biography . By B. B. THATCHER , Esq . New York . J. &amp; J. Harper . 1832 . This is a very interesting chapter in the history of man ; and no one will read this work , without acknowledging that the subject has fallen into the right hands . There is much to awaken interest and sympathy in the character of this unfortunate race , who , with manners and habits essentially savage , exhibited some traits of refined and elevated feeling , and who , when brought into direct contrast with cultivated men , were , in some respects , able to put civilization to shame . For such a people , once great and powerful , to pass away from the soil possessed by them and their fathers ; for those , who once made others tremble , to dwindle away to weak and helpless remnants , scattered here and there upon the face of a country , changed in such a manner , as to make their destruction sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persons , who feel most interested to oppress them , is a destiny well calculated to excite the compassion of those , whose benevolence is not limited to family or nation , but comprehends alike the Samar // 473 itan and the Jew . But to carry this feeling so far , as to express regret that civilization has extended ; to maintain , that it would have been better that the country should still be a hunting ground , instead of being divided into cities and villages ; to speak , as if the accidental vices of civilized life are so many and great , that barbarism would be better , is carrying this sympathy much farther than good sense and reason would be disposed to go . Wherever civilization comes in conflict with barbarism , we mean , with a race which has no active principle of improvement within it , it is the order of nature that barbarism shall give way ; the savage either ceases to be a savage , or retreats before the rising flood ; justice and humanity do not require the civilized to conform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for in that case , no room on earth would ever have been f&amp;und for cultivated man . But justice and humanity do require , that the rights of the weaker party shall be respected , that no advantage shall be taken of superior strength to injure nor oppress them ; that avenues shall be opened , by which they may enter into the privileges of civilization if they will ; and that civilization shall be recommended to them in every possible way , instead of being associated in their minds with violence and wrongs . We do not hold our fathers responsible for the extinction of the Indian race , for we see not how it could have been prevented ; but we fear that there were instances , in which they violated the laws ofjustice and humanity in their dealings with their neighbors , and if so , the other party should not labor under perpetual reproach for the sake of vindicating their reputation . There is enough in their character of which their descendants may reasonably be proud , and if they deserve blame in this instance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charged upon them be investigated , for sympathy in such cases is poorly qualified to act the judicial part ; it takes too much for granted , and trusts as readily to feeling , as to evidence and examination . Mr. Thatcher has touched these cases with a delicate and discriminating hand ; in a popular narrative , he could not enter into the subject very largely ; we would suggest to his consideration , whether a work of permanent value as an authority is not required . The separate sketches of tribes and individuals , which he has given , might easily be woven into a philosophical history , and it would give us pleasure to see it done by one so industrious and impartial , who has the talent withal ofgiving it so much attraction . VOL* Xxxvl. - No. 79. 60 // We do not by any means admit , that the Indians met with such treatment from our fathers as they have met with in later times , in a case already too well known to the world , and justified only by those who are blinded by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do them substantial justice , and if they failed , it was owing to jealousy and suspicion ; it was not because they coveted their lands and were willing to descend to base means to possess them . When such cases are represented as in all respects the same , and attempts are made to involve the pilgrims in such a condemnation , it is time to repel the charge and to show their injustice if they were guilty of any thing mean , avaricious and grasping ; to show also , that if their jealousy of the Indians made them unjust to them , they stood in a relation to them in which no people can ever stand again . Much may be forgiven to their feeling of weakness ; they did not presume upon their power . In the first place , they held the Indians in fear ,  --  a passionx which always leads to the borders at least of inhumanity . Cruelty arises more directly from this feeling than from any other . Those who live in security may not be able to conceive it , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revenge is always strong in proportion to the fears ; and when the same alarm , which sexes the tender and delicate woman , and petrifles the colder heart of man , grows into a panic , and spreads throughout a community , the effect is like that of a demoniacal possession . This was powerfully illustrated in the case of witchcraft ; the universal fear , heightened by the mysteriousness of the danger , could not be quenched without blood ; and even within the last year , we have seen the fear of a pestilential disease lead to acts of gross and enormous inhumanity , which , but the day before , would have been pronounced impossible in the present age of the world . There can be no doubt , that the first settlers of the country regarded the Indians with great and constant dread ; not that they feared acts of personal violence from individuals ; these , they felt themselves able to resist and put down ; but when they looked upon the tribes about them , whose numbers and bounds they could not possibly know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and jealous impatience of wrongs ; when they saw the stern reserve of many of the chiefs , and felt how easy it would be to unite all in the common cause of expelling the stranger , they evidently dreaded their rising in the greatness of their strength ; they felt like men , embarked in slight vessels on the ocean , who // fear nothing in the sunshine , hut tremble at the most distant breathings of the storm . This distinction is not made , as it should be , between immediate and foreboding fears ; and be .. cause the Indians were regarded with indifference , like every thing familiar , even familiar dangers , it is often supposed that our fathers felt perfectly secure against them ; but if they did not regard the danger as pressing , they feared that it might at any time come , and when they thought it actually on the way , they had only the resource of desperation , which was to anticipate the blow . It was necessary for them to be on their guard , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspicion should be over-active , rather than suffered to sleep . As they knew themselves unable to resist a combined assault of all the tribes , or even the determined hostility of one , they could only ward off the stroke , by attempting to disable the uplifted arm . If they sometimes suspected without cause , and acted with excessive rigor , it was evidently no more than was natural in the position in which they stood . But we do not believe that , in any part of our country at present , the Indians are held in similar dread ; they know perfectly well , that an act of violence on their part is suicide to themselves ; when therefore the fear of the Indians is pleaded as an excuse for violence at the present day , we see manifest and sufficient reason , for not allowing it to shelter itself under the example of our fathers . Another circumstance , which goes far to justify their conduct where it needs justification , is their religious feeling . they could do no more than follow the injunctions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and we can not censure them severely for mistaking its commands , if all the rest of the world was in similar delusion . For the same reason , we can not charge them with intolerance , if it appears that toleration was hardly known or practised in the world at the time ; because there is no reason why we should expect to find them exempt from such prejudices , as enslaved the minds of others . It may be asked , if others being bad made them better ; certainly it did ; for excellence is a comparative thing , and it makes an essential difference , whether we compare them with the standard of their own time , or with that of an age when the Scripture is better interpreted , and moral obligations better understood . They believed , that they saw in the Scriptures a history very nearly resembling their own ; they believed that the Hebrews were commanded to exterminate the // inhabitants of the promised land ; and so far from its being a crime to pursue that purpose with unrelenting rigor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that devoted people . Without making any distinction between the Hebrew religion and the Hebrew nation ; without observing whether Moses spoke in that instance as a statesman , or as a teacher of divine truth ; without asking whether the conduct of the Israelites fairly represented the spirit of their sacred law , they at once adopted that people as their example , and felt safe in imitating their actions both in peace and war . Now , we see that many enlightened persons at the present day identify the Hebrew practice with their religion , and taking it for granted that their religion sanctioned all that they did , make this assumption an argument against the divine origin of their religion ; if this is done now , by those who consider themselves free from prejudice , what wonder is it , that the same impression should have prevailed two centuries ago , in those who were looking into the Scripture to ascertain what to do , in a situation so new and difficult as that into which our fathers were thrown . We , no doubt , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impulse of passion , believing it to be the inspiration of the Almighty , as Christians have often done ; but why should they be expected to discern this fact , at a time when it was hidden from all the rest of the world ? But we would not give the impression that they copied this example to the letter ; it was only in times of violent excitement , that they resorted to harsh measures . Indeed , we do not know where any other men , placed in similar circumstances , have conducted themselves with more forbearance and mercy ; assuredly it was not in Mexico nor South America ; and if it be said , that William Penn acted on wiser and more benevolent principles , it must be remembered that his experiment was not made till half a century after theirs , and moreover , his colony was from the beginning prosperous and strong . Again , it must not be forgotten , that the Indians were a savage people . Though we , from observing the whole course of their history , arrive at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high-minded race , distinguished by . respect for age , by kindness to the unfortunate , and hospitality to all , these virtues are such as are almost always found in the uncivilized state ,  --  a state with which it is extremely 4 difficult for civilization , however well disposed , to live on friendly terms . Their virtues also were generally of the warlike // kind ; such as made them formidable not only as enemies , but as friends ; and their strongest advocates will not deny , that they had at times a taste for cruelty and torture , which could not be otherwise than disgusting to those who might possibly become subjects of their skill . The Indian character , which has been so often recommended to poetical imaginations as a subject of art , affords but few varieties of expression and feeling ; - it is hke the ocean , which has been thoroughly seen by those who have seen it in the tempest and the calm ,  --  it is doubtless a fine subject of contemplation , but when the poet said , that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would excuse those from enjoying it , who were within the reach of its waves . This was the case with our fathers . The Indian character , however remarkable and striking it might have been to a distant observer , was too near and threatening for them to regard it with much delight . Their writers said , and no doubt believed , that the land was covered with wild inhabitants , in whom the prince of the power of the air ' did work as a spirit . Satan took the alarm when he saw churches growing up in New England ; and believing the movement to be directly contrary to his interests , stirred up the minds of the savages to bloody and violent actions . Considering the Indians as his subjects , and as wholly under his influence , for there is no reason to doubt that the language of superstition was sincere , it is not at all surprising that the colonists should have regarded them with dislike and dread . The country was perpetually ringing with stories of their devil worship , ' and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their hands ; and these narratives , which we read so coolly as legendary tales , when they were thought of as things which had happened near them , and might soon happen again , inspired the deepest horror and aversion in the hearers of that day . We can not wonder that our fathers should have feared and disliked their neighbors : this , it is true , is no excuse for treating them ill ; but it may show why their suspicion was constantly awake , and why the severe reality of the Indian character , always near and always threatening , should have made them insensible to the savage virtues , and destroyed their relish for all Arcadian imaginations of the beauty and simplicity of the state of nature . One trait in the Indian character , which was made important by the situation of the two parties with respect to each other , was a haughty impatience of superiority . Even when // they made concessions to the English , they carefully reserved their own independence of action . This is oddly illustrated by one article of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abstain from labor on the sabbath ; they expressed their willingness to assent to the arrangement , inasmuch as they had not much to do on any day . ' There seems to have been no good reason why , with their foot on their native soil , ' they should have looked up to others , or suffered others to look down on them ; least of all could they have dreamed of accepting protection from the colonists , who seemed indebted to their kindness for a home , and to their forbearance for life . On the other hand , it was impossible for the English , exalted above them in intellectual improvement , and knowledge of all those arts and appliances which form the elements of power , to forhear using the language and manner of condescension , which are sufficiently expressive to all , and peculiarly so to Indians , who can not endure the least approach to contempt . Here was a fertile cause of unpleasant feeling , even without blame on either part . But the colonists increased the danger , by taking it for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ king ; one of those refinements in civil relations which they certainly could not understand , and which , had they understood it , would have been rejected with scorn . And in all their intercourse with the Indians they assumed a superiority , which must have had its effect in widening the separation caused by such collisions of individuals , as were constantly taking place , and could not possibly have been prevented . The high feeliilg of the other party is strikingly manifested by their willingness to give away their lands , but not to sell them . Massasoit the Wampanoag Sachem , in whose dominions the colonists of Plymouth established themselves , made his liberal grant to them without price or reward . We will not however extend these suggestions ; it is not necessary . We have no desire to justify our fathers , where they have done wrong . We only wish that the delicacy of their position may be taken into the account , by those who are disposed to judge them ; and moreover , we desire to ask those who can extend no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set of men in a similar situation would have conducted themselves better ; what community there is , whose feeling would have been more liberal on the whole ; what government , from which the Indians would have received less op // pression : and let them say what state or nation in modern times , with all the benefit of two centuries of improvement , would , if brought into similar contact , extend better treatment to that injured race . No one needs to be reminded of events , which make it evident that there is none . And then we assert , that if our fathers conducted themselves as well as any body of men in a similar situation ever has done , or could be reasonably expected to do , no charge lies against them which does not bear equally hard on human nature , on the whole race of civilized man . It is enough , if their moral feeling and action was pure and elevated , as that of any other set of men ever has been or is likely to be . But we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they dealt most severely with the Indians : this writer has stated them with great impartiality . He does not wish to vindicate our ancestors at the expense of truth and justice , nor does he let his sympathy for the weaker party make him insensible to what can be said in behalf of the other . He remembers that they judged from circumstances , which would he differently viewed by those who stood in different positions : there were many things in their situation to justify suspicion and even rigor , which can never occur again , and therefore can not be pleaded in defence of acts of modern oppression . Their most threatening conflict was with the Pequots , a warlike tribe residing within the hounds of Connecticut ; they had waged war upon the Indians round them , subduing some and expelling others , till their name carried terror with it throughout the country . When the English came within their limits , and established themselves without leave asked or given , it was not unnatural that they should regard it as an intrusion ; with how much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we imagine colonists from another country pitching their tents in like manner among ourselves . It is no libel upon American hospitality to suggest , that they might possibly be looked upon with a jealous eye , at least by those who happened to be near them ; nor should we much wonder if some of our States should declare them under their jurisdiction , or , in other words , claim a right to seize their lands and possessions , and without actually driving them out , only treat them in such a manner that they could not possibly stay . But , as we have said , this refined process was unknown to the Indian law ; and it does not appear that they made any senous // attempts to dislodge the colonists , though it was impossible to avoid occasional provocations . The circumstance which interrupted this harmony , such as it was , appears to have been the murder of Capt . Stone , with his crew , on Connecticut River , in the summer of 1633 . A detailed account is given of the proceedings of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not appear ; the party interested left no survivor to tell their melancholy story , and the Pequots themselves gave a very different version of the affair . Sassacus , then chief , sent a deputation to the Gov-. governor of Massachusetts , desiring his friendship and alliance : he was told that before the English could treat with him , the murderers of Stone must be delivered up to justice . The envoys , without sending to their court for instructions , replied , that the small pox had destroyed all the murderers , so called , but two , who would doubtless be surrendered by Sassacus , if anything were proved against them . They alleged , that Stone had been guilty of most violent proceedings , and that , in the course of an affray which ensued , the vessel had been blown up , for what purpose they did not pretend to know . This account was given with such confidence , that , Governor Winthrop says , having no means of proving it false , we inclined to believe it . ' This is exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the story of the Indians was at least as likely to be true , as the suggestions of suspicion ; and it was confirmed moreover by what was known of the character of Stone , who , it appears , was before this banished from Massachusetts for piracy and other disgraceful crimes . Nor does it appear , that the suspicions of the colonists prevented their concluding a treaty on terms favorable to themselves . But in 1636 , one Oldham , a trader , was murdered by a party of Block Island Indians , some of whom were said to have found a shelter in the Pequot country . Upon this , the Governor of Massachusetts sent a party to Block Island , with orders to seize the place , to put to death the men , and bring away the women and children ; and after this object was effected , they were to proceed to the Pequots , and to demand the two murderers of Stone , together with one thousand fathom of wampum for damages . Since it does not appear that they had done any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay this enormous assessinent ; and certainly the whole proceeding was an insult , which so spirited a race could not be expected to bear . This enterprise was executed as much in the spirit of the Gospel , as it was // designed ; and after this , as might be supposed , there was no more friendly intercourse between the parties . Dr. Dwight , who defends the colonists with great vigor , and others on the same side , give the same account of these matters , though with a different coloring . They maintain that the Pequots were inveterate in their hostility to the English ; it is true that there is no proof of this , but it was evidently the same impression which influenced our fathers . They may possibly have had evidence of the hostile dispositions of the tribe ; but this evidence has not been recorded , and we must confess that , so far as we can discover , the inveterate enmity was on the other side . It is not surprising , that after the last mentioned expedition , they should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible ; hut up to that time their proceedings indicated , if not friendship , at least a disposition to avoid hostility with the English , and to derive advantage from them in the way of trade . It is painful , therefore , to read the account of the sanguinary war which followed ; the description of the storming of the Pequot fortress , when more than six hundred men , women , and children were shot down or perished in the flames ; the vessel , with its crew of victims on board , to be slain without the harbor ; the swamp , where the warriors cut their way through the English , leaving the more helpless , who were killed as they sat upon the ground , by putting the muzzles of the guns within a few yards of them ; the sending of the children to the Bermudas , or to other tribes , selected as most hostile to their fathers ; - these are passages in our history , which can only he justified by necessity ; and then , perhaps , it would hardly he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was created . It is evident , that our fathers labored under the impression that there could he no security for themselves , so long as this warlike tribe existed : judging from the circumstances under which they had established themselves near the Pequots , and the well-known pri ( le and fierceness of the race , one would say that this conclusion was just ; but at the same time , there are no acts or movements , on the part of the Indians , recorded , which strengthen it , or tend to prove that they would have been disposed to crush the settlements made within their bounds . As we can only judge from such evidence as remains in history , we must say that they appear to have been more sinned against than sinning : and yet there was probably no other set // 485 April7 of men , in that age , who , in the same circumstances , under the influence of the same apprehensions , would have acted differently from our fathers . The next charge against them respects their treatment of Miantonomo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one of the most powerful tribes in the country . Canonicus received Roger Williams , who was thrown upon his mercy , when driven from the Massachusetts and Plymouth jurisdictions ; it is true he received him reluctantly ; hut this only increases the merit of his subsequent kindness and hospitality . They were not at first disposed to be friendly to the Plymouth colony , hut afterwards their disposition changed , and they became important allies in the Pequot war . That war gave birth to a new power ; Uncas , Sachem of the Mohegans , a tribe which had been overshadowed by the Pequots , rose upon the downfall of that race ; and judging , probably from their fate , that it was for his interest to maintain frequent relations with the English , he made himself useful and important to them , caring little meantime on xvhat terms he stood with the neighboring tribes . Uncas and Miantonomo were both of service to the colonists in their war with Sassacus ; . and when it was ended , the two Sachems pledged themselves to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the feeling of rivals to continue at peace ; and it was not long before their jealousy found pretexts for breaking into *en war . The result of this conflict was , that Miantonomo was taken prisoner by the Mobegans ; and Uncas , on applying to the commissioners of the United Colonies , then assembled at Hartford , was authorized , so far as their advice and consent would go , to put his prisoner to death . It is easy to imagine the reasons which induced Uncas to leave the matter to their decision , though the question was sufficiently decided in the practice of the Indian law . He feared lest he might be called to account for proceeding in too summary a way , and thought that he might make the English the instruments of his revenge and ambition . But why they should have accepted the trust , is not so easily accounted for : if their desire had been simply to destroy Miantonomo , they might have left him in the hands of his rival , and thus have gained their point , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only proper course , . unless they followed a more generous principle , and took the opportunity to teach the savage what Christianity required him // to do . It appears that before this time , when the difficulties between the Narragansetts and Mohegans were growing up , Miantonomo had applied to the colonists to obtain for him redress from Uncas , knowing that their suggestion would be a law to their ally . The Connecticut people answered him graciously , that they had nothing to do with the business . He then applied to Governor Winthrop , and was told , in answer to his inquiry whether the colonists would take offence at his proceeding to take redress for himself , . - that if Uncas had wronged him , and would not give satisfaction , he might take his own way . It is remarkable , that when , owing probably to the arts of Uncas , he was strongly suspected , he came boldly to Boston , and demanded to be confronted with his accusers : he also offered to meet Uncas at any appointed place , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his rival . When he did meet him in Hartford , he invited Uncas to sup with him , which the other declined ; his whole bearing was that of a man , who knew that he was injuriously suspected , and was willing to make the English all the explanations in his power . There was something chivalrous in his feelings on these subjects . When he was in the custody of the Governor of Connecticut , he told that officer that the Narragansetts would make attempts for his rescue , and warned him to increase the guard ; he also made a present to Uncas , for the kind treatment he had received during his imprisonment . It is painful to think that a high chief like this was compelled to die the death of a dog , and that the English made themselves res p Onsil ) le for his doom . ft is impossible to acquit these commissioners of blame in this transaction , hut it does not readily appear what they were to gain hy taking an active part . If they could not use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one can doubt that their suggestion would have carried with it the force of a law , they had nothing to do , but to throw back the case upon Uncas 's own decision , which no doubt would have served their own purposes of revenge , if they had any , and would have relieved them at once from all their fears . After their professions of neutrality , it was not decent for them to interfere as judges , in a case where they had the feelings of a party . But we can more easily understand how they should have deceived themselves with respect to the demands of justice , in a case where they felt hound to regard the laws and habits of Indian warfare , than how they could take advantage of the // opportunity , against their conscience , for their own purposes of selfish vengeance and to shed innocent blood . We look upon it as a case of self-delusion , in which they were blinded in a measure by their wishes and fears : and they were still farther misled , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history , that the blood of an Indian was of little value . How easy it was for them to form this impression , appears from parallel cases in modern times , afforded by the wrongs of another injured race . Let any one read the proceedings of West Indian courts of justice , so called , and he will see how much less in value the life of an African is , than that of a man . We would not excuse such feelings : but it is but just to remember , that this was a prejudice from which no one was free . Mather says , that the colonists unanimously resolved that the Indians , that generation of vipers , should be exterminated from the country . We are not surprised to find , in the course of the history , that Canonchet , the son of Miantonomo , who after many years succeeded his father , should have been an enemy to the English name . The tribe were bound , according to their wild notions of duty , to avenge the death of their chief ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successors of Miantonoino could restrain their men . The colonists imposed severe terms upon them , and they evaded and resisted them as well as they could without open war : but when Philip 's coalitions began to agitate New England , the colonists determined to make the Narragansetts a terrible example . They charged them with sheltering some of Philip 's subjects , who had taken refuge in the country , and with aiding the hostile Indians . It was evidently no crime to offer an asylum to the unfortunate , and it was not proved that they had assisted the enemy ; but a strong force was sent against Canonchet , which defeated him in the well known swamp fight , ' where , after a desperate resistance , several hundred warriors perished , beside old men , women , and children , who were burned in wigwams . The whole cause assigned for this energetic proceeding was , that they had not surrendered the hostile Indians ; but since this could not be done without a violation of the laws of hospitality , they could not be expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not have consented at all , except under the fear inspired by the presence of an English army . From this time , Canonchet employed himself in making inroads upon the English villages , and kept the country in a state // of dread . At last he fell into the hands of his enemies , and was put to death . The historians of that day express the utmost bitterness towards this chief ; but though it was natural enough that they should have been prejudiced against him , he appears to have been a fine specimen of savage greatness : high and honorable in feeling , decided in counsel , energetic in action . He was excited against the colonists by the memory of a thousand real or imaginary wrongs , a single one of which , the death of his father , was a sufficient excuse , had any been needed , for all his unfriendly designs and deeds . The most important passage in our Indian history is the war with Philip , who was a most formidable enemy to the colonists , and is never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dread . his father , Massasoit , was a man of peace . Without possessing those warlike virtues , which savages are most apt to admire , he secured and exercised for years a commanding influence among the Indians . Lie was uniformly friendly to the whites , and they appear to have manifested good feeling to him , except on one or two occasions : in the case of Squanto , for example , an Indian who was valuable to the English as an interpreter , having acquired the language in a voyage with Master Hunt , who kidnapped several of his tribe . Squanto seems to have made greater advances in philology than in morals . He took occasion to slander Massasoit to the colonists , and that sachem required the Governor to surrender him to justice , which , as he was one of Massasoit 's subjects , there was no pretext for refusing : in fact , the terms of their treaty required it ; but as the English could not spare Squanto , the demand was evaded . Surely those who afterwards punished the Narragansetts so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they were sheltered both by authority and example . The historians say , that after this Massasoit seemed to frown upon them : they might think themselves very fortunate , if he contented himself with that sort of vengeance ; their own was more searching and effectual . This chief died at peace with the English , and his power descended to Alexander and Philip , his sons . Alexander lived on good terms with the English , till lie was sent for to Plymouth , to answer to a charge against him of exciting the Narragansetts to war . What proof they had of his unfriendly exertions , or whether they had any , does not appear , // but no amount of testimony could have justified their pro. - ceedings . They sent a force to seize and bring him to Plymouth , as if he were amenable to their laws . He was taken , and ordered to proceed to the English settlement , on pain of death , if he refused to go . The insult was so gross , and he felt so keenly his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threw him into a fever , of which he died . If the colonists could have imagined the Indians sending for their Governor in a similar manner , they might have understood the true character of their own proceeding better . They would assuredly have thought it sufficient cause for an exterminating war , and there were days in their history not long before , when the father of this prince held the destiny of the settlement in his hand . It is but just to ask , what must have been the feeling of Philip , when he succeeded to the chieftainship of the tribe . He had seen his brother die of a broken heart , under the treatment of those , who had enjoyed the friendship of the fain ly for years : he had seen the sovereignty degraded by their usurpation , for usurpation no doubt it was , in such a manner , that he must have felt himself disgraced had he submitted to it . Was it reasonable to suppose that he would repress all feelings of wounded pride and affection , and establish the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protest against it ? Truly we should be glad to find one in a thousand of the pretexts for hostilities between civilized nations , half as well founded as the right which Philip had to resist invasion , and to redress his brother 's wrongs . Since one such claim submitted to usually leads on to more and greater usurpations , he must have felt as if he were called upon to-contend for the existence of his authority , and his people . lie appears accordingly to have devised a plan , which , considering his means and powers , was really stupendous , for associating all the tribes in a coalition , which should rise , at once , on every side , against the English , and sweep them from the whole face of the country . The consternation , into which the country was thrown when hostilities began , seems to have been a sort of retribution . For more than a year , the four colonies were constantly in arms ; stories were every day received , of lives destroyed , and villages burned by the Indians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burned , and almost every family involved in the wide and general mourning ; the ex // penses of the old colony alone , for military services and expeditions , amounted to the sum of one hundred thousand pounds . They gained , it is true , a season of peace by means of the desolation ; but we can not help thinking , that they might have secured the same quiet , without the preparation of war ; and as for the removal of the Indians , time xvould have done it for them , without such wild xvaste of blood . The last act of this tragedy is not the least unpleasant to remember : the son of this brave and unfortunate sovereign was sold as a slave , and shipped to Bermuda ; - an act of vengeance merely ; for nothing could have been apprehended from him after the total destruction of his people . Such are the principal acts of injustice to the Indians , which are charged upon our fathers . When it is said , in order to silence our remonstrances against the wrongs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reply is , what then ? We do not defend these things in our fathers , more than in any other men . Wh9ever has committed , or whoever may commit such acts of oppression , the character of the deeds is still the same . It is , however , evident that our fathers had excuses , which can never be offered for others . They lived in times of trouble and danger : their minds were constantly in a state of powerful excitement ,  --  in a state , which made them easy subjects of alarm and any other strong passions ; they were enslaved to certain prejudices also , which the growing light of the world has done away ; and however it may appear to us , now we have seen the essential weakness of the Indian power , they doubtless thou * , ht that they were engaged in a struggle for life ,  --  a struggle in which one must die . It is needless for us to recommend this work , which is already in the hands of most of our readers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ability with which it is executed . The spirit of the writer is also worthy of all praise . He shows a ready sympathy for the unfortunate subjects of his description , but does not allow his sympathy to overstate their xvrongs ; in every case , he takes all possible care to state his facts correctly , which is no easy matter , considering what the authorities are , from which his materials are drawn . His series of biographical pictures has attracted the public attention to the subject , and were he to expand them hereafter into an Indian history , we have no doubt that it would meet with an honorable reception , and be appealed to as a work of lasting authority and value .
