txt Mr. Gladstone has published under the title of Vaticanistn  --  the title is a good hit in tself  --  his answer to the remonstrances and reproofs provoked by his former pamphlet . It is in every way much superior to the Expostulation , more elevated in style , larger and clearer in thought , and closer and more decisive in argument ; yet it has for the present fallen rather flat . By and by it will no doubt be more fully appreciated ; but it is hot difficult to understand why it should not on the instant produce the same impression as the author 's first header into the troubled waters of ecclesiastical controversy . In the first Place , the novelty of the feat has passed away . So mush dissuasion and correspondence followed the publication of the first pamphlet , that people have grown rather tired of the subject . Moreover , the advocates of the Papacy have themselves , by their statements of what they did or did not believe , taken away much of the interest of the summing up . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Vatican , and denied that the great historical Church was bound by the vagaries of any of its ephemeral representatives . POSITION OF ENGLISH CATHOLICS . Mr. Gladstone quotes in an impressive paragraph the substance of Dr. Newman 's admissions , and adds the obvious comment that they are entirely opposed to those spurious doctrines of modern invention for which he has devised the name of " Vatieanism . " There is no fear that Mr. Gladstone 's demonstration of the logical consequences of the now Ultramontane creed embodied in the Syllabus , and the dogma of infallibility will lead English Roman Catholics to renounce the allegiance which for all practical purposes they yield loyally enough to the Protestant Government under which they live ; but it is not unlikely to have the effect of ' establishing a strong and influential body of dissenters in the midst of the Roman Catholic community . It no longer admits of question that the leaders of the Roman Catholic Church in this country have of late years altogether shifted their ground . Nothing can be more emphatic than the contemptuous repudiation by Roman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dogma , or as they then considered it , the offensive and degrading figment of Papal infallioility . On the whole , I should think that the discussions which Mr. Gladstone has started will do good . The Ultromontanee are so humiliatingly pushed up into a corner when the logic of their position is pressed upon them , that Englishmen who are wavering on the brink of the communion of which they are the most noisy and conspicuous representatives , will now be ashamed to commit themselves to it . On the other hand , the disclosure of the resolute revolt of the more independent and rational English Roman Catholics against the innovations of ' the extreme party will also produce a wholesome effect on the Roman Catholics generally . Even if there is no actual secession from the ' body of that Church , conversions to it will probably be checked . Lord Russell 's bill forbidding Roman Catholics to assume ecclesiastical titles was . as far as its immediate object was concerned , nearly a dead letter ; but there can be no question as to the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the number of converts to Romanism . Though it had no effect on confirmed Catholics , it had a very strong effect on those who were tending that way , and made them ashamed to identify themselves with a Church which had assumed so aggressive a position . In the same way , although it would be absurd to suppose that Mr. Gladstone 's pamphlets will seriously disturb the convictions of Roman Catholics who have already committed themselves to the Ultramontane views , it will , in all probability , restrain many who are already in the Church from joining that side , while others outside the Church will be deterred from entering it . Mr. Gladstone is himself responsible to a great extent , by the teachings of his political career . for the spread of the idea that there was nothing very dangerous in Roman Catholicism , and that it need not be regarded with more distrust than other forms of religion ; bat if he helped to furnish the bane , he has now supplied a very effectual antidote . The effect of his recent writings has at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to place the natural and necessary consequences of modern . Popery in a highly-instructive light . In Mr. Gladstone 's opinion the Vatican has now been disposed of , and his next attack is to be on Dr. Strauss and the skeptical asWailants of Christianity . I understand that his present stay in town will be very brief , and that he is eager to be back to his books and desk in Wales . THE BRITISH . AILINCT ? A cariscrtrruoN . It occasionally happens that when some great question is forcing itself on the mind of a nation , an idea becomes current and familiar in thought , although it is not much spoken of . This is the case just now with army reform in England . The events of the last few years have produced a deep impression in public opinion , and it is almost universally admitted that England can not afford to be content with such meagre defenses as at present exist . The solution of the problem is , no doubt , somewhat difficult , and all sorts of plans are started and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finding that one idea is gradually taking possession of the popular mind , and that is the idea of anational conscription . It is a word which by common consent is generally tabooed , just as any allusion to death used to be at the old French Court . It is felt that there is something exceeding uncomfortable about a conscription ; and as a rule Englishmen try to keep the uncomfortable out of view as long . as they can . But if conscription is seldom spoken of in plain terms it is very common in men 's minds , and is getting to be tacitly recognized as , sooner or later , an inevitable neoessity . Count Schouvaloff , the Russian Ambassador , who has been taking an intelligent interest in the military organization of England , which may some day be turned to good account by his imperial master , is said to have recently remarked , after , a visit to Aldershott , that he could now very wegunderstand how impossible it was for En Ind to keep up a large army .. He was Mewed at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the generous rations of English soldiers and the squalid , : semi-starvation in which the troops of hik.ovin country ' were kept , and ' drew the ? conclOsion tkit-ROgliaid " : *. ii ! ld not afford to keep " Up Se. . ? - scale . It certainly can not be doubted by any reasonable person that a sufficient army can not be maintained in England on the existing terms . The arrangements for the board and lodgipg of the soldier was already on the most liberal scale ; and it may be expected that the rate of pay will soon be raised . Yet it is found to be increasingly difficult to get recruits of any kind for the Army , and the physical condition of the men is steadily deteriorating . The standard of height is constantly lowered , and the measurement round the chest , which is even more important , has also been reduced . Where formerly stout , robust men were enlisted , the recruiting officers have now to be thankful for limp , stunted boys . Last year , by great exertions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty good figure , but the quality seems to have been very indifferent . AN UNPOPULAR CALLING . The reason of the unpopularit yof the Army is no doubt to be found in the restraints to which soldiers must submit , the close discipline of barracks , the difficulty of marrying or living in decent comfort with a wife and family , arid so on ; and , above all , the impossibility of advancement beyond a certain point . No doubt most working men remain working men all their lives , but then there is no limit to their chance of rising if they are industrious and intelligent . Another thing is the bad character of the Army , and the want of respect shown to the privates . It is looked upon as ruin for a young man to enlist , and , indeed . few do so unless they have got into trouble through some kind of misconduct . The soldiers are shunned by the rest of the community , and even the highest rank of non-commissioned officers are not allowed to appear in uniform ( which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) in the best parts of theatres and concert rooms for fear of contaminating genteel folk . If there were a universal conscription it would , of course , tend to raise the character of a force in which everybody would have to serve ; and it would also enable the country to feel easy with a smaller number of regular troops then would otherwise be required . It can not be denied that in modern times the Army has come to be too much the plaything of the gentry . Until the abolition of purchase , a large proportion of the officers went into the Army only as a pastime , without the slightest intention of learning their business or of sticking to it . After a few years of home service , ( if they had the means they took care to sell out or exchange when their regiment was ordered abroad , ) they retired , taking with them their red coats and military titles as a sort of social distinction . A desperate effort is now being made by the aristocratic classes to get the purchase system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ payments for exchanges , and it may possibly be successful . The Militia is also kept up very much as the toy of squires ' sons , and absorbs good men who are wanted for the Army . The officers are destitute of military capacity or training , and are appointed by the Lord Lieutenant on account simply of their own or their fathers ' position in the county . There eau be no doubt that whenever the question is gravely looked in the face the Militia in its present form will be abolished , and an honest conscription established . THE PRINCE IMPERIAL . The banquet to the Prince Imperial at Woolwich has given rise to a good deal of criticism both here and in France , and there can be no doubt that it ought not to have been permitted . The commander of the garrison , who presided , made an exceedingly fulsome speech in praise of the Prince , and even went so far as to express a hope that the swords of English officers might one day be at his service . As a mere matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done nothing more than hundreds of lads do every year is nauseous enough ; but it is , of course , a graver scandal that an English official should come forward publicly to support the cause of a foreign . pretender . It is understood that the Prince is to be attached to the staff of the Duke of Cambridge in some sort of vague , indefinite position . The ex-Empress Eugenie has , it is said , just contracted another private loan . A FRENCH MAYOR . The recent visit of the Lord Mayor of London , attended by his gorgeous footmen and trumpeters , was so successful , that the Prefect of the Seine has yielded to the temptation to try the experiment of a visit to London . Not to be outdone by the Lord Mayor , he is to bring with him an escort of fifty troopers of the Municipal Guard , including , I suppose , the band . THEATRICAL INTELLIGENCE . It is hard to say whether it is on account of any dearth of original dramatic authors or on account of a rise in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of London have certainly gone in with surprising enthusiasm for the works of dramatists whose ghosts do not trouble them with visits on treasury days . " Hamlet " has just reached its hundredth night at the Lyceum ; " Midsummer Nights ' Dream " has succeeded the " Merry Wives of Windsor , " at the Gaiety ; and " As You Like It , " is being played at the Opera Comique . Beaumont and Fletcher 's Maid 's Tragedy " has also been produced at the Holborn Amphitheatre , where , tonight , the " Merchant of Venice " takes its place on the bill . There can be no doubt that that these are all very good plays in their way , but there is apparently a difficulty in finding people who are fit to act them . There are still one or two of the last generation of actors , though not of actresses , left who can speak out articulately , but the rest of the parts are filled by people who can hardly speak at all in an intelligible manner , and who have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be recited . In former days , a long and hard-working apprenticeship preceded admission to any but subordinate parts on ' the stage , but now even experienced actors have never learned to pronounce distinctly . It is only with the greatest difficulty , that the audience can follow dialogues . Another ? eatare of the London drama , would seem to be the growing tendency to monopoly in the possession of theatres . At the present moment Mr. Chatterton ? holds Drury Lane , the Adelphi , and the Princess ' , and Mr. Hollingehead the Gaiety , Opera Comique , and Holborn Amphitheatre . Next week we are to have a series of entertainihents of ? another , and  --  perhaps , more stirring kind-those of Messrs . Moody and Sankey froniChicago . A good deal of curiosity is felt as to the effect they willproduce in the cynic al and worldly capital . In the provinces they have no.doubt done much to relieve the dullness of existence .                    @
