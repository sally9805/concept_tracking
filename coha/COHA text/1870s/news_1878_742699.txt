txt It Is becoming painfully evident that ironclad war-ships are failures , and that the millions which have been spent upon them have been wasted . The only object %f incasing vessels in iron armor is to render them invulnerable to hostile . shot . This has not been done . There is not an iron-clad afloat that can not be pierced by the hnghsai 100-ton guns recently manufactured for the Italian frigate The earlier ironclads , including all those belonging to the American Navy , can be penetrated by guns much smaller than the 100-ton gun , and no matter how greatly the thickness of armorplates may be hereafter increased , it is conceded that there is no practical difficulty in the way of manufacturing guns capable of piercing it . The iron-clad , then , is not , and can not be made , invulnerable to shot , and hence it fails of meeting the very end for which it was built . There is , moreover , , another grave objeetionto the iron-clad , which is alone sufficient to condemn it . No matter how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driven to the bottom by the impact of another ironclad , The enormous weight of these vessels gives them a momentum which is irresistible . The collision between the Iron Duke and the Vanguard and the more recent collision between two German iron-clads illustrate this fact . In either case , the blow was delivered by a vessel advaneing at a comparatively low speed , but the momentum was sufficient to crush in the side ; of the strongest ship that was ever built . It must also be noticed that iron-clads , like other vessels , are at the mercy of torpedoes , and that when once injured they sink with frightful rapidity . ? Are we , then , to abandon iron-clads and to return to the wooden walls of the last generation 7 This is a question which is now forcing itself upon the attention of the naval authorities of every country , and in many cases experienced officers are ready to answer it in the affirmative . That we must abandon the present type of armored vessel is very clear , but it does not follow that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Vice-Admiral DE POISSON-n'Avim , a distinguished officer , who has served for more than forty years in the Swiss Navy , has designed a new pattern of war-vessel which can not fail to work a revolution in naval architecture  --  if so novel and startling an expression is permissible . The Admiral set before him as a problem to devise a ship which should be absolutely invulnerable to shot , and which could defy alike the attacks of rams and torpedoes . It is obvious that any hollow vessel may have its sides pierced by a sufficiently hard . blow , and may fill with water if injured below the water line . The Admiral , therefore , proposes to build a solid ship , formed of one homogeneous mass of forged and welded iron. , The largest existing iron-clad , having a breadth of fifty feet , can not carry armor much thicker than three feet . A vessel of the same dimensions built after the Swiss Admiral 's pattern would present a thickness of fifty feet of solid iron to the shot or rams of an enemy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a vessel by shot , rams , or torpedoes . To ram the Rock of Gibraltar , or to attempt to sink the Island of Madagascar by firing 15 ? inch shot at it , would be as idle as any attempt to injure a solid mass of iron three hundred feet long by fifty broad and forty deep . But it may be hastily objected that a solid iron ship will not float . Certainly it will not float ; neither will a man who does not know how to swim ; but both may be floated by artificial means . It is proposed to incase the solid war-ship with a jacket of cork , which will prevent it from sinking . Cork is cheap , and it will be vastly cheaper to cover a solid vessel with cork than it is to cover a hollow vessel with iron armor . Tho enemy 's shot will either sink into the cork or rebound from it , and , can not in any event seriously damage it . Thus the solid vessel will be invulnerable , not only to hostile attacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rock , but she can not have a hole knocked into her . In no conceivable way can she spring a leak , and though she might be entirely blown " out of the water by a torpedo , she would fall back again unhurt . It is manifest that we have here a vessel which can defy the united navies of the world . A solid Swiss ship might enter a hostile port and be fired at by the largest guns , rammed by the swiftest and heaviest rams , and blown up by dozens of torpedoes , and at the end of twenty-four hours of this sort of amusement she would be as strong and serviceable as . ever . The hostile gunners and sailors would ' become so disheartened that they would burst into tears and refuse to waste any more time in so unfair a game . If the Swiss Government were to put its inventive Vice-Admiral in command of a single ( ) solid ship , the navies of Europe would probably blow themselves up in terror and disgust . Of course , there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guns , or crew . Those will either bo left on shore or Will be carried by light wooden steamers which can keep out of the way of the enemy 's cruisers . Perhaps half of the cost of our iron-clads is duo to the high . prices charged for max chinery and guns . The solid ship , being simply a mass of lion incased it cork , is much less expensive than a hollow ship full of guns , and machinery , and it is morally certain that inasmuch as she dc as not Garry any crew , no lives can be lost c n board of her . If it is asked how she is t a be fought without men , guns , or engine ; , it may be answered that fighting is a mea e matter of detail with which the Swiss nventor had not yet concerned himself , but , ; hat , in awl , event , the solid ship will doubtl ass inflict at least as much injury upon the ( moray as we have any reason to suppose a at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
