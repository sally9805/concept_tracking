IS UNIVERSAL SUFFRAGE A FAILURE ? A LECTURE DELIVERED BEFORE THE CITIZENS OF ITHACA , NEW YORK , OCTOBER 17 , 1878 . Is universal suffrage in the United States a failure ? My friend President White told you the other evening what he thought was the opinion of foreigners on that question . This evening a foreigner speaks for himself , - a foreigner , yet not an alien . Canada is a dependency of the British crown , but she is a community of the New World . She is a partner with you in the great experiment of equality . So deal with her , so bear yourselves towards her , if you can , in this crisis of your commercial relations with her which is impending , and on all occasions , that she may be true to the partnership , and learn not to dread the day in which the last lingering shadows of Old World aristocracy and privilege shall depart from these shores , and the New World shall wholly and forever be dedicated to humanity . Voices of despondency are heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Perhaps some reach the ears of us foreigners which do not reach yours ; Skepticism sometimes unmasks to the foreigner which before fellow - countrymen wears the mask . Commercial men from England , going among the chiefs of commerce here , report that misgiving as to the value even of your most fundamental institutions is wide-spread and profound . They report that republicanism here begins to be like theological orthodoxy elsewhere , - openly professed and privately derided . Less important are the whispers of disaffection which Americans of the wealthier class , who have left their country for the pleasure haunts of Europe , sometimes breathe into the open ear of European aristocracy , and which have led aristocracy to hope , and to give practical expression to the hope , that the New World may after all be redeemed from equality . But a deeper significance belongs to the utterances of some of your eminent writers and thinkers , who with the lips not of social sycophancy , but of wailing patriotism , proclaim aloud and in thrilling accents the failure of universal suffrage . In approaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all demagogic cant and // rant . Gone , forever gone , are the illusions as to the perfect wisdom and virtue of the people , and the all-sufficiency of popular freedom for the regeneration of society , which beguiled the pioneers of democracy , and perhaps to them were of service as stimulants , without which they might have shrunk from the effort of overturning the thrones of the past . Sad experience has made it clear that institutions wisely framed are needed by all of us , in order to give that which is politically good in us the victory over that which is politically evil . I say by all of us . Alike in high and low , in rich and poor , in every condition and every walk of life , there are passions and interests which conflict with our public duty and arc adverse to the common weal . Selfishness is the grand obstacle to political wisdom ; and the rich , though commonly the best educated and the most intelligent , are not the least selfish . Let us eschew demagogism , but let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One of Oneida 's heroes , an adorable officer in the British Guards , having been brought into contact with the populace in guarding the royal carriage , laves his gentility as soon as he gets home in a warm bath well dashed with can de cologne . Oneida 's guardsman has his counterparts in the intellectual sphere . Renan , for example , appears to think that the mass of his fellow-men are a mob , to b* held down lest its brutality should interfere with culture . He tells you coolly that the many must find their happiness in the enjoyments and the glory of the few , and it does not seem to occur to him that the enjoyments of the few can possibly be marred or their glory dimmed by the misery of the many . Culture ! Alas , where would culture be if those brutal masses did not support it by their daily toil ? The thought of what labor endures on the stubborn glebe , in the dismal wilderness , in the stifling factory , in the perilous mine , and on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mothers of the poor undergo in their housekeeping and child - bearing , - ought to banish every unbrotherly feeling from our breasts . Myriads of Renans are devoted to coarse and obscure toil that one may write and win the fame . These men look down from the height of their philosophy on the simplicity of Jesus of Nazareth ; yet behold them , and the great Goethe too , wallowing in the mire of their cultivated selfishness , while He remains the brother of mankind . We must also , to judge any particular system of government aright , have a worthy conception of government itself . If it is merely a machine for the preservation of life and property , there may be something to be said in favor of an empire . But we hold that government is the organization of the community not merely for the preservation of life and property , though this no doubt is its primary purpose , but for all the objects , moral as well as material , which we may best attain by actin0 in common . We hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form of government is that which doth most actuate and dispose all members of the commonwealth to the common good . The characteristic excellence of such a government does not consist in mere order , such as the French empire maintained with the bayonet till the bayonet broke . Its excellence consists rather in general , active , and self-sacrificing devotion to the common weal . Nor is mere security its special promise . To attain great ends something must be risked . Much must be risked to attain so great an end as the brotherhood of man . Every system ought to be tried by broad results . Let us try on that principle the strength and the integrity of the American government , and see whether there is any ground for despair . There can hardly be a more crucial test of the strength of a government than its power of going through a perilous crisis without suspending the ordinary course of law and resorting to violent measures of repression . Nothing more decisively displays its confidence in the soundness of its foundations and the free allegiance of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very type of strength , is 72 January , // threatened , or fancies itself threatened , by the French Revolution , what do we see ? We see the ordinary cou.rse of law at once snspended , and recourse had to extraordinary measures of repression , - personal liberty interrupted ; opinion gagged ; the right of public meeting curtailed ; government indictments for libel ; a series of trials for constructive treason , in which conviction would have led to judicial murder ; fair discussion punished as sedition ; a young Scotch advocate , of blameless character , for speaking in favor of parliamentary reform , sentenced to transportation for fourteen years , and told from the bench that he ought to be put to the torture ; the land filled with spies ; the judges turned into agents of police ; private associations formed , with the sanction of government , for the manifest purpose of perverting justice ; a reactionary reign of terror . This , although the war with the French republic was a foreign war , and those who then sympathized with the revolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American government was threatened by a great rebellion on its own soil ; the hostile armies menaced the c*i.pital ; sympathy with the enemy was rife and avowed . Yet a stranger visiting the United States at that time saw no interruption of the ordinary course of law , no suspension of personal liberty , of the freedom of the press , of the right of public meeting , except on the actual scene of war . History can scarcely supply a parallel to this perfect reliance of a government on its moral strength and the unconstrained loyalty of its people . The secon ( l election of Lincoln took place at the acme of excitement , when every other family had a member in the field for the Union or in a soldier 's grave ; yet there was not only perfect order , maintained without any intervention of the police , but perfect respect for every right , not only of voting , speaking , and writing , but of public demonstration . What government in Europe could safely have allowed sympathy with a great rebellion to hang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be forgotten , either , are those predictions of military usurpa tion and sabre sway as the sure result of civil war , uttered with exultation by enemies , with sorrow by friends , warranted by the experience of history , but belied by the republican loyalty of the generals and the immediate return of the armies to civil life . The second election of Lincoln struck an observer at the time as a signal proof of self-control on the part of the people , as well as of conscious strength and security on the part of the government . Where else would you have found , under similar circumstances , the same toleration extended by the dominant party to its opponents ? Majorities are tyrannical , and will be so till our reason gains a greater control than it now has over our passions . But the majority which could respect the free speech , free action , and public demonstrations of the minority in 1864 was not the most jealous or cruel of tyrants . Then as to integrity , we will by no means strive to hide the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of judging by broad results . In fourteen years , as the president was saying the other day , a third of the debt has been paid off , the interest greatly reduced , taxation materially lightened , the credit of the nation raised to a level second only to that of the credit of England . How could this have been done if honesty had not prevailed , on the whole , both in the central administration and in all the agencies through which the revenue is collected and disbursed ? In what state are the finances , and how stands the credit , of Spain , where the reverse of honesty is the rule ? So with regard to the administration of the law . The system of electing the judges for a limited term , instead of appointing for life , appears to us foreigners bad , and we hold it not surprising that there should have been cases of judicial corruption . Yet on the whole it is evident that property is secure ; right is done between suitors ; crime is punished ; confidence in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judge to find a Spanish alcalde or a Turkish cadi . Again , what is the conduct of the re // public towards other nations ? Has it not , since the violent and overbearing spirit of slavery departed , been at least as moderate and as ri0hteous as that of any other nation with equal means and opportunities of aggrandizement ? Canada rests in perfect security beside you , while Holland and Belgium are always turning anxious eyes to the movements of their powerful neighbors . Mexico gives you a sufficient pretext for war about once a month , yet she is not conquered . San Domingo lays herself at your feet , and is rejected . Meantime , those who have most loudly accused you of unprincipled ambition annex the Transvaal and Cyprus , and are now preparing to conquer Afghanistan . If any charge were to be made against you , it would rather be that of excessive non - intervention . After all , the American republic is the tntelary power of the New World , and provided she keeps clear , as she seems resolved to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that capacity with benefit not only to the weaker communities , but to herself , since the minds of her people will thus be sometimes tliverted from internal strife . The determination not to annex Cuba is evidently wise as well as moral : a republic is not like an empire ; the law of its being forbids it to annex anything which it can not thoroughly incorporate . But it was difficult not to feel a pang when the island , after its long and desperate struggle , fell back under the domination of Spain , the most despicable among the Old World powers of iniquity , - a power which is the last ditch of slavery and priest rule , and which , while for the most selfish ends it crushes its agonized dependency , can not keep the flag of the foreigner off its own coast . Surely , then , it is worth while to examine this system of government , to mark its defects and see what can be done to cure them , before you give way to despair . Surely , the spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preside over reforms . That universal suffrage , in the strict and literal sense of the term , has failed in some respects and produced serious evils assuredly is not to be denied . But that we may go forth to combat evil cheerfully and with vigor it is expedient to look at the good first . Experience has disclosed to us only three foundations on which a government can be built : hereditary right , sheer force , and the national will . Government here is based on the national will . The more extended the suffrage can be consistently with public safety , the more complete will be the expression of the national will , the broader and the firmer will be the foundation . During the civil war no careful observer could fail to see what strength your government derived from the general feeling that it was the government of the whole people . That sentiment more , much more , than countervailed the sentiment of loyalty which in monarchical countries is felt towards a hereditary throne . We say the more extended the suffrage can be , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its extension be consistent with public safety . The public good is the sole criterion in politics ; it is the measure of justice as well as of expediency . A man has a right to such institutions as will best promote the public good , in which his own is included ; he has no other right in a civilized state , whatever he might have in the bush . The suffrage will of course be a failure if it is given to those who are manifestly disqualified for political life . It will be a failure , for instance , if it is given to those who can not read , because they can not possibly inform themselves about the questions on which they have to vote . A man who can not read not only has no right to the suffrage , he has a sacred right to be exempted from it , as a blind man has to be exempted from a public duty requiring eyesight . An education test or a security for education of . some kind is an indispensable safeguard of universal suffrage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we shall presently see why . People absolutely devoid of political training and of the knowledge of political duty are in much the same case as those who can not read . It is obviously of vital importance to a free state that // naturalization laws should be strictly enforced . If there are immigrants radically alien as a race , socially and morally , to American civilization , their case must be decided by the same paramount rule of the public good , care being taken that the interest of the state is not confounded with industrial rivalry or inhuman antipathy of race . Negro enfranchisement , which it might have been difficult , from a foreign observer 's point of view , to defend on ordinary grounds of policy , at least in so sudden and sweeping a form , pleads as its justification the exigency of the civil war and the necessity of putting the sword of political self-protection into the hand of the emancipated slave . Again , universal suffrage will fail if a distinction is not drawn between uational and municipal government . In the objects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the poor perhaps most need the suffrage for their protection . Had the poorer classes of England enjoyed the suffrage they would have voted down the old criminal code , so lavish of the poor man 's blood ; they would bave voted down the corn laws , imposed by a landlord Parliament to keep up rents while the masses wanted bread ; they would have voted down the war against the French republic , waged in the interest of the aristocracy to the ruin of the people . But a municipal government is mainly concerned with the collection and the disbursement of local taxes and as these are proportional to property , so in some measure ought the power to be . The principle of the jointstock company is more applicable to municipalities than that of the nation . While the wealthier classes have lost , the poorer have in no way gained by municipal pillage , which has enriched the demagogues alone . Witness the condition of the poorer quarters of New York . The subject is one in which a Canadian has as much interest as you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ municipal government confronts us . It is one of the great problems of society on this continent . Let us remember , however , that the gros sly ignorant and the rowdies are not the only dangerous class . If , in some , envy of wealth breeds dark thoughts of pillage , there are others who provoke envy by the ostentation of wealth . Yon read of millionaires going about in a state rivaling that of kings , though probably not refined by royal taste . These are the great preachers of communism and repudiation . We could half sympathize with the communist who burns to pull Shoddy down . As moral and social beings , we would rather be governed by the rowdies than by the American colony in Paris as it was under the empire . There is yet another class dangerous in its way , - the class of seceders from political duty . Malcontents from this country are always telling their sympathizing friends in Europe that the best men here stand aloof from politics . The answer is . that those who in a free country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A man is not bound to seek the prizes of public life ; he will perhaps exercise more influence for good if he does not ; he is not bound to become the slave of party ; he is not bound to sit in any conclave of political iniquity . But he is bound to do his utmost , in such ways as are morally open to him , to get the best men elected , and to make the right principles prevail . If he can not do much , he is still bound to ( 10 what he can . Striking pictures have been drawn of men with high foreheads and intellectual countenances condemned to sit in council beside low brows and stolid faces . But would the matter be mended if the low brows and stolid faces had the council to themselves ? We must say , however , that during the civil war it appeared to us that all classes of men in this country , if they did not actually go into public life , took an active part in the performance of ptmhlic duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efforts and sacrifices , to be nobly loyal to the republic , and showed thereby that the republic could not have been a very bad mother even to them . Let us see precisely what the evil is , and trace it , if we can , to its source . 75 // It is not tyranny or oppression . Nobody complains of anything of that kind . It is not insecurity of life or property , at least in the settled States of the North , which are the fair specimens of the system . It is political corruption . That corruption does exist , that it is great , lamentable , and scandalous , all citizens and friends of the republic seem to own with sorrow and with shame . But at all events , we may feel pretty sure that we see the worst of it . The American republic is no dissembler ; she washes all her dirty linen in the street . Not only so , but she even dirties some for the purpose . Every presidential election is a match game at slander between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The slightest scent of scandal seems to be followed up with the fell sagacity of the blood-hound . The faintest whisper of suspicion is swelled into thunder by the joyful acclaim of the hostile press , and redehoed by the press of Europe . In England decorous silence is the rule . It is generally believed that the recor ( 1s of the railway mania in that country , if they could he opened , would tell a dark tale of corruption , parliamentary as well as general ; but those records still sleep in peace . The payment of half a million of dollars to the firm of Rothschild for advancing the purchase money of the Suez Canal shares was said , even by the most cautious critics , to be a questionable transaction . In private this was said , but in public not a word . Everybody shrank from bringing forward a charge which could not be positively proved . Here the press and the country would have rung with the scandal . Here a public man of eminence is charged with having sold a cadetship at West @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with having employed a door-keeper of the House as his agent in the transaction ; and the charge , instead of being scouted , becomes the subject of a solemn investigation which fills the world with dreadful ideas of American corruption . So with regard to commercial fraud . In the English newspapers the cases of commercial fraud appear to Is Universal Suffrage a Failure ? January , be about as thick and about as bad as they are in yours . But in the case of England they ni-c called exceptions ; in the case of America they are called the rule . Commerce is corrupted by the gambling spirit which always attends a very rapid development of trade ; and commercial corruption is a principal source of political corruption , both in the way of moral contagion , and through the bribery of legislators by the agents of dishonest speculation . It seems to be mainly in the commercial legislation , or what is called in England the privatebill legislation , that the evil prevails . We do not hear , at least upon trustworthy evidence , of great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason to think that the evil might be diminished by the simple expedient of delegating the decision of questions respecting railway and other commercial hills to a professional tribunal , subject still to the supreme authoritv of Congress ; as in England the decision of election petitions has been delegated to the judges , without prejudice to the supreme authority of the I-louse of Commons . England certainly would have been saved by such a tribunal from infinite waste of money , as well as from much jobbery and corruption . Something , probably much , might he done by a sharper law , meting out to the high and inexcusable the same measure of justice as to the low and excusable felon . The acceptance by a legislator of a bribe is a crime perfectly justiciable , as well as most heinous . Impeachment is a cumbrous remedy , and one which is sure to be perverted by party . A criminal tribunal inaccessible to party , and accessible to all citizens who seek justice , would be a good deal more to the purpose . Put into Sing Sin* @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest will be tired of the game . Laws are nothing without national character , but national character may be improved by laws . The national character of England was improved with reference to trusts by the fraudulent trustees act . Good judges ascribe the prosperity of // French commerce partly to a sound commercial morality , and the soundness of the morality to the strictncss and the rigorous execution . of the law . These problcms are common to all popular governments , and in speaking of them we are speaking of that which concerns all your partners in the experiment of freedom as well as you . Another influence for which the suffrage is in no way responsible is at present affecting morality , political and general , in all countries . There is nothing in the history of opinion like the sudden breaking up of old beliefs during the last twenty , it might almost be said the last ten years . When one revisits England after a short absence , the progress strikes one as almost appalling . It is far greater than appears on the surface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and many religious skeptics support the state church on political grounds ; indeed , they seem to support it the more zealously the more skeptical they become . Skepticism reigns in the intellectual classes and among the intelligent artisans , in conversation , in literature , and in the press . But the morality of the great mass of men has hitherto been bound up with their religion ; at least , with their belief in an all-seeing God , and in an account to be rendered after death . One is not surprised to hear thoughtful men in England say that the effects of religious and moral skepticism begin to be felt in commerce , in politics , and in every walk of life . Far be it from us to cling to anything that has been proved untrue , or even to anything that is doubtful , for the purpose of supporting the social fabric . If there is a God , he is the God of truth , and to prop with falsehood is to prepare a heavier fall . But let those who pull down old beliefs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life higher than his animal nature man must have , or he will become a wild beast and need a keeper . In an old country , society is held together by immemorial authority , ingrained habit , consecrated custom , independently of individual belief ; but in a democracy , each man must be , to a great extent , a law to himself ; and here , if individual belief in the great sanctions of morality fails , social as well as moral anarchy may ensue . On this subject of political corruption , public opinion , at all events , appears not yet to be hopelessly depraved . Bribery , no doubt , when committed in the interest of a party , is too easily condoned ; but the acceptance of a bribe , or of illicit gain of any kind , seems still , if brought home to a man , to ruin him in public life . The same thing can not be said of all countries under what is suppOsO ( l to be the elevating influence of monarchical institutions . The corruption in England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the votes of members of Parliament , were constantly , almost avowedly , bought and sold . To carry a disgraceful peace through Parli* mont , a regular bribery office was opened , as Horace Walpole tells us , by the government , and bribes amounting to twentyfive thousand pounds were paid to members in one day . You could slip a bankbill into the hand even of a peer without offense . Government , in fact , subsisted by corruption . But from this , England , having vigorous life in her , emerged . There is now no bribery in England , - none at least of a pecuniary kind ; for it ought to be remembered that millionaires are bribed by titles and decorations , which the government still uses ns rewards for political support . Of the corrupt we always hear ; the trumpet of party rivalry tells their names loud enough . But no trumpet tells the names of those who through their whole lives serve the republic faithfully and die poor . That such there are we are most credibly assured ; our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is more effectually ratified by the general results of the administration in all departments , and particularly in the department of finance . Universal suffrage has hitherto had the advantage of great safety-valves in the abundance of land and in commercial expansion . This can not be too frankly admitted , nor can the attention // of statesmen be too earnestly directed to the new exigencies which may arise when all the land is filled and commercial expansion has reached its limit ; although it is to be observed that the land will not have been filled till it is all highly farmed , nor will commercial expansion have reached its limit till the land has been filled . For the general possession of property by the people , democracy itself may partly claim the credit , since it has abolished primogeniture and entail . But against these advantages must be set the difficulty of dealing with masses of immigrants , wholly untrained , for the most part , to the exercise of political power , and often embittered against all government by oppression suffered in their native land . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wonderful extent turned into citizens , victims of English misrule in Ireland and fugitives from the military system of Germany . American socialism is not native : it is brought from lands where social wrong breeds wild schemes of redress in the hearts of the wronged . When the International tried to set fire to American society , it was like putting a match to the Hudson . Any one who visited the mining district of Pennsylvania , at the time of the Molly Maguire outrages , might easily satisfy himself that the men were not only immigrants , but for the most part industrial exiles of the wildest and most roving kind , many of them probably ringleaders of strikes in the old country . The times just now are bad . The republic is meeting the heavy bill drawn upon the future by the civil war . She feels the loss of all the wealth , actual and prospective , which was fired away in gunpowder . She feels it the more because for the time the war expenditure produced a factitious prosperity . The poorest , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conspiracy , angry illusions , both social and economical , are the natural result . How was it in England after the long war with France ? For many years English society heaved with political sedition and industrial strife . There were Cato Street conspiracies , Pcterloo massacres , Luddite disturbances , destruction of machinery , Bristol in flames and in the hands of rioters , conflicts with the military , wild outcries against the national creditor , mad currency theories , proposals to apply the sponge to the national debt . Till 1819 , when cash payments were resumed , an inconvertible paper currency aggravated the industrial distress and the disaffection which was its consequence . It was certain that as in England so in the United States , inconvertible paper money would produce fluctuation of prices , confusion , hardship , and industrial disturbance , and that there would be no relief without a return to a sound currency such as that on which the wisdom of Peel and otb*r English statesmen resolved in 1819 . Let us he just . This movement which you are combatin* and which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mere dishonesty ; it is like the similar movement in England , the offspring of real and pressing hardship . An inconvertible paper*currency breeds not only confusion but wrong . Mortgagors and other debtors are crushed by debts which they contracted in depreciated paper , but which they have to pay in coin . The conduct of American sufferers calling for Inflation to lighten their burdens is at least no worse than that of the English land owners after the French war , when , finding that the monopoly which they had enjoyed during the war was being taken from them by the importation of foreign grain , they made the Parliainent , which was entirely in their power , pass the corn law to keep up prices , while the people , after just tasting of plenty , were thrust back into privation . If the present demand were not that the currency should be again debased , commerce again demoralized , and the gambling-table of gold speculation restored to noxious activity , but that mortgage and other debts should be reduced to the value really received by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of practicability , there would scarcely be an objection on the ground of justice . 78 January , // Of the dangers of the present situation no small part is the result of slavery . Even the worst excesses of democracy , or what we foreigners think its worst excesses , in the North , such as the abrogation of the life tenure of the judges and the consequent diminution of the independence of the judiciary , seem to have been rather the work of the Northern allies of the Southern aristocracy than of democracy in the proper sense of the term . Massachusetts continues to appoint her judges for life . But for slavery universal suffrage is not responsible . The responsibility rests historically on a far different power . The Tory rulers of England in the reign of Anne , the political progenitors of those who patronized the Alabama , made the queen proclaim to Parliament the glad tidings of her having obtained for the country a share of the Spanish slave trade . Slavery created at the South a social system radically antagonistic to the social system of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two should die . If slavery had lived it would have filled the New World with social , moral , and economical poison . In this , perhaps , posterity will find the justification of the war rather than in any legal right of coercion . Would we were able to say that the traces of slavery , like the commercial crisis , were temporary as well as unconnected with democracy , and that they might be expected , in the course of nature , soon to pass away ! Alas , this juxtaposition of two races , one , besides its mental itiferiority , bearing the brand of former servitude on its brow , seems likely , for generations to come , to be the difficulty and the danger of the republic ! Divided from each other as they are by the whole scale of humanity , how can the An*lo-American and the negro ever be fused into a community ? The commons of Rome , though they had wrung from the exclusive patriciate a share of offices and political power , thought their enfranchisement incomplete till they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civil rights law as you will , you can not have real political eqaality without social equality , and you can not have social equality without intermarriage . Lastly , we must not lay to the charge of the democratic principle , or of universal suffrage as its general embodiment , defects in the special machinery of any democratic institutions . There were sure to be such defects in the constitution of the United States . The framers of that constitution were perhaps the wisest statesmen of their time ; but they could not be exempt from the prejudices and illusions of their age . They had very little experience to guide them . Democracy on a large scale was new . The republics of antiquity were not democracies , but republics of masters supported by the labor of slaves , in which slavery settled the most formidable of the political problems with which modern democracy has to deal . The only precedent in point was the ill-starred and short-lived , though glorious , commonwealth of England . In your Revolution there were two elements , - one akin to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first represented by Jefferson , and the second by Hamilton . With both came illusions . With the French clement came the false belief in popular perfection and in the all-sufficiency of freedom , which received its hideous refutation in the excesses of the French Revolution ; perhaps , also , that general dislike of government and disposition to confound lawful authority with tyranny , which in its influence upon the household , and upon legislation respecting the internal relations of the family , constitutes about the gravest peril of this country , political as well as moral , because anarchical tendencies bred in the home are sure to extend to the character of the citizen . With the British element came those misconceptions regarding the distribution of power under the British constitution which then universally prevailed , and had taken captive even the intellect of Montesquieu . Everybody at that time fancied that the king of En*land was still , as he had been in the period of the Tudors , a real ruler ; whereas he had become a figure-head , reigning and not governing , // while the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him by Parliament . Everybody then fancied that the House of Lords was a senate , revising in the light of its maturer xvssdom the more impulsive legislation of the popular house ; whereas it was not a senate , but an estate of the old feudal realm , representing not political maturity , but territorial privilege and social caste . Everybody then fancied that power was really distributed between king , lords , and commons , and that in this distribution lay the grand secret of the British constitution ; whereas the House of Commons had in fact reduced the House of Lords to comparative impotence , as well as the king to nullity , and had drawn the substance of supreme power to itself . All the world went astray after constitutional kings and revising senates , imagining that this was the road to British liberty , and the s*ure road of political salvation . Your president is evidently the British king reproduced in an elective form . But a foreign observer may doubt whether the reproduction was necessary or wise .

Every four years it brings burning questions to a dangerous head . It caused the question of slavery , which might otherwise have smoldered on , to burst into the flame of civil war . The periodical revolution which it involves is fatal to anything like stability of policy or forecast on the part of the government . Why should we not all do , as Switzerland does , with an executive council elected by the national legislature ? Harmony between the executive and the le0islature might be preserved and steadiness of policy secured at the same time by having the council elected , not all at once , but by periodical installments .

Would not well-devised rules of proceeding and the requirement of an absolute majority , or even more for the passage of an opposed bill , be as good a security for considerate legislation as the clashing of two separate chambers ? If the two chambers differ decidedly on a serious question , or the party which is in a majority in one of them is in a minority in the other , they will not temper each other 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have just been doing in the British colony of Victoria . They who propose to set matters right by giving the American cabinet , like the British cabinet , seats in the legislative body illustrate once more the prevalence of illusions respecting the nature of the British constitution . In the British Parliament there is really , as we have said , only one chamber , the House of Commons , which has practically engrossed the supreme power . A ministry , therefore , which has a majority in the House of Commons is able to carry its measures through Parliament . But in the American Congress there are not only formally but really two chambers , and unless the cabinet could command a majority in both , confusion , legislative as well as executive , would ensue . For the British cabinet , be it observed , is not merely an executive ; it assumes the control of legislation , and when it loses that control it 80 January , // falls . Moreover , if the cabinet were in Congress , like the parliamentary government in En , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; with the responsibility must go the power ; and the president would have to follow the advice of his ministers , and would become , like the British king , a figure-head . The multiplication of legislators , and paid legislators , to which the system of two chambers leads , if it is not a necessity , is itself an evil . It renders the cost of republican government really greater than the cost of any monarchy . What is worse , it is sure to breed a swarm of professional politicians , who are tempted to leave the regular paths of industry for that which is the highest of all callings , but the vilest of all trades . But of all institutions imported from the Old World or formed here in imitation of it , the most questionable is party government . Burke defines party as " a body of men united for promoting , by their joint endeavors , the national interest on some particular principle in which they are agreed . " The pureminded Burke thinks only of principle and the national interest ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fox and North , with their factious and venal trains , united in endeavoring to govern the country for objects in which they were all agreed , but with which principle and national interest had nothing to do . But let that pass . To justify the permanent division of a nation into parties , the principle of division must obviously be perpetual . But what perpetual principle of division exists or can be imagined ? What principle is there that will forever separate from each other , and range in opposing hosts , men equally sensible and equally patriotic ? Such a principle it must be , because otherwise one of your parties will be a party of the bad , and you will have to dedicate half your citizens to evil in order to keep your system in existence . Suppose real issues fail , as fail they must and do . Are we to go on fabricating factitious issues , merely to provide party with a basis ? This is what is actually done . In Canada , for instance , all the great questions having been settled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two parties became mere personal combinations wrestling with each other for power . Party has its uses . In England it was the necessary organ of resistance to the encroachments of royal prerogative , as it is now the necessary organ of resistance to aristocratic reaction . In this country it was the necessary organ of resistance to slavery , and a foreigner can not presume to say that it may not still be the necessary organ of resistance to repudiation or to movements subversive of the settlement made in 1865 . In such cases a good citizen is warranted in submitting his reason and conscience in some measure to party discipline , for the sake of the great and permanent object to be secured . But can it be seriously maintained that a party struggle for the offices of state is the normal and permanent basis of good government ? Does not such a struggle inevitably evoke all the passions , all the cupidities , all the malignant activities which render good government impossible ? Under such a system , where are good and sensible men to find their place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of party . They will be self-ostracized , and power will fall more and more into bad hands . Let us not deceive ourselves . Party , under ordinary circumstances , is a fine name for faction , and faction is the ruin of free states . All other subjects of human interest are passing , by an irresistible movement , out of the domain of party and passion into the domain of science , and why should polities be an everlasting exception ? So far from being essentially connected with universal suffrage , party is its practical subverter . Under the system of party management , with its caucuses , its wirepulling , and its close nominations , who except the managers really has a vote ? Why is it hopeless to propose an education test for the suffrage ? Because if one party proposed it , the other party would *t once espouse the cause of ignorance for the sake of its vote . Why is it hopeless to agitate for a permanent civil service ? Because party can not af 81 // 82 ford to dispense with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service would not work miracles , but it would be likely to increase the efficicncy , economy , and integrity of the public service , as signal experience shows . Whether British empire in India is a good thing or not , the body of highly traincd administrators which rules that empire is as pure a government as any in the world . West Point officers during your war were exposed to the same temptations as other men in power ; yet I do not remember that I ever heard a West Point officer charged with corruption . The same spirit of corporate honor would probably animate a civil service if it were placed upon a similar footing . As to the danger of bureaucracy , it could hardly be very great in a community so self-reliant and so political as this . But the best part of a reform of this kind is that it reduces to a minimum the amount of personal and pecuniary inducement for seeking a change of government , and insures as far as possible that the change shall be sought , if at all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when the people are carried in some measure out of the direct influence of party an improvement becomes visible in their political character and in their legislative wisdom . It appears at least that the amendment of state constitutions - that of the constitution of the State of New York , for example - has been carried on in a calmer spirit and with better results than ordinary legislation , and that the people on these occasions have shown a willingness to accept reforms even of a conservative kind , such as a lengthened tenure for the judiciary and the minority clause . One hears loud complaints against the press , its violence , its rancor , its untruthfulness , its narrowness of view . Reformers propose , as a remedy , to give journalists a regular training for their profession , - to teach them history , jurisprudence , political science . This is very good ; but teach the journalist what you will , if you send him into the service of party , you send him out of the service of truth . Nor can it be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not be checked , nor can the authors of abuses be kept in awe , by criticism that is indiscriminate and notoriously , almost professedly , unfair . Such criticism cloaks guilt by confounding innocence with it ; it defiles everything , and purifies nothing . Of course in speaking of defects in the machinery of the constitution we do not insist on details ; we may be mistaken about all the special points that we have mentioned . But we do venture to insist on the general fact that the constitution , framed at the time and under the influences that it was , would be likely to contain such defects , entirely apart from universal suffrage and the general principles of ( lemocracy ; and that they may , partly perhaps by the application of the historical method , be discovered , and when discovered may be removed without touching the life of the republic . When we have separated from American democracy that which is not an essential part of it ; when we have made allowance for extraneous influences and temporary pressures ; when we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inherent and incurable vices ; and when , having done this , we survey the actual condition , material and social , of the American people , a foreign observer , while he must believe that there is much need of reform , and while he follows with the eye of anxious sympathy the efforts of reformers , can see no reason for despair . Perhaps his confidence will be greater if ho has lived not only in the great cities , where with much to excite admiration there is much to create misgiving , but in the country also , and there seen the strong foundations of the republic . And if you despair of democracy , whither will you flee ? As was said before , apart from sheer force , experience presents to us no basis for government except the national will and hereditary right . Hereditary monarchy is apparently dying even in the Old World . It lingers in the primeval East ; it lingers in half-Asiatic Russia ; but its decadence // in more civilized Europe is pronounced . Legitimacy and divine right are leaving the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Political writers now class England , notwithstanding her monarchical forms , as a republic also : and in the other countries , although monarchy exists , its attributes are greatly shorn and its character is profonudly altered by the revolutions . Scarcely a monarch sits by the same title as his father , and with his father 's prerogative , on his father 's throne . As to hereditary aristocracy , perhaps it may be said that in all lands social servility , which is one pillar of it , is still pretty strong ; but the other pillars of it , primogeniture and entail , it would be difficult to set up in a land which had once known justice . An empire of force like that of the Bonapartes was proposed some years ago , but without the smallest effect on public opinion . If you wanted an empire of force you allowed the opportunity of securing it to slip , for the road to such an empire lies through revolution and civil war . There seems to be nothing for it , then , but to purify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resignation , says an able and in the best sense patriotic writer after a mournfnl description of republican evils . So might a foreign observer say , in a more cheerful tone , if he were not too well aware that no one but a citizen knows the bitterness that is in the heart of his own country . What a foreigner may without misgiving say is that to purify the republic , if it is the hardest of all political tasks , is by far the highest ; that it has produced characters nobler than have been produced by political effort of any other kind ; and that the result to which , if successfully performed , it leads is the grandest , the happiest , and the most enduring that the political imagination can conceive . *oldwin Smith .
