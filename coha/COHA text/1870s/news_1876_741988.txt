txt The House Committee on Commerce , which is directed to investigate the alleged discrimination in freight charges by railroad companies whose lines run from the interior to the seaboard , last week examined A. J. Cassatt , one of the Vice Presidents of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company . Mr. Cassatt testified that his company operated about 6,000 tulles of road , traversing several States ; that they had established *rates of tariff for freight , but that frequently special contracts were made with shippers . When . asked to produce copies of these special contracts he declined until he could consult counsel . The committee postponed a decision as to whether ho should be required to produce the contracts asked for until to-morrow . This is an important issue , and should the committee insist upon the special contracts being produced some important developments may be made in connection with the ' subject matter of the investigation , and light may be thrown on the causes which have led to the war now being ' waged by the leading trunk lines . The people of Pittsburg and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for carrying freight from those . cities to the seaboard than are charged for carrying from Chicago and intervening points , and that in consequence of this ' discrimination the commerce and trade of the cities against which the discrimination is practiced are being ruined . The alleged discrimination is concealed iu the special Contracts , and those who are pushing the investigation are determined to take the matter into the House if the committee recedes from the demand for their production .
