txt On All Fool 's Day there was brought out at the Gaiety Theatre , in London , a comedy called " Shilly-Shally . " On the 17th ult .. the cable advised us that Mr. CHARLES READE had . announced his intention to Prosecute five journals for libel . We are further informed that the alleged libels have been contained in certain unfavorable criticisms upon the ? abovenamed play . Thus , " Shilly-Shally " is likely to achieve a fame which , to judge from such notices as have reached us , it would : have been unlikely to get on its own merits ; and the clever novelist 's move , whether dictated by policy or temper , will advertise " ShillyShally , " and may puff it into popularity . The sales of Griffith Gaunt were vastly increased by a similar action , and perhaps Mr. READE has been tempted by that reflection to repeat his experiment . We , of course , do not undertake to say , without seeing the criticisms , that Mr. READE has not in this-instance just cause of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offend in the same way , at the same time , our readers can estimate for themselves . There are some further grounds on which to base an opinion on the subject , one of which is the peculiar origin of the drama itself . " Shilly-Shally " is said . to be the joint production of Mr. READE and Mr. ANTHONY TROLLOPE . Just as the combined genius of Mr. READE and Mr. ROUCICA.IILT were ' required to manufacture " Foul Play , " a like potent conjunction has brought forth " Shilly-Shally . " The latter , however , is itself founded on a novel . Mr. TROLLOPEIS Ralph the Heir furnishes the plot of the drama , and , we suppose , most of the dialogue , while Mr. READE has presumably selected and adjusted the " situations , " and the juxtaposition of the scenes . Many readers - will remember the perplexities of Ralph Newton , who balances for so long the comparative advantages of marrying Claressa Underwood and Polly Neefit . The former is a young lady of unexceptionable education and social position . The latter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's breeches-maker . Ralph owes the tailor a heap of money , and the tailor burns to make a " swell " connection . Thus , to put it in the words of a critical contemporary , the tale deals with the vacillations of a narrow and nervous mind , such as Mr. Tnom , oisE has frequently delighted . in analyzing and exposing ; and thus the name of the play , " ShinyShelly " which is doubtless the invention of Mr. READE  --  is sufficiently appropriate . But Mr. READE has usually been unlucky with his plays , strong and racy as are most of his novels . In former cases , the way in which ho has got rid of the most dramatic Portions of his stories in adapting them to the stage has been almost like fatality . From such sketches as are before us , we infer that he has dealt with Mi . TROLLOPE 'S fiction in something like the same fashion . In the tale , Ontario Maggs is a figure of much humor , quaintness , and originality ; in the play much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so is much of Sir Thomas  --  also a creation of some individuality  --  while Squire Newton , one of the most characteristic of all the persons of the book , does not appear on the stage at all . However , the Pall Mall Gazette says that " the performance was attended with much applause , and the usual compliments to all concerned followed the fall of the curtain ; " so that we infer , whatever its sins of omission or commission , " Shilly-Shally " on its first night gained a fair measure of success . That measure , nevertheless , has not satisfied . Mr. READE ; or , rather , be conceived that it would have been greater but for the hard dealing of the critics , and , therefore , he apparently means to teach them a lesson , so that they shall not offend in future . If this teaching is deserved , of course we shall rejoice in its administration ; but if , as is more likely , the proceeding of the dramatist is dictated by a wish to advertise his play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right to censure Mr. READE as guilty of unprofessional , not to say unworthy , conduct . It is most important to the , stage and its patrons , and not altogether a matter of indifferenco to playwrights , that dramatic criticism should be free as air , within , of course , the lines of truth and justice . If those who write such comments are ever actuated by improper motives , let the animus be proved , and all honest interests will be the gainer by it . But the fact is , such imputations are frequently leveled when there is not one grain of truth in them . Nothing is more easy than for the friends of those who act or sing badly , or who write bad plays , to go about saying that malignant or selfish motives have led the critics to abuse them . Libel suits , as a rule , do not , to be sure , hurt those who do not deserve to have them brought against them . Still , it is from the purpose of law , to institute such proceedings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and hobo ? , if Mr. READE fails to make a , good case against the five journalists he intends to prosecute , his attempt , to put it in the most delicate shape possible , ought at least to bring him no honor .
