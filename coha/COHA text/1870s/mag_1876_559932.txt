OLD WOMAN 'S GOSSIP . VIII . LATE in middle life Mrs. Jameson formed an intimate acquaintance , which at one time assumed the character of a close friendship , with Lady Byron , under the influence of whose remarkable mind and character the subjects of artistic and literary interest , which had till then absorbed Mrs. Jameson 's attention and occupied her pen , gave place to others of a very different kind , - those which engrossed for a time , to the exclusion of almost all others , the minds of men and women in England at the beginning of the Crimean War ; when the fashion of certain forms of philanthropy set by that wonderful woman , Florence Nightingale , was making hospital nurses of idle , frivolous fine ladies , and turning into innumerable channels of newly awakened benevolence and activity , far more zealous than discreet , the love of adventure , the desire for excitement , and the desperate need of occupation , of many women who had no other qualifications for the hard and holy labors into which they flung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as it reached her through Lady Byron and Miss Nightingale , and warmly embraced the wider and more enlightened aspect of women 's duties beginning to be advocated with extreme enthusiasm in English society . One of the last books she published was a popular account of foreign Sisters of Mercy , their special duties , the organization of their societies , and the sphere of their operations ; suggestin0 the formation of similar bodies of religiously charitable sisterhoods in England . She had this subject so much at heart , she told me , that she had determined to give a series of public lectures upon it , provided she found her physical power equal to the effort of making herself heard by an audience in any public room of moderate size . She tested the strength of her chest and voice by delivering one lecture to an audience assembled in the drawlug-rooms of a friend ; but as she never repeated the experiment , I suppose she found the exertion too great for her . When first I met Mrs. Jameson she was an attractive-looking young woman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reddish hair , such as hers was ; her face , which was habitually refined and spirituelle in its expression , was capable of a marvelous power of concentrated feeling , such as is seldom seen on any woman 's face , and is peculiarly rare on the countenance of a fair , small , delicately-featured woman , all whose personal characteristics were essentially feminine . Her figure was extremely pretty ; her hands and arms might have been those of Madame de Warens . Mrs. Jameson told me that the idea of giving public lectures had suggested itself to her in the course of her conversations with Lady Byron upon the possible careers that might be opened to women . I know Lady Byron thought a very valuable public service might be rendered by women who so undertook to advocate important truths of which they had made special study , and for the dissemination of which in this manner they might be especially gifted . She accepted in the most liberal manner the claim put forward by women to more extended spheres of usefulness , and to the adoption of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , personally , in some who made the arduous attempt of studying and practicing medicine , and seemed generally to think that there were many directions in which women might follow paths yet unopened , of high and noble exertion , and hereafter do society and the cause of progress good service . Lady Byron was a peculiarly reserved and quiet person , with a manner habitually deliberate and measured , a low sub-316 March , // dued voice , and rather diffident hesitation in expressing herself ; and she certainly conveyed the impression of natural reticence and caution . But so far from ever appearing to me to justify the description oftcn given of her , of a person of exceptionally cold , hard , measured intellect and character , she always struck me as a woman capable of profound and fervid enthusiasm , with a mind of rather a romantic and visionary order . She surprised me extremely one evening as she was accompanying me to one of my public readings , by exclaiming , " Oh , how I envy you ! What would I not give to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am sorry to say , oftener appeared to me to justify my own regret than the envy of others , I answered , " What ! to read Shakespeare before some hundreds of people ? " " Oh no , " she said , " not to read Shakespeare to them , but to have all that mass of people under your control , subject to your influence , and receiving your impressions . " She then went on to say she would give anything to lecture upon subjects which interested her deeply , and that she should like to advocate with every power she possessed . Lady Byron , like most enthusiasts , was fond of influencing others and making disciples to her own views . I made her laugh by telling her that more than once , when looking from my reading-desk over the sea of faces uplifted towards me , a sudden feeling had seized me that I must say something from myself to all those human beings whose attention I felt at that moment entirely at my command , and between whom and myself a sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I looked steadfastly at them before opening my lips ; but that , on wondering afterwards what I might , could , would , or should have said to them from myself , I never could think of anything but two words : " Be good ! " which as a preface to the reading of one of Shakespeare 's plays ( The Merry Wives of Windsor , for instance ) might have startled them . Often and strongly as the temptation recurred to me , I never could think of anything better worth saying to my audience . I have some hope that sometimes in the course of the reading I said it effectually , without shocking them by a departure from my proper calling , or deserving the rebuke of " Ne sutor ultra crepidam . " In February , 1828 , I fell ill of the measles , of which the followin0 note to Miss S is a record . M* DEAREST H- : I am in a great hurry , because my parcel is not made up yet , and I expect your brother 's emissary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sends for my parcel is because we met him yesterday , as he was coming to our house , and so prevented his visit . I send you my play , also an album of mine , also an unfinished sketch of me , also a copy of my will . The play you must not keep , because it is my only copy ; neither must you keep my album , because I want to finish one of the pieces of verse begun in it ; my picture-such as it is-begun , but never finished , by Dick 0 , I thought you would like better than nothing . He has finished one that is a very good likeness of me , but it was done for my mother , or I should have wished you to have it . My will I made last week , while I was in bed with the measles , and want you to keep that . I have been very ill for the last fortnight , but am well again now . I am pressed for time to-day , but will soon write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find my play very long ; when my poor father began cutting it , he looked ruefully at it , and said , " There s plenty of it , Fan , " to which my reply is Madame de SivignCs , Si j'eusse en plus de temps , je ne t'aurais pas 6crit si longuement . " Dear H- , if you knew how I thought of you , and the fresh , sweet mayflowers with which we filled our baskets at Heath Farm , while I lay parched and full of pain and fever in my illness ! Yours ever , FANNY . My beloved aunt Dall nursed and tended me in my sickness with unwearied 18Th. 317 // devotion ; and one day when I was convalescent , finding me depressed in spirits and crying , she said laughingly to me , " Why , child , there is nothing the matter with you ; but you are weak in body and mind . " This seemed to me the most degraded of all conceivable conditions , and I fell into a redoublement of weeping over my own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large looking-glass opposite my bed , and it occurred to me that in my then condition of nerves nothing was more likely than that I should turn visionary and fancy I beheld apparitions . And under this conviction I got up and covered the glass , in which I felt sure I should presently " see sic sights as I daured na tell . " I speak of this because though I was in a physical condition not unlikely to produce such phenomena , I retained the power of perceiving that they would be the result of my physical condition , and that I should in some measure he accessory to my own terror , whatever form it might assume . I have so often in my life been on the very edge of ghost-seeing , and felt so perfectly certain that the least encouragement on my part would set them before me , and that nothing but a resolute effort of will would save me from such a visitation , that I have become convinced that of the people who have seen apparitions , one half have - as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have all my life suffered from a tendency to imaginary terrors , and have always felt sure that a determined exercise of self - control would effectually keep them from having the dominion over me . The most distressing form of nervous excitement that I have ever experienced was one that for many years I was very liable to , and which always recurred when I was in a state of unusual exaltation or depression of spirits ; both which states in me were either directly caused or greatly aggravated by certain electrical conditions of the atmosphere , which seemed to affect my whole nervous system as if I had been some machine expressly constructed for showing and testing the power of such influences on the human economy . I habitually read while combing and brushing my hair at night , and though I made no use of my looking- glass while thus employed , having my eyes fixed on my hook , I sat ( for purposes of general convenience ) at my toilet table in front of the mirror . While engrossed in my book it has frequently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fix them on my own image in the glass , when a feeling of startled surprise , as if I had not known I was there and did not immediately recognize my own reflection , would cause me to remain looking at myself , the intentness with which I did so increasing as the face appeared to me not my own ; and under this curious fascination my countenance has altered , becoming gradually so dreadful , so much more dreadful in expression than any human face I ever saw or could describe , while it was next to impossible for me to turn my eyes away from the hideous vision confrontin* me , that I have felt more than once that unless by the strongest effort of will Jimmediately averted my head , I should certainly become insane . Of course I was myself a party to this strange fascination of terror , and must , no doubt , have exercised some power of volition in the assumption of the expression that my face *radually presented , and which was in no sense a distortion or grimnee , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the memory of which even now affects me painfully . But though in some measure voluntary , I do not think I was conscious at the time that the process was so ; and I have never been able to determine the precise nature of this nervous affection , which beginning thus in a startled feeling of sudden surprise went on to such a climax of fascinated terror . I was already at this time familiar enough with the theory of ghosts , of which one need not be afraid , throu* , h Nicolai of Berlin 's interesting work upon the curious phantasmagoria of apparitions , on which he made and recorded so many singular observations . Moreover , my // mother , from a combination of general derangement of the system and special affection of the visual nerves , was at one time constantly tormented by whole processions and crowds of visionary figures , of the origin and nature of which she was perfectly aware , hut which she often described as exceedingly annoying by their grotesque and distorted apl ) earance , and wearisome from their continual recurrence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health she obtained a release from this disagreeable haunting . One of the most remarkable and painful instances of affection of the visual organs in consequence of a violent nervous shock was that experienced by my friend Miss T , who , after seeing her cousin , Lady L , drowned while bathing off the , rocks at her home at Ardgillan , was requested by Lord L to procure for him , before his wife 's burial , the wedding ring from her finger . The poor lady 's body was terribly swollen and discolored , and Miss T had to use considerable effort to withdraw the ring from the dead finger . The effect of the whole disastrous event upon her was to leave her for several months afflicted with an affection of the eyes which represented half of the face of every person she saw with the swollen , livid , and distorted features of her drowned cousin ; a horrible and ghastly result of the nervous shock she had undergone , which she feared she should never be delivered from , but which gradually wore itself out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under singularly unfavorable circumstances for such an experience . I was sitting at midday in an American railroad car , which every occupant but my maid and myself had left to go and get some refreshment at the station , where the train stopped some time for that purpose . I was sitting with my maid in a small private compartment , sometimes occupied by ladies traveling alone , the door of which ( wide open at the time ) communicated with the main carriage , and commanded its entire length . Suddenly a person entered the carriage by a door close to where I sat , and passed down the whole length of the car . I sprang from my seat , exclaiming aloud , " There is C ! " and rushed to the door before , by any human possibility , any one could have reached the other end of the car ; but nobody was to be seen . My maid had seen nothing . The person I imagined I had seen was upwards of two hundred miles distant ; but what was to me the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met her anywhere , my most careful endeavor would have been to avoid her , and , if possible , to escape being seen by her ; whereas this apparition , or imagination , so affected my nerves that I rushed after it as if desirous of pursuing and overtaking it , while my deliberate desire with regard to the person whose image I4hus sprang towards would have been never to have seen her again as long as I lived . The state of the atmosphere at the time of this occurrence was extraordinarily oppressive , and charged with a tremendous thunder - storm , a condition of the air which , as I have said , always acts with extremely distressing and disturbing influence upon my whole physical system . ST . JAMES STREET , BucmmxouAM GATE , Fe6ruary , 1828 . M* DEAREST II I have this instant received your letter , and , contrary to John 's wise rule of never answering an epistle till three days after he receives it , I sit down to write , to talk , to be with you . Pray , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the sun , and your hills are half hid in warm mist , wish one hearty wish for me , such as I spend by the dozen on you . I confess I am disappointed , as far as I can be with a letter of yours , at finding you had not yet received my parcel , for my vanity has been in considerable anxiety respectin , , your judgment on my production . Now that the effervescence of my poetical furor has subsided , and that repeated perusals have taken a little of the charm of novelty from my play , my own opinion of it is that it is a clever performance for so young a person , but nothin0 more . The 1876. 319 // rest will , I hope , be better , and I think you will agree with me in regard to this . Dearest II , in my last letter want of time and room prevented my enlarging on my hint about the stage , but as far as my own determination goes at present , I think it is the course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ independence of mind and body seems to me the great desideratum of life ; I am not patient of restraint or submissive to authority , and my bead and heart are engrossed with the idea of exercising and developing the literary talent which I think I possess . This is meat , drink , and sleep to me ; my world , in which I live and have my happiness ; and moreover , I hope , my means of fame ( the prize for which I pray ) . To a certain degree it may be my means of procuring benefit* of a more substantial nature , which I am by no means inclined to estimate at less than their worth . I do not think I am fit to marry , to make an obedient wife or affectionate mother ; my imagination is paramoured with me , and would disqualify mc , I think , for the every-day , matter-of-fact cares and duties of the mistress of a household and the head of a family . I think I should be unhappy and the cause of unhappiness to others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I shall never fall in love , but if I do I will fall out of it again , for I do not think I shall ever so far lose sight of my best interest and happiness as to enter into a relation for which I feel so unfit . Now , if I do not marry , what is to become of me in the event of anything happening to my father ? TIis property is almost all gone ; I doubt if we shall ever receive one pound from it . Is it likely that , supposing I were willing to undergo the drudgery of writing for my bread , I could live by my wits and the produce of my brain ; or is such an existence desirable ? Perhaps I might attain to the literary dignity of being the lioness of a season , asked to dinner parttes " hecause I am so clever ; * perhaps my writing faculty might become a useful auxiliary to some other less precarious dependence ; but to write to eat , - to live , in short , - that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard fashion . The stage is a profession that people who have a talent for it make lucrative , and which honorable conduct may make respectable ; one which would place me at once beyond the fear of want , and that is closely allied in its r*ature to my beloved literary pursuits . If I should ( as my father and mother seem to think not unlikely ) Thange my mind with respect to marrying , the stage need be no bar to that , and if I continue to write , the stage might both help me in and derive assistance from my exercise of the pursuit of dramatic authorship . And the mere mechanical labor of writing costs me so little that the union of the two occupations does not seem to me a difficulty . My father said the other day , " There is a fine fortune to be made by any young woman of even ( Iccent talent , on the stage now . " A fine fortune is a fine thing ; to be snrc , there remains a rather matcrial question to settle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passion for all beautiful poetry I am sure you will grant me ; and you would perhaps be inclined to take my father and mother 's word for my dramatic capacity . I spoke to them earnestly on this subject lately , and they both , with some reluctance , I think , answered me , to my questions , that they thought as far as they could judge ( and , unless partiality blinds them entirely , none can be better judges ) I might succeed . In some respects , no girl intending herself for this profession can have had better opportunities of acquiring just notions on the subject of acting . I have constantly heard refined and thoughtful criticism on our greatest dramatic works , and on every various way of rendering them effective on the stage . I have been lately very frequently to the theatre , and seen and heard observingly , and exercised my own judgment and critical faculty to the best of my ability , according to these same canons of taste by which it has been formed . Nature has certainly not been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I am to embrace a calling where personal // beauty , if not indispensable , is so great an advantage . But if the informing spirit be mine , it shall go hard if , with a face and voice as obedient to my emotions as mine are , I do not in some measure make up for the want of good looks . My father is now proprietor and manager of the theatre , and those certainly are favorable circumstances for my entering on a career which is one of great labor and some exposure , at the best , to a woman , and where a young girl can not be too prudent herself , nor her protectors too careful of her . I hope I have not taken up this notion hastily , and I have no fear of looking only on the bright side of the picture , for ours is a house where that is very seldom seen . Good-by ; God bless you ! I shall be very anxious to hear from you ; I sent you a note with my play , telling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but as my note has not reached you I tell you so again . I am quite well , however , now , and shall not give them to you by signing myself Yours most affectionately , FANNY . P. S. I forgot to answer your questions in telling you all this , but I will do so methodically now . My side-ache is some disturbance in my liver , evidently , and does not give way entirely either to physic or exercise , as the slightest emotion , either pleasurable or painful , immediately brings it on ; my blue devils I pass over in silence ; such a liver and my kind of head are sure to breed them . Certainly I reverence Jeremy Bentham for his philanthropy , plain powerful sense , and lucid forcible writing ; but as for John 's politics , they are , as Beatrice tells the prince he is , " too costly for every-day wear . " His theories are so perfect that I think imperfect men could never be brought to live under a scheme of government of his devising . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by ballot , which is one of his favorite reforms . I will give my reasons for doing so hereafter , if you want them ; but as for pulling down the old house by sudden jerks of radical change , I am not for that , before a new one is made sound for us . The Duke of Wellington VOL. xxxvir. - No. 221. 21 seems determined to stand stock - still , or march no way but bnckwards , and that seems a pity . I think Mrs. Jameson would like you , and you her , if you met , but my mind is running on something else than this . My father 's income is barely eight hundred a year . John 's expenses since he has been at college have been nearly three . Five hundred a year for such a family as ours is very ciose and careful work , dear H , and if my going on the stage would nearly double that income , lessen my dear father 's anxieties for us all and the quantity of work which he latterly has often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ privations which my dear mother cheerfully endures , as well as the weight of her uncertainty about our future provision , would not this be a " consummation devoutly to be wished ? ST . JAMES STREET , BUCKINGITAM GATE , March , 1828 . M* DEAREST H I have been thinking what you have been thinking of my long silence , about which , however , perhaps you have not been thinking at all . What you say in one of your last about my destroying your letters troubles me a good deal , dearest H . I really can not bear to think of it ; why , those . letters are one of my very few precious possessions . When I am unhappy ( as I somctimes am ) , I read them over , and I feel strengthened and comforted ; if it is your positive desire that I should burn them , of course I must do it ; but if it is only a sort of " I think you had better , " that you have about it , I shall keep them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I ca n't keep it 's . " As for my own scrawls , I do not desire that you should keep them . I write , as I speak , on the impulse of the moment , and I should be sorry that the incoherent and often contradictory thoughts that I pour forth daily should be preserved against me by anybody . My father is now in Edinburgh . He has been absent from London about a week . I had a conversation with him aboutthe stage some time before he went , in which he allowed that , should our mis 1876. 321 // erably uncertain circumstances finally settle unfavorably , the theatre might be an honorable and advantageous resource for me ; but that at present he should be sorry to see me adopt that career . As he is the best and kindest father and friend to us all , such a decision on his part was conclusive , as you will easily believe ; and I have forborne all further allusion to the subject , although on some accounts I regret being obli*ed to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criticisms ; I am grateful to you for taking the trouble of telling me so minutely all you thought about my play . For myself , although at the time I wrote it I was rather puffed up and elated in spirit , and looked at it naturally in far too favorable a light , I assure you I have long since come to a much soberer frame of mind respectin* it . I think it is quite unfit for the stage , where the little poetical merit it possesses would necessarily be lost ; besides , its construction is wholly undramatic ; the only satisfaction 1 now take in it is entirely one of hope . I am very young , and I can not help feeling that it offers some promise for the future , which I trust may be fulfilled . Now even , already , I am sure I could do infinitely better ; nor will it be lon0 , I think , before I try my strength again . If you could see the multiplicity of subjects drawn up in my book under the head of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and perhaps your lean sides . I wish I could write a good prose work , but that , I take it , is really difficult , as good , concise , powerful , clear prose mu t be much less easy to write than even tolerable poetry . I have been reading a quantity of German plays ( translation** , of course , but literal ones ) , and I have been reveling in that divine devildom , Faust . Suppose it does send one to bed with a side-ache , a head-ache , and a heart-ache , is n't it worth while ? Did you ever read Goethe 's Tasso ? Certainly he makes the mad poet a mighty disagreeable person ; but in describing him it seemed to me as if Goethe was literally transcribing my thoughts and feelings , my mind and being . Now , dearest H , do n't bear malicQ , and , because I have not written for so long , wait still longer before you answer . My mother has been in the country for a few days and has returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maladies she finds the house full here to welcome her , so that we all croak in unison most harmoniously . I was at the Siddonses ' the other evening . My aunt was suffering , I am sorry to say , with one of her terrible head-aches ; Cecilia was pretty well , but as it was a soire'e cliantante , I had little opportunity of talking to either of them . Did you mention my notion about going on the stage in any of your letters to Cecy ? The skies are brightening and the trees are budding ; it will soon be the time of year when we first met . Pray remember me when the hawthorn blossoms ; hail , snow , or sunshine I retnember you , and am ever your affectionate FANNY . The want of a settled place of residence compelled me , many years after writing this letter , to destroy the letters of my friend , which I had preserved until they amounted to many hundreds ; my friend kept , in the house that was her home from her fourteenth to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several thousands , the history of a whole human life , - and gave them back to me when she was upwards of seventy and I of sixty years old ; they are the principal aid to my memory in my present task of retrospection . My life at home at this time became difficult and troublesome , and unsatisfactory to myself and others ; my mind and character were in a chaotic state of fermentation that required the wisest , firmest , and gentlest guidance . I was vehement and excitable , violently impulsive , and with a wild , ill-regulated imagination . The sort of smattering acquirements from my schooling , and the desultory reading which had been its only supplement , had done little or nothing ( perhaps even worse than nothing ) towards my effectual moral or mental training . A good fortune for which I can never be // sufficiently thankful occurred to me at this time , in the very intimate intercourse which grew up just then between our family and that of my cousin , Mrs. Henry Siddons . She had passed through London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going for the sake of the health of her youngest daughter , an interesting and attractive young girl some years older than myself , who at this time seemed threatened with imminent consumption . She had a sylph - like , slender figure , tall , and bending and wavering like a young willow sapling , and a superabundant profusion of glossy chestnut ringlets , which in another might have suggested vigor of health and constitution , but always seemed to me as if their redundant masses had exhausted hers , and were almost too great a weight for her slim throat and drooping fi*ure . Her complexion was transparently delicate , and she had dark blue eyes that looked almost preternaturally large . It seems strange to remember this ethereal vision of girlish fragile beauty as belonging to my dear cousin , who , having fortunately escaped the doom by which she then seemed threatened , lived to become a most happy and excellent wife and mother , and one of the lar* , est women of our family , all of whose female members have been unusually slender in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When Mrs. Henry Siddons was obliged to return to Edinburgh , which was her home , she was persuaded by my mother to leave her daughter with us for some time ; and for more than a year she and her elder sister and their brother , a lad studying at the Indian Military College of Addiscombe , were frequent inmates of our house . The latter was an extremely handsome youth , with a strikin0 resemblance to his grandmother , Mrs. Siddons ; he and my brother Henry were certainly the only two of the younger generation who honorably maintained the reputation for beauty of their elders ; in spite of which and the general admiration they excited ( especially when seen together ) , perhaps indeed from some un comfortable consciousness of their personal advantages , they were both of them shamefaced and bashful to an unusual degree . I remember a comical instance of the shy mauvaise konte , peculiar to Englishmen , which these two beautiful boys exhibited on the occasion of a fancy ball , to which we were all invited , at the house of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , my first fancy ball was an event of unmixed delight , especially as my mother had provided for me a lovely Anne Boleyn costume of white satin , point- lace , and white Roman pearls , which raised my satisfaction to rapture . The two Harrys , however , far from partaking of my ecstasy , protested , pouted , begged off , all but broke into open rebellion at the idea of making what they called " guys * and " chimney-sweeps* ' of themselves ; and though the painful sense of any singularity might have been mitigated by the very numerous company of their fellow-fools assembled in the ball-room , to keep them in countenance , and the very unpretending costume of simple and elegant black velvet in which my mother had attired them , as Hamlet and Laertes ( it must have been in their very earliest college days ) , they hid themselves behind the ball - room door and never showed as much as their noses or their toes , while I danced beatifically till daylight , and would have danced on till @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with us , obtained my mother 's consent that I should go to Edinburgh to pay her a visit , which began by being of indeterminate length , and prolonged itself for a year , - the happiest of my life , as I often , while it lasted , thought it would prove ; and now that my years are over I know to have been so . To the anxious , nervous , exciting , irritating tenor of my London life succeeded the calm , equable , and all but imperceptible control of my dear friend , whose influence over her children , the result of her wisdom in dealing with them , no less than of their own amiable dispositions , was absolute . In considering Mrs. Henry Siddons 's character , when years had mod1876. *323 // ified its first impression upon my own , my estimate of it underwent , of course , some inevitable alteration ; but when I stayed with her in Edinburgh I was at the idolatrous period of life , and never , certainly , had an enthusiastic young girl worshiper a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but of a sweet and most engaging countenance ; her figure was very pretty , her voice exquisite , and her whole manner , air , and deportment graceful , attractive , and charming . Men , women , and children not only loved her , but inevitably fell in love with her , and the fascination which she exercised over every one that came in contact with her invariably deepened into profound esteem and con6dence , in those who had the good fortune to share her intimacy . Tier manner , which was the most gentle and winning imaginable , had in it a touch of demure playfulness that was very charming , at the same time that it habitually conveyed the idea of extreme self-control and a great reserve of moral force and determination underneath this quiet surLace . Mrs. Harry 's manner was artificial , and my mother told me she thought it the result of an early determination to curb the demonstrations of an impetuous temper and passionate feelings . It had become her second nature when I knew her , however , and contributed not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my vehement and stormy character . She charmed me into absolute submission to her will and wishes , and I all but worshiped her . She was a Miss Murray , and came of good Scottish blood , her great - grandfather having at one time been private secretary to the young Pretender . She married Mrs. Siddons 's youngest son , Harry , the only one of my aunt 's children who adopted her own profession , and who , himself an indifferent actor , undertook the management of the Edinburgh theatre , fell into ill-health , and died , leaving his lovely young widow with four children to the care of her brother , William Murray , who succeeded him in the government of the theatre , of which his sister and himself became joint proprietors . Edinburgh at that time was still the small but important capital of Scotland , instead of what railroads and modern progress have reduced it to , merely the largest town . Those were the days of the giants , Scott , Wilson , Hogg , Jeffrey , Brougham , Sidney Smith , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the formidable intellectual phalanx that held mental dominion over the En0lish-spenking world , under the blue and yellow standard of the Edinburgh Review ; they were an amazing company of brains , to be sure . The ancient city had still its regular winter season of fashionable gayety , during which sedan chairs were to be seen carrying through its streets , to its evening assen*blies , the more elderly members of the beau monde . The nobility and gentry of Scotland came up from their distant country residences to their town houses in " Auld Reekie , " as they now come up to London . Edinburgh was a brilliant and peculiarly intellectual centre of society , with a stron0ly marked national character , and the theatre held a distinguished place among the recreations ; the many eminent literary and professional men who then made the Scotch capital illustrious being zealous patrons of the drama and frequenters of the play-house , and proud , with reason , of their excellent theatrical company , at the head of which was William Murray , one of the most perfect actors I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Mackay , admirable actors and cultivated , highly intelligent men , were conspicuous for their ability . Mrs. Henry Siddons held a peculiar position in Edinburgh , her widowed condition and personal attractions combinin0 to win the sympathy and admiration of its best society , while her high character and blameless conduct secured the respect and esteem of her theatrical subjects and the general public , with whom she was an object of almost affectionate personal regard , and in whose favor , as long as she exercised her profession , // she continued to hold the first place , in spite of their temporary enthusiasm for the great London stars who visited them at stated seasons . " Our Mrs. Siddons , " I have repeatedly heard her called in Edinburgh , not at all with the slightest idea of comparing her with her celebrated mother-in-law , but rather as expressing the kindly personal goodwill and the admiring approbation with which she was regarded by her own towhs-folk , who were equally proud and fond of her . She was not a great actress , nor even what in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had no natural versatility or power of assumption whatever , and what was opposed to her own nature and character was altogether out of the range of her powers . On the other hand , when ( as frequently happened ) she had to embody heroines whose characteristics coincided with her own , her grace and beauty and innate sympathy with everything good , true , pure , and upright made her an admirable representative of all such characters . She wanted physical power and weight for the great tragic drama of Shakespeare , and passion for the heroine of his love tragedy ; but Viola , Rosalind , Isabel , Imogen , could have no better representative . In the first part Sir Walter Scott has celebrated ( in the novel of Waverley ) the striking effect produced by her resemblance to her brother , William Murray , in the last scene of Twelfth Night ; and in many pieces founded upon the fate and fortune of Mary Stuart she gave an unrivaled impersonation of the " enchanting queen " of modern history . My admiration and affection for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and some of the various methods I took to exhibit them were , I dare say , intolerably absurd , though she was graciously good-natured in tolerating them . Every day , summer and winter , I made it my business to provide her with a sprig of myrtle for her sash at dinnertime ; this , when she had worn it all the evening , Ireceived again on bidding her good night , and stored in a treasure drawer , which , becoming in time choked 325 with fragrant myrtle leaves , was emptied with due solemnity into the fire , that destruction in the most classic form might avert from them all desecration . I ought by rights to have eaten their ashes , or drunk a decoction of them , or at least treasured them in a golden urn , but contented myself with watching them shrivel and crackle with much sentimental satisfaction . I remember a most beautiful myrtle-tree , which by favor of a peculiarly sunny and sheltered exposure had reached a very unusual size in the open air in Edinburgh , and in the flowering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the warm terraces of the under cliff of the Isle of Wight . From this I procured my daily offering to my divinity . It has always seemed to me sine , ular that the ancients should have held the myrtle sacred to Venus ; beautiful , it seems to me , above all other flowers , but it is of a severe as well as sweet beauty ; its rather stiff and formal growth , its sharply cut and polished dark green leaves , its pure , delicate , spiritual blossom , and the aromatic fragrance of its verdure , which indeed requires bruising to draw it forth , are all chaste and original characteristics which do not indicate the flower possessing them as the appropriate one for her to whom the rose was dedicated , and of whom the perfectest rose was the perfectest type . The myrtle is the least voluptuous of flowers ; the legend of Juno 's myrtlesheltered bath seems not unnaturally suggested by the vigorous , fresh , and healthy beauty of the plant , and the purity of its snowy blossoms . The exquisite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncorrupted the water in which it is placed , with other flowers , is a sort of moral attribute , which , combined with the peculiar character of its fragrance , seems to me to distinguish this lovely shrub from every other flower of the field or garden . To return to my worship of Mrs. Harry Siddons . On one occasion , the sash of her dress came unfastened and fell to the ground , and , having secured pos Old TfToman 's Goss*p. // session of it , 1 retained my prize and persisted in wearing it , baidric fashion , over every dress I put on . It was a silk scarf , of a sober dark gray color , and occasionally produced a most fantastical and absurd contrast with what I was wearino These were childish expressions of a feeling the soberer portion of which remains with me even now , and makes the memory of that excellent woman , and kind , judicious friend , still very dear to my grateful affection . Not only was the change of discipline under which I now lived advantageous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have been quite impossible in London , was delightful to me ; while the wonderful , picturesque beauty of Edinburgh , contrasted with the repulsive dinginess and ugliness of my native city , was a constant source of the liveliest pleasure to me . Is there a more beautiful city in the world than that Scotch fortress-crowned metropolis , the mountains , framing every picture of which it is the centre , on one side , and the sea on the other ? - where on one hand Arthur 's Seat overhangs the town , its verdant , turfy slopes sinking down in lovely curves towards Holyrood and Dalkeith , a perfect model of a mountain in all its features and whole configuration ( though wanting the supreme quality of great mountain height ) ; and on the other the splendid broken mass of the Castle Cliff , with its bristlin* crest , springs straight up from its rocky roots in the very heart of the fair city , like some great flower of war , and confronts the Salisbury Crags and their long line of battlemented cliff ; while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose outline and position have given to Edinburgh its title of the modern Athens , rises in gradual slopes and terraces to a height that gives the spectator the most favorable point of view for the unrivaled panorama which it commands . Hence the eye wanders in delight over the time-tinted , ( Turner forbid I should say stained ! ) irregular masses of the old town to the broad , bright* , stately avenues and edifices of the new ; to the beautiful Frith of . Forth , its winding shores and picturesque islands , and the Ochil Hills , throwing their delicate purple outline on the horizon beyond ; while on the opposite side , the smoothswarded slopes and shoulders of the Braid and Pentland Hills , and the ( lark , wooded crests and ravines of the Cortorphines , complete the enchantment of a landscape possessing every combination of various beauty . Almost beneath one 's feet lies Holyrood Palace , with its quadrangles and cloisters and beautiful ruined arches , and but a little farther on the remains of St. Anthony 's Chapel , crumbling among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Seat . The indescribable mixture of historic and romantic interest with all this present , visible beauty , the powerful charm of the Scotch ballad poetry , which now began to seize upon my imagination , and the inexhaustible enchantment of the associations thrown by the great modern magician over every spot made memorable by his mention , combined to affect my mind and feelings at this most susceptible period of my life , and made Edinburgh dear and delightful to me above all other places I ever saw , as it still remains , - with the one exception of Rome , whose combined claim to veneration and admiration no earthly city can indeed dispute . Seen from far or near , in a distant mass , when its noble outline against the sky assumes the figure of a colossal couchant lion , or in detail , when the eye divides part from part of its varied and picturesque features , nowhere , I believc , can a more interesting or beautiful object or group of objects engage the attention of poet or painter , or stamp themselves upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edinburgh ! dear to me for all its beauty and all the happiness that I have never failed to find there , for the keen delight of my yeain ' o* youthful life spent among its enchanting influences , and for the kind friends and kindred whose affectionate hospitality has made each return thither as happy as sadder // and older years allowed , - my blessing on every stone of its streets ! I had the utmost liberty allowed me in my walks about the city , and at early morning have often run up and round and round the Calton Hill , delighting , from every point where I stopped to breathe , in the noble panorama on every side . Not unfrequently I walked down to the sands at Porto Bello and got a sea bath , and returned before breakfast ; while on the other side of the town my rambles extended to New Haven and the rocks and sands of Cramond Beach . While Edinburgh had then more the social importance of a capital , it had a much smaller extent ; great portions of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bridge of Dean were still out of town ; there was no Scott 's monument in Princes Street , no railroad terminus with its smoke and scream and steam scaring the echoes of the North Bridge ; no splendid Queen 's Drive encircled Arthur 's Seat . Windsor Street , in which Mrs. Harry Siddons lived , was one of the most recently finished , and broke off abruptly above gardens and bits of meadow land and small , irregular inclosures and mean , scattered houses , stretching down towards Warriston Crescent ; while from the balcony of the drawing - room the eye , passing over all this untidy suburban district , reached without any intervening buildings the blue waters of the Forth and Inchkeith with its revolving light . Standin* , on that balcony late one cold , clear night , watchin0 the rising and setting of that sea star that kept me fascinated out in the chill air , I saw for the first time the sky illuminated with the aurora borealis . It was a magnificent display of the phenomenon , and I feel certain that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound which appeared to accompany the motion of the pale flames as they streamed across the sky ; indeed , crackling is not the word that properly describes the sound I heard , which was precisely that made by the flickering of blazing fire ; and as I have often since read and heard discussions upon the question whether the motion of the aurora is or is not accompanied by an audible sound , I can only say that on this occasion it was the sound that first induced me to observe the sheets of white li0ht that were leapin0 up the sky . At this time I knew nothin0 of these phenomena , or the debates among scientific men to which they had given rise , and can therefore trust the impression made on my senses . I have since then witnessed repeated appearances of these beautiful meteoric lights , but have nerer again detected any sound accompanying their motion . The finest aurora I ever saw was at Lenox , Massachusetts ; a splendid rosecolored pavilion appeared to be spread all over the sky , through which , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visible , while at the zenith the luminous drapery seemed gathered in to folds , the color of which deepened almost to crimson . It was wonderfully beautiful . At Lenox , too , one night during the season of the appearance of the great comet of 1858 , the splendid flaming plume hovered over one side of thc sky , while all round the other horizon streams of white fire appeared to rise from altars of white light . It was awfully glorious , and beyond all description beautiful . The sky of that part of the United States , particularly in the late autumn and winter , was more frequently visited by magnificent meteors than any other with which I have been acquainted . At that season of the year hardly an evening closed in without some apparition of brilliant light sweeping like a discarded world down through the gloom ; and I have driven at night over the hills between Stockbridge and Lenox , when a perfect shower of these beautiful meteors has flashed on every side . The extraordinary purity , dryness , and elasticity of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause of these heavenly showers ; the clear transparency of the sky by day often giving one the feeling that one was looking straight into heaven without any intermediate window of atmospheric air , while at night ( especially in winter ) the world of stars , 18Th. 327 // larger , brighter , more numerous than they ever seemed to me elsewhere , and yet apparently infinitely higher and farther off , were set in a depth of dark whose blackness appeared transparent rather than opaque . Midni* , ht after midnight I have stood , when the thermometer was twenty and more degrees below freezing , looking over the silent , snow - smothered hills round the small mountain village of Lenox , fast asleep in their embrace , and from thence to the solemn sky rising above them like a huge iron vault hung with thousands of glittering steel weapons , from which , every now and then , a shining scimitar fell flashing earthwards ; it was a cruel-looking sky , in its relentless radiance . My solitary walks round Edinburgh have left two especial recollections in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very sad . I will speak of the latter first ; it was like a leaf out of the middle of a tragedy , of which I never knew either the beginning or the end . Frances Anne Kemble . @
