Full oft ye merrie Gambolier In gay attire is seen ; Ye sportive cuss doth love to Play And Gambol on ye Green . He fain doth Cut , he loves ye Chips , When he to balls doth go ; Ye Double Shuffle is for him , Ye Break-down for his foe . No storms appall ye Gambolier For winds he doth not reck ; For he is ever on ye Seize , And traveleth on ye Deck . Ye Gambolier doth ever speak Like Hamlet , by ye Card ; A soldier he who serveth not , Save on ye Picquet-guard . Ever ye swifter passeth he Ye more he lags behind , And eke more sharply doth he See When he is Going Blind . When Death doth Call , and rakes his Pile , No panic doth he feel ; He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ De'il . John Hay .
