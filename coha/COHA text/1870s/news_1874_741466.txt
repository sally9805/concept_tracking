txt A story is told about an emigration agent and a Dorsetshire laborer , which , whether true or not , has been often repeated as an illustration of the stupidity of the latter personage . The agent bad been dilating upon the virtues of emigration . His interests were divided , apparently , between this country and New-Zealand , and he drew a vivid picture of the luxuries of emigrant life in either land . But the laborer was not readily convinced , and he asked to be allowed to consider the subject till the following morning . The request being granted , he at the appointed time announced his decision to remain where he was , because he could not learn that in those new countries there were any work-houses . We are not sure that it ought not to be regarded rather as an illustration of the prudence and caution of the laborer , who thus looked forward to the possibility of the agent 's promises not.being wholly fulfilled ; or that there is not an undercurrent of satire in it which makes it not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many parts of this country as , there are in England it can not be said that there are not means provided for assisting the poor . If it be true , as it doubtless is , that in England no person , man , woman , or child , need perish for want of food , so also is it , in a large measure , true here . But it must be acknowledged that the means of obtaining relief here are not so evident as they might be to be properly effectual . Several times lately our columns have contained evidence of this . One day it comes in the narrative of a pitiable affair in Jersey City , . where a child seven years of age died from disease and atarvation . Three physicians had been applied to by the distressed mother , but in vain . There was no medical aid to be had . A few loaves of bread were all that could be procured from the Poormaster , and for days in succession this family of four persons was left without food . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother herself fell prostrate from exhaustion , or , in other words , starvation , that a little help came , and with it the County Physician . On another occasion we have it in the account of a parent deserting his child in the streets , that he may of necessity come into the safekeeping ' of the Police , rather than that he should perish for want of food . Again we have the distressing history which we ? published yesterday from Hartford , where a steady working man , with all the ability and necessary ambition to earn a livelihood , fell suddenly ill from fatigue , destitution , . and hunger , and died without any assistance being forthcoming . He was buried in the Potter 's Field , without even the presence of a minister of religion . Without attempting to enter upon the wide question as to how such cases are to be prevented , it will be conceded , we think , by everybody that they ought not to have occurred . It is not to be expected that all the strangers'who come among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  not an unlikely one ? of their being reduced to the inability to ? earn a living . Neither would it be politic to render the facilities for procuring eleemosynary aid so groat that idle people would be encouraged . But in the three instances we have mentioned , the persons were not strangers , although it is stated that the Poormaster of Jersey City at first refused help to the dying child , on the plea that it had not resided long enough in the city to be entitled to public relief . It is , however , we think , sufficiently shown from those and many other like occurrences that the organization for giving such relief is not as effective as it ought in justice to be . However prosperous a community may be , there will always be many in it to whom a little temporary assistance may be necessary : The way to procure this should be plain and open to all . It ought not to be said that the undeserving poor are better off than the poor who have just claims upon our sympathy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are allowed to die of want in our midst without relief in any form , and that their bodies may be put into a pauper 's *grave , without the decencies of Christian burial . We have no need for work-houses , but , we do want more effectual means than we have for saving the deserving poor from death by starvation .
