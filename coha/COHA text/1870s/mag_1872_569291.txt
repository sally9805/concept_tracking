ARTICLE IV. - THE FOUNDATION OF MORAL OBLIGATION . THE foundation of moral obligation is one of the points in moral science where philosophers have always differed . These differences have greatly weakened the practical power of moral ideas , and strengthened the hostile position of opposers to truth . Obligation has its peculiar characteristics . It can be clearly stated and accurately defined as a fact in human experience . Not , however , as some affirm , by synonymous terms merely . As a state of being obligated , it is a movement in the sensibility , a feeling preceded by * judgment of the intellect This prior judgment is a pure decision of the reason , which affirms that the choice we feel obligated to make , or the course of action to pursue , is the right thing to be done-that which is fitted to secure the end . The feeling which we call obligation is a necessary consequent upon this judgment , and is a movement in the sensibility , under certain conditions , and , as the feeling of obligation simply , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characteristics which distinguish it from all others within the experiences of moral beings . It is wholly unlike the feeling of i*iere awakened desire of pleasure , which pleads to be admitted and cherished . This feeling is of the nature of the imperative . It assumes the control of the will by authority . It demands admission to the exclusion of everything else . It gives the clearest intimations and the brightest promises of happiness when admitted and cherished , but a sad reverse of woe , if rejected . These are some of the characteristics of this feeling of obligation . It prescribes duty , something to be done , and when done the action is known by all to be right , and its rejection wrong . In seeking after the foundation of obligation , we enquire for the origin of this feeling . What is it that issues this imperative . which of itself assumes this high authority to bind the moral being to duty , and to hold him fast to blessedness or woe , on condition of being admitted or rejected ? This is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another , some assigning one cause of this feeling as ultimate and some another . Apparently there is a wide difference among them on this fundamental point Still this difference is more apparent than real : for nearly all the things affirmed by one to be true are admitted to be such by the others ; except the single affirmation that the thing in question is the ultimate originating cause of obligation-is its foundation . What is that which in itself imposes obligation ? We say in itself ; and not by or through any representative . A rightful ruler is the source of authority . His will imposes duty on subjects . His minister or messenger who bears his commands is simply his representative , not the primary source of authority . So we seek not for the proximate representative , or any representative of the source of obligation , but for the ultimate source itself ; that which in and by its own nature imposes it . By some the free moral being with all his known faculties , or the power of free choice simply , is made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affirmation is true , that there can be no obligation without a being capable of it ; which is a condition of obligation , but nothing more . It gives no rational account of the foundation of duty . Our inquiry is for the ultimate reason for the existence of this feeling in the minds of moral beings , admitting such beings to be in existence with all their acknowledged capacities to feel obligation . What is it that comes down with this peculiar imperative on such beings ? The nature or fitness of things is assigned by other philosophers as the ground of obligation ; and not without some measure of truth in it . All things have their peculiar nature and fitness one to another . That which imposes obligation has a nature which fits it to do this . So too the moral being on whom this force is exerted has a nature fitting him to be thus moved . These are fitnesses of things as God made them . But to ascertain the ultimate ground of obligation we should be shown what these things are , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really fits them to be or to do what is claimed for them . Many things may have a nature fitting them to impose obligation , or fitting them to be the necessary elements of its existence . A physician is summoned to attend // a sick and suffering patient-he has an able-bodied horse fitted , if rightly guided , to bring him to the side of his patient . The nature of the horse may be in these circumstances as valuabl*e as the life of the man . The physician is obligated to go , and the horse is a necessary means to the existence of this obligation , but does the horse impose it ? Again , the skill of the physician is necessary to the existence of this obligation . But this skill no more imposes obligation than the horse , one being as necessary to its existence as the other ; but the welfare of the patient , his valuable life to be saved , or his sufferings to be relieved constitutes the good which binds to duty . It is also asserted that there is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ binding influence . This is very true ; but what is this necessity ? and what is the ultimate ground of it ? What object creates it ? Is it such as to originate obligation ? These are important questions , and must have an answer , before the ground of obligation is reached . By others it is affirmed that right is the basis of obligation , an abstract idea which no one can define ; and that right must be chosen for the sake of the right . This is using words with . out any definite ideas , except the popular one that a thing must be done because it is duty , which us begging the whole question at issue . It is simply affirming that obligation is obligation , or duty is right , and therefore must be yielded to . But we wish to know wl*at is right , and what makes it so , as an ultimate end or object ; then we shall have reached something definite ; but this theory spends itself in words only . Next comes the theory of worthiness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of obligation . If by this be meant the natural capabilities of ' moral beings , then it will be admitted by all that these capabilities are fitted for high and worthy ends which stamp them with dignity , and that every moral being is obligated to act in accordance with these fitnesses and to choose the ends which will meet these demands . These high and worthy capabilities are sure finger marks that point the way to the end which , when properly studied , will give the law of his being . There is really no difference of opinion here among philosophers . But what are the ends which meet and satisfy these fitnesses ? This is the very ques // lion to be settled , and no answer to our inquiry is obtained till it is settled . But the authors of this theory contri*j*ute little toward settling it These capabilities , elevated as they may be , are only necessary conditions or faculties fitted to some worthy ends , and can not of themselves furnish the ultimate ground of obligation . Besides , these capabilities are fitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but what we seek is some ultimate end which will bind the moral being under all circumstances and in all relations . Nothing else will give the ultimate rule of duty or unfold the ground of obligation . To say that we are bound to act worthy of these high powers in accordance with the law they dictate , is simply affirming the truism that we are bound to meet obligation . Again , to say that I am bound to act so as " to stand in my own sight as worthy of my own spiritual approbation , " is simply affirming a truism in another form , viz : that I am bound to obey the dictates of my conscience . For my own spiritual approbation can be nothing but conscience approving my action . This gives no ground of obligation . Similar to this system of spiritual worthiness is that propounded by Jouffroy , that order is the chief good . " Universal order , " he tells us , " is the accomplishment of all particular destinies , " but the destiny of a moral being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made . This end , Whatever it may be , is the absolute good and not the " order " or peculiar fitness found in all beings pointing out the way and leading to the end . This is good only as a means to the end . But what is the end ? What then is the foundation of moral obligation ? We answer unhesitatingly , the highest good , by which we mean the highest happiness . In physics the only two things about which our investigations are employed are matter and force ; force inherent in matter , subjective to it , and force without . In like manner in our investigations of morals we treat of free moral beings and of the forces which move them . These forces are good and evil , happiness and misery pure and absolute , the one attractive , the other repellent . They both may truly be said to impose obligation ; the one to secure and promote it , and the other to avoid or remove it . But as misery is a destruction of happi // ness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foundation of obligation may be accurately described as the highe4 good , the diminution or removal of evil being always a relative good . We propose to establish this proposition , if possible , beyond any reasonable doubt . The first argument which we adduce in support of this proposition is this universally admitted fact , that happiness is good , the only good per se . Happiness wherever found is good , the only absolute good . This is a simple and universal idea , revealed in every one 's sensibility , and is an axiom in moral reasoning . How can all men thus unite in giving to happiness the name of good , unless there is in it this binding force ? Do not all recognize the fact , that the free moral being is bound to secure the good ? A modified form of this argument , yet the same in essence , is the fact that the highest happiness always imposes obligation . There is no necessity of adding " of the greatest number , " for the highest happiness involves that of the greatest number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one that two or more objects of good-each one seen to contribute a measure of happiness to himself or to others , are presented to his choicewhere one only can be secured by him , but either may . The intelligence reveals the fact that on* of several conflicting objects is the highest good , fitted to secure the greatest amount of blessedness . This on* is found to impose obligation-draws the moral being to itself binds him to secure it to the rejection of the others . This one alone possesses the authority of the imperative . The others have no such binding force . They are so far as creating obligation is concerned as if they had no existence . We need not affirm that this is the experience of all moral beings . It is a fact universally recognized in the consciousness of men . But how is this universal fact to be accounted for ? In the case supposed , there is no essential difference in the objects presented except this , that this one gathers into itself or appears to , the highest happiness . Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the choice of either one of the others inevitably rouses conscience to pass condemnation ? Why does the choice of this inferior good always degrade the being who makes it ? as is // evinced by the ever downward and degrading course of the miser and the sensualist ? Why does it render these inferior objects , otherwise good in themselves , to be despised , so that the very name of happiness gets the stamp of degradation and is often excluded as an element from the system of ethics ? Why is all this , except that the highest good is sacrificed . With these facts before us it is impossible to avoid the conclusion that happiness the absolute good is the imposing power , the ground of obligation , and the choice of it by the moral being the thing to which he is bound ; thus givilig clearly and decisively the choice of the highest good as the ultimate rule of action . A further modification of this argument is found in the obligations imposed on individuals by their own personal happiness . There is a large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a view of his own happiness simply , having no relation whatever to the welfare of others . Take as an illustration a young man alone in the world , with no family relatives dependent upon him-none in any way to be affected by his conduct Place him if you please upon a desolate island and take from him all hope of escape , and banish from his mind the belief of a Supreme Being . Now is he free from all obligation ? Can he help*feeling it ? His life is a good to him even in this lonely condition . He values it and necessarily feels an obligation to preserve it . He can not avoid feeling a sense of guilt if he were to determine deliberately to take his own life . And whence comes this feeling of obligation ? He knows that in this life , lonely as it is , there is wrapped up a measure of happiness which by the continuance of his life he may secure and which he is not at liberty to sacrifice . This is the thing , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We will still further suppose that two courses of action are open to him , one of them is the possible course of civilized refinement . To some extent he finds himself able by forethought and vigorous effort to surround himself with objects of taste by a culture of nature and with some enlarged comforts of living . He is also able by a study of his own being and by a study of nature around him to secure the enjoyment of mental // effort and of the acquisition of knowledge . The other course is simply that of lazy existence , to eat , drink , and slee*p like the brutes around him . The former course is seen to contribute much more than the other to his personal happiness . In these conditions with no belief of a future state of existence he will still feel obligation , of a low degree it may be , but it is positive obligation , to adopt the course in which it is known the highest happiness is found . This binds him to itself and to the rejection of the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either of which he is of equal liberty to pursue . The highest good seen or apprehended . though temporary , has in it the binding force . It imposes obligation . This is the nature of happiness brought to the individual being under such conditions . Thus it is that any moral being becomes a law unto himself ; is under law to himself and growing out of himself , has its basis in the happiness of which his being is capable . Thus , too , when this lonely person comes in contact with mere animals ; sentient creatures , capable of a low degree of enjoyment , obligation is imposed upon him . Why is it that he most certainly , unless hardened by disregard , feels obligation not wantonly to sacrifice their lives , nor needlessly torture them ? And why is it that all feeling of obligation is removed , and life is sacrificed without any sense of wrong when the higher good of himself or of others demand it ? Here is obligation measured and conditioned ky happiness merely , and that of the lowest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is drawn from the known origin of the idea of obligation . In the belief of some this idea is either innate or comes into being nobody knows how , without cause-without circumstances or conditions , only that it is found in the mind and universally known . It is not surprising that such should fail to define obligation , or to seek for it any solid foundation . Still the origin of this idea can be analyzed , accurately traced , and satisfactorily described . Let then any thinking free being , however youngso young as never before to have experienced the feeling of obligation-find now the happiness of his brother , or sister , his father or mother , or any one coming distinctly in his viewwhile the happiness of no other person is known to conflict with // this . It is simply the good , the enjoyment of his relative or associate that is now presented . It is the highest good therefore now to be secured . He knows that it is within his power to make that friend happy . This happiness is solely dependent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The feeling of obligation binding upon him to do the thing that will make this friend happy . This feeling follows necessarily on the first coming together of these three conditions : the happiness to be secured ; the highest and best apprehended at the time : and which is known to be within his power to secure . The feeling of obligation can in no manner be avoided under these conditions . This is the origin in every case of the idea of obligation . Universal consciousness affirms this . Now what originates this feeling and consequently the idea of obligation in the mind of this youth ? We say it is the good presented  --  the happiness to be secured . Nothing else does it , nothing else can do it . Substitute any other object not involving happiness , something to be obtained by choice while all the other donditions remain , ' and no feeling of obligation would arise in the mind , unless there is something that stands as the representative of happiness . This may do it , which bAngs us to the Third argument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is imposed by representative objects of good . These are usually called relative good , being good only as they are the means of happiness . In the argument just closed , happiness is intuitively seen-directly presented , and obligation is immediately affirmed by the intuitive conscience . But not so with these representative objects . They are seen to be means of happiness by a process of reasoning only , more or less extended . In some cases the process is very slight , so slight that they are invested with the characteristic of relative good almost by intuition . We will take the felt obligation to speak the truth . It may be a question whether this particular obligation is universally felt It is however so common-so nearly universal , that many philosophers affirm with confidence that this is an instance of obligation based on abstract right-right seen bya moral faculty or sense unconnected with happiness imposing the obligation or constituting it right . Now in reply we say that this statement is unphilosophicaL It is made without any proof // that the obligation to speak the truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no object of good exists , either intuitively seen , or by reason obtained , to create the obligation so as to render it nearly universal That this obligation to speak the truth is not quite universal , is clearly proved by the fact that some at least have maintained the duty as well as the right to utter falsehoods . While others have maintained that truth should be spoken when and only when the generic principle of benevolence is seen to require it . Now without assenting fully to either of these opinions , we affirm that the utterance of truth contributes to the good and this gives the obligation . Hence the generic principle of benevolence requires the observance of this general law  --  and not merely that truth is to be spoken only when the moral being apprehends by other evidence than the law itself ; that the general welfare requires it This general law or obligation to speak the truth is not reached in its wide extension at once by the young mind or by any mind without a process of reasoning concluding with a judgment ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the simplest process of reasoning imaginable , so simple that it is well nigh intuition . So soon as any one , however young , comes to know what the speaking of truth is in distinction from falsehood-he is so made-such is his nature that he will have a pleasurable happy feeling in view of the one and the opposite feeling in view of the other . This as well as many other moral ideas reveal themselves in the sensibility as truly and perhaps as fully as objects of beauty or their opposites . This feeling is at once transferred to others as belonging to their experiences as well as his own . He knows without a word of teaching , except by his own experience , that his mother whose happiness he has learned to value will be pleased and made happy by his utterance of truth , and be pained by his utterance of falsehood ; and he comes speedily to feel the obligation to speak the truth in a general sense , and this obligation is thus traced directly to happiness as its foundation , both in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becomes the representative of happiness , the necessary means of securing it But the means ; the bare utterance of truth is not the foundation of the obligation , separate from its relations to the good of himself and // others . It is the inherent and necessary relation of truth to happiness that gives it any value or any motive power over any being . It has , it is true , a nature or tendency peculiar to itself ; which is only the fitting condition ; but it is the good inseparably conn*cted with it which imparts its value and imposes the obligation , and is therefore the ground of it . If any thing else in its stead would secure the good results it would at once be invested with value , and become obligatory as a means . These representative objects are called good . All unite in giving to many of them without hesitation this appellation of good . By some they are declared to be good in themselves . But this is only where they have , or are believed to have , inherent qualities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them tendencies to good . In respect to all these representative objects , a process of reason is necessary , more or less extensive , to apprehend and determine these . essential natures . In most minds this process has been gone through with and the tendencies of most of them to some end have been settled . And thus these representatives come to be regarded by many , as themselves the foundation of obligation . All minds and moral natures have been more or less familiar with them . Now we ask , what is the end which stamps these representative objects with the impress of good ? And here we appeal to the consciousness of men . We do not propose to settle this 4uestion by mere assertion , but by facts recognized by general consciousness . We do not hesitate to affirm that these facts point directly to the highest good , the happiness or welfare of being in generaL It is a tendency to this one thing , the absolute good , which determines this question and gives to these objects the impress of good . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power , thus imposing obligation . What other thing is ever recognized as giving these objects the stamp of good ? Is there any thing else in the wide range of thought , not having this apprehended tendency to this ultimate end the highest blessedness , which is universally pronounced good and imposes obligation ? It is said that tendencies to the right are universally called good . This is admitted . But right is itself only a representative term . It is not itself the ultimate end , not even an object // with tendencies to good . It is oniy or at best the ultimate rule of duty-made so only because it leads directly to th' highest blessedness . This is but another confirmation of the truth of our proposition-that the highest happiness imposes obligation , and lies at the basis of every rule of right . It is plausibly affirmed , however , that happiness or absolute good is only the invariable result of the performance of duty-but is not the ground of obligation , that duty gives happiness and not happiness duty . Now this admitted invariable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secure happiness , and establishes the attractive force of that one thing called happiness imposing on the moral being obligation as truly as the falling of an apple to the earth or any other unsupported material substance proves the existence of the gravitating force in nature . The tendency is admitted  --  the binding force therefore lies in the thing . Another illustration of the truth of our proposition , is found in the changeable nature of these representative objects of good . Not being themselves absolute good , circumstances often change their representative character in the mind , sometimes being obligatory and at other times not . So long as happiness or the highest general good continues to result from them , or is believed to do so , so long they are found invariably to impose obligation ; but the instant they are seen to fail to do this , the obligation ceases to be imposed . As an illustration of this change take the civil government , presided over and directed by a single head ; it is believed to contribute to the highest welfare of its subjects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are supposed to be scrupulously guarded and protected by this single arm of power . Measures are devised and vigorously pushed , in which the highest interests of subjects are clearly involved and general prosperity flows on in a steady stream . The good intention of the sovereign is undoubted . This goveminent is felt . It gains tha conscious approval of men at home and abroad . It binds subjects to duty . Loyalty springs up in their hearts spontaneously and lives are cheerfully offered in its defense . The form of government is now regarded of little account , so long as the end , the highest welfare of subjects is secured . But let these results be changed ; let rights be // left unprotected , and the best interest of the whole become neglected and sacrificed , and the good intention of the sovereign converted into that of self-aggrandizement , and * becomes of the feeling of obligation to sustain him ? Lpyalty has fled . And instead of offering lives to support his government his subjects rise en masse , moved by a sense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high position . Here the mighty moving force which once sustained and now overturns this government is the welfare , the highest happiness of its subjects . These facts are fully recognized in every one 's consciousness which is proof beyond a question that in the law of human consciousness the highest happiness is the ultimate ground of obligation . Again where there is doubt concerning the appropriate tendencies of two or more objects , what is found to be the testimony of consciousness ? When no clearly apprehended balance of evidence is frnind in favor of either , no obligation is felt ; but so soon as evidence in the reason clearly preponderates in favor of one above the other in this simple respect of tending to secure happiness-then obligation is invariably felt if action is at once demanded , which still further confirms our proposition . Another form of representation nearly allied to that just treated is where mere words or forms of statement are used to represent obligation . They are not like those already dwelt upon which are seen to be the necessary means of producing happiness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They are such words as right , ought , duty , virtue , holiness , and the like . Many have maintained that these words convey to the mind the idea of abstract right , a necessary and universal idea ; when the fact is they are simply synonyms of the idea of obligation . The whole meaning of such words is exhausted when we say that the thing described by them is obligatory . When it is asked , must not this thing or that thing be done because it is right ? Must not God be loved and obeyed because it is right ? The answer must always be , Yes . That is , it should be done because it is obligatory . But this answer does not even approach to an explanation , or a statement of the foundation of obligation . Nor does it in the slightest degree invalidate the doctrine that happiness is the founda // tion . For a binding force should be found for the things represented by these abstract statements-something which renders theta obligatory . This thing , when found , will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are used as representatives of obligation in order to meet a necessity . That necessity arises when finite beings can not trace the tendencies of different courses of action , between which they are obliged to choose . In such cases they must act by the light of others who are believed to know . These words become the necessary representatives of their ideas of obligation , and are used to communicate these ideas to others . Such is the case with children . The very first idea of duty or obligation is probably obtained by the child from the parent-from his expressed pleasure or displeasure . The idea of ought , duty , or obligation , is planted in the mind of the child by the very words , looks , or gestures , of the parent These representative words become the decisive expressions of authority-of the pleasure of the parent , *nd furnish to the child the highest evidence in the circumstances of what is obligatory . He takes these representative expressions of the parent as law for him , as he should do . But these statements themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there must be an objective reality , a foundation oC some kind to sustain the statement and to make the thing represented obligatory . Now what is this basis ? We have philosophically accounted for nothing in obligation till we have reached this basis , and we only deceive ourselves by supposing we have , in the use of these terms , synonyms of obligation . To test this basis , let it be distinctly made known to the child that the thing required by the parent is evil , does no good , contributes to no happiness , but produces positive misery , and the feeling of obligation vanishes so far as this particular requirement is concerned , even though it has been supported by authority which the child has been accustomed to regard as absolute . Repeated instances of such erroneous representation will soon destroy these authoritative expressions of obligation . The enstomary words may be used and fear may be awakened , but the feeling of obligation will be absent because the thing is seen not to be good . This seems to furnish proof that the basis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // happiness . This process of reasoning is equally applicable to civil government When its accustomed representative of obligation , though framed into the forms and sustained by the solemn sanctions of law , become generally known to be adverse to the best interests , the happiness of subjects , the obligation to sustain or to yield obedience to it vanishes , and the noble duty of loyalty to the government ceases . This line of argument is equally valid in its application to God and his government . That all his moral creatures ought to love and obey him is admitted by all who believe in his infinite attributes . But the ought in this case is simply the expression of obligation-an abstract form . The basis of this obligation must be found in the being of God , and in the results of loving and obeying him . To test this basis let us take his justice , the severest attribute , perhaps , of his being ; one which we are taught to revere , and also to love him for the exercise of it . We know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mere good wishes for the pleasure or the happiness of his creatures irrespective of their character . Such an attribute could not be loved . Let it once be known that it is not based on the highest blessedness of himself and of his creatares , not dictated *by his purpose to secure this good end , but tramples upon their welfare  --  and obligation to regard his justice ceases . His government becomes in the minds of loving subj*ects an oppressive tyranny . Even this sternest of attributes is entitled to be called just or right solely because of its tendencies to good . Thus we see that the highest good is at the basis of all obligation . It is the one idea that gives the should , the obligation , the duty . Dr. M'Oosh , on page 262 of " Intuitions , " enquires , " Why should I seek the happiness of any other being than myself ? Why the happiness of a great number , or of the greatest number ? Why the happiness of any one individual beyond the unit of self ? Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do answer by saying that happiness is good , the only good per se wherever found ; and such being its essential nature , it imposes every obligation on moral beings both human and divine whenever the requisite conditions are present , whether the happiness be that of self or of others , of few or many . Thus correctly and thoroughly does // this theory account for every " ought , " every " should , " every " duty . " Nor do we " take refuge , " as Dr. M'Cosh says , " in a system against which our whole nature rebels , " nor " in a theory which says that we are not required to do more than look after our own gratification , " unless the Scripture promise of eternal life " rendered to them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory , honor , and immortality " be such gratification . The fourth argument in *snpport of this doctrine is the formation and operation of the generic obligation . By the generic obligation in the highest sense , we mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is imposed on all moral beings . That all should feel obligation to adopt and prosecute some end of their being is inseparable from their natures . They can no more be without this generic obligation revealed in the sensibility , than they can be without the feeling of obligation in a particular case . Every one has met this generic obligation in his conscious experiences . But the question here is , what is that ultimate end or object which originates this obligation , which summons every one with the highest authority to pursue it through the entire course of his being ? Many generic obligations may be imposed for a long period of time , and then cease to be obligatory by a change of circumstances . These though generic are not ultimate . But what is that end which possesses an unchangeable binding force and imposes the ultimate obligation , which continues for time and eternity ? The universal consciousness of men pronounces this to be the highest good ; the highest blessedness of himself and other sentient beings , the highest of which he , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secure . Good in the particular he has known , and felt the obligation to secure it . With equal distinctness has he known the general good the highest blessedness , depending upon his choice and pursuit of it , in the generic sense , and has felt the obligation thus to choose it . Also when he has known himself to be destitute of this generic choice , his conscience has pronounced him a violator of obligation . So too , whenever this generic choice has been formed or broughtinto renewed activity , his consciousness has recognized the fact that the highest good was the thing chosen , // the end which imposed the obligation . Nothing else possesses this power of being the ultimate source of obligation* It is the one universal binding force either direct by its own intuitively seen value , or through some known representative . This is the universal ground of obligation , not only for creatures , bat for the Creator . It *gives the universal law of moral action , the law of love , binding on every moral being to seek and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his capabilities . This generic obligation is met in the only way in which it can be met , by a free choice of the end which imposes obligation . It is necessarily a generic choice , calling for specific subordinate volitions to secure the end ; and in meeting this highest generic obligation all other generic obligations are met . In this generic choice or the refusal of it lies all character good or bad , holy or sinful , which is found nowhere else . Now this is the right thing to be done , the way to the ulti. mate end . It puts one in the attitude necessary to secure the end-controlling and directing all his powers and specific volitions to reach it ; which constitutes it right or holy . It is a necessity that can in no manner be avoided , and the end be reached or obligation be met , and as such it has essential and necessary tendency to secure the end , as every choice of an end must have . This is order , but whether it shall be called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as these controlling and directing qualities and this unavoidable necessity are in it Dr. Hopkins , on the 54th page of his " Law of Love , " remarks : " This holiness is not a means of happiness , but the cause . " This is a statement the correctness if which the author will find it difficult to establish ; we say this with all due deference to this eminent philosopher . The actions of voluntary beings are not causes , but effects . They are produced by the self-active being , who is properly termed the cause . But why call this right action , holiness ? It is a choice and generic in its character , and like all other generic choices it has in it a tendency to secure its end . But this quality as choice merely , can not constitute it holy ; for many generic choices may be formed , as is admitted , without approaching the character of holiness . Is not this quality of holiness stamped upon it by the end which is chosen , whatever that may be ? If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is it ? Dr. Hopkins fully admits that holiness is fitted to produce happiness , when he says , " that eac1* new choice of God , both in augmenting his glory and increasing the good of others , augments the joy of those who have alread*y thus chosen him " ( page 57 ) . " The happiness from this is no happening . " " It is the infallible outgrowth of our innermost being when we act according to our law . This with all joys of complacency in others or in ourselves incident to it is holy happiness , or blessedness . It is the happiness that comes from holy activity . " What language could more decisively describe tendency to blessedness ? The infallible outgrowth as the limbs , leaves , and fruit of a tree , are its outgrowth . This tendency constitutes the act right and fixes its character . It should not be called means in the sense of mere , things-in distinction from action ; still it is not cause , but the work of the causing agent ; and its whole value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its end , to secure that which is chosen , and thus becomes as valuable as the end itself . The ultimate end , therefore , stamps its character . But what is its ultimate end ? The ultimate good to be chosen ? Dr. Hopkins , in his " Law of Love , " page 57 , answers : " Objectively God is his end and good ; " again , on page 58 , he says , " Whether we regard ourselves as active or passive , God is our good . " This seems to imply that God as a being to be loved , and his friendship to be enjoyed , in distinction from th&amp;good that he enjoys and produces , is to man at least the ultimate end of all obligation , the ultimate good . But can no obligation exist on the mind of any human being till he comes to have a knowledge of God , not only of existence but also of his friendship  --  a being to be loved ? Is it not a fact that obligation is imposed on multitudes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a God , much less of his attributes ? If so , what imposes this obligation , if God is the ultimate good ? Is this choice of God as the chief good the only thing that constitutes holiness ? This is not giving a philosophical statement of the ultimate and universal ground of obligation , that end which binds all moral beings , both creatures and Creator , as moral philosophy should do . The ultimate and universal ground of obligation must be the same to all agents . If the creatures of God are like him , made in his image , then // the same ultimate ground of obligation exists for them as for him . But how can God as a being be the ultimate e*d to himself ? His happiness or his blessedness may be such an end as the Scriptures affirm . " For thy pleasure they are and were created . " But this is distinct from his being . The simple fact that be is a being of infinite natural attributes does not constitute him the chief good , nor any good at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their fitness to produce good , to give existence to happiness in himself and in creatures . But they are also fitted to produce mischief  --  to work infinite woe . Why then is he the chief good ? Is it because he is infinitely good himself perfectly holy in character as well as infinite in attributes . But in what does his goodness or holiness consist ? This question must be answered before we have reached the foundation of obligation . Universal consciousness answers as well as his works and declarations , in the voluntary production of good , of blessedness . In the production of happiness to himself and to his creatures . Thus the divine holiness has its basis in happiness . With his infinite attributes controlled and directed by holiness , by a heart unchangeable to secure the highest good to all , to himself and to creatures , He becomes the highest source of blessedness , and for this reason , and for this alone , can he be loved . This being true of him , it is sufficient to constitute him the chief good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creatures , not by his being simply - by his exalted attributes alone , but by the infinite blessedness which is wrapped up in his being , and flows out of it , so that the Infinite One becomes the chief good , the highest source of good , and receives the name of the good to all creatures . This , and this only , makes his will impose obligation on them . This is the highest proof that happiness is the ultimate good , that which imposes all obligation , even the obligation of holiness , and of obedience to God . But as objective good-good to be sought as an end , or to be enjoyed as such , God is not the only good . He is indeed the highest source of good-as compared with all others , the original source ; but he has opened other sources of good beside himself , beings made in his own image who should be loved , whose happiness is an absolute good , and should be sought and promoted as well as // his . This , says Dr. Hopkins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our neighbor as well as ourselves , " an accurate definition of al1* virtue . This analysis unfolds to us the truth that there is something back of mere being , both of the being of God and of creatures , which places upon beings the stamp of good ; which gives to them all the value they possess . This is the blessedness they are capable of receiving and producing . This is the one ultimate and universal end to all , that which imposes duty on every one , high or low , created and uncreated . This ultimate end as we have found it to be is happiness , settled upon in the reason as the chief good ; not the happiness of this or that individual , not necessarily , and only of the person on whom the obligation rests , which is imposed by it , but wherever found under the necessary conditions to impose obligation to whomsoever it may come on that obligation being met , whether to friend or enemy . Indeed to secure it to a friend who can repay it by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is , may not bring to the acting being so large a subjective good as to procure the same for an enemy . This latter is the offspring of a pure love to the good of being in general , in adverse circumstances , with no hope of reward except the blessedness of doing it . This is Godlike . It is in a very important sense the choice of good for its owA sake , for what it is in itself irrespective of* any circumstances in which it may be found , or of any relations *t may sustain , except the relation of being itself an object of further happine*s which increases fts value , lit is therefore the simple force of what we call happiness , the highest happiness objectively seen which under all circumstances imposes obligation . This is the moving power . But the subjective movements in the sensibility of the objective good , should be carefully and accurately distinguished from the objective good itself and also from ordinary movements in the sensibility . Happiness itself objectively viewed is a force fitted to move the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him or to some one else . He is so made that he can not avoid the approving pleasurable feeling in view of it . The simple presentation of any object of good not only moves the sensibility , but awakens more or less desire for this good // to be put into actual existence unless repressed by a state of sin . But this movement in the sensibility does not%constitute the objective motive-is not the thing to be chosen . lit is not the motive power . It is the movement itself . It is often called the subjective motive , but it is only the result of the motive power . It is an essential , necessary , and involuntary condition of any choice , but never the thing chosen . Much of the language of Edwards seems to imply that these various and opposing desires , moving or being moved , with greater or less strength , are the objects of choice , and that the will is determined by the one of the greatest strength and can only be so determined . Many have interpreted Edwards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the greatest strength fixes the choice by necessity ; and hence they have charged him with teaching fatalism . Now it may be true that those particular objects of happiness which do not originate the feeling of obligation may lie together in the mind in greater or less strength of desire and be objects of the mind 's contemplation , and comparison , and judgment , and of choice , as mere subjective good or present happiness . Indeed we are disposed to believe this to be a true account of them , for they are kindred one to another , all possessing similar qualities . They are all awakened desires for happiness ; personal happiness in different degrees . They are movements in the sensibility which may be compared anl fix choice . They all lie mainly outside of the domain of reason , and consequent ? y by some philosophers are cafled passions in distinction from good in the reason . But when the objective good comes to the mind under the three conditions requisite to impose obligation , the movement in the sensibility is peculiar . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not impose obligation . There is doubtless more or less desire in all cases to meet the conditions of the obligation and to secure , not only the good thus presented , but also the satisfaction , the blessedness it will bring . This satisfaction is known to be real , solid , seen in the reason to be the best thing , and is a subjective motive and a condition of choice . There can be no choice without it . But this feeling of obligation is peculiar to itself , unlike all the movements of desire produced by happiness which does not impose obligation . // It has the imperative in it which no other movements in the sensibility have , and as such it precludes or forbids a compariz son with a view of an exchange of the one for the other , as is true of other desires . Its commanding force is simply to be yielded to , or rejected . This is the alternative . There is no comparison of the greater or the less formed in the mind . When rejected by the voluntary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desire which secures the rejection ; but it is wholly unlike this imperative , and can not be cornpared with it as greater or less . When this imperative is yielded to , and obligation fully met , the resultant is a high degree of satisfaction , an exalted blessedness . But it is peculiar to itself unlike the result of yielding to other movements of the sensibility . It brings complacency in character an attendant upon conscious right action in one 's self or in others , a feeling of blessedness both in degree and kind which no other voluntary action ever produced . So that there is indeed some valid reason for calling it as Dr. Hopkins does , " holy happiness**  --  the result of meeting the generic obligation ; a blessedness peculiar to itself . It is certainly a blessedness distinct from all others . We have aimed , thus , to analyze obligation , and ascertain its basis purely on philosophical grounds without any reference to the Scriptures . But this view , we believe , is fully sustained by Scripture statemen*ts which are confessedly not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ philosophical discussion we have found happiness , blessedness , to be the one thing good , and the highest blessedness of which any moral being is capable of securing , the highest good to him , the chief object or end of his being -- that which imposes upon him the ultimate generic obligation , and is the supreme law of being . The voluntary choice of this end , the meeting of this generic obligation by the free capabilities of his being , is the only thing fitted to secure the highest good to him and to all . In this voluntary controlling aim is found his character for goodness  --  or uprightness ; a conformity to the law . The rejection of this generic obligation , the refusal to meet it , is sinful or wrong action , and the only thing that is . Here lies the whole of moral guilt . No one can fail to see how exactly this philosophical deduction cor // responds with the Scripture statements which divide the whole world into two classes only , the righteous and the wiQked-the holy and the unholy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whether , as applied to God or creatures , they mean the willing of good or love which is the fulfilling of all law . The opposite is described as the failure to do this : " To him that knoweth to do good and doeth it not , to him it is sin , " an exact philosophical definition in perfect accordance with what we have described wrong doing to be  --  a failure to meet obligation . Here the obligation which is not met , and which failure is by the infallible Word termed sin-is fully recognized to be founded in the good ; the good known to be the highest good , and known by the free being to be within his power . What could furnish us a clearer description of the foundation of obligation ? given , too , in a plain common sense definition of sin ? From the subject as now presented it is a manifest inference that one obligation can never conflict with any other . Duty is revealed or made known by obligation . It is often thought that duties conflict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a seeming conflict when objects stand opposed to each other , both partially claiming during contemplation the binding force of obligation . Both can not be met , if there is opposition , being alternatives to each other . In all such cases one , under clearer light , is made to give way to the other . Preponderating evidence in favor of the one causes the other to cease to be obligatory , and gives clear predominance to one , so that all conflict ceases . This is the necessary result of the principle that the highest good always imposes obligation . There are many sub-* ordinate obligations essential to the complete fulfillment of any generic obligation . Among these there is and can be no conflict . Being known to be essential to the ultimate end , they become thereby distinct obligations , and are embraced in the generic obligation just as a part is included in the whole These subordinate obligations may be , as they usually are , mere means to the general end , receiving all their binding force as obligations from the end itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these subordinates . They are independent obligations , each having // a distinct basis of good in itself They are in no sense means one of the other , nor are they in any sense opposed to eack other-can never come into conflict , but each remains in full force . The son is obligated to love both father and mother , and brothers and sisters . These are separate , independent obligations . The good of each is distinct , not dependent the one upon the other , and in no sense opposed to each other . To meet the one obligation , does not involve the neglect of the other . They can all be met Nor do we institute any comparison between them , as higher or lower , as we do in cases where one object of good stands opposed to another , and must be relinquished if the other is met They are all parts of the one generic obligation to secure the highest good , all being wrapped up in this one general good . The same is true of the obligation to love God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the obligation to love all the members of this family whom he has created . These are independent and generic obligations , in no sense conflicting with each other , because the goodness and will of God require creatures to be loved as well as himself To meet the one does in no sense involve a release from the other . They both stand in full binding force , and both can be met . They are but parts of the one ultimate obligation of universal benevolence  --  the voluntary aim to promote the highest good of being both of God and creatures . This same law of happiness , the chief good imposing obligation , applies equally to God as to creatures . He brings his character and conduct down to the inspection and judgment of his creatures , inviting them to examine and be convinced of his uprightness , as in the passage " Are not my ways equal ? " But by what rule or law of equality or integrity can his creatures know his character unless the chief good , the highest blessedness , is taken as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for them . This points us at once , before any sentient beings had existence , to his own highest blessedness to be secured by his infinite capabilities as the moving spring of his action . To meet this obligation of filling his own being with blessedness , he creates the worlds and fills them with sentient beings , as before stated : " For thy pleasure they are and were . created . " Here the possible blessedness of created // existences is made essential to the highest blessedness of Deity as a means of securing it . But not simply as means* for their blessedness is a positive good , and imposes obligation by its own force and is chosen as an absolute good . The two generic objects of good exist together , and can not be separated , and the obligation they impose are in perfect harmony in the Divine Being . This is equally true of the obligation resting on every created intelligence to secure his own highest blessedness , and the obligation to secure to the utmost of his abilities the highest good of others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a distinct basis in itself . The highest happiness or blessedness of each individual is a great and positive good , and as such imposes obligation-an obligation to secure this chief end to himself . He can no more rightfully throw off this obligation , . than he can disregard the highest welfare of others . Both are binding obligations , and are enforced by the command of God . For any one to fail to secure his highest well being is to commit the crime of self murder , not only of the body , but of the soul . These obligations , though thus distinct and independent , can never conflict with each other . If they could they would not both have a binding force . One would of necessity yield to the other , and thus become subordinate . Being thus distinct and independent , having each a distinct basis of its ow'n , in absolute good they can never come into comparison the one with the other , as greater or smaller , higher or lower . It can never be ascertained whether the highest good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be greater or less than his own highest blessedness , his eternal well being . They can both be met . Indeed they are so inseparably connected that one can not be met without the other any more than the obligation to love God can be met without meeting the obligation to love his neighbor , or the obligation to love his neighbor be met , without meeting at the same time the obligation to love God . These two objects of good are generic ends , and can be made distinct objects of choice and pursuit , for the good involved in each . The choice of one necessarily involves the choice of the others , not as mere means to the other which is ultimate , though the only method of securing one 's own highest // blessedness is to promote the highest good of all . Hence the choice to secure the chief end of one 's own being , his complete and endless blessedness is in no sense selfish-no more so tha*i the choice to secure the highest blessedness of others . There is a sense in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does become selfishness . Bnt this is when some specific good or course of action leading to good conflicts with his highest good , or with the highest good of others , in other words when it conflicts with obligation . In all such cases it is some inferior good-awakening , it may be , strong desire-even rising into strong passion  --  but such an object of good never imposes obligation ; for nothing but the highest good can impose obligation , and the choice in such a case is never that of choosing between mere good of greater or less , but it is the choice of yielding to the imperative of obligation , or of rejecting obligation for this object of desire which imposes no obligation . This rejection of obligation , and yielding to desire which imposes no obligation , is selfishness  --  and the only thing that is . It is the whole of sin . The opposite of benevolence . But the highest good of the individual imposes obligation as truly and fully as the highest well being of others , and can never come into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in harmony with each other-lie in the same line  --  the same road must be traveled over to reach either . The generic obligation in the highest sense ) that which is ultimate for all moral beings , is that which is imposed by the highest blessedness of being in general . This includes all other generic obligations , and is in perfect harmony with them .
