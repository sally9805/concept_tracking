txt There certainly never was presented to Congress a job of the magnitude of the proposed Texas and Pacific Railway which was sustained by arguments so ridiculously inn animate for its defense . The nation is asked to assume a direct and contingent liability amounting to some four hundred millions of dollars for the following reasons : 1 . Because it would save money in the conveyance of mails and military supplies . Because the proposed road would insure filo prompt dispatch of troops in case of war with Mexico . 3 . Because it would help to keep the Indians in order . 4 . Because it is in the interest of cheap transportation . 5 . Be-. cause it insures competition with existing lines . 6 . Because it will develop adjacent territory . 7 . Because it will bring us a trade with Mexico . 8 . Because the Government has spent on public improvements in the North and West nearly ten times as lunch as it has spent in the South ; and 9 . Because the Government has created in thb existing Pacific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which it ought to spend more of the public money . These are substantially the reasons , printed for the use of committee , " why Congress should adopt the proposition g , the Texas and Pacific Railway Company , and thereby secure the speedy construction of a transcontinental railway between the Mississippi River and the Pacific Ocean . " If such arguments or any possible amplification of them have had the effect of ? convineing the committee that Tom SCOTT/8 bill ought to receive a favorable report from them , their minds must have been made up beforehand , or the kind of arguments which weigh with them must be of a character not appreciable by the majority of intelligent men . Should Congress be induced to enter again into the business of railroad building on such a showing as this , it is difficult to imagine where it is likely to stop . The great double-track freight railway scheme , not to mention other projects favored by some of the " cheap transportation " societies , can give much better reasons for seeking a Government guarantee than those which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the advocates of the new transcontinental railroad . The wildest of the Southern and Western canal schemes , and the most costly of river improvements , could present a better plea on the score of public necessity , and hold out a more feasible prospect of a remunerative return on the capital invested than this proposed route across the barren plains of New-Mexico , Arizona , and Southern California . Mr. Scorr and his friends do not appear to have presented to the House committee any reasons why they have failed to carry out the bargain made with the Government under the acts of March 3 , 1871 , and May 2 , 1872 . Under that legislation they secured a large and , on their own showing , a highlyvaluable land grant , on the condition that they would construct a railroad similar to that on whose behalf they now ask for a Government guarantee of the interest on its bonds . That lino was to be completedby next year , but hardly more than a beginning has been made with the work . It ' is perhaps surprising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the House have not used the argument that Congress , being responsible for getting . them involved in au unprofitable speculation , is morally bound to help them out of it . It is certain that one of the first results of the success of the job would be the rapid appreciation of a largo quantity of worthless bonds and the immediate realizing of largo sums of money upon the securities of various bankrupt Southern roads , controlled by the Texas Pacific combination , and forming part of the railroad system whose bonds the United States are asked to guarantee . It is very doubtful whether the South would reap any substantial advantage from the proposed road , and it may be safely assumed that unless it is to be run at the Government expense , it would conduce neither to the interests of cheap transportation nor healthy competition . But its construction certainly would enrich a ring of greedy and unscrupulous speeulitters . The Texas Pacific corporation has not only virtually forfeited the Government land grant received in return for its liberal promises of 1871 ? it has also lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the State of Texas . The new Constitution of that State , which is to be voted on by the people to-morrow , contains a provision to extend the time within which that portion of the road which was to have been open to travel by the beginning of this year should be completed . The expenditure of a few hundred thousand dollars would have saved the Texas charter from being forfeited , yet so thoroughly unpromising was the enterprise considered by capitalists that the attempt to raise more money had to be abandoned . If the opening up of the most productive region traversed by the road can not attract the support of private investors , it is surely a very hopeless business for the Government to undertake to carry it through the Western desert . The whole scheme is as impudent an attempt as could well be conceived to reopen a new era of legislative and corporate jobbery , beside which the Credit Moblier and Pacific Mail scandals would seem commonplace . The principle which underlies the bill is a vicious one , and the details of its proposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disreputable.
