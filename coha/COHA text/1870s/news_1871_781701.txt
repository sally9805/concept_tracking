txt The mysterious " corona " will soon be scrutinized again with the finest instruments and . closest skill of modern science . On the 12th of December there will be another total eclipse of the sun . Astronomers will have to go farther to see it than they went to see the eclipse of last year . The south of Europe was the necessary point of observation for the latter , but the coming phenomenon must be viewed from the southern extremity of Java . It will first be visible from the ocean off the coast of Arabia , subsequently from the northern parts of Sumatra and Australia . and likewise from some of the islandeor Polynesia ; but Java is selected as the best station . and thither some of the most experienced English and French observers have resolved to make their way . Our mill Government will not send a deputation , as it did Casa yedal , tel co-operate with the European official astronoiriers . An invitation to do so was duly received ; but the explanation is now made public that the routine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consequence of the protracted absence of leading members of the corps last year , and that , because of the greater distance , an expedition to observe the eclipse of 1871 , in Asia , would . take even more tune than that which observed the eclipse of 1870 , in Europe . The report of the latter event will appear in a few days , and will be the first formal account published under any Government authority . A prefatory article by Admiral SANDS , Superintendent of the Naval Observatory , will begin the volume ; after which will come reports from Profs . NEWCOMB , HALL , HARKNESS and EASTMAN , and a monograph by Capt . Turalarr . It is naturally thought that of these the contribution of Prof. HARKNESS will be most valuable . Prof. Harkness made the famous observations at Des Moines , Iowa , Aug. 7 , 1869 , the inferences from which , at first discredited by foreign experts , in the matter of the elements or nature of the sun 's corona , were subsequently assented to by many of them , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from his observations'in Sicily of the eclipse of last year . Our readers will remember that the data gathered on that occasion were less satisfactory than had been hoped , mainly because of the cloudy weather . This misfortune proved entirely fatal to the success of several parties at different stations , and hence prevented that full collation of testimony so important to the establishment of scientific truth . Still , enough was seen to gain many able converts to what has been called the " American theory " regarding the corona , and , as we have said , Prof. HARKNESS looks upon his Sicilian experience as conclusive . Farther confirmation will , of course , be acceptable to the philosophic world , and repeated trials will doubtless furnish it . With each fresh attempt the improvement of instruments , the points already established . and the lesson of past failures , will combine to improve the chance of success , and the report of our own astronomers will be compared with curiosity with the accounts of the approaching eclipse , that may be expected to come to us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year .
