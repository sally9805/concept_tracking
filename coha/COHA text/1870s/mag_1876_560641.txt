OLD WOMAN 'S GOSSIP . XIII . AMONG the persons whom I used to see behind the scenes were two who for different reasons attracted my attention : one was the Earl of W- , and the other the Rev. A. F. C- . I was presented to Lord and Lady Win society , and visited them more than once at their place near Manchester . But before I had made Lord W- 's acquaintance he was an object of wondering admiration to me , not altogether unmixed with a slight sense of the ridiculous , only because it passed my comprehension how any real , live man could be so exactly like the description of a particular kind of man , in a particular kind of book . There was no fault to find with the elegance of his appearance and his remarkable good looks ; he certainly was the bean ideal of a dandy , - with his slender , perfectly - dressed figure , his pale complexion , regular features , fine eyes , and dark , . glossy waves of hair , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was so like the Earl of So-and- So , in the fashionable novel of the day , that I always longed to ask him what he did at the end of the " third volume , " and " whether he or Sir Reginald married Lady Geraldine . " But why this exquisite par excellence should always have struck me as slightly absurd , I can not ima0ine . The Rev. A. F. Cwas the natural son of William IV . and Mrs. Jordan , and vicar of Maple Durham ; when first I came out , this young gentleman attended every one of my performances , first in one of the stage boxes and afterwards in a still nearer position to the stage , one of the orchestra reserved seats . Thence , one night , he disappeared , and , to my surprise , I saw him standing at one of the side scenes during the whole play . My mother remarking at supper his non-attendance in his usual place , my father said that he had come to him at the beginning of the play , and asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasionally to present himself behind the scenes . My father said this reference to Mrs. Jordan had induced him to grant the request so put , though he did not think the back of the scenes a very proper haunt for a gentleman of his cloth . There , however , Mr. F. Ccame , and evening after evening I saw his light kid gloves waving and gesticulating about , following in a sort of sympathetic dumb show the gradual development of my distress , to the end of the play . My father , at his request , presented him to me , but as I never remained behind the scenes or went into the green - room , and as he could not very well follow me upon the stage , our intercourse was limited to silent bows and courtesies , as I went on and off , to my palace in Verona , or from Friar Laurence 's cell . Mr. F. C- appeared to me to have slightly mistaken his vocation ; that others had done so for him was made more manifest to me by my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a very gay ball given by the Countess de 5- . Almost as soon as I came into the room he rushed at me , exclaiming , " Oh , do come and dance with me , that s a dear good girl . " The " dear good girl " had not the slightest objection to dancing with anybody , dancing being then my predominant passion and a chair a perfectly satisfactory partner , if none other cduld be come by . While dancing I was unpleasantly struck with the decide ( lly unreverend tone of my partner 's remarks . Clergymen danced in those days without reproach , but I hope that even in those days of dancing clerks , they did not often talk so very much to match the tripping of the light fantastic toe . My amazement reached its climax when , seeing me exchange signs of amicable familiarity with some one across 1876. 185 // the room , Mr. F. C- said , " Who are you nodding and smiling to ? Oh , your father . You are very fond of him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the affirmative , he said , " Ah , yes ; just so . I dare say you are . " And then followed an expression of his filial disrespect for the highest personage in the realm , of such a robust significance as fairly took away my breath . Surprised into a momentary doubt of my partner 's sobriety , I could only say , " Mr. F. C , if you do not change your style of conversation I must sit down and leave you to finish the dance alone . " He confounded himself in repeated apologies and entreaties that I would finish the dance with him , and as I could not find a word to say to him , he went on eagerly to excuse himself by a short sketch of his life , telling me that he had not been bred to the church and had the greatest disinclination to taking orders ; that he had been trained as a sailor , the navy being the career that he preferred above all others , but that in consequence of the death of a brother he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in spite of the utmost reluctance on his part , compelled to go into the church . " Do n't you think it s a hard case ? " reiterated he , as I still found it difficult to express my opinion either of him or of his " case , " both appearing to me equally deplorable . At length I suggested that , since he had adopted the sacred calling he professed , perhaps it would be better if he conformed to it at least by outward decency of language , e and decorum of demeanor . To this he assented , adding with a sigh , " But , you see , some people have a natural turn for religion ; you have , for instance , I m sure ; but you see I have not . " This appeared to me incontrovertible . Presently , after a pause , he asked me if I would write a sermon for him , which tribute to my talent for preaching , of which he had just undergone a sample , sent me into fits of laughter , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am not a proper person to write sermons , and you ought to write your own ! " " Yes , " said he , with August , rather touching humility , " but you see I ca n't , - not good ones , at least . I m sure you could , and I wish you would write one for me ; Mrs. N- has . " This statement terminated the singular conversation , which had been the accompaniment to a quadrille . The vicar of Maple Durham is dead ; had he lived he would doubtless have become a bishop ; his family had already furnished its contingent to the army and navy , in Lord E. and Lord A. F. C- , and the living of Maple Durham had to be filled and he to be provided for ; and whenever the virtues of the established church system are under discussion , I try to forget this , and one or two similar instances I have known of its vices as it existed in those days . But that was near " fifty years since , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sailor-parson friend could hardly be told now . Nor could one often now in any part of England find the fellow of my friend H. D- , who was also the predestined incumbent of a family living . He was passionately fond of hunting , and , clinging to his beloved " pink " even after holy orders had made it rather indecorous wear , used to huddle on his sacred garments of office at week-day solemnities of marrying or burying , and , having accomplished his clerical duties , rapidly divest himself of his holy robes , and bloom forth in unmitigated scarlet and buckskins , while the temporary cloud of sanctity which had obscured them was rapidly rolled into the vestry closet . I confess to having heard with sincere sympathy the story of a certain excellent clergyman of Yorkshire breeding , who , finding it impossible to relinquish his hunting , carried it on simultaneously with the most exact and faithful discharge of his clerical duties until , arriving at length at the high dignity of the archbishopric of York , though neither less able for , nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expedient to abandon it and ride to hounds no more . He still rode , however , harder , farther , faster , and better than most men , but conscientiously avoided the hunting-field . Coming accidentally , one day , upon the Old Woman 's G*o**ip. // hounds when they had lost the scent , and trotting briskly away , after a friendly acknowledgment of the huntsman 's salutation , he presently caught sight of the fox , when , right reverend prelate as he was , he gave a " view halloo " to be heard half the county over , and fled in the opposite direction at a full gallop , while the huntsman , in an ecstasy , cheered on his pack with an exclamation of " That s gospel truth , if ever I heard it ! " A. F. C- was pleasant - looking , though not handsome , like the royal family of England , whose very noble port de tate he had , with a charming voice that , my father said , came to him from his mother . I have spoken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of purchasing a horse , which was not only an immense pleasure to me , but , I believe , a very necessary means of health and renovation , in the life of intense and incessant excitement which I was leading . For some time after my first coming out I lost my sleep almost entirely , and used to lie wide awake the greater part of the night . With more use of my new profession this nervous wakefulness wore off ; but I was subject to very frequent and severe pains in the side , which any strong emotion almost invariably brought on , and which were relieved by nothing but exercise on horseback . The refreshment of this panacea for bodily and mental ailments was always such to me that often , returning from balls where I had danced till daylight , I used to feel that if I could only have an hour 's gallop in the fresh morning air , I should be revived beyond all sleep that I could then get . Once only I was allowed to test my theory , and I found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been acting in Boston every night for a whole week , and on Saturday night had acted in two pieces , and was to start at one o'clock in the morning for New York , between which and Boston there was no railroad in those days . I was not feeling well , and was much exhausted by my hard work , but I was sure that if I could only begin my journey on horseback instead , of in the lumbering , rolling , rocking , heavy , **25;681;TOOLONG " Exclusive Extra " ( that is , private stage-coach ) , I should get over my fatigue and the rest of the journey with some chance of not being completely knocked up by it . After much persuasion my father consented , and after the two pieces of our farewell night to a crowded , enthusiastic house , all the excitement of which of course told upon me even more than the actual exertion of acting , I had some supper , and at one o'clock , with our friend , Major M- , and - , got on horseback @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us only about three miles , and then turned back , leaving us to pursue our road to Dedham , seven miles farther , where the carriage , with my father and aunt , was to meet us . The thermometer stood at seventeen degrees below zero ; it was the middle of a Massachusetts winter , and the cold intense . The moon was at the full , and the night as bright as day ; not a stone but was visible on the iron - hard road , that rang under our horses ' hoofs . The whole country was sheeted with snow , over which the moon threw great floods of yellow light , while here and there a broken ridge in the smooth , white expanse turned a sparkling , crystalline edge up to the lovely splendor . It was wonderfully beautiful and exhilarating , though so cold that my veil was all frozen over my lips , and we literally hardly dared utter a word for fear of swallowing scissors an ( l knives in the piercing air , which , however , was perfectly still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rode hard and fast and silently , side by side , through the bright , profound stillness of the night , and never drew rein till we reached Dedham , where the carriage with my father and aunt had not yet arrived . INot a soul was stirring , and not a sound was heard , in the little New England village ; the country tavern was fast shut up ; not a light twinkled from any window , or thread of smoke rose from any chimney ; every house had closed its eyes and ears , and gone to 18T6. 187 // sleep . We had ridden the whole way as fast as we could , and had kept our blood warm by the violent exercise , but there was every danger , if we sat many minutes on our saddles in the piercing cold , that we should be all the worse instead of the better for that circumstance . Mr. - rode along the houses , looking for some possible shelter , and at last , through the chink of a shutter , spying a feeble glimmer of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it were possible for me to be admitted there for a few minutes , till the carriage , which could not be far distant , came up . He was answered in the affirmative , and I jumped down from my saddle and ran into the friendly refuge , while he paced rapidly to and fro before the house , leading the horses , to keep himself and them alike from freezin* , ; a man was to come on the coach - box with the driver , to take them back to Boston . On looking round I found myself in a miserable , little low room , heated almost to suffocation by an iron stove , and stifling with the peculiar smell of black dye - stuffs . Here , by the light of two wretched bits of candle , two women were working with the utmost dispatch at mourninggarments for a funeral which was to take place that day , in a few hours . They did not speak to me after making room for me near the stove , and the only words they exchanged with each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and so they rapidly plied their needles in silence , while I , suddenly transported from the cold hrightness without into this funereal , sweltering atmosphere of what looked like a Black Hole made of crape and hombazine , watched the lugubrious occupation of the women as if I was in a dream till , the distant rumbling of wheels growing more and more distinct , I took leave of my temporary hostesses with many thanks ( they were poor New England workwomen , by whom no other species of acknowledgment would have been received ) , and was presently fast asleep in the corner of the carriage , and awoke only long after to feel rested and refreshed , and well able to endure the fa August , tigue of the rest of the journey . In spite of this fortunate result I do not now , after a lapse of forty years , think the experiment one that would have answered with many young women s constitutions , though there is no sort of doubt that the nervous energy generated by any pleasurable emotion is in itself a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the best and most popular teacher in London , - Captain Fozzard , or as he was irreverently called among his young amazons , " Old Fozzard . " When my mother took me to the riding - school , he recalled with many compliments her own proficiency as an equestrian , and said he would do his best to make me as fine a horsewoman as she had been . He certainly did his best to improve a very good seat and a heavy , defective hand with which nature had endowed me ; the latter , however , was incorrigible , and so , though I was always a fearless horsewoman , and very steady in my saddle , I never possessed the finer and more exquisite part of the accomplishment of riding , which consists in the delicate and skillful managernent of a horse 's mouth . Fozzard 's method was so good that all the best lady riders in London were his pupils , and one could tell one of them at a glance , by the perfect squareness of the shoulders to the horse 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His training was eminently calculated to produce that result , and to make us all but immovable in our saddles . Without stirrup , without holding the reins , with our arms behind us , and , as often as not , sitting left-sided on the saddle , to go through violent plunging , rearing , and kicking lessons , and taking our horses over the bar , was a considerable test of a firm seat , and in all these special feats I became a proficient . One day when I had gone to the school more for exercise than a lesson , and was taking a solitary canter in the tan for my own amusement , the little door under the gallery opened , and Fozzard am peared , introducing a middle-aged lady and a young girl , who remained standing Old Woman 's aossip. // there while he advanced towards me , and presently began to put me through all my most crucial exercises , apparently for their edification . I was always delighted to go through these particular feats , which amused me excessively , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through them all , till , upon a si0n from the elder lady , Fozzard with extreme deference opened the door and escorted them forth , and then returning to dismount me informed me that I had given a very satisfactory sample of his teaching to the Duchess of Kent and the Princess Victoria , the latter of whom was to be placed under his tuition forthwith . This was the first time I ever saw the woman who holds the most exalted position in the world , the Queen of England , who has so filled that supreme station that her name is respected wherever it is heard abroad , and that she is regarded by her own people with a loyal love such as no earthly dignity but that of personal worthiness can command . JAMES STREET , BLTcKINGHAM GATE . DEAREST II The kind exertion you made in writing to me so soon after leaving London deserved an earlier acknowledgment ; but when I tell you that every day since Christmas I have fully purposed writing to you , and have not been able to do so before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and believe me when I assure you that not only the effort you made in going to the theatre , but your seeing me at all , are appreciated by me as very strong marks of your affection for me . Now let me say something to you about Lady C L- 's criticism of my performance . In the first place , nothing is easier than to criticise by comparison , and hardly anything much more difficult than to form a correct judgment of any work of art ( be it what it may ) upon the foundation of abstract principles and fundamental rules of taste and criticism ; for this sort of analysis is really a study . Comparison is the criticism of the multitude , and I almost wonder at its being resorted to by a woman of such ability as Lady C- . I only say this by the way , for to be compared with either Mrs. Siddons or Miss O'Neill is above my expectation . They were both professional actresses , which I can hardly yet claim to he ; women who had for years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves proficients in their business ; whilst although I have certainly had many advantages , in hearin0 the stage and acting constantly , tastefully , and thoughtfully ( uscussed , I am totally inexperience ( l in all the minor technical processes , most necessary for the due execution of any dramatic conception . As to my aunt Siddons - look at her , H- ; look at her fine person , her beautiful face , listen to her magnificent voice , and supposing that I were as highly endowed with poetical dramatic imagination as she was ( which I certainly am not ) , is it likely that there can ever be a shadow of comparison between her and myself , even when years may have corrected all that is at present crude and imperfect in my efforts ? This is my sole reply to her ladyship . To you , dearest H- , I can add that I came upon the stage quite uncertain as to the possession of any talent for it whatever ; I do not think I am now deceived as to the quantity I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public , who have been too long deprived of any female object of special interest on the boards to be very nice about the first that is presented to them ; nor am I unconscious of the amount of work that will be requisite to turn my abilities to their best use . Wait ; have patience ; by and by , I hope , I shall do better . It is very true that to be the greatest actress of my day is not the aim on which my happiness depends . But having embraced this career , I think I ought not to rest satisfied with any degree of excellence short of what my utmost endeavor will enable me to attain in it . . My print , or rather the print of me , from Sir Thomas Lawrence 's drawing , is out . He has promised you one , so I do not . There are also coming out a series of sketches by Mr. Hayter , from 1876. 189 // my Juliet , with a species of avant propos written by Mrs. Jameson ; this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copy of it when it is published . I will tell you a circumstance of much anxious hope to us all just now , but as the result is yet uncertain , do not mention it . We have a species of offer of a living for my brother John , who , you know , is going into the church . This is a consummation devoutly to be wished , and I most sincerely hope we may not be disappointed . He is still in Germany , very happy and very metaphysical ; should we obtain this living , however , I suppose he would return immediately . Independently of my wish to see him again , I shall be glad when he leaves Germany , I think ; but I have not time for what I think about Germany to-day , and you must be rather tired of Yours most affectionately , F. A. K. This letter will show that I was not altogether , in the midst of my successful career , without the wholesome check of occasional criticism . The Lady CL-mentioned in this letter was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and most charming woman in the London society of my day . She was good and amiable , extremely clever , and very humorous and witty , the comical things she used to say deriving additional point from an odd trick she had of looking at her nails through half her sentence , and then at the end of it suddenly raising her dear ugly face , twitching most grotesquely , and bright with the irresistible effect of her own drollery . She was the most intimate friend of the socially celebrated Misses Berry , and was almost always to be found at their house , where I remember a discussion once occurring in which they all took part , as to the pleasantest age of life ; when she suddenly beamed up with a ludicrous grimace from contemplating her nails , and said , " I think my present age ' * ( somewhere between fifty and sixty ) " the pleasantest . " Which sentiment was uttered in my hearing by a very different person , Dr. Ohanning , one evening at a happy assembly of young people among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarking upon the happiness of youth , he said , with the solemn sweetness peculiar to his manner , " I think all ages are pleasant , but I think sixty-five " ( his own ) " the pleasantest of all . " Mr. Hayter 's graceful sketches of me in Juliet were lithographed and published with Mrs. Jameson 's beautifully written but too flattering notice of my performance ; the original drawings were purchased by Lord Ellesmere . The second part assigned to me by the theatre authorities was Belvidera , in Otway 's Venice Preserved . I had never read the play until I learnt my part , nor seen it until I acted in it . It is , I believe , one of the longest female parts on the stage . But I had still my school - girl capacity for committing quickly to memory , and learned it in three hours . Acting it was a very different matter . I was no longer sustained by the genius of Shakespeare , no longer stimulated by his sublime passion and exquisite poetry . Juliet was a reality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could receive , as it were , into mine at once , without effort , comprehending and expressing it . Belvidera seemed to me a sort of lay figure in a tragic attitude , a mere " female in general , " without any peculiar or specific characteristics whatever ; placed as Belvidera is in the midst of sordidly painful and coarsely agonizing circumstances , there was nothing in the part itself that affected my feelings or excited my imagination ; and the miserable situations into which the poor creature is thrown throughout the piece revolted me , and filled me with disgust for the men she had to do with , without inspiring me with any sympathy for her . In this piece , too , I came at once into the unfavorable light of full comparison with my aunt 's performance of the part , which was one of her famous ones . A friend of hers and mine , my dear and excellent William Harness , said that seeing me was exactly like looking at Mrs. Siddons through the diminishing end of an opera glass . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diminutive size and irregular features , was striking , and of course suggested , to those who remembered her , associations which were fatal to my satisfactory performance of the part . I disliked the play and the character of Belvidera , and I am sure I must have played it very indifferently . I remember one circumstance connected with my first performance of it , which proved how painfully the unredeemed horror and wretchedness of the piece acted upon my nerves and imagination . In the last scene , where poor Belvidera 's brain gives way under her despair , and she fancies herself digging for her husband in the earth and that she at last recovers and seizes him , I intended to utter a piercing scream ; this I had not of course rehearsed , not being able to scream deliberately in cold blood , so that I hardly knew , myself , what manner of utterance I should find for my madness . But when the evening came , I uttered shriek after shriek without stopping , and rushing off the stage ran all round the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfectly unconscious of what I was doing , down the stairs that led out into the street , when I was captured and brought back to my dressing-room and my senses . The next piece in which I appeared was Murphy 's Grecian Daughter : a feeble and inflated composition , as inferior in point of dramatic and poetical merit to Otway 's Venice Preserved , as that is to any of Shakespeare 's masterpieces . It has situations of considerable effect , however , and the sort of parental and conjugal interest that infallibly strikes sympathetic cords in the pater familias bosom of an English audience . The choice of the piece had in it , in my opinion , an ingredient of bad taste , which , objectionable as it seemed to me , had undoubtedly entered into the calculation of the management , as likely to increase the effect and success of the play ; I mean the constant reference to Euphrasia 's filial devotion , and her heroic and pious efforts in behalf of her old father , incidents in the piece which were seized upon and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and which may have perhaps added to the feeling of the audience , as they certainly increased my dislike for the play . Here , too , I again encountered the formidable impression which Mrs. Siddons had produced in the part , of which , in spite of the turgid coldness and stilted emphasis of the style , she had made a perfect embodiment of heroic grandeur and classical grace . My Euphrasia was , I am sure , a pitiful picture of an antique heroine , in spite of Macdonald 's enthusiasm for the " attitude " in the last scene , and my cousin Horace Twiss 's comical verdict of approbation , that it was all good , but especially the scene where " you tip it the tyrant . " JAMES STREET , BUCKIEGHAM GATE , Ja uary 17 , 1830 . DEAREST H- : Although my mind is much occupied just now with a new part in which I appear to - morrow , I take advantage of the bodily rest this day affords me to write you a few lines , which I fear I might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was enough in your last letter , dear H- , to make me melancholy , independently of the question which you ask respecting my picture in Juliet , and which the papers have by this time probably answered to you . Sir Thomas Lawrence is dead . The event has been most distressing , and most sudden and unexpected to us . It really seemed as though we had seen him but the day before we heard of it ; and indeed , it was but a few days since my mother had called on him , and since he had written to me a long letter on the subject of my Belvidera , full of refined taste and acute criticism , as all his letters to me were . It was a great shock ; indeed , so much so that absolute amazement for a little time prevented my feeling all the regret I have since experienced about it . Nor was it till I sat down to write to Cecilia , to request her to prevent any sudden communication of the event to my aunt Siddons , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some relief in crying . I had to act Belvi 1876. 191 // dera that same night , and it was with a very heavy heart that I repeated those passages in which poor Sir Thomas Lawrence had pointed out alterations and sug* , ested improvement.s . He is a great loss to me , individually . His criticism was invaluable to me . He was a most attentive observer , no shade of feeling or slightest variation of action or inflection of voice escaped him ; his suggestions were always improvements , conveyed with the most lucid clearness ; and , as you will easily believe , his strictures were always sufficiently tempered with refined flattery to have disarmed the most sensitive self-love . My Juliet and Belvidera both owe much to him , and in this point of view alone his loss is irreparable to me . It is some matter of regret , too , as you may suppose , that we can have no picture of me by him , but this is a more selfish and less important motive of sorrow than my loss of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Siddons was dreadfully shocked by the news , and cried , " And have I lived to see him go before me ! ** . . . His promise to send you a print from his drawing of me , dearest H- , he can not perform , but I will be his executor in this instance , and if you will tell me how it can be conveyed to you , I will send you one . This letter , my dearest H- , which was begun on Sunday , I now sit down to finish on Tuesday evening , and can not do better , I think , than give you a full account of our last night 's success ; for a very complete success it was , I am happy to say . Murphy 's play of The Grecian Daughter I suppose you know ; or if you do not , your state is the more gracious , for certainly anything more flat , poor , and trashy I can not well conceive . It had been , you know , a great part of my aunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genius than her having clothed so meagre a part in such magnificent proportions as she gave to it , and filled out by her own poetical conception the bare skeleton Mr. Murphy 's Euphrasia presented to her . This frie , htened me a great deal ; Juliet and Belvidera scarcely anybody can do ill , but Euphrasia I thought few people could do well , and I feared I was not one of them . Moreover , the language is at once so poor and so bombastic that I took double the time in getting the part by rote I should have taken for any part of Shakespeare 's . My dress was beautiful ; I thick I will tell it you . You know you told me even an account of hat and feathers would interest you . My skirt was made immensely full and with a long train ; it was of white merino , almost as fine as cashmere , with a rich gold Grecian border . The drapery which covered my shoulders ( if you wish to look for the sort of costume in engravings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made of the same material beautifully embroidered , leaving my arms quite free and uncovered . I had on flesh - colored silk gloves , of course . A bright scarlet sash with heavy gilt acorns , falling to my feet , scarlet sandals to match , and a beautiful Grecian head-dress in gold , devised by my mother , completed the whole , which really had a very classical effect , the fine material of which my dress was formed falling with every movement into soft , graceful folds . I managed to keep a good heart until I heard the flourish of drums and trumpets , in the midst of which I had to rush on the stage , and certainly when I did come on my appearance must have been curiously in contrast with the " prave ords " I uttered , for I felt like nothing but a hunted hare , with my eyes starting from my head , my " nostrils all wide , " and my limbs trembling to such a degree that I could scarcely stand . The audience received me very kindly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breath and self-posseslion , and got on very comfortably , considering that , what with nervousness and the short time they had had to study them in , none of the actors were perfect in their parts . My father acted Evander , which added , no doubt , to the interest of the situation ; the play went off admirably , and I dare say it will be of some service to me , but I fear it is too dull and poor in itself , despite all that can // be done for it , to be of much use to the theatre . One of my great difficulties in the play was to produce some striking effect after stabbing Dionysius , which was a point in which my aunt always achieved a great triumph . She used to fall on her knees as if deprecating the wrath of Heaven for what she had done , and her mode of performing this was described to me . But , independently of my anxiety to avoid any imitation that might induce a comparison that could not but be fatally to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may venture to confess it ) feel the situation in the same manner . Euphrasia had just preserved her father 's life by a deed which in her own estimation , and that of her whole nation , entitled her to an immortal dwellinc , in the Elysian fields . The only feeling , therefore , that I can conceive as checking for a moment her exultation would be the natural womanly horror at the sight of blood and physical suffering , the expression of which seems to me not only natural to her , as of the " feminine gender , " but not altogether superfluous to reconcile an English audience to so unfeminine a proceeding as stabbing a man . To conciliate all this I adopted the course of immediately dropping the arm that held the dag*er , and with the other veiling my eyes with the drapery of my dress , which answered better my own idea of the situation and seemed to produce a great effect . My dearest H- , this is a long detail , but I think it will interest you and perhaps amuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirits , tell me so , and another time I will not confine my communications so much to my own little corner of life . Cecilia dined with us on Sunday , but was very far from well . I have not seen my aunt Siddons since Sir Thomas Lawrence 's death ; I almost dread doing so ; she must have felt so much on hearing it , he was for many years so mixed up with those dearest to her , and his memory must always recall theirs . I hear Campbell means to write his life . His letters to me will perhaps be published in it . Had I known they were likely to be so used , I would have preVOL. xxxVIII. - No. 226. 13 Old Woman 's Gossip . 193 served them all . As it is , it is the merest chance that all of them are not destroyed , for , admirable as they were in point of taste and critical judgment , some of them seemed to me such mere specimens of refined flattery that , having extracted the advice likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the flames , which probably would have been the ultimate destination of them all ; but now they have acquired a sad value they had not before , and I shall keep them as relics of a man of great genius and in many respects , I believe , a truly amiable person . The drawing , which is , you know , my mother 's property , is safe in Mr. Lane 's hands , and will be restored to us on Saturday . The funeral takes place tomorrow ; my father , I believe , will attend ; neither my mother nor myself can muster courage to witness it , although we had places offered to us . It is to take place in St. Paul 's , for Westminster Abbey is full . All the beautiful unfinished portraits which filled his rooms will be returhed imperfect to their owners , and I. wonder who will venture to complete them , for he has certainly not left his like behind him . Reports have been widely spread that his circumstances were much embarrassed , but I fancy when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surplus . He behaved with the utmost liberality about his drawing of me , for he gave it to my mother , and would not accept of any remuneration for the copyright of the print from Mr. Lane , - who , it is said , made three hundred pounds by the first impressions taken from it ,  - -  saying that he had had so much pleasure in the work that he would not take a farthing for either time or trouble . We are all tolerably well ; I am quite so , and rejoice daily in that strength of constitution which among other of my qualifications entitles me to the appellation of " Shetland pony . " How are you all ? How is E- ? Tell her all about me , because it may amuse her . I wish you could have seen me , dear H- , in my Greek dress ; I really look very well in it , and taller than // usual , in consequence of all the long draperies ; moreover , I " stood grandly " erect , and put off the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statue-like deportment . Oh , H- , I am exceedingly happy , et pour peu de chose , perhaps you will think ; my father has given me leave to have riding-lcssons , so that I shall be in right earnest " an angel on horseback , " and when I come to Ardgillan ( and it wo n't be long first ) I shall make you mount upon a horse and gallop over the sand with me ; wo n't you , my dear ? Believe me ever your affectionate FANNY . P. S. This is a very long letter ; is it too long ? Pray write and tell me . The words in inverted commas at the end of this letter had reference to some strictures Miss S- had made upon my carriage , and to a family joke against me in consequence of my having once said , in speaking of my desire to ride , that I should not care to be an angel in heaven unless I could be an " angel on horseback . " My invariable description of a wonian riding was " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unhappiness , certainly not dissipated by equestrian exercise , I still agree with Wordsworth that " the horse and rider are a happy pair . " After acting The Grecian Daughter for some time I altered my attitude in the last scene , after the murder of Dionysius , more to my own satisfaction : instead of dropping the arm that held the daggerbymyside , I raised the weapon to heaven , as if appealin0 to the cods for justification and tendering them , as it were , the homage of my deed ; of course I still continued to veil my eyes and turn my head away from the sight of my victim . JAMES STREET , BUCKINGUAM GATE , Saturday , February 20th. 3 DEAREST H : I need hardly apologize to you for my long silence , for I am sure that you will have understood it to have proceeded from no want of inclination on my part to answer your last , but from really not having had half an hour at my command in which to do so . I have thought , too ( although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tenor of your letter and the evident depression it was written in , and I hardly know how to resolve : whether I ought not to forbear wearying you with matters which every way are discordant with your own thoughts and feelings , or whether it is better by inducing you to answer me to *ive you some motive , however trifling , for exertion . Dearest H- , if the effort of writing to me is too painful to you , do not do it . I give you a most disinterested counsel , for I have told you more than once how much I prize your letters , and you know it is true . Still , I do not think my " wish is father to my thought " when I say that I think it is not good for you to lose entirely even such an interest as I am to you . I say even such an interest , because I believe your trouble must have rendered me and my pursuits , for the present at least , less likely than they have been to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you to decide ; if my letters weary or annoy you , tell me so , dear H and I will not write to you until you can " follow my paces " better . If you do not like to make the exertion of answering me , I will still continue to let you know my proceedings , and take it for granted that you will not cease to love me and think of me . Dear H- , I shall see you this summer again ; you , and yours , whom I love for your sake . I shall go on with this letter , because if you are inclined for a gossip you can read it , and if not it may perhaps amuse your invalid . I have been uncommonly gay , for me , this winter , and I dare say shall continue to be so , as it does not disagree with me , and I am so fond of dancing that a quadrille renders palatable what otherwise would be , I think , disagreeable enough , - the manner in which society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party the other night , at the poet Campbell 's , where every material for a delightful evening - good rooms , pretty women , clever men - were brought into requisition to make what , after all , appeared to me 194 August , // nothing but a wearisome , hot crowd . The apartments were overfihled : to converse with anybody for five minutes was impossible . If one stood up one was squeezed to death , and if one sat down one was stifled . I , too ( who was the small lioness of the evenin0 ) , was subjected to a most disagreeable ordeal , the whole night being stared at from head to foot by every one that could pass within staring distance of me . You probably will wonder at this circumstance distressing a young person who three times a week exhibits herself on the sta* , e to several hundred people , but there I do not distinguish the individual eyes that are fixed on me , and my mind is diverted from the annoyances of my real situation by the distressful circumstances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my sorrows , at the beginning of the evening a lady spilled some coffee over a beautiful dress which I was wearing for the first time . Now I will tell you what consolations I had to support me under these trials : first , the selfapproving consciousness of the smiling fortitude with which I. bore my gown 's disaster ; secondly , a lovely nosegay , which was presented to me ; and lastly , at about twelve o'clock , when the rooms were a little thinned , a dance for an hour which sent me home perfectly satisfied with my fate . By the bye , I asked Campbell if he knew any method to preserve my flowers from fading , to which he replied , " Give them to me , and I will immortalize them . " I did so , and am expecting some verses from him in return . On Thursday next I come out in Mrs. Beverley ; I am much afraid of it . The play wants the indispensable attribute of all works of art , imagination ; it is a most touching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the story is such as might be read in a newspaper , and her character has its like in many an English home . I think the author should have idealized both his incidents and his heroine a little , to produce a really fine play . Mrs. Beverley is not one shade inferior to I ) noge n in purity , in conjugal devotion , 195 and in truth , but while th' one is to all intents and purposes a model wife , a poet 's touch has made of the other a divine image of all that is lovely and excellent in woman ; and yet , certainly , Imogen is quite as real a conception as Mrs. Beverley . The absence of the poetical element in the play prevents my being enthusiastic about my part , and .1 am the more nervous about it for that reason ; when I am excited I feel that I can excite others , hut in this case - However , we shall see ; I may succeed with it better than I expect , and perhaps my audience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lady , after the Belvideras and Juliets and Euphrasias they have hitherto seen me represent . I will tell you my dress : it is a silver gray silk , and a white crape hat with drooping feathers . I think it will be very pretty . My father acts Beverley with me , which will be a great advantage to me . Oh ! I must tell you of a delightful adventure which befell me the other night while I was acting in The Grecian Daughter . Mr. Abbot , who personates my husband , Phocion , at a certain part of the play where we have to embrace , thought fit to clasp me so energetically in his arms that he threw me down , and fell down himself . I fell seated , with all my draperies in most modest order , which was very fortunate , but certainly I never was more frightened or confused . However , I soon recovered my presence of mind and helped my better half on with his part , for he was quite aghast , poor man , at his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his eyes and mouth wide open to this moment , if I had not managed to proceed with the scene somehow and anyhow . Only conceive me sitting plump down on the ground in the midst of that most heroical play ! It was a fearful tumble indeed from Mr. Murphy 's stilts . I gave the commission for your print of me , dear H- , to Colnaghi , and I hope you will like it , and that the more you look at it the stronger the likeness will appear to you . Was my brother Old Woman 's aossip. // John returned from Germany , when last I wrote to you ? I forget . However , he has just left us to take his degree at Cambridge , previous to being ordained . Henry , too , returned yesterday to Paris , so that the house is in mourning for its liveliest inmates . I continue quite well , and indeed I think my work agrees with me ; or if I am a little tired with acting , why , a night 's dancing soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town , and came to see me the other day . I like her ; she is a gentle , nice person ; she is going back in a week to Cassiobury . How I wish you and I had wings , and that Heath Farm belonged to us . It is coming to the time of year when we first became acquainted ; and , besides all its associations of kindly feeling and affectionate friendship , your image is connected in my mind with all the pleasantest things in nature , - the spring , May blossoms , glow-worms , " bright hill and bosky deli ; ** and it dates from somewhere " twixt the last violet and the earliest rose , " which is not a quotation , though I have put it in inverted commas , but something that just came to the tip of my pen and looks like poetry . Cecy Siddons dined here to-day , and bids me tell you all manner of excuses ( which I have forgotten ) for not having written to you ; they were very good ones , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . I must leave off now , for I got leave to stay at home to-ni*ht to write to you instead of going to the opera , with many injunctions that I would go to bed early ; so , now it is late , I must do so . Good-by , dearest H believe me ever Yours most affectionately , F. A. K. P. S. This is my summer tour - Bath , Edinburgh , Dublin , Liverpool ; Manchester , and Birmingham . I am Miss Fanny Kemble , because Henry Kemble 's daughter , my uncle Stephen 's granddaughter , is Miss Kemble by right of birth . The invalid referred to in my letters to Miss 5- was her niece , who at this time was condemned to a reclining posture , from which for upwards of a year she was not able to rise , in consequence of some nervous affection which attacked the spine , and rendered every other attitude impossible . It was a remarkable instance of that sort of malady . Crampton , the celebrated Irish surge on , repeatedly assured her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that the infirmity would disappear suddenly and entirely , thought in the mean time it was quite impossible to find any remedy for it . After a twelveinouth ' s wearisome prostration on her back , one morning she said to her father , " I wonder what was in the night , last ni , ht ; I feel as if I could sit up . " Her father , alarmed at the possible ill result of such an exertion , endeavored to dissuade her from it , but she resumed her natural upright posture without effort or difficulty , and never a am was subject to a similar attack , though on one occasion , some time after , having thrown herself back much in the same position to which she had been so long condemned , she sprang up with a sudden exclamation , declaring that she felt as if she was going to be laid down on her back without being able to move again , - a sensation which showed how purely nervous the affection had been , and how the mere action of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The lady who spoiled my pretty cream - colored poplin dress by spilling coffee on the front of it , instantly , in the midst of her vehement self-upbraidings and humble apologies for her awkwardness , adopted a very singular method of appeasing my displeasure and soothing my distress , by deliberately pouring a spoonful of coffee upon the front breadth of her own velvet gown . My amazement at this proceeding was excessive , and it neither calmed my wrath nor comforted my sorrow , but exasperated me with a sense of her extreme folly and her conviction of mine . The perpetrator of this singular act of atonement was the beautiful Julia , eldest daughter of the Adjutant - General , Sir John Macdonald , and the lady whom // the Duke of Wellington pronounced the handsomest woman in London ; a verdict which appeared to me too favorable , though she certainly was one of the handsomest women in London . An intimate acquaintance subsisted between her family and ours for several years , and I was indebted to Sir John Macdonald 's assistance , most kindly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my youngest brother his commission in the army , which Sir John enabled me to purchase in his own regiment ; and I was indebted to the great liberality of Mr. John Murray , the celebrafed publisher , for the means of thus providing for my brother Henry . The generous price ( remuneration I dare not call it ) which he gave me for my play of Francis the First obtained for me my brother 's commission . JAMES STREET , BUCKINGHAM GATE , March 9th. 1 DEAREST H- : I have been so busy all this day , signing benefit tickets , that I hardly feel as if I could write anything but " 25thMarch , F.A.K. " Ourtwo last letters crossed on the road , and yours was so kind an answer to mine , which you had not yet received , that I feel no further scruple in breaking in upon you with the frivolity of my worldly occupations and proceedings . I was sorry that the newspapers should give you the first account of my Mrs. Beverley , but my time is so taken up with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not had an hour to call my own till this evening , and this evening is my only unen* , aged one for nearly three weeks to come . The papers will probably have set your mind at ease as to the result of my appearance in The Gamester ; but althou , : , h they have forestalled me in the sum total of the account , there are some small details which perhaps may interest you , of which they can give you no knowledge . I shall talk to you much of myself , dearest II- , and hope it will not weary you ; that precious little self is just now so fully occupied with its own affairs that I have little else to talk of . I probably also felt much as our kind and most comical friend , Dessauer , used , when he emphatically declared , " Mais , je m'interesse extr*mement ii ce qui me regarde . " I do not think I ever spent a more miserable day than the one in which I acted Mrs. Beverley for the first time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , increases instead of diminishing with practice ; and certainly , as far as my own limited experience goes , I find it so . The first haEard , I should say , was not half so fearful as the last ; and though on the first night that lever stood upon the stage I thought I never could be more frightened in my life , I have found that with each new part my fear has augmented in proportion as previous success would have rendered it more damaging to faiL A stumble at starting would have been bad* enough , and might have bruised me ; but a fall from the height to which I have been raised might break my neck , or at any rate cripple me for life . I do not believe that to fail in a p*art would make me individually unhappy for a moment , but so much of real importance to others , so much of the most serious interests and so much of the feelings of those most dear to me , is involved in the continuance of my good fortune , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These considerations and their not unnaturalresult , a violent headache and side ache , together with no very great liking for the part ( interesting as it is , it is so perfectly prosaic ) , had made me so nervous that the whole of the day was spent in fits of crying ; and when the curtain drew up , and I was " discovered , " I m sure I must have looked as jaded and tear - worn as poor Mrs. Beverley ever did . However , all went well with me till the last act , when my father 's acting and my own previous state of nervousness combined to make my part of the tragedy anything but feigning ; I sobbed so violently that I could hardly articulate my words , and at the last fell upon the dead body of Beverley with a hystericaf cry that had all the merit of pure nature , if none other , to recommend it . // Fortunately the curtain fell then , and I was carried to my dressing-room to finish my fit in private . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my arms and legs , with sheer nervous distress , that I am ready to drop down with exhaustion at the end of it ; and this reminds me of the very difficult question which you expect me to answer , respecting the species of power which is called into play in the act , so called , of acting . I am the worst reasoner , analyzer , and metaphysician that ever was born ; and therefore whatever I say on the subject can be worth very little , as a reply to your question , but may furnish you with some data for making a theory about it for yourself . It appears to me that the two indispensable elements of fine acting are a certain amount of poetical imagination and a power of assumption , which is a good deal the rarer gift of the two ; in addition to these , a sort of vigilant presence of mind is necessary , which constantly looks after and avoids or removes the petty obstacles that are perpetually destroying the imaginary illusion , and reminding one in one 's own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The curious part of acting , to me , is the sort of double process which the mind carries on at once , the combined operation of one 's faculties , so to speak , in diametrically opposite directions ; for instance , in that very last scene of Mrs. Beverley , while I was half dead with crying in the midst of the real grief , created by an entirely unreal cause , I perceived that my tears were falling like rain all over my silk dress , and spoiling it ; and I calculated and measure*l most accurately the space that my father would require to fall in , and moved myself and my train accordingly in the midst of the anguish I was to feign , and absolutely did endure . It is this watchful faculty ( perfectly prosaic and commonplace in its nature ) , which never deserts me while I am uttering all that exquisite passionate poetry in Juliet 's balcony scene , while I feel as if my own soul was on my lips , and my color comes and goes with the intensity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falling over my train , from setting fire to myself with the lamps placed close to me , from leaning upon my canvas balcony when I seem to throw myself all but over it . In short , while the whole person appears to be merely following the mind , in producing the desired effect and illusion upon the spectator , both the intellect and the senses are constantly engrossed in guarding against the smallest accidents that might militate against it ; and while representing things absolutely imaginary , they are taking accurate cognizance of every real surrounding object that can either assist or mar the result they seek to produce . This seems to me by far the most singular part of the process , which is altogether a very curious and complicated one . I am glad you got my print safe ; it is a very beautiful thing ( I mean the drawing ) , and I am glad to think that it is like me , though much flattered . I suppose it is like what those who love me have sometimes seen me , but to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The effect of it is much too large for me , but when my mother ventured to suggest this to Lawrence , he said that that was a peculiarity of his drawings , and that he thought persons familiar with his style would understand it . Mv dearest H- , you express something of regret at my necessity ( I can hardly call it choice ) of a profession . There are many times when I myself can not help wishing it might have been otherwise ; but then come other thoughts : the talent which .1 possess for it was , I suppose , given to m@ for some good purpose , and to be used . Nevertheless , when I reflect that although hitherto my profession has not appeared to me attractive enough to engross my mind , yet that perhaps admiration and applause , and the excitement springing therefrom , may become necessary to me , I resolve not only to watch but to pray against such a result . I have no desire to sell my soul for anything , least of all for sham fame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far deeper en-. // joyment in other pursuits ; the happiness of reading Shakespeare 's heavenly imaginations is so far beyond all the excitement of actin* them ( white satin , gas lights , applause , and all ) , that leannot conceive a time when having him in my hand will not compensate for the absence of any amount of public popularity . While I can sit obliviously curled up in an arm - chair , and read what he says till my eyes are full of delicious , quiet tears , and my heart of blessed , good , quiet thoughts and feelings , I shall not crave that which falls so far short of any real enjoyment , and hitherto certainly seems to me as remote as possible from any real happiness . This enviable condition of body and mind was mine while studying Portia in The Merchant of Venice , which is to be given on the 25th for my benefit . I shall be much frightened , I know , but I delight in the part ; indeed , Portia is my favoritest of all Shakespeare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wise , so arch and full of fun , and such a true lady , that I think if I could but convey her to my audience as her creator has conveyed her to me , I could not fail to please them much . I think her speech to Bassanio , after his successful choice of the casket , the most lovely , tender , modest , dignified piece of true womanly feeling that was ever expressed by woman . I certainly ought to act that character well , I do so delight in it ; * I know nothing of my dress . But perhaps I shall have some opportunity of writing to you again before it is acted . Now all I have to say must be packed close , for I ought to be going to bed , and I have no more paper . I have taken two ridino lessons and like it much , though it makes my bones ache a little . I go out a great deal , and that I like very much whenever there is dancing , but not else ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought not to say it , but after the sort of conversation I am used to , the mere usual jargon of socicty seems poor stuff ; but you know when I amdancing I am " o'er all the ills of life victorious . " John has taken his degree and will be back with us at Easter ; llcnry has left us for Paris ; A- is quite well , and almost more of a woman than I am ; my father desires his love to you , to which I add mine to your eldest niece and your invalid , and remain ever your affectionately attached F. A. K. BLACKH1*ATH . M* DEAREST H- : I was exceedingly glad to receive your letter , for I thou , ht it was a long time since you had written , and I began to fear the exertion of doing so was too much for you- I am very glad indeed that it is not , for your handwriting always occasions me much pleasure . I look forward exceedingly to my visit to Ireland , to seeing you once more , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom I am much interested for your sake . Cecy Siddons had told me of your niece E- 's improved health , and I rejoiced most truly , for all your sakes , to hear of it . Pray give her my most sincere congratulations on her restoration to the perpendicular . I trust now that the summer will accelerate her convalescence , and that when I have the pleasure of seeing her she will have made great progress in recovering her strength . You ask me for my own criticism on my Portia ; you know that I think I am able to do myself tolerably impartial justice , which may be a great a*istake ; but whether it is or not , I request you will believe the following account in preference to any other report , newspaper or letter , public or private , whatever . In the first place , on my benefit night ( my first appearance in the part ) I was so excessively nervous about it , and so shaken with the tremendous uproar the audience made with their applause , that I consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and quite unworthy of it . I was frightened FLAT to a degree I could hardly have believed possiJ3le after my previous experience . I am happy to think that I improve in the part , and sincerely hope that I shall continue to do so for some time . The principal defect of my acting in it 1876. 199 // is that it wants point - brilliancy . I do not do the trial scene one bit better or worse than the most mediocre actress would , and although the comic scenes ire called deli*htful by people whose last idea of comedy was borrowed from Miss C or Miss F- , my mother says ( and I believe her ) they are very rapid . The best thing I do in the play ( and I think it is the best thing I do at all , except Juliet 's balcony scene ) is the scene ef the caskets , with Bassanio , and this I think I do well . But the scene is of so comparatively subdued , quiet , and uneffective a nature , that I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rows of the pit must be the only part of the audience who know anything about my acting of that portion of the play . I like the part better than any I have yet played . I delight in the poetry , and my heart goes with every sentiment Portia utters . I have a real satisfaction in acting it , which is more than I can say for anything else I have yet had to do . Juliet , with the exception of the balcony scene , I act ; but I feel as if I were Portia - and how I wish I were ! It is not a part that is generally much liked by actresses , or that excites much enthusiasm in the public ; there are no violent situations with which to ( what is called ) " bring the house down . " Even the climax of the piece , the trial scene , I should call , as far as Portia is concerned , rather grand and impressive than strikingly or startlingly effective , and with the exception of that the whole character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and so free from all exaggeration , that it seems to me hardly fit for a theatre , much less one of our immense houses , which require acting almost as splashy and coarse in color and outline as the scene-painting of the stage is obliged to be . Covent Garden is too large a frame for that exquisite , harmonious piece of portrait painting . This is a long lecture , but I hope it will not be an uninteresting one to you ; and now let me tell you something of my dresses , which cost my poor mother sad trouble , and were really beautiful . My first was an open skirt of the palest pink levantine , shot with white and the deepest rosecolor ( it was like a gown made of strawberries and cream ) , the folds of which , as the light fell upon them , produced the most beautiful shades of shifting hues possible . The under-dress was a very pale blue satin , brocaded with silver , of which my sleeves were likewise made ; the fashion of the costume was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pointed body , cut square over the bosom and shoulders , with a full white muslin shirt drawn round my neck , and wide white sleeves within the large blue and silver brocade ones . C'omprenez-vous all this ? My head was covered with diamonds ( not real ; I m anxious for my character ) , and what delighted me much more was that I had jewels in the roses of my shoes . I think if I had been Portia I never would have worn any ornaments but two large diamonds in my shoe bows . You see , it shows a pretty good stock of diamonds and a careless superiority to such possessions to wear them on one 's feet . Kow pray do n't lau0h at me , I was so enchanted with my fine shoes ! This was my first dress ; the second was simply the doctor 's black gown , with a curious little authentic black velvet hat , which was received with immense applause when I put it on ; I could hardly keep my countenance at the effect my hat produced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made exactly like the first , the ample skirt gathered all round into the stomacher body ; the material was white satin , trimmed with old point lace and Roman pearls , with a most beautiful crimson velvet hat , a perfect Rubens , with one sweeping white feather falling over it . . We are spending our holiday of Passion week here for the sake of a little quiet and fresh air ; we had intended going to Dover , but were prevented ; I am sorry for it , for I love the sea , and I should have been so happy in watching the effect it would have produced on my sister , who has never seen it . You ask me after my mother : she is pretty well now , but her health is extremely uncer // tam , and her spirits , which are likewise very variable , have so much influence over it that her condition fluctuates constantly ; she has been very well , though , for the last few days . London , I think , never agrees with her , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had become not only desirable but necessary . Thank you for wishing me plenty of dancing . I have abundance of it and like it extremely ; but I fear I am very unreasonable about it , for my conscience smote me the other day when I came to consider that the night before , although my mother had stayed at a ball with me t*ll three in the morning , I was by no means gracious in my obedience to her request that I should spare myself for my work . You see , dear H- , I am much the same as ever , still as foolishly fond of dancing , and still , I fear , almost as far from " begetting a temperance in all things ' as when you and I wandered about Heath Farm together . I have been to a church to-day which I have not visited since I was five or six years old . The house where I at that time often stayed is either demolished or so altered and modernized as to have prevented me from recognizing it . The neighborhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I remember well , instead of standing in the open fields forms the centre of a little town of new , white , citizen-retreat-like villas . I felt vexed , though the inside was unaltered . The wise man said , " There is nothing new under the sun , " but lie did n't live in or near London in the nineteenth century . We met with a comical little adventure the other evening . We were wanderin* over the common , and encountered two , ypsies . I always had desired to have my fortune told , so A and I each seized hold of a sibyl and listened to our fates . After predicting to me all manner of good luck and two lovers , and foretellin , that I should marry blue eyes ( which I will not ) , the gypsy went up to my father , and began , " Pray , sir , let me tell your fortune : you have been much wronged , sir , kept out of your rights , sir , and what belonged to you , sir , - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sir . " My father turned away laughing , but my mother , with a face of amazed and amazing credulity , put her hand in her pocket , exclaiming , " I must give her something for that , though ! " Is n't that delicious ? Oh , H- ! bow hard it is to do right and be good ! But to be sure , " if to do were as easy as to know what were good to be done , " etc . How I wish I could have an hour 's talk with you ! I have so much to say , and I have neither time nor paper to say it in ; so I must leave off . Good - by , God bless you ; pray look forward to the pleasure of seeing me , and believe me ever Your affectionate F. A. K. The house where I used to visit at Lea , in the neighborhood of Blackheatb , was a girls ' school , kept by ladies of the name of Grimani , in which my aunt Vietoire Decamp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a noble Venetian family , of which the Reverend Juhian Young , their nephew , has given an account in his extremely interesting and aniusing memoir of his father ; his mother , Julia Grimaui , being the sister of my kind friends , the directresses of the Blackheath school . One of these , Bellina Grimani , a charming and attractive woman , who was at one time attached to the household of the ill-fated and ill-conducted Caroline of Brunswick , Princess of Wales , died young and single . The elder Miss Grimani married a Mr. H within a few years . Though I have never in the intervening fifty years met with them , I have seen two ladies who were nieces of Miss Grimani , and pupils in her school when I was a small visitor there . My principal recollections connected with the place were the superior moral excellence of one of these damsels , EB- , who was held up before my unworthy eyes as a model of school - girl virtue , at once to shame and encourage me ; Bellina Grimani 's sweet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawn , and a picture in the drawing-room 1876. 201 // qwq
