txt Being " on the homestretch , " the Greeleyites are preparing for what horsemen call a " spurt , " in the desperate hope of saving themselves from being distanced in the race . They know very well that if Mr. GREELEY does not carry his own State , no earthly power can keep the Democracy together till another Congressional election . They have no expectation of electing their candidate ; but they are bending all their energies to supplement the vote they will strive to gain by fraud and . violence in the South by the electoral vote of New-York , and so put oft for a tune , the destruction that will otherwise be immediate and certain . To this end the leaders are trying to rouse the flagging spirit of the local politicians in the election districts . They have prepared an elaborate circular-letter , bearing date at the " Rooms of the Democratic State Committee , St. Nicholas Hotel , NewYork , Oct. 21 , 1872 . " This letter is lithographed , to bear to the rural Democrat the appearance of being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in whose handwriting it is , and who is the principal signer . It is not such a letter as was sent under Mr. TILDEN 'S signature in 1868 , asking confidentially for early returns from outside the City . There is no hope now that any such letter would be of use , because there is no chance for a monstrous majority in the City , made to order . to swamp the honest vote of the country districts . This letter is meant for more general reading : " Concentrate your attention . " it urges . " On YOUR OWN election district . Take no risk of losing a vote which extra effort could save to our cause . Your friends and associates are making the same exertions in every election district in the State . Turn your eves from everything but your full duty in your own election district . You have the best opportunity which has occurred in many years of making great and permanent gains in your Assembly district , your county , and in your Congressional and Senatorial districts . The way to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within your own election district . " This is the tone of the circular-letter , which has a postscript declaring that the State Committee have indications that they can carry the State ' outside the City , and that their majority here will be from thirtyfive thousand to forty thousand . This letter was evidently confided to poor . Mr. GREELEY 'S , ! manager , and the Trifnine yesterday had a " screalnina " article based deleted 8 lines This fact , however , appeals with as much force to patriotic men as to the Democratic managers . The opportunity of shattering the Democratic Party  --  which has for so many years been the foe of progress  --  ought to be seized by all good citizens as eagerly as it is resisted by the politicians , whose occupation will be gone when the party is destroyed . That opportunity is presented now to the people of the State of New-York .. Gen. GRANT will be re-elected . whether NewYork is carried or not . But if we carry this State . we shall add to the satisfaction of securing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having broken up the reactionary party of the country . The prize is worth working for , and we appeal to every true man in his own neighborhood to do his share of the work .
