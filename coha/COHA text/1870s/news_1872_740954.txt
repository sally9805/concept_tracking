txt JAMES J. Kelso , by the favor of WM . M. TWEED Superintendent of Police of the City of New-York , seems to be afflicted with an idea that the people of this City are idiots , who can be deceived by the shallowest of tricks . When we called attention to the fact that he had allowed a plain law of the State to be violated by areligious procession marching through the streets - with music on Sunday last , it was swiftly announced that he had ordered the Captains in whose precincts the violation of the law had occurred to be placed on trial tor neglect of ditty . ? The inference to be drawn from this action was that be had done all that was incumbent upon him to insure the " observance ? of the law ; but facts . have come ' to . our knowledge which show that his pretense of vigor is only intended as an attempt to hide his own effort to evade the statute , in order . that he might favor a certain class of citizens . *It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the church . of ' St : John the Baptist is situated , and . in . which there was more playing of music than any other , is not to be placed on trial because of his claim that he stopped it as soon as he heard of it . This would be a plausible excuse if it could . not be shown that by this course the Superintendent will be able . to smother much evidence that he is himself at fault in the matter . There was an application made at Police bead-quarters , Saturday evening , for another procession with music , which was refused on the ground that it was contrary to law , and the answer was made that this Captain had just read them a permit for the religious procession , which said nothing about music . This was strictly true as to the character of the permit . It merely informed . the Captains that a permit had been granted tor the procession , and said nothing whatever about music , which was the vital matter , as it is music , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wish to do our Catholic citizens the . justice to say that if all the facts are allowed to appear , we believe . it will be seen that , being misled by KELSO , they unwittingly violated the . statute . The application for the permit was made to the Board . of Police , and referred to the Superintendent in the usual way . Nothing being said in it about music , the gentleman . who applied for it being igno r ant of the law , and knowing that it was generally understood that there were to be several bands , acted accordingly . But , under the singular determination of the Superintendent not to put a particular Captain on trial , it is probable that the . important evidence of this gentleman can not , be made available . All that we ask in this matter is that the whole truth shall be told . This much the Police Commissioners owe to a community outraged by the action of their Tammany Superintendent , who manifestly sought to ignore a law of the State for the benefit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands .
