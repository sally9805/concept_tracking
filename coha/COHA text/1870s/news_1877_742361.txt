txt In old times the Indians used to coinplain that the white man was driving them into the Pacific Ocean . The red man 's fear was not wholly groundless . West of the Mississippi lie went first ; then , no room being found for him , the Missouri was the pale of civilization , eastward of which he must not tarry ; and a few tribes were forced down into the then remote regions of the south-west , the Kiekapoos being given a home on the banks of the Rio Grande . In the North-west , the Sioux made a determined stand for their hunting grounds in the Black Hills and about the head-waters of the Missouri . But , in the meantime , the discovery of gold in California and the settlement of the vast territory occupied by the Gadsden Purchase and the treaty of Guadaloupe Hidalgo forever fenced off the westward-flying tribes from the Pacific . If the red man , figuratively driven toward the Peaceful Sea , should really make for that sheet of water , he would be compelled to run the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well settled as any west of the Mississippi . The result is that the fugitive tribes have been squeezed out , so to speak , at either extremity  --  north and south .. The Kickapoos have gone over the Rio Grande , and the Sioux are in British America . The Kickapoos went first . It is commonly asserted that the Mexicans , who are a sharp race of brigands , observed with admiration the peculiar talent for stealing which the Kickapoo has in common with his race . The Mexican as a thief  --  in the free vernacular of the South-west ? " is no slouch . " But the Kickapoo is his equal in all branches of pilfering , and his superior in some . The Mexicans proposed a partnership , and the Kickapoos , nothing loath , consented to organize a kind of joint stock stealing corporation . The consent of the United States to this migration was obtained with the greatest of ease , and the self-expatriated Kiekapoos went over the border into Mexico , followed by the heartfelt blessings of the population of Texas . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country . But , like lietamore , he would return . He came back during many subsequent dark nights , accompanied by his Mexican allies ; and ? what these associated vagabonds did not carry back with them across the boundary was not worth stealing .. At this moment , Indian ? and Mexican raid backward and forward , almost unchecked ; and when the nettled and exasperated authorities propose to chase them over the border , a knot of political idlers exclaim that we are seeking a war with Mexico . This admirable example has not been lost on SITTING BULL . That eminent aboriginal politician and statesman , finding Montana too hot to hold him , has lightly galloped over into British domains , and is represented as standing just across the line , making derisive gestures to his baffled pursuers . Assisted by BULL EAGLE , and one or two other good fighters , SITTING BULL , varies the monotony of his exile with an occasional incursion into the country of the Americans . He finds United States territory still available as a hunting ground , and , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Pembina to Arrow Lake , his opportunities are practically unlimited . There is no way to reach this difficulty . SITTING BULL is hardly a subject for extradition . He has never been indieted . He would probably sot up in a British Police Court that he is not a fugitive from justice , though he may be a fugitive from injustice . Then , again , if we should make an official demand for him on Earl DERBY , the British Secretary for Foreign Affairs might have some difficulty in finding him . The British , or Canadian , Government could not be induced to send an army against the unwelcome intruder . They would very probably tell us that SITTING Bun and his band are American subjects , although we have concluded treaties with them , and that if we want our Indians we may come and take them . If Gen. MILES should imitate Gen. ORD , and chase the thieving Sioux over the border , we should expect to hear the British lion howl with anguish . An invasion of the sacred soil , although that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would convulse the Dominion of Canada , and give the London newspapers a more thrilling topic than " British interests in the East . " It is not comfortable to have these two savage tribes hanging on the flanks of our civilization ; and when we consider that it is possible that SITTING Bun and his comrades may skirt the boundary until they are within supporting distance of the rebellious Nez Perces and Cwur d'Alenes of Idaho , the prospect is by no means comforting . Assuming that the bad qualities of the American Indians are largely the result of our own mismanagement , a moralist might say that our sins had thus returned to plague us by their consequences . If we had civilized and enlightened the Sioux , they would not now be buzzing and stinging us from British territory . If the Kickapoos had had the advantages of the public school and a citizenship under TWEED and SWEENY , they would be organizing municipal governments in Texas instead of cattle-lifting on the Rio Grande . But it is denied that Sioux or Kickapoos are capable of being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prof. MARSH , we believe , " makes no bones " of declaring that the Indian is a wild man , who can not be tamed without rebuilding him from his native stock . So , what are we to do with the Indian in the abstract but to pen him up when we can , and chase him into a foreign country when we can not I These two experiments of chasing the Indians into the territory of our neighbors have not been brilliantly successful , it is true . But on the whole , it is less expensive , perhaps , than an Indian war at home . It is estimated that it costs $700,000 each to kill an Indian with the means and appliances of the War Department . If the Sioux and the Kickapoos would only make themselves as unpopular in Canada and Mexico as they have been in the United States , we should expect that the respective Governments of those countries would abate them as nuisances . Meantime , however , there is no knowing what international complications may arise from attempts to reclaim these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
