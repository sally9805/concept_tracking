txt The action for libel - which has recently been tried in England is one which concerns the press all over the world . Many comments have already been made upon it in this country which were evidently based on a misapprehension of the facts , as they necessarily must have been since the full reports of the proceedings were not received . till yesterday . The action was nominally against Baron GRANT , a somewhat notorious speculator in London , and . Mr. SAMPSON , late city editor of the London Times , but it is quite clear that GRANT was only brought in by an adroit move of the plaintiff , while the Times undertook the expense and responsibility of defending the action on the part of SAMPSON . The action was brought by a man named RUBERRY , for libels contained in the city ( or money ) article of the Times . These articles related to one of the greatest frauds which have ever been devised for the benefit of a speculative community . It was an alleged discovery of diamond fields in Arizona , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Directors of the " San Francisco and New-York Mining and Commercial Company " on the 11th November , 1872 . Mr. KING clearly proved that the " diamond fields " had simply been " salted . " He tested the locality in the most thorough manner , and came to these conclusions ? we copy from his report which now lies before us : " The result of these ten links of proof are : That the gems exist in positions where nature alone could never have placed them . That they do not exist where , had the occurrence been genuine , the inevitable laws of nature duet have carried them . Finally , that some designing hand has ' salted ' them with deliberate , fraudulent intent . " Two men , named SLACK and ARNOLD , claimed the honor of " discovering " this diamond field ; with them were associated , among other persons , the man named RuBERRY , who pretended . that he had stumbled over an ant-hill , and found that it contained nothing but rubies and diamonds . He and his contederates were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ November or December , 1872 . These facts were stated in the most moderate language in the London Times city articles of Nov. 18 , 1872 , and 20th December , 1872 . RUBERRY was mentioned only incidentally . As to the fact that the diamond fields were a swindle , there seems to be no dispute . RUBERRY 'S connection with the swindle is , in our opinion , equally clear . It is true that nobody saw him take out the diamonds from a bag and sprinkle them . over the ground ; but he was in the company of . the men who did it , and thus exposed himself to the gravest charges . His defense was that he was deceived , and that he believed the diamond fields to be genuine . In that case , he must have been a fool ; but the evidence shows that he was not a fool . He bad previously been mixed up in all sorts of " wildcat " companies . There was the " Lincoln Gold Mining Company , " the " Pyramid Range Company , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the " Emma Mine Company . " The Times , in warning the public against the Arizona diamond fields discovery , simply protected that public from further spoliation and robbery . It rendered the community a service , and we venture to say that any jury which could have been brought together in the United States would have recognized anda appreciated that service , and sent RUBERRY out of court a great deal taster than he bad come into it . For we do ? fit hesitate to assert , after a careful eictti. nation Of allthe fabta , ihat RUBERRY Was involved in the rascalities of the diamond fields fittud . We may go even further , and assert that RUBERRY is clearly an adventurer of the lowest character He began his career in this country . in 1863 by obtaining letters of marque from JEFFERSON DAvrs for a privateer , which ; in conjunction with others , he fitted out " to operate , " as the Chief Baron said in his summing up , " against either the mercantile navy or the Government Navy , or both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went on to say that this was a highly-honorable exploit ; but , on this side of the Atlantic , at least , we may take leave to express a different opinion . The privateer was seized in the harbor of San Francisco , and RUBERRY and his associates were tried and . convicted . They were afterward released  --  the Chief Baron says through the intervention of Mr. BRIGHT  --  and iu 1864 , RuBERRY returned to London , and began to exercise his ingenuity in forming bubble companies . In 1872 , RUBERRY , who at that time was in a slight difficulty with his wife which required the intervention of the Divorce Court , thought proper to return to this country to give it once snore the benefit of his experience and abilities . He came over with another man named HARPENDING , and soon afterward they discovered between them these diamond mines in Arizona . In California he had to encounter the keen journalists of San Francisco , and they very soon saw through his little scheme . After that he went to Chicago , and ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge of law is better than his geographical knowledge ? " from Chicago he went to see a great and celebrated natural curiosity at no great distance , called the Mammoth Caves . " There lie met two men named SLACK and ARNOLD , who are admitted to have been concerned in " salting " the mines . They were proved to have bought the rough stones in London and Paris . How did RUBERRY become - associated with these men if he was innocent of all participation in the frauds Then came Mr. CLARENCE KING 'S disclosure , and . after that RUBERRY was taken sick , returned to England , and finished up by bringing his action for damages against the Times for defamation of character . His intimate association with the men who salted the mines is not denied ; his presence on the scene of the fraud is not denied . The comments of - tlie Times upon his part in ' the transaction were most moderate . How , then , did he manage to induce a jury to give him damages ? The diamond fields were a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every reason to believe that RUBERRY was connected with those frauds . That much is clear . But an appeal of an able and slightly unscrupulous lawyer to a jury of British tradesmen , against the license of the press , never fails to produce its effect . In this case , the Solicitor General ( who appeared for.RunEurtv ) dwelt much upon the libels , even " upon her Majesty on the throne down to the humblest tradesman , " which appeared in the press . He deplored , he wept over them . It broke his heart to read them . To libel the Queen on the throne , that lie might have stood ; but to see the British Tradesman traduced ? it was that which pierced him to the quick . He went on to say that he did not accuse the Times ? oh , dear , no ! But the prejudice which lie sought to create was equally obvious , and he knew very well that he had succeeded . The press may publish libels now and then ; but for a good , thorough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British counsel pleading before a jury of British Tradesmen . We scarcely remember ftree instances , in the course of twenty years ' experience , in which the B. T. have not relieved their overcharged souls by bringing a verdict against the newspaper .. But the case was complicated by an . incident which had no direct bearing upon it , but which was used by RUBERRY and his counsel with great effect . RUBERRY had discovered that Mr. SaaviesoN had received money from Baron GRANT , the speculator above mentioned . GRANT swore that these payments had . no connection with RUBERRY or the diamond swindle ? as the Chief Baron , ( who , as usual , summed up dead against the newspaper , ) was obliged to admit , " GRANT , upon his oath , positively and solemnly denied that he had ever mentioned the name of Re BERRY to Mr. SAMPSON , or Mr. SAMPSON to him . " But GRANT was forced to admit that he had made money payments to SAMPSON from time to time . And that SAMPSON dishonored himself and his calling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is needless to say that the chief editor and proprietor of the ' Ting ? knew nothing of these transactions . They are men far above the reach of improper influences ? men not only of great ability , and of almost unrivaled experience in public affairs and . of men , but of the most lofty honor and . integrity . They would rather sacrifice everything than see the reputation of their great journal tarnished . " The honor and independence of this paper , " says the Times in its , article on this action , " must ever be above suspicion , and the humiliation we have suffered is hard to bear ? a hardship compared with which the damages that have been awarded to Mr. RuBERRY are as a feather in the air . " There is no journalist of proper feeling who will not sympathize with the conductors of the Times in the sorrow which the bad faith of their subordinate has occasioned them . They have been betrayed , as all of us are likely to be ; but they have taken what precautions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future , and even in the case which was the accidental means of disclosing GRANT 'S relations with SAMPSON , it is proved that they did no more than their duty . The paper warned the public against a gigantic swindle , and it deserved the thanks of the community instead of the adverse verdict of a jury .
