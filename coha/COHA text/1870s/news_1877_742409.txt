txt We have heard a great deal about women running away from their husbands in all ages and under all conditions of society , and we shall continue to hear of their doing so to the end of time . These uxorial hegiras , as the reporter of the period would ' be delighted to call them , have laid the foundation of many a romantic story , and the writers have usually embellished the good looks and wickedness of the wives to the utmost in order to make their narrative as interesting as possible . The blind old bard from Scio led off in this sort of thing , and got such a reputation for his epic that all eloping wives are now called Helens , beguiling lovers Parises , and all deserted lieges compared with MENELAUS , The poet , being masculine , gave MENELAUS ' version of the affair rather than HELEN 'S , and it is quite probable , if she could have been heard from , ( Dr. SCHLIEMANN may soon exhume the diary M which she kept a detailed . record of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undoubtedly have had quite another story to tell . Mon are generally the guilty ones ; but , being the historians and poets , for the most part , they make women the scapegoat of their sins . They illustrate the old fable of the lion and the painter . The painters paint the lions , but the lions can not paint the painters , and so , for lack of capacity or opportunity , what is invented is believed , and the actual truth is unexpressed . Eloping husbands , unless their elopement involves some criminality , or causes great scandal , are not advertised as eloping wives are , partly because men make the newspapers and partly because there is so much less novelty and piquancy in their violation of law and conventionality than there is in women 's violation of the same . But the elopement of husbands has grown to be much commoner than is generally supposed or known , especially since the commercial dullness and financial pressure ? now in their fourth year  --  have rendered the maintenance of a family extremely difficult . Hardly a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not desert his wife , and children too , if he has any , because he finds it inconvenient to support them . In some cases husbands are candid enough to leave a communication behind declaring their intent and the cause of their departure . But in most cases they go away without a word , oral or written , preferring that their families should endure the agonies of doubt and suspense rather than confess their own cowardice and weakness . If the forlorn wives suspect the truth , as they often do , they say nothing about their desertion save to the intimate few from whom it can not long be hidden ; but they take up their new burden in silence and bear it as well and bravely as they may . Not unfrequently , however , they are terribly alarmed  --  for they have so idolized their lords that they can not believe them capable of such baseness . They believe they have been murdered or have lost their wits and wandered off . Then the local columns contain accounts of mysterious disappearances and families plunged in grief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the false impression they have created . The women are not very long deceived , usually ; ninny circumstances and coincidences come into their mind by degrees , and the truth is revealed at last . It is a bitter truth , far bitterer than their former grief  --  for a woman would rather mourn as dead a man she had loved than believe him living and utterly unworthy of her love . There are scores and . scores of wives in this and adjacent cities who have been widowed by the hard . times . Left without natural protectors , they have courageously gone to work and taken care of themselves and those dependent on them . Four years ago many of them had husbands who seemed to be men ; but the husbands , not strong enough to bear up against continued ill fortune , slunk away , leaving the women they had claimed to love , and the children they had brought into being , to fight the hard battle of life alone . Some of these deserted wives have been tenderly reared , have never known until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edges of the actual world . But they have accepted the change heroically , and are sustaining the struggle as finer natures do when put to the test . A number of young wives , but a few months wedded , have been abandoned by men ( generically speaking ) who , having little earning capacity , and no sense of responsibility , found it inconvenient to support them after the lover 's ardor had cooled . ' Many of these fugitive husbands have gone to California and other new States , not because enterprise carried them thither , but that they might be far removed from the scenes of their broken faith and demonstrated shame . Probably their conscience pricked them a little at the start ; but they could not have had enough to prick long ; otherwise they could not have so wholly renounced their manhood . If the times had been ordinarily prosperous , it is not unlikely that they would have kept their covenant and done their duty ; but adversity , pressed them ; they had small power of resistance . and they went ignobly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as weak .. Hugs ; but oh ! the inconceivable power . of mischief that lies in weakness , greater often than deliberate villainy entails . When the tide of prosperity sets in , some , perhaps many , of these marital fugitives will he sneaking back , with a plausible story , and begging to be forgiven . Seeing how well their families have got on without them , they will want to be partners in their sue ? cess , sharing the profits , but contributing nothing thereto . They will not be forgiver in most eases , we suspect ; for their forme ' wives will have had time to learn how much better off they are in every way disincum ? bored of such husbands . They have been compelled to despise them , and to be grate ? ful for deliverance even through mortify . ing desertion . Few of the abandoned wivel will be willing to re-establish relations with men who have proved that they never de . served to have a wife . Women are divinely forgiving ; they can forgive deceit , trench @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have ever loved ; but the one thing they find hardest to forgive in him is weakness ; for weakness , in a woman 's eyes , has no power to atone.
