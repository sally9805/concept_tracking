txt was insensible , and her recovery despaired of . She is still suffering from the effects of the fall , which , at her time of life , is likely to have dangerous consequences . Suit was brought for $10,000 damages , and the jury rendered . a verdict for $1,000 ? little enough , it must be confessed , but sufficient , perhaps , to induce stage proprietors to employ in the future less reckless drivers . But such cases ought not to stop here . A money verdict may satisfy the feelings of the person injured , but it does not meet the requirements of the public welfare . Some means ought to be found for reaching , and punishing severely , stage-drivers  --  and , it may be added , ear-conductors  --  who are often as culpable in this direction for accidents occurring through utter recklessness . How frequent such accidents are , and how frequently fatal , our readers do not need to be told . Were they rarer , the driver or conductor , in any particular case , might be forgiven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plea will avail . With many individuals of this class , it seems to be part of a settled system never to stop a sufficient time for any but exceptionally active persons to ascend or descend . in safety . It is a common thing to hear conductors speak with extreme rudeness and insolence to women who fail to reach this required standard of agility . As for men ? who are supposed , in the conductors ' and omnibus drivers ' simple creed , to be all natural acrobats  --  only the most pressing demand will gain for them the briefest stoppage . If they are a trifle tardy or clumsy , so much the worse for them . Their ignominious struggles in the mud afford ' a congenial theme for mirth to the courteous public servant as he hurries gayly away . Now , of course , it is unjust to say that all conductors and stage-drivers are of this pattern , or that many of them are not patient and civil to a degree that is really remarkable , considering their hard lives , the annoyances of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very little consideration they receive from anybody . But many of them are of the other sort , and some few of them are downright ruffians , whose properplace is the Penitentiary . Letters are constantly appearing in the newspapers describing acts of reckless brutality perpetrated by these men which deserve no slighter punishment . One such a day ortwo ago related an accident to an aged lady of a precisely similar nature to that which has furnished a text for this article . In another it was asserted that the driver of a Twenty-third street omnibus knocked over and severely injured a gentleman . We do not know if complaints in these and the like cases were laid before the proper authorities . It is , perhaps , too often true of our people that they prefer to write letters to the newspapers rather than to seek more effectual redress in the proper quarters . But it may be true that complaints can not often be substantiated . The culprit is seated on a high box , where his features are with difficulty recognizable from the street ; Tie drives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becomes , inmost cases , impossible . Nevertheless , this sort of recklessness is altogether too common and too uncomfortable not to require that an effort should be made for its suppression . It can be stopped only by severe punishment of the offender in every case where he can be ascertained . If there is any means of punishing the driver convicted by this verdict in the Common Pleas of culpable carelessness , he ought to be punished . What is more , it ought to be understood by every conductor and car and omnibus driver in the City that , in accidents resulting from their negligence , they will be held to a personal , as well as their employers to a pecuniary , liability . Then the use of these vehicles will be much safer for aged . and infirm persons than it is at present . RECKLESS DRIVERS . It is to be hoped that the verdict rendered . in the Court of Common Pleas the other day , against the proprietors of the Madison Ave . nue Stage Line , will have the effect of Mak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case was one of only too frequent oc. currence . An elderly lady , riding in one of these omnibuses , purled the strap at Twenty . second street , where she wished to get out . The driver stopped , but while she was still on the Step started suddenly , throwing her violently to the , ground .

Except in large purchases made at cheap prices just after that time , out-of-town merchants have until recently bought sparingly , stocks are low , and there should not be any serious doubt as to the ability.of the people to consume . The only remaining factor in the question is the financial agitation in Congress . Business men want to know whether the currency is to be inflated , and whether there is to be additional taxation . It is clear enough that it is impossible , at present , to operate understandingly in tea , coffee , tobacco , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for additional taxation . An addition to the currency would also unsettle values . These questions should be settled as soon as possible in the interest of the business community .
