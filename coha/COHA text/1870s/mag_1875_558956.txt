ART . IV . - l*femoirs of General William T Sherman . By Himself . In Two Volumes . New York : D. Appleton and Company . 1875 . THE appearance , within a few months of each other , of two books so noteworthy as General Sherman 's Memoirs and General Joe Johnston 's Narrative of Military Operations , revives the interest in the history of our civil war which time and the pressure of the many cares of our intense and nervous American life had perceptibly deadened . There is a peculiar fitness in their appearing as they do . Their authors , opposed to each other at Bull Run , the first considerable battle of the war , were opposed to each other as commanders-in-chief in the arduous campaign which carried the Union army forward to Atlanta , and at the end of the war it was to Sherman that Johnston surrendered his forces . The two books are valuable separately , and more than doubly valuable taken together , for they go far towards enabling us to understand some very interesting operations of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ altogether from one side . We have had fuller means of knowledge of the operations of the Eastern armies than of the Western , and our accounts of the Georgia campaign of 1864 have been especially imperfect . General Sherman 's and General Johnston 's books go far towards supplying the want ; and , as these books are provoking lively criticism and copious reply , it seems probable that we shall soon have the means of knowing all that needs be known about the matters of which they treat . Not to mention the numerous newspaper articles which are appearing , especially in Southern papers , it is announced that General Hood , who succeeded General Johnston in the command of what was then known as the Army and Department of Tennessee , is preparing a formal reply to his Narrative , so far as it concerns him . When that is published , and the government has given us the original reports of officers on both sides , now in the possession of the War Department and understood to be in process of // arrangement for publication , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work with . In the mean time , the curious student may find much interesting and instructive employment in analyzing and comparing the accounts which Sherman and Johnston have given us of the great operations which they conducted against each other . There is a marked contrast in the tone of these two books . Each is the work of a man of ability , and of a man conscious of his own ability ; but Sherman writes with the cheerfulness of success , and Johnston with the depression of disappointment and failure . The latter was not only on the losing side , and obliged to work with the limited material of the Confederacy , but he seems to have been out of favor with President Davis from the beginning of the war , and assigned to the duty of resisting powerful armies with forces inferior in quality , number , and supplies to those which were given to Lee . We know less of his personality than we do of Sherman 's , but it seems probable that he is wanting in the nervous activity , the confidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speeches , personal bearing , and whole career of the latter have shown him to possess . Sherman saw dark days in the war , but he lived to see the time when he had the full confidence of his civil and military superiors ; when troops and supplies in abundance were placed at his disposal , and when he was given almost unlimited control of the plans to the prosecution of which he proposed to devote his forces . But we must pass from such comparison to an examination of the contents of the two volumes before us . The author dedicates them to " His Comrades in Arms , Volunteers and Regulars , " and accounts for " his departing from the usage of military men , who seldom attempt to publish their own deeds , " by the statement of his wish that what he offers , " not designed as a history of the war , or even as a complete account of all the incidents in which the writer bore a part , but merely his recollection *of events , corrected by a reference to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he comes to describe the whole , and account for the motives and reasons which influenced some of the actors in the grand drama of war , " may " prove interesting to // the survivors , who have manifested so often their intense love of the cause ' which moved a nation to vindicate its own authority ; and , equally so , to the rising generation , who therefrom may learn that a country and government such as ours are worth fighting for , and dying for , if need be . " The general public , as well as the student , may be glad of this departure from the usage of military men , for we owe to it two very interesting as well as very valuable volumes . Indeed , we see no sufficient reason why such a usage should prevail among military men , provided they have accomplished anything worth describing , and have the capacity of telling their own story . Put , however that may be , General Sherman has written his Memoirs and has published them , and , as he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has placed his fellow-citizens under a fresh obligation to him . The style of a book like this is * matter of secondary importance . The author makes no attempt to attaiii high finish ; but , though his English is sometimes queer , and he never hesitates to use colloquial expressions , he is always clear , rapid , and interesting . There is hardly a sentence in these volumes that leaves one in any more doubt as to its meaning , than those to whom his tart letters have been addressed from time to time must have experienced in reading them . His language is sometimes picturesquely simple , as when he describes the departure of the army from Atlanta , and when he says that at the grand review , " For six hours and a half that strong tread of the Army of the West resounded along Pennsylvania Avenue . " He either never feels or never yields to the temptation to indulge in sentimentality . He is sometimes , but not too often , humorous , and he never goes out of his way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and business-like as a book can be ; although as anecdotes connected with his story occur to him , he tells them very entertainingly . His descriptions of battles are not remarkable ; but of Sherman as a fighter of battles , as distinguished from the planner and manager of great operations , we propose to speak at more length hereafter . Earnest and determined as Sherman was in fighting and putting down the Rebellion , it appears that he was by no means eager to take up arms for the North at the beginning ; but no // one seems to have surpassed him , if any one equalled him , in the clearness with which he foresaw and the accuracy with which he estimated the magnitude of the struggle . One of the sharpest trials of his life was owing to this very fact of his being in advance of his time . His statement to the Secretary of War , in October , 1861 , that , in his judgment , two hundred thousand men would be needed for offensive operations on the central line before the work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and by them , if not by the Secretary himself , so used that he was very generally and for some time believed by the public to be insane . This cruel imputation was keenly felt by Sherman , as is shown by the space which he devotes to the matter in his first volume . There is nothing in these volumes with which the reader is more strongly impressed than with the fact that Sherman possesses the gift of good sense in the very highest degree , and that he always has his wits about him and his eyes open . At Bull Run , - his first battle , - before he received his orders to cross the run , he saw a horseman , presumably a Southerner , though he does not say so , cross the stream . Inferring that where one went more might go , he sent forward a company to try the ford , and followed with his whole brigade . By similar sense and use of his own eyes , he found a way for General Blair 's division to cross the Big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of just such faculties , by seeing for himself and deciding for himself , that Wellington was enabled to make his famous passage of the Douro . General Sherman was one of the first to see that , so long as the war lasted , all on the other side were enemies , and he never for a moment lost sight of this truth , or failed to shape his action accordingly . He gave a signal example of this clear perception , and of the determination with which he acted upon it , when , after the capture of Atlanta , he ordered the removal of the inhabitants of that city , in order to make it " a pure military garrison or depot , with no civil population to influence military measures , " and enforced the execution of the order with absolute disregard of the outcry which it raised and the protests which it callei forth . There seems no good reason , nor , indeed , any reason , for charging him with uhumanity , but he went droit au bitt . In common phrase , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not hesitate , when he had torn up a railroad and ruined the rails by fire and twisting , to fill up cuts with tr*3s , brush , and earth , and " commingle with them loaded shells so arranged that they would explode on an attempt to haul out the bushes " ; and yet he pronounced it " not war but murder " when he found a great shell planted in the road over which his column passed , and which exploded when it was trodden on . There is a distinction between the two cases , but it is a nice one ; and , though his keen eyes probably saw it clearly , it was rather too nice , and we would rather not have found that he set the example of such modes of warfare . His cordial response to Halleck 's suggestion that he should destroy Charleston and sow salt upon its site is the most savage and the only really savage thing that we recall in his two volumes ; but it was written in 1864 , and the mildest of us did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burning of Columbia was accidental , and , in his judgment , began with the cotton which General Hampton 's men had set fire to on leaving the city . His army seems to have striven hard to put out the fire , but it does not appear that he exerted himself personally in the matter . A striking illustration of his coolness at a time when we were most of us full of that enthusiasm which , as a witty lampooner of the period said , swelled the head as well as the heart , is afforded by  --  a story which he tells in his first volume . Soon after the first Bull Run , in July , 1861 , Mr. Lincoln came out to his camp , and proposed to speak to the men . " I asked him to please discourage all cheering , noise , or any sort of confusion ; that we had had enough of it before Bull Run to ruin any set of men ; and that what we needed were cool , thoughtful , hard-fighting soldiers , - no more hurrabing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ praise which are applicable to men of thought and action are applicable to him . He was both careful and quick in making up his mind , and absolutely unswerving in his progress to his goal , or , rather , absolutely unswerving in his determination to reach his goal . He was ready to see and to acknowledge the importance of obstacles which he had not foreseen or which he had not justly estimated , and // prompt and fertile in the adoption of his action to the altered circumstances of each case , but he never lost sight of his object , or failed to press forward to it as swiftly and forcefnlly as he could . His book is full of evidences of his determination and his wisdom , his promptness and his energy . The same qualities that made him prompt and efficient , when a lieutenant of artillery in California before 1850 , in displacing one Alcalde and installing another and settling affairs in Sonoma , made him prompt and efficient in Virginia in 1861 in bringing to his senses an officer of three-months troops whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at once without waiting for leave or to be mustered out . On another occasion , also , early in his career in California , he showed the same remarkable pluck and ready-witted skill , in his arrest of a large party of deserters from the Regular Army . He showed his prompt resource in Alabama , in 1863 , when two of the clerks at head-quarters were caught by guerillas , and , when last seen , were tied to the tail-board of a wagon , and driven rapidly away . As soon a he learned the fact , he sent for three or four of the principal men of the neighboring town of Florence , told them what had taken place , and demanded the immediate restoration of the captives . The gentlemen so arrested disclaimed all knowledge and all responsibility ; but Sherman told them that these guerillas were their own sons and neighbors , that they knew their haunts , etc. , and that if the restoration did not take place within twenty-four hours , he would strip them of their hats and coats , and tie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were produced . They sent off messengers at once , and the missing ones were brought back the next day . Many commanders have failed because they would see lions in their path . Sherman , on the contrary , fixes his eyes on the thing he proposes to do , and goes over or through or , at the worst , ronud the obstacle , whatever it may be . " Where there s a will , there s a way . " Sherman had the will in plenty , and seldom failed to find the way . When he was planning his northward march from Savannah , and " the question of supplies remained still the one of vital importance , " he reasoned that " if the worst came to the worst , we could live several months on the mules and horses of our trains ? ' This // single simple sentence shows the radical difference between the man and so many of our doubting , balancing , council-ofwar-calling generals ) on both sides , who could not move for want of this store or that supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He showed his determination in quite a different , but not less striking way , and that was in his assignments to command . Soldiers know that there are few harder things to do than to displace a really deserving officer because a better officer is within reach , and the good of the service seems to demand not only a worthy officer but the very best one that can be had . General Sherman seems never to have shrunk from the performance of this duty . After the death of McPherson before Atlanta , it became necessary to settle the important question who should succeed him . " General Logan had taken command of the Army of the Tennessee , by virtue of his seniority , and had done well ; but I did not consider him equal to the command of three corps . Between him and General Blair there existed a natural rivalry . Both were men of great courage and talent , but were politicians hy nature and experience , and it may be that for this reason they were mistrusted by Regular officers like Generals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there should exist a perfect understanding among the army commanders , and at a conference with General Thomas e discussed fully the merits and qualities of every officer of high rank in the army , and finally settled on General Howard as the best officer who was present and available for the purpose I wanted to succeed in taking Atlanta , and needed commanders who were purely and technically soldiers , men who would obey orders , and execute them promptly and on time ; for I knew that we would have to execute some most delicate manoeuvres , requiring the utmost skill , nicety , and precision . I believed that General Howard would do all these faithfully and well , and I think the result has justified my choice . I regarded both Generals Logan and Blair as volunteers ' that looked to personal fame and glory as auxiliary and secondary to their political ambition , and not as professional soldiers . " Again , when he reached Newbern , in 1865 , he - " asked for General Mower to command the Twentieth Corps , because I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generals in the whole army . His predecessor , General Williams , the senior division // commander present , had commanded the corps well from Atlanta to Goldsboro , and it may have seemed unjust to replace him at that precise moment , hut I was resolved to be prepared for a most desperate , and , as then expected , a final battle , should it fall on me . " But if Sherman was decided in changing the rank of officers under him , he seems to have fully understood and practised the duty of subordination in his own case , and to have done what he could to cause others to do the same , and , generally , to promote harmony in the service . When Thomas was put over him after Shiloh , he says , " We were classmates , intimately acquainted , had served together before in the old army , and in Kentucky , and it made to us little difference who commanded the other , provided the good cause prevailed . " When Porter and McClernand were moving together upon Arkansas Post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manner to the latter was extremely curt , and asked him what he meant by it . Porter said that he did not like him , - that he had taken a strong prejudice against him . Sherman " begged him , for the sake of harmony , to waive that , " and Porter promised to do it . This occurred just after the intriguing McClernand had arrived to supersede Sherman in the command of the expeditionary force on the Mississippi , under orders from the War Department . It appears to have been mainly , if not altogether , owing to him that Grant gave up going to the roar on leave , when ilalleck superseded him , after Shiloh . Grant told Sherman that he had resolved to do so . The consequences to him might have been most serious , if not fatal , but for Sherman 's strenuous advice . When he reached Savannah , after all his successes in Georgia , and his great fame was secured , he showed the most cheerful readiness to abandon his carefully considered plan of further operations , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from him by two hostile States . That he did not attempt to disguise his personal feelings at the shameful treatment which he received from Stanton at the close of the war , is true ; but we know of no ground for even suspecting him of having allowed his resentment to influence his official action . General Sherman is unquestionably a very natural man . He is capable of intense wrath , but there is great kindliness // and cordiality in his manner , and an entire absence of reserve , formality , and what we call conventionality , and his Memoirs satisfy the reader that he is the sort of man he appears to be . There is no self-praise in them , though he does not hesitate to speak well of his own action when he sees occasion . lie says very simply , when he learns of his commission as a major-general in the Regular Army , that it was unexpected , and not desired till he was successful in the capture of Atlanta . Of his general orders for the March to the Sea he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late day , so clear , emphatic , and well digested , that no account of that historic event is perfect without them , and I give thewi entire . " He is very plainspoken , as he showed in his interview with General Johnston , after he had heard of the assassination of Lincoln , when he told him , " I could not believe that he or General Lee , or the officers of the Confederate Army , could possibly be privy to acts of assassination , but I would not say as much for Jeff Davis , George Sanders , and men of that stripe . " His manly letter to Mr. Stanton , written on the 25th of April , 1865 , in which he tells him that he still believes the general government of the United States has made a mistake , is another example . When Halleck telegraphed him in May , 1865 , " professing great friendship , and inviting me to accept his hospitality at Richmond , " he answered that he " had seen his despatch to Mr. Stanton , of April @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regarded as insulting , declined his hospitality , and added that I preferred we should not meet as I passed through Richmond . " Like a true soldier , and unlike Halleck , or , if he was not to blame , unlike the Secretary of War , who used the newspapers to publish to the world cruel attacks upon a great soldier in the hour of his triumph , he sent this message by a cipher-despatch , He is very candid . In describing his feelings and actions in the early part of 1861 , he says , " I thought , and may have said , that the national crisis had been brought about by the politicians , and , as it was upon us , they might fight it out ' " ; and he records yet stronger language in the same direction , used to his brother in Washington in March of the same year . He frankly confesses that he made a tactical error when oppos // ing Johnston at Bentonsyille in March , 1865 . He does not hesitate to place on record a fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that when his company was near St. Louis , before the war , he was permitted , on application , as there was cholera there , to delay joining till September . He showed the wise thoughtfulness which often increases the chances of success in war in his instructions to division commanders , issued before the attack on Haines 's Bluff , in December , 1862 , in which he says : - " The detailed manner of accomplishing all these results will be communicated in due season , and these general points are only made known at this time , that commanders may study the maps , and also that in the event of non-receipt of orders all may act in perfect concert by following the general movement , unless specially detached . " His possession of what may be called strategic sense is illustrated by a paragraph in relation to the departure from Atlanta . " It surely was a strange event , - two hostile armies marching in opposite directions , each in the full belief that it was achieving a final and conclusive result in a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the movement on our part was a direct attack upon the Rebel array and the Rebel capital at Richmond , though a full thousand miles of hostile country intervened , and that , for better or worse , it would end the war . " The country knows so well what admirable letters Sherman writes , that it will be good news for those who have not seen these volumes to be told that he has introduced his correspondence into them very freely . His official letters and reports are also constantly reproduced , and it is unnecessary to say that they are of the very greatest interest and value . Some of his letters , other than official letters in the ordinary sense , which have impressed us most , are his letters to General Hood at the time he ordered the abandonment of Atlanta by its inhabitants ; to the Mayor of Memphis , written in July , 1862 ; and to the editor of the " Union Appeal " and the " Bulletin , " both of Memphis , at about the same time ; and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " of all his children the most precious , " to the officer commanding Battalion Thirteenth United States Infantry , in which " Willie // was , or thought he was , a sergeant . " In this connection it may be remarked that no one could see more distinctly than Sherman the mischief wrought by the press in war . His stern warnings to Southern editors in places under his control , and his wise remarks in his closing chapter on the evils inseparable from the presence with troops of newspaper correspondents , will command the approval of every thoughtful reader as well as of every soldier . He adds to the latter passage , with the judicious moderation which is seldom wanting in him : " Yet , so greedy are the people at large for war news , that it is doubtful whether any army commander can exclude all reporters , without bringing down on himself a clamor that may imperil his own safety . Time and moderation must bring a just solution to this modern difficulty . " The question whether this book has been published @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be one upon which every reader must form his own opinion . It certainly has not been common for men so highly placed as General Sherman to give to the world their memoirs so soon after the great events which they describe , and in the lifetime of so many of the men who were prominent in their connection with those events . For our own part , the custom of holding back a great man 's memoirs seems to belong to the class of those which are more honored in the breach than in the observance . A timid man will stay his hand from motives of prudence ; a man who does not like controversy , for fear of disturbance ; a very considerate man , for fear of giving pain . If the book is worth publishing , it is likely to be best worth it when the interest in its subject is fresh . So far as it is accurate , it adds to the stock of valuable information . So far as it is inaccurate or incomplete , it has the best chance of having its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ published early , while living men can draw on their memories . A great soldier 's memoirs are not likely to contain much that will give needless pain . Scandal and gossip must be sought elsewhere . As for the books before us and their author , General Sherman certainly is not timid , nor averse to controversy , whether with the pen or with the sword ; and as for the spirit of his book , it seems to us that no charge of want of consideration for the // feelings of others can fairly be brought against it . We have heard him ask , with every appearance of the liveliest and most genuine interest , whether one who was reading his book found any malice in it , and assert with the most emphatic utterance that if there were any , he was unconscious of it . For ourselves , we are able to say that a good degree of familiarity with its contents disposes us to agree cordially with him in this view . He blames freely , as he praises freely , but he seldom if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his reasons are such as very generally to command the assent of the reader , and he very rarely attributes unworthy motives for any action which he disapproves . With these remarks , and a quotation from the book itself , touching the question raised , we propose to leave the reader to form his own opinion - " I have again and again been invited to write a history of the war , or to record for publication my personal recollections of it , with large offers of money therefor ; all of which I have heretofore declined , because the truth is not always palatable , and should not always be told . Many of the actors in the grand drama still live , and they and their friends are quick to controversy , which should be avoided . The great end of peace ha* been attained , with little or no change in our form of government , and the duty of all good men is to allow the passions of that period to subside , that we may direct our physical and mental labor to repair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater task of continuing our hitherto wonderful national development . " What I now propose to do is merely to group some of my personal recollections about the historic persons aimd events of the day , prepared , not with any view to their publication , but rather for preservation till I am gone , and then to be allowed to follow into oblivion the cords of similar papers , or to be used by some historian who may need them by way of illustration . " - I. 1 76 . He begins his book with the statement , " In the spring of 1846 I was a first lieutenant of Company G , Third Artillery , stationed at Fort Moultrie , South Carolina . " He does not tell us anything of his earlier life , except incidentally . It is well enough to mention , therefore , that he was born at Lancaster , in the State of Ohio , in February , 1820 , and so was twenty-six years old at the period at which his Memoirs commence . Considerably // more than a third of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following years , the greater part of which he passed in California and the rest in Missouri , New York , Kansas , and Louisiana . He played many parts in these y*ears . He was by turns soldier , banker , and superintendent of the " Louisiana Seminary of Learning and Military Academy , " and circumstances led to his being a good deal of a traveller . The story of this period is most agreeable and interesting . He arrived in California before the discovery of gold , and when the country was very thinly settled . He saw the gold fever break out and rage , and he not only was there while the Vigilance Committee held sway , but he seems to have come very near to putting down that powerful organization , and to have only failed because General Wool did not adhere to his promise to furnish him with arms . His account of this affair suggests a question upon which we shall have more to say hereafter , and that is , how far he possesses the precious talent of being able to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as these , however readable the accounts of them may be , the Livian phrases apply , " Legentium plerisque , prima origines proximaque originibus minus pr*bitura voluptatis , festiiiantibus ad ha*c nova " ; and it is sufficient to say here , that his Memoirs show that during all these years of his early manhood he possessed and displayed , so far as circumstances permitted , the same qualities that afterwards made him the famous man he is . The outbreak of the war found him a husband and father , but about as poor in pocket as he was when he began life ; and - one rubs his eyes when he reads that the Sherman who went " marching through Georgia , " the General of the Army of the United States , was the president of a street railroad in St. Louis when the Rebel batteries were firing on Sumter , and did not resign his place till a month after Anderson had saluted his flag and left his fort with the honors of war . Before leaving this earlier and less conspicuous portion of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes some pains to meet what seems to us the very absurd charge that he was guilty of a breach of hospitality in taking up arms against the South , and disposes of the charge in the most conclusive manner . Our // Southern brethren had a way of thinking that whatever they did not like was wrong , but among their many wrong-headed notions a high place is due to their idea that because a Northern officer of instruction and government had received a salary for services rendered them in time of peace and of loyalty to the Union , he must , therefore , stand idly by when they sought to break up that Union by force of arms . On the 14th of May , 1861 , he was appointed colonel of the Thirteenth Regular Infantry , and he soon after went to Washington , reported in person to General Scott , took the oath of office , and was assigned to inspection duty , his regiment having then no existence except on paper . On the 30th of June he assumed command of a brigade in Hunter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before Washington . He says that he had reason to believe that he had one of the best brigades in the whole army , composed of " good , strong volunteer regiments , pretty well commanded , " and having attached to it Ayres 's battery of the Fifth Artillery . On the 21st day of July following , he commanded his brigade in the battle of Bull Run . Three weeks is short time in which to make a brigadier , even out of a West Point graduate , especially without previous experience in any higher position than that of a line officer . General Sherman seems to have kept his head cool , as usual , and to have done his best to use his men with effect in the action ; but his own account of it confirms the impression which we have formed from other accounts , that he displayed no tactical skill , none of the genius of war , in this engagement . Bull Run , one of the best planned battles of the war , as he says , was , as he also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest that attaches to it belongs to its consequences and not to its incidents . We seem to see in his own statement that his regiments came into action well , but successively , " an early indication of something wanting in his mental composition which goes far towards explaining why the great soldier never won a great battle . Before the end of the summer he was assigned to duty in the Department of the Cumberland , Brigadier-General Robert Anderson commanding , and remained on duty in Kentucky for the greater part of the three following months . It was // during this time that he had the interview with Mr. Cameron , then Secretary of War , in which he made the statements which led to the story of his insanity . About the middle of November , 1861 , he was transferred to the Department of Missouri , and ordered to report in person to General ilalleck at St. Louis . The following winter was one of busy preparation , and in the month of February , 1862 , General Grant received the surrender of Fort Henry and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Rebels at Pea Ridge . General Sherman had no connection with operations in the field at this time ; but on the 10th of March , 1862 , he embarked at Paducah a division which he had been forming out of the new troops arriving there , and of which General ilalleck gave him the command . It was a division of four brigades , composed of regiments of volunteer infantry from Ohio and Illinois , and of one volunteer battery from Indiana . After some movements on the Tennessee River , he was ordered to disembark his division at Pittsburg Landing , and to take position well back . Pittsburg Landing is the usual landing-place for the people about Corinth . At Corinth , the Memphis and Charleston Railroad and the Mobile and Ohio , the great Northern road from Mobile to Columbus , just below the confluence of the Ohio and Mississippi , intersect each other . Corinth is in the northeastern corner of Mississippi , and about twenty miles distant from Pittsburg Landing , which is just over the Tennessee line . The distance by road between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the navy told General Sherman it was thirty miles . It was General Halleck 's intention to move out in force , and make a lodgment on the Memphis and Charleston Railroad . General C. F. Smith was in charge of the expedition , but he soon became extremely ill , and was relieved , on the 17th of March , by General Grant . On the 19th of March , after a careful reconnoissance of the ground for ten miles out on the road to Corinth , Sherman disembarked his division , and took post about three miles back from the landing , on ground from which he was driven on the 6th of April , the first day of the battle of Shiloh . It is difficult to believe that he was not surprised in this action . It appears from his own account that // of the five divisions which formed the army which Grant commanded at Shiloh , Prentiss 's was on his left , Huribut 's was a mile and a half to his left rear , and MeClernand 's and W. II . L. Wallace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a distance not stated . He had learned from the country people three weeks before " that trains were bringing large masses of men from every direction into Cc*Anth " ; he " was only responsible for his own division " ; he had made himself " familiar with all the ground inside and outside " his lines ; he knew that Snake Creek and LIck Creek with their confinents narrowed the space over which the Union Army could be attacked to about a mile and a half or two miles ; that the Rebel cavalry in his front was " getting bolder and more saucy , " and that they had artillery with them , if not infantry ; and , finally , he knew that he , or he and Prentiss , held the advanced position , and yet his original report shows that early on the morning of that memorable Sunday , " the enemy drove our advance-guard back on the main body , when I ordered under arms all my division . " His recollections , as stated in the text , are rather more favorable than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the picket firing led him to ride along his lines , he received , when riding along the front of one of his own regiments , at a distance of four hundred yards , a volley which killed his orderly . Nothing seems to indicate that he derived any advantage from timely occnpation of the ground , which he says " admits of easy defence by a small command . " There does not appear to be any good reason for being proud of this battle . Buell 's arrival turned the defeat into a victory , but the Rebel attack caused Grant a loss of ten thousand men from his thirty-two thousand , of which the loss in Sherman 's division , one of the five , was just his due proportion , that is to say , a fifth and a score over . As for the army , Sherman 's own estimate to Buell at the close of the day was that Grant " ought to have eighteen thousand men fit for battle . " As for the commander , Lew . Wallace 's division was left as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Ligny . As for the character of the troops , all of Sherman 's were perfectly new , and many of the rest were probably not much better . It does not appear unjust to Sherman to sum up the story of this battle // by saying that he showed determination and hopefulness , but otherwise did nothing to entitle him to much praise , or to raise brilliant expectations of his future . Till near the close of the year 1862 , there was nothing salient in Sherman 's career . He was promoted to the rank of majorgeneral of volunteers , and he fell under the immediate comruand of General Grant , under which he continued , at least nominally , till the end of the war ; but he was not , during the l ) eriod named , connected with any affair which deserved the name of a battle . On or about the 12th of December , 1862 , he assumed command of an expeditionary force of four divisions , designed to move down the Mississippi in co-operation with Admiral Porter 's fleet , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forces on some ground which was separated only by a bayou from the bluffs of Yicksbnrg , and at about noon of the 29th day of December he gave the orders and signal for the main attack . It was made near the head of Chickasaw Bayou , and upon some heights known as ilaines 's Bluffs , and failed , with a loss of close upon two thousand men , of whom one hundred and seventy-five were killed . General Sherman says that he has " always felt that it was due to the failure of General G. W. Morgan to obey his orders , or to fulfil his promise made in person " ; that is , to lead his division in person . He does not give many details , but the account he gives makes this explanation plausible . Soon after , General McClernand arrived , with orders from the War Department to command the expeditionary force on the Mississippi River . He was appointed to this command by President Lincoln in person , who , Sherman says , had then no knowledge of this repulse. lie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a failure , raised the usual cry at the North of ' repulse , failure , and bungling . ' There was no bungling on my part , for I never worked harder or with more intensity of purpose in my life ; and General Grant , long after , in his report of the operations of the siege of Yicksbnrg , gave us all full credit for the skill of the movement , and described the almost impregnable nature of the ground . " Under General McClernand , General Sherman was present at the rather easy capture of Arkansas Post , in January , 1863 , as commander of the Second Corps of the Army of the MissisVOL. cxxi. - No. 249. 23 // sippi . The aggregate loss of the corps in that operation was five hundred and nineteen . During the first six months of 186* , General Sherman was engaged , as commander of the Fifteenth Army Corps , in the series of difficult and laborious operations conducted by General Grant , which resulted in the surrender of Vicksburg on the 4th of July in that year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do , but it so happened that he was not present at any of the very considerable battles which forced Peniberton 's army into Vicksburg and separated him finally from General Joe Johnston 's forces . The battles of Port Gibson , of Raymond , and of Champion Hills were fought and won without him . In the line of investment , his corps had the right . It took part in the general assaults of May 19 and May 22 , and shared in the general repulse . He was rewarded for his share in the general success of the campaign by the commission of brigadier-general in the Regular Army . So far as we know the part he played in the operations of these six months , in which , it is to be remembered , lie was not at any time the chief commander , he seems to have been always an excellent , trustworthy soldier , but not to have exhibited any exceptional or brilliant qualities . The last six months of the year 1863 were made memorable by the great victory gained by Grant over Bragg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made memorable for Sherman personally by the loss of his favorite son Willie , who died at Memphis on the 3d of October . At about the end of that month , he was assigned to the command of the Department and Army of the Tennessee , the latter of which was made up of the Fifteenth , Sixteenth , and Seventeenth Army Corps . Circumstances made it necessary for General Grant to call him to Chattanooga in great haste , with a portion of his troops , in a short time after . In the great battle of Chattanooga , he led four divisions to attack the right flank of Bragg . Our impression has always been that his success iii this undertaking was not signal . He met with stubborn resistance , and gained little ground , but he undoubtedly caused Bragg to detach heavily from his centre to the threatened flank , and so contributed largely to the magnificent success of the attack of Thomas upon // Missionary Ridge . He reports his loss at about two thousand , which seems small for so large a force , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunrise till late in the afternoon . " Column after column of the enemy was streaming towards me ; gun after gun poured its concentric shot on us from every hill and spur that gave a view of any part of the ground held by us . " Either the Southerners did not shoot as straight that day as they usually did , or Sherman 's attack was not pressed close . The principal events of the first three months of 1863 were the useful but uneventful Meridian campaign , the object of which " was to strike the roads inland , so to paralyze the Rebel forces that we could take from the defence of the Mississippi River the equivalent of a corps of twenty thousand men , to be used in the next Georgia campaign . " This part of the enterprise was successful , but the connected enterprise of attempting to destroy General Forest , the execution of which was intrusted to General Sooy Smith and a strong force of seven thousand selected cavalry , failed utterly , because , General Sherman says , General Smith did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both by letter of instructions and by personal explanations . In March of this year , Sherman received from Grant , then going to Washington to receive the commission of lieutenant-general , the admirable letter of gratitude and thanks with which the public is familiar . On the 18th of the same month , Sherman succeeded Grant in command of the MIlitary Division of the Mississippi , embracing the departments of the Ohio , the Curnberland , the Tennessee , and Arkansas . From this time on , he was virtually an independent commander . He had no superior nearer than Washington , and only the President and General Grant there . The seven weeks following were employed by him in active preparation for the Georgia campaign , in which he proposed to use the Army of the Cumberland , commanded by General Thomas , the Army of the Tennessee , commanded by General McPherson , and the Army of the Ohio , commanded by General Schofield , amounting together to a hundred thousand men and two hundred and fifty guns , besides some ten thousand or more cavalry . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by General Grant from his headquarters in // Virginia , the great campaign was begun . " Its general purpose was to do the utmost possible damage to the Western Army of the Confederacy , commanded , since the defeat of Bragg at Chattanooga , by General Joe Johnston , and to keep him and his forces so fully employed that Lee , in Virginia , should be unable to draw any supplies of men or munitions from that quarter . The next four months were the most momentous and interesting of Sherman 's military career . He was , for the first time , a commander-in-chief . The general plan of operations having been settled and approved , he was left his own master . He had a large and good army , with most excellent commanders , and admirably equipped and supplied . Everything that foresight and industry could do to insure success had been thoroughly done by him , and he bestowed the most watchful and untiring care upon the conduct of the campaign . He had opposed to him one of the very best generals of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , corps commanders under him . He estimated the opposing force as half the size of his own . General Johnston calls it only one third , and a careful comparison of the figures of the two generals leads to the belief that the latter 's estimate was nearer the truth . We believe Johnston to have been fairer in his statements of numbers than most of the prominent Southern officers . However the two armies may have compared numerically , Sherman 's was undoubtedly much the stronger relatively , from its superiority in equipment and supply . Moreover , if his troops were not better , as we believe they were , they were cheered by the consciousness of success . The great victory of Chattanooga had encouraged the Union Army of the West , and the beaten Confederate Army appears to have been more than proportion*ly depressed by it . Sherman moved forward steadily but slowly , for his adversary was able and wary , the country was difficult , he himself made it a principle to avoid the attack of fortified lines , if possible , and both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they took them up . The mistake the Federals made at Shiloh was not repeated in these latter days . Finally , he depended for supplies for his great army upon the single line of // railroad to the rear , therefore he could not go far from it , and he had to protect every mile of it as he went forward . The fighting was continuous , almost daily , for the greater part of these four months . Position after position was made untenable for the enemy by his resistless advance . At last , at Kenesaw , after doing everything in his power to dislodge the enemy from his strong position , he found himself compelled , as he thought , to assault ; but he was repulsed , with a loss of twenty-five hundred men . lie then resolved upon a turning movement on a grand scale , but it had hardly begun before Johnston detected it and evacuated Kenesaw . The story does not make it clear why Sherman might not have resorted to this manoeuvre as well before the assault as after ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an error , is confirmed rather than weakened by his account . He was sharply attacked near PeachTree Creek , before Atlanta , but he repulsed the attack with heavy loss to the assailants . About the 18th of July , Hood was placed in command of the Confederate Army , aud he signalized his accession to the place by two desperate attacks on Sherman 's forces , - on the left of the Union line on the 22d of July , and ou the right of it on the 28th . He was obliged , in each case , to retire into Atlanta , but he inflicted . very heavy loss upon the Union Army in each engagement , and in the former he killed McPherson , one of the very best generals on the Union side . On or about the 16th of August , Hood committed the fatal error of sending away all of his cavalry to raid upon our railroads . Sherman never lost sight of his immediate object , - the capture of Atlanta , - and his indefatigable industry had its reward on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire campaign were about thirty-two thousand killed , wounded , and missing ; and he gives the loss of the opposing forces during the same period as about thirty-five thousand . This most interesting and successful campaign can not be described in detail within the space at our command . It should be studied in the accounts which the two great commanders have given of it . These accounts tally very closely , which is not surprising , for each commander is a man of sense , capaciand integrity . Johnston is conspicuous among Southern // officers for his candor , and his readiness to do justice to the soldiers of the North . Moreover , Sherman quotes Johnston 's narrative , and thus shows that he has had the means of verifying his own recollections , and correcting them , if necessary , and supplementing them , from his adversary 's material . The points of resemblance and difference between the Virginia and Georgia campaigns of 1864 are so many and so marked , that one is strongly tempted to make the comparison , and , with Sherm*n 's Memoirs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Eastern and Western armies and their commanders . But when we find that , typical Western man as Sherman is , he never says one word in disparagement , direct or indirect , of Eastern troops and their performances , it seems that it would be ungracious to introduce such a discussion into a review of his Memoirs . In this connection , it is well to remind the reader of his promotion of Howard , an Eastern man , to the place made vacant by the death of McPherson , instead of either of those Westerns of the Westerns , Logan and Blair , and to notice the cordial language of his special field orders , announcing to his army the surrender of Lee : " Glory to God and our country , and all honor to our comrades in arms , toward whom we are marching . " If he said , as he did , that his army was , in his judgment , the most magnificent army in existence , he had a right to say it ; for he said it , not , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but after he had led them to victory and we of the East may echo his praises , not only with the national pride of Americans , but with a local pride besides , for more than one seventh of his regiments were from the East . And before leaving this matter of the recognition of soldierly merits wherever he found them , it may be remarked , that this great graduate of West Point and soldier of the Regular Army not only sets no limits to his praises of his volunteer rank and file , but says : " At the close of our civil war , lasting four years , some of our best corps and division generals , as well as staff officers , were from civil life . " With the capture of Atlanta we reach the end of the first third of the second volume . What remains is not less interesting , but less important ; for though many months of hard work were still before the armies of the West and of the East , // the Confederacy was becoming every day more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gettysburg and surrender of Vickshurg marked the turning-point of the Rebellion . The Army of Northern Virginia died harder than the Southern armies of the West . Missionary Ridge and Atlanta showed that they were declining in force , if not in valor , and Sherman 's sword had little work to do after his army entered Atlanta . Till near the end of October , he was occupied in the pursuit of Hood , who was aiming to get upon his communications . The priiicipal event of this time , and one full of dramatic interest , was Corse 's famous defence of Allatoona . The pursuit was continued until the armies reached the northwestern corner of Georgia , within twenty-five miles of Chattanooga , and then Hood drew off to the Southwest , and Sherman had no more to do with him directly . The pursuit ceased on the arrival of Sherman 's army at Gaylesville , between the 21st and 28th of October . At this time , he finally resolved on his future course , " which was to leave Hood to be encountered by General Thomas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ project of marching for the sea-coast , and thence to operate towards Richmond . " This is the language of the Memoirs . In his despatches of the period he uses more characteristic language , and speaks of his intention to " make Georgia howl , " and to move through Georgia , " smashing things to the sea . " He seems to us to make it quite clear that he originated this plan . He gives ( II . 166 ) a letter of General Grant , which proves that that was his view in December , 1864 ; and he asserts that , in his opinion , General Grant has never thought or said that he himself was the projector of the march . Indeed , the documents which he prints seem to show incontestably that Thomas , Grant , and Mr. Lincoln all disapproved the plan , or were anxious and fearful as to its wisdom . He prepared with his usual thoronghness for the execution of his plan . The leading features of his preparation were the assignment to Thomas of a force ample to enable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rear the immense stores which had accumulated at Atlanta and along the railroad , the destruction of everything in the part of Georgia which he controlled which could be of military use to the enemy , and the // putting his own army into perfect marching order . On the 12th of November , the last trains went to the rear , a bridge was burnt and a telegraph-wire severed , and all communication with the rear ceased forthwith . The army which made the march to the sea was divided into two wings , the right commanded by General Howard and the left by General Slocum , and composed of the Fifteenth Corps of four divisions , the Fourteenth , Seventeenth , and the Twentieth Corps , each of three divisions , and of Kilpatrick 's cavalry . Its strength was a little over sixty thousand men of the three arms , - " able-bodied , experienced soldiers , well armed , well equipped , and provided , as far as human foresight could , with all the essentials of life , strength , and vigorous action . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ famous march . Though the story is most interesting , its interest is not strictly military . Much of the fighting force of the Western Army of the South was destroyed , and most of what was left had gone to seek better and find worse fortune in Tennessee . Sherman had organized and trained an army which , then and there , was simply resistless . Tie says himself that he was never , in all his marching through Georgia from Atlanta , forced to use anything but a skirmish line , and that he regarded the march " as the transfer of a strong army , which had no opponent , and had finished its then work , from the interior to a point on the sea-coast , from which it could achieve other important results . " His clear eyes were not blinded . He saw that there was no difficulty in the execution of his plan , and he speaks very modestly of the whole matter , but the enterprise has impressed powerfully the imagination of the public , and he has , as he deserves to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To leave space for a few closing remarks of a general character , we must pass rapidly over the capture of Savannah , the famous " Christmas gift , " - the triumphant march northward through the Carolinas , with the two sharp actions of Averysboro ' and Bentonsyille , neither of them general actions , and the latter not well fought by Sherman , - the surrender of Johnston , - and the Grand Review , in which " for six hours and a half that strong tread of the Army of the West resounded along Pennsylvania Avenue . " // The Memoirs close with a chapter 0n the Military Lessons of the War , which is full of the valuable results of enlightened observation , digested with trained sagacity . It is altogether admirable and instructive , and deserves and will reward the most attentive perusal . One of the most original opinions which it expresses is that sanitary commissions and similar organizations should limit their operations to the hospitals at the rear , and never appear at the front . For this opinion he gives strong reasons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hospital and ambulance arrangements at the front are what they ought to be . His definition of courage is so good that we reproduce it : " I would define true courage to be a perfect sensibility of the measure of danger , and a mental willingness to incur it , rather than that insensibility to danger of which I have heard far more than I have seen I would further illustrate my meaning by describing a man of true courage to be one who possesses all his faculties and senses perfectly when serious danger is actually present . " He dreaded Washington , and " the influences that poison a political capital , " as he shows in a letter written to Grant in March , 1861 , in which he says , " For God 's sake arid for your country 's sake , come out of Washington , " and in his strong remarks upon the torture to Mr. Lincoln of the suspicions suggested to him by the politicians who surrounded him . He confesses to " a kindly feeling of respect for the negroes , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found them faithful and white men faithless ; but he did not think it an attitude becoming the North which would permit the Rebels to say that we had to call on their slaves to help us to subdue them . He thought , and truly , that under the system of enlistment we pursued , the enlistment of every black man did not strengthen the army , but took away one white man from the ranks , and he was ashamed of it , as all of us ought to have been . It is probable that the system of foraging was developed under Sherman to a degree scarcely known before in civilized war . It went so far , that once , when the army approached the South Carolina Railroad , and deployments were in progress in expectation of severe resistance and serious battle , " a parcel // of our foragers , in search of plunder , got ahead and actually captured the road , a line of vital importance to the Rebel government . " This reads pleasantly , and all s well that ends well ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the part of troops might not be practically inconsistent with that control of the army as one great machine which is commonly considered essential to success , and whether it does not show a lack of discipline that might have been attended with serious results . The Memoirs of a man who was closely connected with our war from the beginning to the end , and who held high command for the last eighteen months of it , must necessarily contain some praise and blame ; but when the reader has finished the book , and pauses to ask himself how much there is of each , he is surprised to find that there is very little . The truth is , that Sherman 's Memoirs , like himself , are very business-like , and he l*eeps going straight forward . He saw clearly whether work was well done or ill , and he states the facts . He is little given to panegyric , still less to invective . With all the plainness of his disapproval , when he has any to express , he very rarely imputes any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highest that he pays : " Of all the men I ever met , he seemed to possess more of the elements of greatness , combined with goodness , than any other . " There is a story current that General Grant recently said that he had always supposed he had something to do with the campaigns in the West until he read Sherman 's book . The story can hardly be true ; but , if it is , the remark is curiously unfounded . Sherman says : " The campaign of Yicksburg , in its conception and execution , belonged exclusively to General Grant , not only in the great whole , but in the thousands of its details . " As for Chattanooga , Sherman speaks very modestly of the part he played there ; and as for the Georgia campaign , it was managed by Sherman alone , after Grant 's departure for the East . Of Buell , Halleck , McClernand , and Thomas his mention is sometimes favorable and sometimes not , while even the favorite McPherson , on one occasion , " seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Porter , Gorse , Hazen , and others of less note , he always speaks highly , while the good opinion he formed of // Howard is a surprise , and that of Kilpatrick an inscrutable enigma to the men who serv ? d with those officers in the East . lie found Hooker as unsatisfactory a lieutenant as might have been expected , and got rid of him at the first favorable opportunity . He has no praise to bestow on Burnside , and nothing but blame for IRosecrans ; and when any of his generals get " bewildered , " or do not obey orders or fulfil their promises , or display folly , he does not hesitate to say so . His wrath and indignation at the treatment he received from Mr. Stanton at the time of his negotiations with General Johnston are as hot and fresh as if the events were recent , and we confess we do not wonder . The arrogance and injustice of Mr. Stanton were monstrous and exasperating , and the manner in which he used the press to exhibit to the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reprimanded subordinate was unendurable . Such conduct should be stigmatized as it deserves wherever it is recorded in history , and we are glad , for our part , that Sherman has not hesitated to say his say upon the , subject . We wish we could find reason to be as well satisfied with his mention of Thomas . It is always friendly , but it does not seem to us cordial or enthusiastic to the degree which his magnificent victory at Nashville , the most thoroughly successful battle of the war , deserves . Sherman 's descriptions of battles do not lend his Memoirs any peculiar charm . They are very well , and they sometimes contain artistic touches , but they are brief and simple . We look in vain in his pages for the fascination that abounds in Napier , and finds its finest expression in the thrilling account of the battle of Albuera . Indeed , considering the length and severity of the war , and his high rank , he was not present at many pitched battles , and , great and numerous as were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Atlanta and Savannah , to the man who made the march to the sea , and who received the surrender of Johnston , ever to win a great victory . So far as it is in our power to judge , he can never have known the joy of Thomas at Nashville , of Sheridan at Cedar Creek and Fisher 's Hill , of Lee at Chancellorsville , of Grant at Chattanooga , or of Meade at Gettysburg . For a man of unquestionable capacity , of brilliant and continued success , of the largest usefulness // to his country , his career as a fighter of battles sums up curiously . A defeat at Bull Run , a defeat at Shiloh , an assault made and repulsed at Haines 's Bluffs , two assaults made and repulsed at Vicksburg , a flank attack at Chattanooga , in its immediate results very near a drawn battle , an assault made and repulsed at Kenesaw , three attacks received and repulsed with heavy loss on both sides at Peach-Tree Creek - and before Atlanta , a little success at Averysboro ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to himself at Bentonsville ,  --  these make up a fair general statement of the engagements in which he took part . As we study his military history , using his Memoirs to correct , verify , and add to what we knew before , we see reason to suspect that he does not possess in a very high degree two qualities needed to make a consummate commander . One of these is tactical genius , the other is the capacity of selecting the right subordinates , and the connected capacity of making men do just precisely what one wishes done . We seem to see the want of the first quality illustrated at Bull Run ; again , but less certainly , at Chattanooga ; again , before Atlanta , the day when McPherson was killed , when he " purposely allowed the Army of the Tennessee to fight the battle almost unaided because he knew that the attacking force could only be a part of Hood 's army , and that , if any assistance were rendered by either of the other armies , the Army of the Tennessee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Bentonsville . As examples of the other want , we may cite his failure to hold General Wool to his promise to give him arms to put down the Vigilance Committee , his failure to make Morgan obey his orders at ilaines 's Bluffs , his failure to get Resaca taken by General McPherson , his failure to make Sooy Smith accomplish anything , and his failure to get Hardee 's corps captured at Jonesboro ' . But these are matters of speculation , and there may be no real foundation for the doubts suggested . They are interesting , as everything connected with the character of one of the foremost men of the day is interesting ; but , even if they are well founded , his great fame is secured . We lay down these volumes with regret . We seem to be breathing a fresh and bracing and inspiriting atmosphere as we read them . They increase our pride in the General of our // Army and our regard for him . It is good to know him as we now know him ; to recognize the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what a clear-headed , right-minded , accomplished , faithful , successful commander has been born of our American civilization .
