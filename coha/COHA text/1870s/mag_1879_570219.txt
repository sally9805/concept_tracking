ARTICLE V.-ENGLISII FACTORY LEGISLATION . FEW subjects with which the legislator has to deal present greater difficulties than the relations of labor and capital . On the one hand he has the physical and moral well being of the laborers to consider , and , on the other , the commercial and industrial interests of the country . The principles upon which such legislation should be based are by no means settled , and each step forward has partaken more or less of the character of an experiment . In England the contest has been a severe one . The political economists have opposed legal restrictions upon the free competition of labor as wrong in theory . " If it is beneficial to have unrestricted freedom in exchanging the products of industry , " why , say they , " should not capital and labor be unfettered in their dealings with each other ? " What right has the State to intervene , and prevent the laborer from entering into such contracts as regards time and conditions of employment as are satisfactory to him ? This argument has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the condition of laborers due to factory legislation has been obtained against the combined opposition of political economists and employers . The latter have predicted , that every act passed for the protection of labor would result in the downfall of England 's industrial supremacy . As to much of the legislation , the laborers themselves were apathetic . They took little interest in efforts to improve the sanitary condition of factories , or to afford protection in dangerous or unhealthy trades . The greater the danger , the higher the wages . The laborer who could support himself upon the earnings of his wife and children , did not consider the cutting off this source of income an unmixed good . Women and children , upon whom the evils of the old system bore the heaviest , could do little to arouse public sentiment . The arguments of the capitalist and economist would be plausible if the laborer was in a condition to contract with his employer upon equal terms . But he is not . The introduction of machinery brought with it // the factory system , under which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a single roof . Production requires a large capital , often furnished by persons who know little of the wants and needs of those by whose labor they profit . Skilled labor has been to a large extent displaced by that of women and children . The processes of manufacture have been minutely subdivided , and the operative has become a part of a large and complicated structure . When the wheels start in the morning he must be in his place , and remain until the cessation of work . It is a conflict of human nerve and muscle with steam and iron . What wonder that the operative comes to regard himself as a part of a vast machine , which has absorbed his individuality , his hopes , and aspirations ? " For all day , the wheels are droning , turning , The wind comes in our faces , Till our hearts turn , our heads with pulses burning , And the walls turn in their places . " Turns the sky in the high window blank and reeling , Turns the long light that drops adown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ceiling , All are turning , all the day , and we with all . " What opportunity has the operative to protect himself ? Is he in a situation to insist that he shall be protected from dangerous machinery-that the factory shall be properly ventilated and drained-that the danger incident to unwholesome trades shall be reduced to a minimum-or , if over-work is demanded , can he resist when hundreds stand ready to take his place ? If adults are comparatively helpless under such a system , what must be the condition of children ? The cupidity of parents and employers has driven children of five and six years of age into factories , and kept them at work the same number of hours as adults . They have no protection except such as the law gives. * English legislation on the subject began in 1802 , with the passage of an act relating to the employment of apprentices in * " The factory system , " says the Duke of Argyll , " had not been many years in operation when its effects were seen . A whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mental ignorance , and of moral corruption . " // cotton factories . A violent epidemic fever raged in the neighborhood of Manchester , and many children employed in the cotton factories died . It was at once seen that the disease was the result of excessive work , poor accommodation , and overcrowding . The act required the walls of factories to be limewashed , a sufficient number of windows to be provided , arid the hours of labor fixed at twelve per day . It only applied to apprentices , and children whose parents resided in the neighborhood were not affected by its provisions . In 1819 , an act was passed applying to all children employed in cotton mills . The employment of children under nine years of age was prohibited , and those between nine and sixteen years of age were not to be employed more than twelve hours per day , exclusive of one hour and a half for meals . In 1825 , a partial holiday was given on Saturday , and penalties provided for violations of the act . In 1831 , night-work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty-one years of age . The working day for persons under eighteen , was fixed at twelve hours for every day except Saturday , when it was to be nine hours . The subject entered into and was complicated with the reform movement of the time . Wool factories had not been affected by the previous legislation , and the operatives in the wool districts demanded the restriction of nonadult labor to ten hours per day . As the manufacturers were in favor of the reform bill , the conservatives developed a strong interest in the operatives and supported their demand . The matter was considered by committees and commissions and resulted in the act of 1833 , which was a great step in advance of previous legislation . Persons under eighteen years of age , employed in cotton , wool , worsted , hemp , flax , tow , and linen spinning and weaving mills , were forbidden to work between 8.30 P. * . and 5.30 A. *. , and children between nine and thirteen years were limited to forty-eight hours per week . The most significant features of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the appointment of inspectors to enforce the law . In 1835 , the employment of women , and children under ten years of age , in underground work was prohibited . In 1844 , further provision was made for school attendance , and a distinction was made between children and young persons . // Children between eight and thirteen could be employed six and one-half hours each day , or for ten hours upon alternate days . Adult women were brought under the same regulations as young persons . In 1847 , women and young persons were restricted to ten hours per day , and the working day made from 5.30 A. M. to 8.30 * . xi . In 1864 , more industries were brought under the factory legislation , including manufactories of earthern ware , percussion caps , cartridges , lucifer matches , and paper staining . In 1867 , a distinction was made between factories and workshops . The act of that year applied to furnaces , iron and copper works , machine manufactories , metal and gutta percha factories , paper mills , glass works , printing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ establishments in which over fifty persons were employed for a period of one hundred days . During the same year an act was passed relating to workshops , and applying to small trades and handicrafts . The working day for children in workshops was fixed at from 6 A. M. to 8 * . xi. , and for young persons and women at from 5 A. xi . to 9 * . xi . Printing , bleaching , and dyeing works were brought under the general law in 1870 , and in 1871 government factories were placed under the same restrictions as those occupied by private individuals . In 1874 , the employment of children under ten years of age was prohibited in England . In May , 1878 , an act was passed entitled " An Act to consolidate and amend the Law relating to Factories and Workshops . " It amends and consolidates all previous legislation on the subject , and repeals the sixteen acts of parliament passed between 1802 and 1874 . It also amends portions of the " Sanitary Act , 1866 , " " The Public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Education Act , 1876 . " The act contains 107 sections , and appended to it are 6 schedules  --  the whole prepared with great fullness and minuteness of detail . It came into operation on the first day of January , 1879 , at which time the repeal took effect . With some exceptions , to be noted hereafter , it applies to Ireland and Scotland as well as England . It will be seen from the hasty and imperfect sketch given , that the factory legislation of England is a growth . As the evils of the old system became apparent , Parliament attempted to supply a remedy . One restriction after another was placed upon // the free competition of labor , and the measures taken for the preservation of the health of workmen kept pace with the progress of sanitary science . The principle of interference seems to us to have been carried to an extreme degree ; but the law , as it stands , is fully supported by public opinion . The act of 1878 was brought in by Mr. Cross , the Home Secretary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the House of Commons , was as to whether it should apply to the employment of adult women . A motion of Mr. Fawcett in the negative was rejected by a large majority . In view of the importance of the subject and the demand for further legislation in this country for the protection of workmen , a detailed statement will be given of the various provisions of the act . Experience has shown that laws of this kind are never enforced without a thorough system of inspection and administration ; and the general provisions of the act , and their practical effect , can be better understood after that portion relating to administration is explained . Administration , Inspection , etc. -A Secretary of State from time to time , with the approval of the Treasury as to number and salary , is to appoint such inspectors and such clerks and servants as he may think necessary for the execution of the act , and assign to them their duties and award them their salaries . He may also appoint a principal inspector with an office in London . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The salaries and other expenses incurred are to be paid out of money provided by Parliament . No person who is an occupier of a factory or workshop or is interested therein , or in any process or business carried on therein , orin any patents connected therewith , or is employed in or about a factory or workshop , is eligible as an inspector . Such annual reports of the proceedings of inspection are to be made to Parliament as the Secretary of State may from time to time determine . Every inspector is to be furnished with a certificate of his appointment which he must exhibit , if required , on applying for admission to a factory or workshop . An inspector appointed under the act has power to do all or any of the following things : // 1 . To enter , inspect , and examine at all reasonable times by day and night a factory and workshop , and every part thereof ; when he has reasonable cause to believe that any person is employed therein , and to enter by day any place which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workshop . 2 . To take with him in either case a constable into a factory in which he has reasonable cause to apprehend any serious obstruction in the execution of his duty . 3 . To require the production of the registers , certificates , notices , and documents kept in pursuance of the act , and to inspect , examine , and copy the same . 4 . To make such examination and inquiry as may be necessary to ascertain whether the enactments in force relating to public health , and the enactments of the act , are con*plied with , so far as respects the factory or workshop and the persons employed therein . 5 . To enter any school in which he has reasonable cause to believe that children employed in a factory or workshop are for the time being educated . 6 . To examine either alone or in the presence of any other person , as he thinks fit , with respect to matters under the act , every person whom he finds in a factory or workshop , or such a school as aforesaid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be , or to have been within the preceding two months , employed in a factory or workshop , *nd to require such person to be so examined and to sign a declaration of the truth of the matters respecting which he is so examined . 7 . To exercise such other powers as may be necessary for carrying the act into effect . The occupier of every factory and workshop , his agents and servants , are to furnish the means required by an inspector as necessary for an entry , inspection , examination , inquiry or other exercise of his powers under the act in relation to the factory or workshop . Every person who wilfully delays an inspector , or fails to comply with a requisition of an inspector made under the foregoing provision , or to produce any certificate or documents which he is required by the act to produce , or who conceals or prevents or attempts to conceal or prevent a child , young // person or woman from appearing before or being examined by an inspector , is deemed to obstruct an inspector in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fine not exceeding five pounds , or , where the offence was committed in the night time , . twenty pounds . Before an inspector may enter , without the consent of the occupier , any room or place actually used as a dwelling , as well as for a factory or workshop , he must on an affidavit or statutory declaration of facts or reasons obtain written authority so to do from a Secretary of State , or a warrant from a Justice of the Peace . A Justice of the Peace , if satisfied by information on oath that there is reasonable cause to believe that any enactment of the act is contravened in such room or place , may , in his discretion , grant a warrant authorizing the inspector named therein , at any time within the period named therein , not exceeding one month from date , to enter the room or place named in the warrant , and exercise therein the powers of inspection and examination conferred by the act . Provision is also made for the appointment of certifying surgeons by inspectors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The duties of such surgeons will be hereafter particularly referred to , the most important being an examination of children and young persons with reference to their fitness for employment . Definitions. - The terms factories and workshops are defined and distinguished with great care . Factories are divided into textile and non-textile . Speaking generally , the term " factory , " for the purposes of the act , includes any premises wherein steam , water , or other mechanical power is used to move or work any machinery employed in preparing , manufacturing , or finishing , or in any process incident to the manufacturing of certain goods , the character of the subject of manufacture distinguishing textile from non-textile factories . Speaking in the same general way , the term " workshop " includes any premises , room , or place ( may be in the open air ) , not being a factory within the meaning of the act , in which any manual labor is exercised by way of trade or for purposes of gain in or incidental to the making , altering , repairing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it for sale , and to which , or over which premises , room , or place , the employer of the persons working therein has the right of access or control . The expression " child " means a person under the age of fourteen years . A " young person " means a person of the age of fourteen years , and under the age of eighteen years . A " woman " means a woman of eighteen years of age and up wards . Sanitary Provisions. - The act requires factories and workshops to be kept in a cleanly state , and free from effluvia arising from any drain , privy , or other nuisance . That they shall not be so over-crowded as to be injurious to health , and that they shall be so ventilated as to render as harmless as practicable gases , vapors , dust , or other impurities generated in manufacturing . When it appears to an inspector under the act , that any act , neglect , or default in relation to any drain , water-closet , earth-closet , privy , ash-pit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , etc. , is remediable under the law relating to public health , ' he is to give notice in writing to the sanitary authority . To secure cleanliness , all the inside walls of a factory or workshop , and the ceilings , whether plastered or not , and the passages and stair-cases , if they have not been painted with oil or varnished once at least within seven years , are required to be lime-washed every fourteen months . Wherever in the process of manufacturing dust is generated to such an extent as to be injurious to workmen , and it appears to an inspector that inhalation can be prevented by the use of a fan or other mechanical means , he may require the same to be applied within a reasonable time by the occupier. * Dangerous Machinery and Accidents. - Certain portions of a mill , as hoists , fiy.wheels , wheel-races , mill-gearing , vats , etc. , are to be fenced , and wherever the machinery , by reason of its character or situation , is , in the opinion of the inspector , so dangerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one * The general provisions of the Sanitary and Public Health Acts apply to factories and workshops , and it is the duty of inspectors to see that they are enforced . // employed in the factory , he is to serve on the occupier a notice requiring him to fence the part of the machinery which he deems to be dangerous . The occupier may , by serving a requisition on the inspector within seven days of the receipt of the notice , refer the matter to arbitration . A child is not allowed to clean any part of the machinery of a factory when in motion . A young person or woman is not allowed to clean such part of the machinery as is millgearing , while the same is in motion . A child , young person , or woman is not allowed to walk between the fixed and traversing part of any self-acting machine while the same is in motion . When an accident occurs in a factory or workshop , causing loss of life or bodily injury of such a nature as to prevent the person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notice of the accident is to be forthwith sent to the inspector and certifying surgeon of the district by the occupier , stating the residence of the person killed or injured , or the place to which he may have been removed . A failure to give such notice makes the occupier liable to a fine of not less than ? 5 . When a certifying surgeon receives notice of an accident it is his duty , with the least possible delay , to proceed to the factory or workshop , and make a full investigation as to the nature or cause of the death or injury caused by the accident , and within twenty-four hours send to the inspector a report in regard to the same . All offenses under the act are to be prosecuted , and all fines recovered , on summary conviction before a court of summary jurisdiction . If a factory or workshop is not kept in conformity with the act the occupier is liable to a fine not exceeding ? 10 . The court in addition to or instead of inflicting a fine , may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept in conformity with the act , and if such order is not complied with the occupier is liable to a fine not exceeding ? 1 for every day such non-compliance continues . If any person is killed or suffers any bodily injury in consequence of the occupier having neglected to fence any machinery , etc. , required by the act to be fenced , or having neg // lected to maintain any such fence , such occupier becomes liable to a fine not exceeding ? 100 , the whole or any part of which may be applied for the benefit of the injured person or his family , or otherwise , as a Secretary of State determines . Employment and Meal Ilours. - The period of employment for young persons and women in factories is to begin at six o'clock in the morning and end at six o'clock in the evening ; or begin at seven o'clock in the morning and end at seven o'clock in the evening . Daring the day there are to be at least two hours for meals in case of a textile factory ; and one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of which one hour at least , either at the same or different times , is to be before three o'clock in the afternoon . A young person or woman is not to be employed more than four and a half hours in the one case , and five in the other , continuously , without an interval of at least half an hour for a meal . On Saturday they are to be employed only during the forenoon , with an interval of half an hour for a meal . Children are not to be employed in factories , except on the system either of employment in morning or afternoon sets , or of employment on alternate days only . A child is not to be employed in two successive periods of seven days in a morning set , nor in two successive periods of seven days in an afternoon set ; and a child is not to be employed on two successive Saturdays , nor on Saturday in any week , if on any other day in the same week his period of employment has exceeded five hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning and end at night at the same time as young persons and women . All children , young persons , and women employed in a factory or workshop are to have the time allowed for meals at the same hour of the day ( simultaneously ) , and they must not during any part of the times allowed for meals be employed in the factory or workshop , or allowed to remain in a room where any manufacturing process or handicraft is then being carried on . The occupier of a factory or workshop may fix , within the limits allowed by the act , and shall specify in a notice affixed in the factory or workshop , the period of employment , the // times allowed for meals , and whether the children are employed on the system of morning and afternoon sets , or on alternate days . A change can not be made until notice has been served on the inspector , and affixed in the factory or workshop , and shall not be made oftener than once a quarter , unless for special cause allowed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of age is not to be employed in a factory or workshop under any circumstances . Every child , young person , and woman is to be allowed as holidays  --  the whole of Christmas day , the whole of Good Friday or of the next public holiday , and in addition eight half holidays in every year ; but a whole holiday may be allowed in lieu of any two such half holidays . Half of them shall be between the 15th day of March and the first day of October . Children , young persons , and women are not allowed to take a meal , or to remain during the time allowed for meals , in certain parts of glass works , lucifer match works , and earthenware works . Notice of the prohibition is to be affixed to the factory or workshop to which it applies . Children and young persons are not to be employed in certain portions of factories and workshops where the process carried on makes it especially deleterious to health . Notice of this prohibition is also to be affixed . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of State that , by reason of special circumstances affecting any class of workshops , it is expedient for protecting the health of children and young persons employed therein he may prohibit their employment in such workshops without a certificate of fitness for such employment . Provision is made for changing the hour of employment of children , young persons , and women in certain classes of factories , etc. , where the exigencies of trade demand it ; but the sanction of a Secretary of State must be obtained and due notice given of the change . A considerable measure of discretion is vested in the Secretary of State as to the enforcement of some of the most important provisions of the act . Any orders made by him under the act must be published in the London Gazette , and can not come into operation until such pub . // ic ation . His order may be temporary or permanent , conditional or unconditional , etc . Every order made by him must , as soon as may be , be laid before both Houses of Parliament , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same ought to be annulled , the same after the date of the resolution is of no effect , without prejudice to anything done in the meantime , or to the making of any new order . Before an occupier of a factory or workshop can avail himself of any special exception under an order of the Secretary , he must serve a notice on an inspector at least seven days before the same can go into effect , and must also affix in his factory or workshop notice of his intention , which must remain affixed while he avails himself of the exception . lIe is also required to enter in a prescribed register and report to an inspector the prescribed particulars respecting the employment of a child , young person , or woman in pursuance of an exception . Education of Children. - The parent ( this term means parents or guardian of , or person having the legal custody of , or control over , or having direct benefit from the wages of a child or young person ) of a child employed in a factory or workshop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( which school may be selected by the parent ) , as follows : 1 . The child , when employed in a morning or afternoon set , shall in every week , during any part of which he is so employed , be caused to attend on each week day one attendance . 2 . The child , when employed on the alternate day system , shall on each week day preceding each day of employment be caused to attend for at least two attendances . 3 . What is to be an attendance under these provisions is to be defined by a Secretary of State with the consent of the Education Department , and be between the hours of eight in the morning and six in the evening . A child is not required to attend school on Saturday or any holiday or half holiday allowed under the act . Non-attendance to be excused when the teacher certifies that the child has been prevented from attending by sickness or other unavoidable cause , and also when the school is closed during the ordinary holidays or for any other temporary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the nearest road from the residence of the child a recognized efficient school , which the child can attend , attendance at a school temporarily approved in writing by an inspector is sufficient ; but the inspector must immediately report to the Education Department every case of the approval by him of a school under this provision . The Education Department is required by the publication of lists or notices , or otherwise , to provide for giving to all persons interested information of the schools in each school district which are recognized efficient schools . A child who has not in any week attended school for all the attendances required under the act must not be employed the following week until he has attended school for the deficient number of attendances . The occupier of a factory , etc. , in which a child is employed is required to obtain every week from the teacher a certificate ( according to the prescribed form and direction ) respecting the attendance of such child at school in accordance with the act , which certificate must be kept two mont1*is and exhibited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who manage a recognized efficient school may apply in writing to the occupier of a factory or workshop to pay a weekly sum specified in the application , not exceeding three pence and not exceeding one twelfth part of the wages of the child , and after that application the occupier , so long as he employs the child , becomes liable to pay the applicants while the child attends their school , the weekly sum , and it may be deducted from the wages payable for the services of the child . Children of thirteen years of age can be employed as young persons upon obtaining a certificate of proficiency in reading , writing , and arithmetic . The standard of proficiency is to be fixed by a Secretary of State with the consent of the Education Department . Oert*/icates of Fitness for L7mployrnent. - In a factory a child or young person under the age of sixteen years ihust not be employed for more than seven , or if the certifying surgeon of the district resides more than three miles from the factory , thirteen , work days , unless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the fitness of the child or young person for employment in that factory . The certificate must // show that the surgeon is satisfied as to the age of the child , and that he has been personally examined by him , and is not incapacitated by disease or bodily infirmity for working daily for the time allowed by law in that factory . The occupier of a workshop may obtain such a certificate , but is not required to do so . When an inspector is of opinion that a child or young person under the age of sixteen years is , by disease or bodily infirmity , incapacitated for working daily the time allowed by law in the factory or workshop in which he is employed , he may serve written notice on the occupier requiring that the employment be discontinued from the time named in the notice , not being less than one or more than seven days from the service of the notice , after which time the occupier can not continue the employment without a new certificate that the child or young person is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new certificate of fitness must be obtained . The occupier is required to produce certificates of fitness to an inspector on demand . Miscellaneous provisions-Every person must , within one month after he begins to occupy a factory , serve on an inspector a written notice containing the name of the factory , the place where it is situated , the address to which he wishes his letters addressed , the nature of the work , the nature and amount of the moving power therein , and the name of the firm under which the business of the factory is to be carried on , and in default is liable to a fine not exceeding ? 5 . Occupiers are required to keep in the prescribed form and with the prescribed particulars registers of the children and young persons employed in the factory or workshop , and of their employment , and of other matters under the act , and to send such extracts from the register to the inspector as he may require . The act prescribes that there shall be affixed at the entrance of a factory or workshop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and be constantly kept so affixed in the prescribed form , and in such position as to be easily read by the persons employed in the factory or workshop : // ( 1 . ) A prescribed abstract of the act . ( 2 . ) A notice of the name and address of the prescribed inspector . ( 3 . ) A notice of the name and address of the certifying surgeon for the district . ( 4 . ) A notice of the clock ( if any ) by which the period of employment and times for meals in the factory or worksh9p are regulated . ( 5 . ) Every notice and document required by the act to be affixed in the factory or workshop . The act applies to Scotland and Ireland , with a saving for twelve months as regards children under ten and young persons over thirteen years of age . The act will make little change in the English factory system , being for the most part a consolidation of previous legislation with such change in matters of detail as experience has suggested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the working of the act from the repoits made to Parliament from time to time by the inspectors previous to January 1 , 1879 . All proper means are used to detect and suppress violations of the law , but no attempt is made to exact a large sum by way of fines and penalties . One of the ablest and most experienced inspectors says in a report : " We are happy to have the law kept by warnings when warnings are sufficient ; but we are bound to enforce it when remonstrances have failed . I rejoice when the opportunity is afforded me of passing by transgressions ; but I can not forget that the Factory Acts were enacted for the benefit of both masters and workers , and that it is our duty to hold an even hand between those that are willing to obey the law , and those who seek undue advantages by disobeying it . " Of 367 prosecutions instituted in one division during six months , 45 were for employing children without proof of physical fitness ; 4 for employment amongst dangerous machinery ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workers being children of tender years ) ; 65 for employment of children by masters without proof of attendance at school ; 72 for employment of children by parents without proof of attendance at school ; 6 for employment during meal hours ; 14 for employing children forenoon and afternoon during the same day ; 46 for // employing workers after 6 P. M. ; 61 for employing children more than 6j hours per day ; 14 for employment after 4 * . M. on Saturday ; 4 for employment after 8 P. M. on Saturday , and 1 for employing a child under eight years of age . Of these only 8 were dismissed , but a considerable number were withdrawn upon payment of costs and a promise to respect the law in future . It will be noticed that most of the violations are connected with the employment of children . Masters and parents join in attempts to evade the law , and adopt numerous devices to escape detection and conviction . The inspectors report , that " it is often next to impossible to obtain a repetition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prosecutor , if it seems at all likely to reduce their wages from full time to those of half time . " It has already been stated , that a motion by Mr. Fawcett excepting adult women from the provisions of the act met little favor in the House of Commons . On the other hand , a strong sentiment is growing up in favor of further restrictions upon the labor of married women , and it is proposed to class them with children sq far as employment in factories is concerned . As it is , a great deterioration is going on in the health and physical and moral condition of wives and mothers - infants and children suffer from the lack of maternal care and nursing  --  the ordinary duties of a housewife are not attended to , and home ceases to be attractive to husband or children . This state of things will continue as long as married women are allowed to be employed full time .
