txt We publish in another column some suggestions from a correspondent , who has had vouch experience in practical steam-boat management . and in yachting , upon the important subject of avoiding collisions at sea , which seem to us the most sensible that have yet appeared . Our correspondent starts from the wellknown fact that the avoiding a threatened collision at sea is always a " matter of seconds . " As a consequence , the arrangement of the steering apparatus and of the lookout is of vital consequence to the safety of ship and passengers . The ancient mode of steering sailing-ships and ofcouveying alarm was for the lookout on the hews to pass word to the officer of the deck , and he to the helmsman at the stern . This did well enough , perhaps , for the old sailingships , and in days or localities where there was but little danger of collision . But in our river and coast steam navigation , such a system would never do . Fancy , as Mr. SCHUYLER says , a Sound steamer starting up East @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amidships , and the helmsman astern . She would hardly avoid the first ferry-boat , for the few seconds necessary to pass the orders astern would often make the difference between collision and the passing around ; then in the sudden turns of the tide in Hell Gate , for a pilot to telegraph a distance of three hundred feet to the steersman would often be certain disaster . He must be himself forward , and , as it were , have his hands on the helm . A single quick and slight turn , such as might have been made in the " fatal ten seconds " which wrecked the Vile du Havre , will save from ruin or destructive collision . Still more , when such a long , unwieldy steamer gets out in the narrow waters of the Sound , where innumerable sail are crossing its bows in every direction , and it still , through fog and . night , must plow on with tremendous and unslackened speed , is a rapid steering arrangement needed . When one thinks of the fleets of vessels which sail continually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along our coast , and of the enormous steam-boats always driving thrsugh them in night and day , one eau only wonder at the comparatively few collisions which take place among them  --  the chances and the dangers being a hundredfold greater than on the open Atlantic . The causes of the comparative safety of these coast voyages from collision we believe to be , as our correspondent so well states , our peculiar method of steering , and the trained skill of the pilots . In the very front of our steam-boats , as every one knows , - there is a box where the pilot is placed , protected from weather , so that his faculties can have their best play , with the helmsman by side steering by wheel and chain connecting with the stern . There he stays in the dark night and fog , peering out into the darkness , every faculty ' strained , and knowing just what to do at the first and . sudden appearance of a sail , coming out of the fog close ahead . He is trained to reckon on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do ; be himself is cool and collected ; he holds his hand on the rudder , as it were ; there is no telegraphing ; he does not depend on the lookout at the bows , nor is he obliged to report to the officer of the deck amidships . He knows that safety or ruin is a " matter of seconds , " and he acts accordingly , and has all his machinery to help him to act with this promptness . The                     @x txt result is that , meeting as he does more dangers of collision in a single trip to Fall River , or Albany , or Charleston , than ocean steamers would in a year , . he . hardly ever suffers his vessel to collide with any other . Now ? our ocean steamers , which , as is well known , are immense and unwieldy machines , have kept up in their traditions the old methods of steering belonging to sailing ships . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the steersmen astern , guided by telegraph from the centre of the ship . A steamer like the Vile da Havre , as our correspondent states , going at her usual speed , paws half her length , or 200 feet in ten seconds . Ten secoads of delay will ruin her . How easily may those ten seconds be lost in communicating th ? ouili the ' hut hundred feet from the lookout on the bows to the helmsman at the stern . If it be said that a pilot-house forward is liable to be swept away by Atlantic storms , or the chains be broken which connect it with the rudder , the reply is obvious , that every steamer could have . her low sternhouse , and her men at the wheel as well , but only in this way , a double provision for safety . It would only be once in many voyages that a pilot-house would be liable to be swept away , and then the ship could fall back on the old modes of steering , and take her chance of collision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endure as heavy storms as ever sweep over the open ocean . Then , with the steering apparatus forward , why should not these valuable steamers afford a trained pilot for thick weather , or even a pair of them ? The expense would be more than repaid by increased safety and reduced insurance . Steering a great . ship is a profession by itself . We pay it liberally on our rivers and sounds . Why should not the profitable ocean steamer companies equally pay good salaries and secure skilled and trained pilots ? With these improvements , aye see not why ocean traveling should not be as safe from collision as our river and coast voyaging.
