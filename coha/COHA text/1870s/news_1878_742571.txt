txt The last report of the Commissioner of Agriculture is a remarkable document , which has by no means attracted the attention it deserves . We propose to do something toward making amends for the general neglect and rescuing this extraordinary production from the oblivion into which it seems to be sinking . The Department of Agriculture , since its first ' organization , has had the faculty of attracting to itself Commissioners with an eminent capacity for making themselves ridiculous . Whether this is due to the effect upon their mental organizations of a too close communion with pumpkins and cabbages , or to a belief entertained by successive Presidents that the Agricultural Department is a sort of " side show , " which may be bestowed upon any inconvenient applicant with more influence than capacity , we leave to philosophers to determine ; the fact is historical . That the intellectual NEWTON and the flowery WATTS have found a worthy successor in the comprehensive LE Due ' is evident from a perusal of this report . LE Due , be it known , is no mere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind above pumpkin-seeds and onions , and soars airily into the realms of statesmanship and political economy . He has ascertained , it appears , from a deep study of the reports of the - Bureau of Statistics that this country imports no less than $236,205,981 worth of foreign agricultural productions , all of which might , could , would , or should be produced iiithe United States . All of this vast sum , ho declares , " could and should be saved to our people . " It is plain that the writings of the late Dr. ADAM SMITH and his followers have not brought the sturdy.intellect of Commissioner IA Due under their enervating influence . Ho spurns the platitudes of the economists , and does not hesitate to announce his belief that every dollar paid for foreign productions which he has , persuaded himself ' might be raised in this country is a dead loss . He takes no stock in the puerile notion- of the book men that it is to the advantage of each country to devote its industry to those productions which it can raise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly or indirectly , with other countries for those productions which they can produce to most advantage . We must produce everything ourselves , declares the Commissioner , in effect , so that " the millions of gold paid to foreign nations " may be " saved to our people . " He is uncommonly severe on the exportation of gold for commodities , especially when it " finds its way into the coffers of British merchants . " The-ghost of the old mercantile theory which received its death-blow in the days of ADAM SMITH is evidently stalking about the halls of the Department of Agriculture and vexing the mind of the worthy Commissioner . If he could but take his mind from the fascinating reports of the Statistical Bureau long enough to read some easy elementary work on political economy , he might learn that , in the opinion of the economists at least , gold and silver are not the only true wealth after all , and that they are valuable to a nation only as they enable it to command the objects of desire . The catalogue of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , be it remembered , he declares that this country might produce:is interesting , as showing the comprehensive charac ter of his mind and the lengths to which he - Proposes to push American industry . to snv nothing of the strain to which he would subject our soil and climate . - It embraces Peruvian bark , cork bark , coffee , tea , indigo , madder , eggs , jute , sugar , palm-leaf , silk , wines , lemons , raisins , almonds , and " all other fruits and nuts . " It is to be regretted ' that the Commissioner does not tell us precisely how this somewhat diverse list of productions is to be made to flourish upon our soil . ' It would be interesting to know , for instance , just what plan ho has in mind for stimulating the ambition and fecundity of our native-born hens so that the $630,393 paid for the oviparous efforts of foreign fowls might be " saved to our people . " The country would be glad to know , too , how to go to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to transfer their unreasonable liking for other climes to the free but uncongenial air of the great Republic . We can not expect everything , however , even from a Commissioner of Agriculture , and we ought to be thankful , perhaps , that Mr. LE Due has concentrated his whole intellect on the question of the native production of sugar and tea . " The sugar-interest of the country , " he declares in language of great emphasis and beauty , " reaches every cupboard in our broad land . " To this extent we agree with him , but when he predicts that by raising our own sugar " the perpetual flow of American gold to countries with which we have comparatively no trade will be arrested , specie resumption will be assured , confidence restored , and the material prosperity of the country will advance with renewed energy and power , " wo may be permitted to doubt whether he has not given his soaring imagination a little too much tether . A carping disposition might also suggest a doubt whether a man without any special knowledge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months ' occupancy of the chair of the Commissioner of Agriculture , to turn the whole current of American agriculture into new channels , or to give instruction to men who have devoted their lives to special classes of production . The statesmanlike breadth and grasp of the Commissioner 's mind are well-illustratedby the fact that , as a mere incident of the sugar question , lie recommends that the General Government shall forthwith rebuild the levees of the Mississippi River , and that the sugar industry be further " protected and encouraged " by a higher tariff . Another hobby of the enterprising Commissioner , which has been paraded in the press considerably of late , is the culture of the tea-plant . He derives considerable encouragement from the fact that sundry persons in ' the South have availed themselves of his offer to distribute tea-phi-its at the public expense , and felicitates the public on the " possibility of saving to our country nineteen or twenty millions of coin which annually finds its way into the coffers of 13ritish merchants . " Indeed , report says that he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Statistician of the department ? an'old and valuable officer ? in consequence of his expressing a doubt as to the success of the Commissioners efforts to stimulate the culture of what the latter beautifully terms " the fragrant herb . " Ile leaves noroom for doubt that by a judicious system of " encouragement " and " protection " against the pauper-labor of Chum , tea might be produced on our own soil , ( at a cost of , say , $5 a pound , ) which would make the pagan Chinaman fairly rend his pig-tail in impotent rage . Praiseworthy and patriotic as these various efforts to stimulate American industry and credulity are , we can not repress the thought that the Commissioner 's mind is of too broad a east to be pent up in the narrow confines of the Department of Agriculture . The fact is apparent that he is too much of a statesman and too little of a farmer for the humble and prosaic duties of an Agricultural Commissioner . The friendship of a President 's Private Secretary is doubtless a great qualification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ask for any other ; but it would have been fortunate if it had been accompanied by a little practical sense and some scanty knowledge of agriculture .
