APRIL , 1873 . AN HOUR AMONG THE ( ; REENBAckS . Ov the amount of labor requisite to issue arid redeem the vast volume of the paper currency of the United States , few persons , not connected with Qe Treasury , have any conception . Most people are satisfied if they can obtain enough of it , in the shape of " greenbacks " or " stamps , " to meet the daily requisitions upon their wallets , without puzzling their brains to learn in what manner it was originally issued or will be ultimately redeemed . But there are some practical and inquiring minds , whose believing is based upon nothing less than actual seeing . Being perVOL . V.-43 suaded that our reader is the possessor of a mental organization of that kind , we invite him to devote a leisure hour to making with us the rounds of the Treasurer 's Office at Washington , and learning by personal observation how m.oney is there made and destroyed . It is necessary , first of all , to obtain the Treasurer 's permission to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and no surly door-keeper requires our card , business , and position as pre-requisites to admission . The bluff old General is a true Vor* . V. No. 6. // democrat , whose right to that title dates back to the days of Andrew Jackson , and , like that old hero , he despises everything which savors of exclusiveness . So we at once enter into the Treasurer 's presence without any preliminary formality , and are quite sure to find him busily engaged at his desk . Very probably he is occupied in constructing specimens of that mysterious signature which ornaments all our paper money , and is to most men a riddle more unsolvable than any that the Sphinx ever propounded . Translated , it is F. E. Spinner . We observe that the pen with which it is written is of peculiar ' construction , and has three points , and that the ink used has the thickness and consistency of mud and the blackness of Egyptian darkness , and is " piled up " on the paper to a height of which we would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having been seen , renders us more ink-credulous still . This delightful quality in the ink , the messenger informs us , is produced by long exposure to the atmosphere in an open vessel ; to be accurate , in an old pitcher with a broken nose . It is astonishing , we are further told , to note the number of people , principally from the country districts , who stray into the Treasurer 's room during the course of a year for the purpose of shaking hands with " the man who makes that funny signature , " and of looking wonderingly on to see . how he makes it . We are quite sure to be affably received , unless some circumstance of an unusually disturbing nature has occurred , for " the General , " as he is familiarly called , notwithstanding his reputation for the use of strong words , is really a man of uncommon good-nature . Even when provoked to one of his ebullitions of righteous wrath , his bark is proverbially worse than his bite , and the goodness of his heart usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lenity of action . So it happens that applicants for favors at his hands are sometimes told by their friends , who know the old gentleman 's peculiarities , that it is a favorable circumstance that on the first presentation of their cases they have been roundly scolded , since the chances are , that after the first heat of temper has cooled , penitence for undue harshness will lead him on second consideration to grant their requests . Not even the General 's most ardent admirers  --  and no man has more - will claim that he is a handsome man . And even should they have the hardihood to do so , the vignette on certain fifty-cent notes , of which there are many still in circulation , would furnish a complete refutation of their assertion . But , to be fair , the shin-plasters do not do him justice . There is an expression of honesty and openness of nature about his homely features , and a twinkle of humor in the eye , which the artist has failed to reproduce , and which render the face , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A grizzly mustache , cut unreasonably short at the corners of the mouth , does not help to supply the lack of beauty in the features . The *wide , determined mouth , and the square , heavy chin , suggest the irreverent idea that personal appearance , no less than watchful care , of the nation 's treasure may have led to the bestowal of the sobriquet of " Watch-dog of the Treasury , " by which the faithful Treasurer is so well known . The room is of moderate size and plainly furnished , and gives evidence that of the vast amount of money which has passed through his office , but little has been used to minister to the Treasurer 's comfort . A door opens into a still smaller apartment in which the Treasurer sleeps . The responsibility of the safe-keeping of hundreds of millions is too great to be devolved upon others , and the General therefore rests where he can in a moment asstire himself that the public treasure in his keeping is safe . Once , before he began sleeping at the Treasury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impression that something was wrong at the Department . He lay for a long time tossing uneasily on his bed , and trying to close his eyes and convince himself that it was a mere freak of an over-taxed brain ; but it would not be driven away . At last , about two o'clock in the morning , in order to assure himself that his impression was at fault , he arose , hastily dressed , and set out for the Treasury . On his way he met a watchman from the Depart . ment , hastening to arouse him with the information that the door of one of the vaults had just been found standing wide open . A careless clerk , whose duty it was to close and lock the door , had failed to perform his duty that night , and the watchman on going his rounds / had discovered the neglect . Since that night the Treasurer has inspected the doors and locks of the vaults himself , and has satisfied himself , by attempting to turn the handles , that they are securely locked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ departure of the clerks , and again before retiring to rest . There are few public officers whose sense of duty and responsibility constrains them to thus sacrifice their own time and comfort in the interest of the government . The moneyed responsibility // is indeed tremendous , and such , we venture to assert , as never fell on the shoulders of one man before . That we do not exaggerate is evidenced by the fact that the notes , bonds , and securities in the vaults of the Treasurer 's office amount on an average to eight hundred million dollars . But we are tarrying too long in the General 's room , as the flight of time and the increasing pile of papers on his table awaiting signature remind us . So , having received a courteous permission to inspect the various branches of the office , and secured the services of a clerk as a guide , we bow ourselves out of the room . In order to begin at the beginning of the various stages through which the currency passes in the Treasurer 's office , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which the new currency is received directly from the printers and counted before being placed in the vaults of the Treasury . The rustle of the new , crisp notes greets our ears as we open the door , and , passing in , we find ourselves in a long , well-lighted room , in which . are some thirty or forty women , each sitting at a table counting notes . The things which most impress us at first are the wonderful rapidity with which , the notes pass . under the nimble fingers of the counters , and the machine-like constancy with which the work is maintained . Years of experience have made the counters who have been longest employed marvelously expert and almost infallible , their fingers passing from one note to another with the celerity and regularity of some wonderful machine . The lady who sits nearest to the chief of the room , and who has come to be considered a sort of assistant to him , having sometimes performed his duties during his absence , has been engaged in the division ever since its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accuracy and dexterity in counting . On many occasions she has counted fifty thousand notes in one day . As the nominal hours of labor are from nine to three o'clock , and as at least half an hour must be deducted from this fornecessary interruptions and for lunch , the time occupied in counting these fifty thousand notes was five and a half hours . This is at the rate of nine thousand and ninety notes every hour , one hundred and fifty every minute , and two and a half every second ! The lady informs us that it is no unusual feat for her to " pick up " a bundle containing four thousand legal-tender notes in twenty minutes ! We doubt whether this can be excelled . If any gentleman thinks it can , let him try the experiment of simply tapping his finger on a table at the above rate , and we l ) redict that at the end of half an hour 's trial he will change his mind . There are other ladies who are almost as rapid and accurate . They are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ redemption division ( which we shall visit presently ) , to visit other cities , when the rreasury offices in those places are to be examined , and to assist in counting the government funds there . Through this division and under these skillful fingers has passed every note , wl*ther legal-tender or fractional , which has been issued by the United States since the beginning of the rebellion ,  --  every note which we have ever handled or seen ,  --  as well as all the gold-notes , and many millions of imperfect bonds and ndtes which were never put in circulation . The total value of the money which had been counted in this division previously to the first day of July , 1872 , was , according to the Treasurer 's last annual report , nearly two thousand nine hundred million dollars ,  --  more than two hundred and twenty-three millions of which consisted of postal and fractional currency . Just now , the counters find full employment in counting new legal-tender and fractional notes . The notes , after having been counted , are COUNTING NEW GREENBACICS. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrappers , and the fractional currency in stout paper boxes ,  --  sealed , placed in a capacious hand-cart , and trundled away to the v4ults of the cash division , whither we will now follow them . Passing through the cashier 's office , which adjoins it , we find ourselves in the magnificent new marble cash-room ( so called until some kind philologist shall invent or suggest a more appropriate and euphonious name ) . In this room , then in an incomplete condition , the inaugural ball of 1869 was held . We hazard nothing in saying that it is the most costly and magnificent room of the kind , and for the purpose for which it is used , in the United States , probabfy in the world . It is seventy-two feet long , thirty-two feet wide , and twenty-seven feet six inches high , and its walls , from floor to ceiling ( excepting the upper cornice ) , are entirely of marble , no less than seven of the most beautiful varieties of which have been used in its construction . It extends upward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and therefore has two rows of windows . As a consequence , it was necessary to finish it in two stories . The base of the stylobate of the first story is black Vermont marble , the mouldings Bardiglio Italian , the styles dove Vermont , the panels Sienna Italian , and the dies Tennessee . Above the stylobate the styles are of Sienna marble , to the light strawcolor of which the beautiful Corinthian pilasters and cornice of white-veined Italian marble form a pleasing contrast . Opposite the windows , and in corresponding positions at the ends of the room , are inserted panels of the dark-veined Bardiglio Italian , of the same size as the windows . A narrow gallery , protected by a bronze railing of a very graceful pattern , runs around the room at the top of the cornice of the first story , from which visitors may at all times inspect the room and its occupants without fear of molesting or molestation. rhe stylobate , and the styles and pilasters above the stylobate of the second story , are of the same varieties of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ panels are of Sarrangolum marble from the Pyrenees . This latter is a rare marble , of peculiar appearance , and the panels at a little distance bear as strong a resemblance to huge slices of raw beef , a little the worse for age , as can well be imagined . A closer inspection , however , develops rare beauties in color and in the configuration of the veins , in which an active imagination will discover faces , landscapes , mountains , cataracts , and rivers . The pilasters of the second story are not pure in style like those of the first , but are composite . They support a cornice , not of marble , as one would expect from the general design of the room , but of plaster of Paris , of fantastic . design and richly gilded . The bean*s of the ceiling , which are quite heavy , and cross each other at right angles , are also finished in plaster of Paris and gilt . This cheap and tawdry ornamentation , so out of keeping with the general character of the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that the architect has permitted his desire to exhibit in one room specimens of the most rare and striking varieties of marble , to mislead his taste for unity of design and harmony of color . An elegant counter of various kinds of marble ,  --  surmounted by a partition of mahogany and plate glass ,  --  over which checks , drafts , notes , coupons , and interest are paid and deposits received , protects the treasure from the " great unwashed . " Passing through the cash-room , we come , at the end opposite to the cashier 's office , to a room of the same size as his , the greater portion of which is occupied by a ponderous iron vault with great double doors . On each of these doors are two burglar-proof locks of the best construction , each set on a combination different from the rest . But three or four persons know any of these combinations , and no one knows the combinations to the locks on both doors , so that they can not be improperly opened except by collusion between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vault is the grand reservoir upon which our good Uncle draws whenever he is in need of funds . Here is packed away for safe-keeping the money which is not needed for present use , and the longer it is kept the better it becomes ; for currency , like wine , improves in quality with age , the paper becoming seasoned , and the ink dry and hard and less liable to be rubbed off or blurred by handling . A large portion of this currency has never been technically placed in the Treasury and charged to the Treasurer on the books of the Department , but , although perfect and ready for use , remains simply so much printed matter until needed to be issued , when , presto ! an entry on the book converts xVhat was before but valueless paper into dollars and cents . Its want of value , however , is but a fiction of the accounts , for should some rogue get his hands on it and attempt to put it into circulation , no one to whom he should pass it would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // terious transmogrification from paper into money . Passing into the ponderous jaws of the vault , we find ourselves surrounded on every side by all the various kinds of money which the ingenuity of Congress and of successive secretaries of varying views has devised . Legal-tender notes , compound interest notes , five per cent . notes , seven-thirty notes , national hank notes , gold notes , three per cent . notes , fractional notes , and postage currency confront us at every turn . The coml ) artlnents of the safe failing to furnish accommodations for them all , they are piled up in great heaps on the floor , apparently with no more care than potatoes or wheat . And yet the value of every pile and package is known , and the slightest loss would be speedily discovered . Four hundred millions of dollars , the vault clerk informs us , are contained in this vault . No wonder , we exclaim , that the I'reasurer feels anxious for its safety . The sides of the vault are divided into compartments , cubic in form and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is numbered , so that its contents can be registered in a book , and is provided with a fastening to which a leaden seal can be affixed . A cubical package , measuring about nine inches in each direction , is tossed to us with the remark that it contains four million dollars in legal-tender notes . Four million dollars ! and to think that for one-hundredth , nay , one-thousandth part of the value contained in this packet , which an infant could hold in its hands , men have toiled and delved through long years of suffering and self-denial , have robbed and murdered , have committed every conceivable wickedness , have endangered and sacrificed their lives and bartered their immortal souls ! Just a step from the door of the vault is an elevator communicating with the room of the agent of Adams Express Company , on the basement floor beneath . The motive power is Potomac water from the water mains . Two iron pistons about eight inches in diameter attached to the elevator platform , one on each side , move easily but tightly up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE NEW CASH ROOM , TREASURY DEPARTMENT . // slight turn of a handle admits the water into the cylinders beneath the pistons , which are forced up by the pressure and with them the elevator . A reverse movement of the handle permits the water to escape from the cylinders , and the elevator instantly descends . Its movements are almost noiseless , and the ease with which it is operated is remarkable . Just as we emerge from the vault the elevator descends , laden with a great pile of packages , securely put up , containing legal-tender notes and fractional currency . some of these packages are addressed to banks , railroad and manufacturing companies and others , who need small currency for their daily disburseinents and for their customers , and whose orders , accompanied by remittances for the amounts desired , came in by this morning 's mail . Others are addressed to the assistant treasurers and depositaries of the United States , to be used in the government disbursements . Perhaps one of them has telegraphed that an unexpected demand has been made upon him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a remittance has been prepared with all haste , that it may reach him at . the earliest possible moment and save the government paper , drawn on him , from protest . Sometimes during the war it happened that the Treasury was not able to respond as promptly as now to requests of this kind . We have been told that this was the case several times with the urgent requests of the assistant treasurer at Boston . And did the government paper go to protest ? Not a bit of it . One of the national banks of that noble city , representing the solid men of Boston , came to the rescue and proffered the embarrassed assistant treasurer every dollar which it could spare for the use of the government in its need , freely and without price , until sufficient funds could be sent from elsewhere . Much of the money contained in the packages which we see on the elevator is going out to replace that whichThas been retired and has been brought to Washington for destruction and exchange for new . The new currency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the government , . which accounts for the location of the office of its agent in the Treasury building . This arrangement is mutually advantageous ; to the Express Company , because it has the monopoly of the vast money transportation business of the government ; and to the government , because the rates under the contract are much lower than those which it would otherwise have been compelled to pay , being but twenty-five cents for each thousand dollars transported between any two points on the lines of Adams Express Company , and sixty cents for the same amount between a point on the lines of Adams Express Company and a point on the lines of another express company ,  --  or from one-fortieth to onesixteenth of one per cent . Having followed the new currency through the Treasury from its receipt from the printer to its delivery to the express compa*iy , by which it will be speedily borne away to places where it will be put into circulation , let us now repair to the redemption division , on the basement floor , and see in what condition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspecting return home again . Very much in the condition of the prodigal son , we shall flnd ,  --  filthy , tattered , and generally de // moralized , and giving strong evidence of companionship , if not with swine , with men whose filthiness renders them deserving of the name . We are told at the start , that the necessities of the government having compelled it to resort to the issue of paper money , the officers of the Treasury have felt bound to provide ample facilities for its redemption , and for keeping the circulation of the country in as good a condition as practicable . To this end , they have established regulations providing for the transportation to the Treasurer by express , the expense of the governi**ent , for redemption , of all currency which the holders think ought to be redeemed , provided they send it in proper amounts , and for the return in like manner of new currency in its stead . These liberal facilities are provided , not only because clean , new notes are desirable in themselves , but as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has proved that if a note is clean and fresh from the printer 's hands , with every line and shade distinct , it is a comparatively easy matter to determine whether it is genuine or counterfeit . But if it is worn , dirty and , especially , greasy , and the finer lines are thus obscured , the difficulty of correctly deciding as to its character is greatly increased . This is especially the case with notes which have a large number of fine lines and a great deal of pictorial engraving upon them , it having been found that counterfeits of such notes are much more easily made and circulated than of notes upon which the lines are more open and the engraving less crowded . It is a common practice with counterfeiters and " shovers " of counterfeit money , to soil and rumple their spurious notes before attempting to pass them , so as to give them the appearance of having been in circulation a long time . So we shall find that a considerable proportion of the fractional notes which we see in the redemption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we may have in our pockets , and do not think of handing in for redemption . Many banks , especially those within a few hours ' travel from Washington , do not sort over or pay out any of the fractional currency which they receive , but make a practice of putting it up in packages and sending it to the Treasurer to be exchanged for new at the close of each day 's business , so that nothing but clean currency is paid out over their counters . It may seem a trifle wasteful to destroy whole packages of notes , some of which are still fit for use ; but when we consider that the clean ones are scattered through remittances of notes which ought tD be destroyed , that their selectibn and re-assort* ment would cause a great amount of additional labor , that after all they would not be as pleasant to use as perfectly new notes , and that their issue to applicants for new notes would doubtless occasion a vast deal of grumbling , we shall probably come to the conclusion that the practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our guide , on the way down the stairs , let us proceed with our inspection . Entering the room in which the express messengers deliver their remittances , we find the counter , the tables , and the floor l ) iled high with remittances of damaged money from all parts of the United States , including very probably Salt Lake City and Texas . Two hundred and fifty packages are , we are told , not unfrequently received here in a single day . By far the greater part of the bulk of the money received is postage and fractional currency . An idea of the magnitude of the business performed may be gathered from the fact , that the Assistant Treasurer at New York forwards a remittanceof fractional currency ' for redemption every ten or twelve days , and that he never sends less than one hundred thousand dollars , and that the remittances from other Treasury officers are proportionately frequent and large . Over thirty-one million dollars in fractional currency alone were receive ( l and counted during the last fiscal year , - about one hundred thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these immense receipts has to be counted , carefully scrutinized to determine whether it is genuine , assorted with others of the same denomination and issue , and strap . ped and labeled . This work , like that in the division of issues , is done exclusively by women . It is maintained by those who know that it could not be done by menwith an approximation to the present rapidity and accuracy . The fingers of the women ac ( luire a dexterity and a nimbleness to which the clumsy digits of the sterner sex could never attain , while their quickness of perception enables them to detect counterfeits with great certainty ,  --  counterf*its which S l ) erchance some lord of creation has passed over without discovery . Of course these qualities are not acquired at once , and by some they can not be acquired at all . Months of training and experience are required to develop the novice into the expert and accurate counter . It is the practice to place the beginner under the charge and tutelage of an experienced counter , with directions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to apply to her teacher whenever she is in need of assistance or explanation . In this way the novice is probably in time inducted into the mysteries of the art . But here , as everywhere else in the world , excellence is not attained without hard striving , and can not be attained by some even by the most diligent effort . Willingness , concentrativeness of mind , natural ability , and quickness of perception are indispensable requisites in the successful counter . There is another requisite which we are told is almost as indispensable , and that is , that the learner shall be young , or at most not beyond the meridian of life . The most expert counters are almost all below the middle age . Women beyond that age have dif ficulty in acquiring the manual expertness necessary , , and are correspondingly slow in learning to detect counterfeits . The reason is obvious ; the work is something for which their previous lives have in almost all instances given them no preparation whatever . A man of or beyond the middle age , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to acquire some degree of business knowledge , and may , therefore , if tolerably well educated and not too old , be found competent to perform the ordinary duties of a clerk . But a woman who has been accustomed for half a life-time only to the monotonous duties of the household , or to no duties at all , finds , when forced to seek means of support other than the needle or the school , that her previous experience has unfitted her for the requirements of a new pursuit . So , when additional counters are to be appointed , bright , intelligent young women are in demand . Each lady is provided with a separate table , so that the money intrusted to her may not become mixed with that of any other counter . The fractional currency , when presented for redemption , is often assorted by denominations only , the task of assortment by issues , which is necessary in order to properly keep the accounts , being left for the counters at the Treasury . As there are four distinct issues of most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself , the assortment by issues adds vastly to the labors of the counters , as we observe by looking at their tables , which are covered with little piles of currency , each composed of a denomination or issue different from the rest . Hence every new issue adds to the labor of redemption . It is estimated that the latest issue , which is coming in for redemption in heavy amounts , has added one-third to the labor of assortment . Moreover , each note*has to be carefully scrutinized in order to determine whether it is genuine . The counterfeits which are thus detected are branded with a hot iron , or punched with a steel punch , with the word " Counterfeit , " and returned to the parties from whom they were received . About three hundred and fifty dollars in counterfeit notes , principally among the fractional currency , are discovered , stamped , and returned each day . For these reasons , we find in the redemption division little of that rapid manipulation which surprised us in the division of issues . When a package @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty is to compare the bundles inclosed with the inventory or list of contents of the package , if there is one . If there is not , she must prepare one herself . If there is a discrepancy between the aggregate contents of the package and the amount claimed , she calls a clerk to verify her work , so that there may be no mistake . She then proceeds to the examination of one of the bundles , having first I ) laced all the others in LOWERING MONEY ON THE ELEVATON. // a box , so that the straps or contents of different bundles may not become mixed . and , when she has counted its contents , marks upon the strap , over her initials and the date , the amount found short , " " over , or counterfeit . She l ) roceeds in this manner until all tbe bundles in the package have been counted . She then assorts the money into bundles containing one hundred notes , each of the same denomination and issue , which she surrounds with new printed straps , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If there are any notes over even hundreds , these are p*it up sel ) arately and are known as " odds . " All the " odds " thus arising in each day 's count are turned over to counters , whose sole duty it is to make them up into bundles of even hundreds . Five or six counters are thus constantly em* ) loyeel . She then enters in a book , having a blank form for the l ) ti*PO5* Prilited in duplicate on one side of each leaf , a statement of the result of the count , embracing the net amount found due the owner , the aggregate of the " shorts overs , " and counterfeits discovered , and the amount claimcd . One of these duplicates is retained in the book as her voucher ; the other is attached to the letter which accoml ) anied the money and handed , as soon as coml ) leted , to the clerk who draws the check which is to be sent in return , or . if new currency is to be returne ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on which it is to be forwarded . So we learn that these ladies , besides being counters and counterfeit detectors , must be mathematicians and accountants as well . lAarther on we come to the room devoted to the counting of the mutilated money received by mail , for , in addition to the receipts by express , an average of one hundred packages is received each day by mail . The money so received is in much worse condition than that which comes by express , for the reason that currency which is mutilated is redeemable only by the Treasurer , and usually comes in small amounts by mail ; while the various assistant treasurers , del ) ositaries , and depositary banks are agents for the re(leml)tion of currency merely soiled and defaced , which is forwarded by them to the Treasurer by express . Phe money received by mail comes in all sorts of damaged conditions , and has all ilnaginable kinds of horrible or ludicrous histories . Sometimes it has been swallowed by a calf or a goat , which , finding a pocketbook carelessly left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salt which the leather had absorbed from the l ) ersl ) iration , until the book was forced open and the contents exposed . The green notes had an inviting and familiar al ) i ) earance , and the confiding animal eagerly swallowed tlicmim and so sealed his own death-warrant ; for I the owner , returning and seeing the wreck of the pocket book , rightly conjectured where his money had disappeared , put the unwitting thief to death an ( l recovered the halfdigested notes . Others have been found on the bodies of drowned or murdered men , weeks lierchance after their death . Frequently they have been so burned that nothing remains but the charred resemblance of notes , so frail and brittle that a slight touch will change them to cinders . Sometimes a note is sent which some drunken fool , lord for the hour of untold riches , to show his cbsregard for money , has used to light his cigar , but which , Ul ) Ofl the return of reason , he has hastened to send to the Treasurer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be cxchanged fur a ncw note with which to pay for food and lodging . Or it may be that it is one which a termagant wife has thrown RECEIVING MONEY EN ADAMS EXPRESS . // into the fire to spite her hen-pecked mate , who has rescued it before it was entirely devoured by the flames ; or one that some luxurious mouse has stolen from the moneydrawer and used to line his nest . Once a poor Frenchman sent a handful of minute fragments of notes , with the statement that they had " met with the accident of a little dog . " Our Fenian friends are prone to put lighted pipes in the same pockets in which they carry money . The consequence is that the Treasurer receives for redemption a great many greenbacks with round holes burnt through them here and there , and looking for all the world like bullet-riddled ensigns of the Irish Republic . Some stories are so frequently repeated as to excite grave doubts of their entire truthfulness . For instance ; a note which is so badly damaged as to call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make it worth anything , is pretty sure to be said to belong to a poor , hard-working widow with an astonishing number of children , for whom the writer , in the fullness of his charitable heart , has forwarded it for redemption . All these notes , so variously mutilated , must be restored as nearly as may be to their original shapes before their value can be definitely ascertained . Here again the skillful ngers of women are called into requisition . Some of the women employed in this work have , by long experience , become exceedingly expert in pasting and restoring notes . Fragments which are so burned as to seem to others only charred pieces of paper , or so minute as to be almost indistinguishable , under their patient hands again assume the semblance of notes , so that their kinds and denominations can be readily distinguished . Notes which have been nibbled by mice into such tiny fragments that most persons would say that it was beyond human power to restore them to their original shapes , are arranged and restored bit by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begin to assume their former forms , and at last are restored with sufficient perfection to warrant their redemption . These ladies have made an art in which they have no rivals . It would require years to educate others to the same degree of skill and knowledge , and it would be difficult to estimate th' embarrassment which their loss woul*l entail on the Department . The identification and restoration of notes which have been burnt is a difficult and interesting operation . Every one has observed that a printed paper after having been burnt , if not subjected to a strong draft or roughly handled , retains its original form , and that the printing is distinct and legible , and appears as if it had been raibed or embossed on the paper , but that if it is touched never so gently it crumbles into dust . Notes in this condition are frequently received at the Department for redemption . The counter subjects each note and fragment of a note to a careful inspection in a strong light , under a powerful glass , until she determines the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece of thin , tough paper in order that it may be safely handled . But this pasting , by destroying the raised or embossed appearance , at once and forever precludes all chance of again identifying the kind or denomination of the note . Henceforthitisbut a plain , black piece of paper , giving no indication that it ever represented money . It is therefore very necessary that the counter should be quite sure that her judgment is correct before the note is pasted upon the paper . She must also ,  --  a most difficult task ,  --  determine whether the note is genuine or counterfeit . And yet counterfeits are discovered by these experts among the charred remains of notes with almost as much certainty as among perfect notes . Charred notes of National banks have occasionally come into the possession of the Department , and have been restored in this m*anner and returned for redemption 7- // to the banks which issued them , accompanied by the affidavits of the counters that they were the remains of notes of the banks to wbich they were returned . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leemed . But occasionally a surly bank officer , unable or unwilling to trace any resemblance to bank notes , or at least to the notes of his bank , in the plain black pieces of paper returned to him , and influenced perhaps by a desire to effect a little saving for the stockholders , refused to redeem and challenged the Department to the proof . All positive ocular proof having been destroyed when the notes were restored and j ) asted , the Department was compelled to submit to the loss . Once some of these experts were granted leaves of absence , without pay from the government , for the purpose ofrestoringa large quantity of burnt money belonging to Adams Express Company . This was permitted partly because it was known that there was no one else who could perform the service , without which the company would be subjected to great loss , but principally because the company offered to pay them much more for their time and labor than they were receiving from the government , and it was thought that their long and faithful services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The money was taken from safes recovered from the wreck of a burnt steamer which had been lying for four or five years at the bottom of the Mississippi , and the notes were so burnt , decayed , and ( lamaged as to be absolutely worthless , unless identified and restored . Yet nearly every note of the one hundred and eighty-one thousand dollars in United States and National Bank notes recovered was restored with unerring certainty and redeemed at its full face value . The Chicago and Boston fires have for the last year and a half furnished burnt notes enough to keep all the experts of the office l ) retty constantly employed . Passing through the various rooms , we find that the whole basement floor of the north wing of the Treasury building , including the large room under the cash-room , is occul ) ied by these busy counters . One hundred and eighty women are engaged in counting redeemed money in this division . The work is far from pleasant , for the money is often deplorably dirty and emits the most nauseating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to health , especially as want of space has necessitated the crowding of the counters al most as closely as they can sit . *I-Ience , we are not surprised to see that many of the women are pale and thin , and apparently weary and care-worn . We are sorry to record that these women in common with all others employed in the Department have been accused as a body , both on the floor of Congress and elsewhere , of being loose and immoral in their character . It is doubtless true that some improper women have been employed in the Treasury . It would be miraculous if out of so n ) any women em ) loyed it were otherwise , under the former imperfect system of appointment . But that more than an inconsiderable proportion are otherwise than virtuous and modest , we confidently deny , and our denial is based , on a thorough acquaintance with the facts . The simple truth is that these women as a class are as virtuous , as modest , as intelligent , as respectable , and as discreet and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which we know , and that even the few who constitute the unfortunate exceptions to this encomium are compelled , by the force of the common sentiment of both men and women in the Department , to conduct themselves discreetly and properly while there . Could their cruel traducers but visit the Department and observe the deportment of the women clerks , day after day ; could they see them at their fatiguing employment ; could they know that most of them have either children or young brothers and sisters or aged and infirm parents dependent upon them foi support ; that many of them lost the strong arm which they had hoped would shield them from want and detraction in the conflict which saved our liberties from destruction ; that many were themselves on the field of battle or in the hospital , ministering , as only woman can , to the sick , the wounded and the dying , and that most of them if deprived of their positions would have scarcely any other re*source for the support of themselves and families than the charity of friends or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be put at once and forever to the detraction of the women who earn their bread by hard labor in the Treasury Department . Entering the last room to which our inspection will lead us , a busy scene is presented . Messengers , bach accompanied by a counter , are hastening to and fro with boxes containing bundles of money carefully strapped and labeled , while a bevy of women surround a large table which they almost screen from our gaze , but which the continual " thud " thud that salutes our ears // l ) roclaims to be the site of the cancelling machine . Approaching , we find that the at ) paratus consists of two heavy horizontal steel bars , about five feet in length , working on pivots about a foot from the ends nearest to us . To the shorter end of each is attached a punch , while the other is connected by a lever with a crank in the sub-basement beneath , which is propelled by a turbine waterwheel , furnished with Potomac water from one of the pipes which supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one hundred pieces , are l ) assed rapidly and dexterously under the punch by a man whose fingers sedm ever just on the verge of complete destruction , but which always escape in some marvelous manner unhurt and whole . The punch savagely and easily cuts a hole in each end of each bundle . This is done for the purpose of effectual cancellation . The bundles , when all have been punched , are returned to the box , the messenger picks it up , and the counter and he hasten away to turn over the money to the clerk who is to make up the cash account of the division and ascertain whether all the money received and delivered to the counters has been returned and accounted for . From the time when the money is received by her , until it is thus delivered the counter is respon sible for it , and is required to keep it constantly within sight , except when it is locked away for the night . For this reason she accompanies the messenger who carries her box to the cancelling-room , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the clerk to whom it is delivered , when her responsibility ends . Just beyond the punches a knife of formidable aspect and proportions is engaged in cutting the cancelled bundles in two in the middle of each note . After a sufficient ( juantity of money has been counted , it is made up into lots of about one hundred thousand dollars of fractional currency and proportionately larger amounts of legal-tender notes , and sent in to be cut in two by this knife . The straps with which the bundles of notes are surrounded are so printed as to be also cut in two , and to show upon each half the denomination of the notes , the issue , and the number inclosed . The counter 's initials and the date of counting are also written upon each end , as well as a number or letter to identify the bundle , so that if , upon re-counting the money , errors are discovered , they can be traced in a moment to the proper counter , , date , and bundle . One set of half-notes is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other to counters in the Register 's office , in each of which the money is recounted . This is done as a check upon theTreasurer 's counters , and for the purpose of securing as complete accuracy as possible . If a counterfeit or " short " is discovered it is charged to the counter whose initials the package bears , and the amount is collected from her at the end of the month . This seems oppressive , but there is no alternative . The party from whom the money was received can not be charged with the defi6iency , since the straps which originally surrounded the bundles , and which alone could determine the ownership , were replaced by others when the money was counted in the Treasurer 's office , and even could he be traced , he is beyond reach , since he received his return for the money as soon as it was counted . Nor has the law provided any fund out of which the loss can be made good to the unfortunate counter . The only course open to her is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ careful the CUTTING MACHINE : REDEMPTION ROOM .
