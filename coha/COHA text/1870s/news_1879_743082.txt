txt The situation here among the iron workers on the wages question has been brought down to a very fine point by the action of the puddlers this afternoon . A proposition had been made to them , through their own confer . ence committee , from the madufacturers , to submit the question to arbitration . No plan was suggested , but it was thought the English rules would form the basis of arbitration , if it was agreed to . The poddiem , at their meeting this afternoon , discussed the matter for about three hours and then unanimously passed a resolution rejecting the proposition . They went further , too , by discharging their conference committee on the ground that there was no further need for conference . The puddlers thus say to the manufacturers : " Sign the scale or we will not work . " There is a point here which is apt to be overlooked . It is not so much that the manufacturers object to paying $5 a ton , but they object to the sliding scale , because If iron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puddling goes up with it . This is the real hitch . Both sides have an idea which , however , they try to conceal , that better prices for iron will prevail during the coming year , and each is anxious to profit by it . It is hard to-night to predict the outcome , but the preponderance of opinion is that the manufacturers will be compelled to sign . Some of the smaller mills , working on specialties , have already signed , but these are claimed to be special contracts which are to be hereafter decided by the general result . There is no question , however , that the action of these mills greatly encourages the puddlers . The manufacturers talk with as much determination as ever tonight . They admit , what the paddlers allege , that orders areRinot scarce , but they say emphatically that the prices will not justify them in signing the scale . They say they are anxious to keep the men at work and save suffering , but can not do it at a loss . So far , the dispute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sides . The stoppage of the mills has thrown thousands of men out , and they thronged the streets today , but everything was quiet .
