txt The happy family now controlling the United States Senate held a caucus , the other day , at which matters of grave moment and importance were discussed . When it was rumored that the Democratic Senators were assembled in high conclave , the newspaper correspondents were thrown into a state of great excitement . For what purpose could these Conscript Fathers have met in council ? Was it to decide on the business of the session ? Or to determine the limits to which debate should be allowed on important measures to be introduced ? Or was it to agree on new legislation concerning the counting of the Electoral vote and the determination of the popular choice of President and VicePresident ? Those who suggested that the caucus was called to consider the best means to repress the fiery and untamed members of the dominant party in Congress were frowned down as trifling with the highest and holiest instincts of the Democracy . None of these inconsiderable Eiljects engaged the mighty minds of the Senators . The venerable statesmen met to discuss this weighty question : Has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senate 7 What are known as " the loaves and fishes " have always hold a grave significance in the Democratic mind . Among Democrats , places with which to reward one 's dependents , family , relatives , and party followers are more than principles or abstract questions of party policy . The triumph of the party is not so much to be desired as assuring the maintenance of political faith and doctrine as the maintenance of men who have heretofore been debarred the privilege of being supported at public expense . In the Senate , since the Democrats have obtained con- ' trol , there has been steadily growing up an uneasy suspicion that all was not well . It was darkly intimated that the Sergeant-atArms had given certain Senators more places than he had others . There was a wild rumor that one crafty , and exceedingly hightoned Senator had bagged five of the Capitol Police , in addition to a committee clerk , a folder in the document-room , and two scrubbers and washers . And it was whispered about the corridors of the Senate wing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great West would have more pages , more clerks , more sweepers , more policemen , more everything . It was high time to investigate things . There had not been an investigation of anything for a great while . The foundations of the Democratic Party were being slowly but surely undermined . Senator VoomEns , better known as the Tall Sycamore of the Wabash , being the representative of the boundless but unsatisfied West , was first brought to book . It was found that this noble patriot , whose loathing of official patronage and place has been frequently and eloquently expressed on the stump , has put his son CHARLES into a House clerkship at a salary of more than $2,000 a year ; while for his nephew he has secured the position of clerk of the Senate Committee on the Library , at the tune of $6 per day . Tho same . patriotic Senator , not content with this unselfishly sacrificing his own relatives on the altar of his country , has sternly ordered , nine Indiana dependents into the , employment of the Sergeant-at-Armsi. where they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of Virginia , it was found , as Chairman of the Committee on Agriculture , has appointed his son Josion as clerk of that committee , and his nephew , R. B. EnmoNsex , is provided with a clerkship in the office of the Secretary of the Senate at an annual salary of $2,220 . Senator ZEBULON B. VANCE , of North Carolina , is another who believes that that man is a heathen who does not first provide for his own family , and his sou is clerk ( at $6 per day ) of the Committee on Enrolled Bills , of which the Honorable ZEBULON is Chairman . Senator WITHERS , of Virginia , not having a convenient son at hand , has made his son-in  --  law , Mr. HENRY COOK , clerk of Mr. WITHERS 'S committee ; and Senator WALLACE , of Pennsylvania , viewing with undisguised alarm these instances of Senatorial nepotism , rushed his youthful and immature son into the clerkship of his own Committee of Revision of the Laws , and told him to grow up with the revision of the.raws . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that every Democratic Senator who had a son and a committee appointed his offspring to the clerkship of that committee , the pay in all cases being $6 per day . Those who were so poor as not to have a son put in a son-in-law . Thus , Senator MCDONALD , of Indiana , is one of those who is compelled by stress of circumstances to be content with a mere son-in-law as clerk of his committee . But that stern old Roman , EATON , of Connecticut , more fortunatd , is Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations , while his son , W. L. EATON , is its clerk . And the country beholds the affecting spectacle of a Roman father at the head of a committee and a Roman son at its tail . But Senator MORGAN , who is notoriously the most virtuous and self-denying of the Democratic Senators , and who repels with scorn the imputation that Senatorial influence is strengthened by the number of " retainers " in place , is fortunate in the disposition of his family . He has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly-about among the nicest places in the ' Senate  --  three committee clerkships , the gift of the Honorable Senator , a place on the staff of the Sergeant-at-Arms , and a page 's appointment , being successively occupied by these talented young persons . Senator SAULSBURY , whose growls disturbed the caucus , is apparently destitute of eligible sons . The clerk of his committee , that on Privileges and Elections , is merely a nephew ; his salary is $2,220 . It may be truly said that the Democratic majority in the Senate is " great on sons and nephews . " Probably , there never were so many Senatorial sons and nephews supported in the contingent expenses of the Senate before , in the history of the Republic . And when a Democratic Senator , as Chairman of a committee , certifies to the fact that the service of the clerk , his son , has been truly rendered , he does not , let us hope , put into his pocket , as a father , the warrant which his voucher brings . Democratic parents have paternal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though they fiercely denounced. , nepotism on the stump , they have since yielded to the call of nature . They go for everything in sight . So the caucus solemnly resolved that every Senator who had a son or nephew , was provided for , and that the dividends of spoil . had been justly and fairly distributed .
