txt It is no exaggeration to assert that in the last seventy years more has been done to enfranchise all sections of humanity than in the previous seven hundred . The existing generation may find it hard to realize that , until the year 1793 , a Roman Catholic gentleman could not , even in Ireland , hold the rank of Colonel in the Army , and when , in 1807 , Lord GRENVILLE , with apparently the full approval of Lord Chancellor ERSKINE and Lord SIDMOUTH , both of whom were opposed to Catholic emancipation in general , proposed to insert a clause in the Mutiny bill , as the annual act providing for the Army is curiously called , to extend the privilege then conceded to Catholics serving in Ireland to Catholics serving in England ' and Scotland , GEORGE III . at first flatly refused , and , at length , only gave way under heavypressure . Writing to Lord GRENVILLE he said : " The King reluctantly concedes , but considers it necessary to declare that he can not go one step further , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secure him from being at a future period distressed by any further proposal connected with this question . " Tvventy , two years later Roman Catholics found the Legislature and every profession open to them , the latter on nearly equal terms , and five years ago a member of that faith held the post of Lord Chancellor of Ireland . So , again , with Jews . Since the days preceding the captivity in Egypt they have never known so golden a period as the latter half of the nineteenth century ; and yet at its opening their position was , even in the freest of European countries , full of disabilities . There are those in this City who can recall how , in some of the free towns of Germany , the Jews had to be outside the walls before nightfall , while in England , even , they were politically and socially proscribed . But the England of today has changed all that . The Jews are now , as Lady ASHBURTON ( to quote Lord HOUGHTON ) said of the BARINGS , " everywhere . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have observed one afternoon such a gathering of aristocratic equipages and servants in state liveries as would have suggested a drawingroom being held by her Majesty . Dukes ' and Marquises ' coronets by the dozen , besides the well-known carriages of Cabinet Ministers and Ambassadors  --  what was it all about I Simply that the marriage of a ROTHSCHILD , whose parents dwelt in the princely edifice which ' dwarfs the Duke of Wellington 's , Apsley . House , its next neighbor , had brought together a concourse such as that which assembled there when lately the premier peer of England married the daughter of an historic house . There can be no question that the RomSCHILDS have had a great deal to do with the rise of their race in public estimation : About such stupendous wealth as theirs there is an element of romance which appeals to the minds of those who would be but little affected by ordinary riches , and , under this influence , the position which was necessarily theirs in the world of business has gradually become theirs in that of fashion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best Christian blood in England . A few years aao a member of the FITZROY family chose a daughter of the ROTHSCHILDS for his wife . His example was followed , not long after , by a brother of Lord HARDWICKE ; and now it is stated , with every appearance of probability , that a young nobleman favorably known on these shores is to marry the greatest heiress of the renowned Hebrew house . Lord ROSEBERY , who is nephew of the late able and accomplished historian , Earl STANHOPE , has abilities and ambition such as have raised great hopes of him . When some one asked JOHNSON what had become of all those young nobles who ought to come forward and take a prominent part in public life , his answer was , " They 've gone into the city to hunt for heiresses . " Lord ROSEBERY , it may be hoped for the credit of himself and his order , will know how to turn matrimony with " millions in it " to the best advantage of his country . It will be in his power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " What is the good of a House of Lords f " There is just now a singular dearth of young men of rank and ability , and with these qualifications , added to the strong position immense wealth gives , he has the chance of making for himself a notable name .
