IT would be impossible , in the space at our command , to notice in detail all that may have merited attention in the March exhibition of the Boston Art Club . The water-color department was hardly as strong as that of the January exhibition , but the average of the whole collection did not fall far below that of the previous one . Among the foreign pictures was that of a slim-waisted girl , reputed to be a work of Hogarth , a Madonna and Child attributed to Annibale Caracci , and a tumultuous rout of fallen angels , of the school of Rubens . But all these , as well as some beautiful bits by Troyon , a Daubigny , and one of the usual deep and drowsy woods of Diaz , with its touch of sunlight in the midst , thick with medium and glistening with glaze , must be passed over , in order that we may surrender our eyes more freely to the work of the American painters represented . Chronologically , the first mention should be given to a portrait of General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face which would hardly have satisfied us , had not the illustrious names of painter and subject cast about it a certain radiance of national antiquity too seldom found to be neglected . But two small portraits hanging below this , and apparently of equal antiquity with it , attracted one as well by their color and quaintness and sturdy individuality as by the pleasant uncertainty in regard to authorship with which the parenthetical , questioning " Who ? " of the catalogue surrounded them . The arrangement of these portraits was in the highest degree conventional ; and yet there was almostan agreeable nai*ved in the substitution of green , in the background curtain that relieves the venerable gentleman in marroon coat and gilt buttons , for the crimson of that which hangs behind the lady , his companion , and , as we take it , wife . A smaller portion of distant landscape , too , is allotted to him than that which she enjoys . Altogether , she comes off with a richer endowment from the painter than does her husband , whose grand white wig , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not distract us from our admiration for her dress of ancient , rich brocade , and her long black veil of lace , drooping back from the hair to a point below the arm of the square-backed chair in which she reposes . It would , however , be difficult to say which enjoys the more rubescent complexion ; and we suspect that this fine , vital color , so strongly laid in upon the cheeks of either , is the very charm that has kept us so long before a pair of mere picturesque reminiscences , while the fresh-faced canvases of to-day hang waiting farther on . Two landscapes by Mr. F. D. Williams , Clearing off Warm , and Clearing off Cold , have especially interested us . They are artistic presentations of two differing phases in the dispersion of stormy or cloudy sky , - fleeting and every-day transactions of light and air , cast in little coloridyls . Mr. Williams is not , it strikes us , completely successful in this instance ; but all his pictures appear to have issued from a sincere and direct personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this regard . The first-mentioned is the better achievement , however . A moist and maculated sky - pale whiteyellow , gathered here and there into a faint mauve-tint and slate , which again diffuses itself into the former hue - constitutes the real field of action , above a dim stretch of woods , brown and blue with distance , containing a running hint of dark green ; and a placid water between it and us . A group of distant elms define themselves on the right ; and three birds hover over the lake . In the other piece , we feel too acutely the rawness of the time and condition represented , despite the merit of its cold whiff of chimney-smoke , spinning off on the chilly breeze , the water blown in spray from the wayside-trough , the pale blue sky strained sparsely through gray clouds . It may be questioned whether a picture should send an atmospheric chill down the back of the spectator for this is neither pleasing nor nobly moving . American scenery abounds in effects of color that , by reason of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ verge of discord ; but they never actually pass into it . When a painter fails to catch its delicate strain , then it is probably owing to some mistake in his seizure of relations , or to a strong inclination , for the moment , toward imitation , which disturbs the balance of creative apprehension . Mr. Norton shows a mistake attributable to something of this sort in his twilight scene // Art . on the sea-shore . His Wing and Wing , however , a schooner laden with hay , and riding a smooth sea , is an exquisite triumph in every particular , though in quite another region of effects . This picture is struck from a high scale of color , but the profundity of the blue foreground-water is given with a delicate intensity that is all the more powerful for not employing intrinsic depth of hue . The aerial recession of the perspective must be noted , wafting into graceful prominence an advancing schooner , lighted on its starboard side ( to our left ) , its spankers spreading one to right and one to left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - a delicate structure of chiaroscuro . In the background , at the left , is a steamer ; at the right , three distant ships , the first of which is white , the second and third being farther away and of a slaty blue . High at the left , the white light of a shaded sun is admitted , and falls softly into the lower part of the sky , - a sky that nurses gentle glooms of gray , grading into palest green , - and there is re-echoed , less and less , until at last it dies away into the dream of distance at the farthest right . It is perhaps worth while to mention two large pictures of woods in autumn and winter , by Mr. T. L. Smith , as showing how much labor , expended in the statement of multitudinous detail , may be lost by the subjection of nature to a theoretic method of reproducing leafage . There is a certain fine spaciousness about these two scenes ; but , by some means or other , which it must be left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been transformed , from fresh leaves out of nature 's book of witchery , into pages of dry sylvan statistics , as it were . Mr. George Inness 's small picture of a coming thunderstorm has all that these lack . The prescient dread of the darkened trees in the foreground , the sulphurous dimness farther back on the right , the threatening blue of the hills on the left , and the dusty gray on the tops of the approaching clouds , all purple-black beneath ; the sheaves in the foreground , with three men in white , red , and dark blue shirts ; and the last shifting gleam of light on a space of red earth , a little farther back in the valley , - these things demand recognition as genuine and sympathetic reproduction . Two larger and later works from the same hand , though praiseworthy , were hardly so pleasurable . In the View on the Tiber , below Perugia , the lines of an ancient olive-tree , lifting its warped and slender limbs against the dis June , tant valley , were especially notable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full of the gray luxury of Italian air . But in this later style of Inness there is a certain severity of purity , that gives his work something of hardness , despite its superior refinement over his earlier manners . Perhaps , indeed , it is an over-refinement which causes it , a dryness of finish caught partly from the air of Italy , and a long abode among the chief examples of purist landscape-art . A. Jourdan 's picture of a lady reading , and called The Latest Novel , offered an instance of less conventional disposition in a portrait ( if such it be ) than we are usually treated to . A finely formed and beautiful woman sits before us , in a carefully arranged n/gZi*r6e , with a book open upon her knee , resting on a dress of pale mauve silk , just dimmed here and there by some reflected light , that gives it a hue of hazy blue . A kind of elaborated corsage of white satin , with a tuft of leaves and a rose at the top , leaves the graceful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delicate roundness on the lap , very pleasingly and , as it seems to us , truly drawn . Upon the substantial and gracious neck hangs a slight chain of little pearls . There is a lack of richness in the coloring , though a certain agreeable silvery lightness and mystery is achieved . We may venture the opinion , however , that something of needful force has been lost , in the search for a soft harmoniousness , that reminds one of Huntington 's manner in portrait . Perhaps the most thoroughly satisfactory head in the exhibition was that of a Capri girl , by Mr. Ernest Longfellow . The rich and mantling cheek , remarkably vigorous in its vitality , lost nothing of its lustrous charm by the close proximity of a deep magenta cloth tied over the head , knotted , and richly embroidered behind . A line of small , close curls of deepest black , peeping out from under its front edge , furnished a potent contrast ; and , from this , one 's glance descended with keen relish to the beautiful , alert eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revery a tinge of early morning , and its first pure touch of fire ; breathing a positive zesthetic balm of semitropical richness and rest upon our meagredieted Northern senses . We may be honestly thankful to any one who renders so sweet a head so simply . Mr. Frank H. Smith contributed a quiet and careful little picture of a Marquise in a garden , - a lady with an odd type of face ; that long , slen // 1873. der nose above a somewhat wide mouth , and touching at the bridge the lines of wide-arched eyebrows , which , without being precisely pretty , belongs to a peculiarly and we might say pathetically , feminine character . In a deep wine-colored dress , she sits upon a stone bench , the arm of which stares out in a griffin 's face under her elbow , and clutches the ground with a stony claw . Her hat , full of flowers , lies at her side , and a black lace shawl is drawn upon her head ; so that , thus capped , and fretting a guitar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slight inflection of Spanish suggestion . The abundant foliage behind her is , perhaps , a trifle too vaguely treated ; but a cool gray luminosity prevades the picture , which is accordant with the leafy seclusion of the place . A large picture of a ram standing , and a lamb lying down , upon a greensward , under an uncertain sort of apple-tree to the right , and lent by the Union Club , does not show Mr. J. Foxcroft Cole at his best . It is but an expansion of the severe and almost unimaginative simplicity of pastoral greenness , matched with grays of cloud and the smoked white of sheep , which distinguish his very acceptable smaller pictures ; and appears to lack something which is essential to masterly life-size representation . Among the chalk-drawings was a portrait by Rowse , hardly so captivating , however , as the fascinating , almost fantastic , head of a child , in oil , at the last exhibition . Mr. Bellows 's water-color study in New Hampshire showed what may be accomplished with such simple native elements as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a glowing window ; some purple logs lying near , yellowred at the ends ; and a surrounding growth of quiet green saplings . The habit of buying directly from painters , or through the exhibitions organized by them , will have to be much more generally cultivated than at present in American communities , before artists can take the independent position they should be allowed to occupy , or exhibitions be made thoroughly successful . When the present disadvantageous state of things in this regard is remedied , we shall not find painters gathering in an informal association , like that which proposes from time to time to hold an auctionsale under the name of Boston Artists ' Sale . One of these took place last month , and among the hundred and odd oil-paintings offered on that occasion were many excellent 757 ones by Messrs . F. H. Shapleigh , J. Appleton Brown , Frank H. Smith , and others . Mr. Shapleigh , a disciple of Lambinet , distinguishes himself by an acute and sensitive grasp of mountain-forms ; though as a colorist he may , we think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Matterhorn , from Zermatt , gives with much strength and nicety not only the rugged bulk of the mountain , - a pale mauve mass of rock , under light layers of snow , - but also the fine deflection of the peak , like that of a candle-flame bowed by the slightest imaginable breath of air . The elastic woodiness of some willows , too , in a small Yosemite scene , should be noticed . Others of his contributions showed some unevenness ; but Dixville Notch throws itself into a very graceful composition , appearing before us as a receding mountain-gap , lined by sheer , light-purple rock-walls , with woods and a road in the foreground , and a serene but scattered company of clouds poised in the blue , behind . We must speak of Mr. Brown 's little twilight episode , near Kenilworth , - a dark brown water , with bare-branched trees behind , against white clouds involved in a delicate suspicion of rose . The artist inclines strongly to trace again and again these beauties of tree-lines thrown forward by a white , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy ; but we should be glad to see a little more responsiveness to climatic changes in his coloring than was instanced by the scenes at home and abroad here exhibited . Mr. F. H. Smith 's Venetian scenes we should be glad to recall in words ; but it can only be said that both eye and hand have , in turn , answered with unusual grace and fervor to those resonances of rich red and gold and crimson , those gleams of rare pale green and blue , which echo in our memories of Venice and her silent water-ways . We have only time to hint the fresh clearness and good faith of some seaside studies by Mr. Norton ; one , in particular , showing an exquisite , sunny cumulus , glooming underneath , with a long , thin slip of slaty cirrostratus against it , looming stately over an inky sea ,  --  a sign of storm . Nor can we describe , here , the fine group of sheep on a desolate wold by the sea , with soft gray clouds rolling here and there into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and variety in the entire collection are most encouraging . // SCIENCE . IT was long ago observed that when stars are occulted by the moon , they disappear and reappear , not gradually , but instantaneously . That is , the star , in passing behind the moon , does not grow dim until it fades from sight altogether it vanishes at once , and its reappearance , at the farther edge of the moons disk , is equally abrupt . From this fact it was rightly inferred that the moon has no enveloping atmosphere . More recently spectroscopic observation has verified this inference , besides establishing the parallel fact that there is no appreciable quantity of water on the lunar surface . This absence of air and water from the exterior of a planet so similar to the earth in its general aspect has always been regarded as a phenomenon needing to be accounted for ; and very queer have been some of the hypotheses by which it has been sought to explain it . It has even been hinted that all the lunar air and oceans may have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owing to a slight displacement of the moon 's centre of gravity , the air and water may have entirely retreated to that hemisphere of the planet which is always turned away from us . At the present day neither of these suggestions is worthy of serious consideration . The first is simply ridiculous , in view of what we now know about comets ; and the second , though not intrinsically incredible , will not bear examination . Any one , says Mr. Proctor , " who will draw a cross-section of the moon ( in a plane passing through the earth ) , and endeavor to assign such a position to an atmosphere of moderate extent that even during the moon 's extreme librations no signs of the atmosphere could be perceptible from the earth , will at once see that the theory is untenable . " A much more probable explanation supposes the lunar atmosphere and oceans to be frozen solid . The entire cessation of volcanic activity upon the lunar surface indicates that the planet has nearly or quite lost its primitive stock of internal heat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ size of the planet . The degree of cold implied by the solidification or " rigidification " of the moon 's nucleus immeasurably exceeds anything within terrestrial experience ; and it may well have been great enough to freeze all the lunar oceans , and even to liquefy , or perhaps to solidify , the gases of the lunar atmosphere . The moon is indeed subjected at each rotation to the fierce noontide heat sent from the sun ; but although this may scorch and blister the rocky surface , it can exercise but little melting power . From the airless surface of the moon , the solar radiance must be immediately reflected into space , as from the surface of a polished mirror . Just as on the summits of the Himalayas , where the atmosphere is so rare , the huge snow-masses remain through centuries unmelted , in spite of the sun 's blazing heat , so upon the surface of the moon the air and water once frozen must remain frozen forever . This explanation , however , does not give a satisfactory account of the disappearance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the maintenance of a more than arctic cold in spite of the utmost intensity of solar radiation may readily be admitted . But in this explanation the absence of a surface atmosphere is presupposed rather than accounted for . A far more thorough-going hypothesis was propounded some years since by M. S*mann , in a paper on the unity of geological phenomena throughout the solar system translated by Professor Sterry Hunt , and published in the American Journal of Science , January , 1862 . In his excellent pamphlet on the " Geology of the Stars , " * Professor Winchell , of the University of Michigan , has newly called attention to M. S*emann 's hypothesis , and shown that it gives a complete account of the facts in the case . Observe first that the former existence of air and water on the lunar surface is not a mere inference from analogy . The moon having been originally a portion of the earth 's equatorial zone , it is difficult to suppose that it does not contain materials which have from the oldest times constituted so large a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the vast plains on * Half-Hour Recreations in Popular Science . No. 7 . The Geology of the Stars . By Prof. A. Winchell , of the University of Michigan . Boston : Estes and Lauriat. 1873. 758 June , // 1873. the moon which the old astronomers supposed to be seas , and named as such , have now been found to be areas underlaid by sedimentary rocks , thus attesting the former presence of water . Hence , as Professor Winchell sensibly argues , there must in all probability have been winds to excite the erosive movements of the water which caused this sedimentation . For tidal action upon the moon can not be regarded as a considerable factor in the erosion , unless we go back to that enormously remote period when the earth 's tida.l pull was still dragging the moon 's rotation into synchrony with its revolution . Since , then , we have plain indications of the former existence of air and water on the surface of the moon , how does M. Swmann account for their disappearance ? They have been drunk up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tendency of the surface water is constantly to percolate through the soil of the land or sea-bottom , and thence through the rocks , downward towards the centre of the earth . Yet with our present supply of internal heat , it is not probable that any water can reach more than one fiftieth part of the distance towards the earth 's centre , without becoming vaporized and thus getting driven back towards the surface . In this way there is kept up a circulation of water throughout the peripheral portions of the earth 's crust . But as the earth becomes cooler and cooler , the water will be enabled to circulate at greater and greater depths , thus materially lowering the level of the ocean . In this way , long before the centre has become cool , all the surface-water of the earth will have been sucked into the pores of the rocks , and the same will afterwards take place with the atmosphere . M. Swmann shows that by the time the earth had reached complete refrigeration , the pores of the rocks would absorb more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the globe , " and that the unfilled pores would more than suffice for the retirement of the atmosphere . " According to M. Swmann , this state of things , which is by and by to be realized on the earth , is already realized on the moon . Being forty-nine times smaller than the earth , the moon has cooled down forty-nine times as rapidly , and its geologic epochs have been correspondingly short . - Its zoic age , " says Professor Winchell , " was reached while yet our world remained , perhaps , in a glowing condition . Its human 759 period was passing while the eozoi5n was solitary occupant of our primeval ocean . " More careful reflection will probably convince us that , with such a rapid succession of geologic epochs , the moon can hardly have had any human period . For the purposes of comparative geology , the earth and the moon may be regarded as of practically the same antiquity . Now , supposing the earliest apelike men to have made their appearance on the earth during the Miocene epoch , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at that period the moon must have advanced in refrigeration very far beyond the earth . Supposing organic evolution to have gone on with equal pace in the two planets , it would seem a probable conclusion that the moon would be rapidly becoming unfit for the support of organic lire at about the time when man appeared on the earth . Still more , it is a strictly logical inference from the theory of natural selection , that upon a small planet there ' is likely to be a slower and less rich and varied evolution of life than upon a large planet . Grouping together all these considerations , it does not seem at all likely that the moon can ever have given rise to organisms nearly so high in the scale of life as human beings . Long before it could have attained to any such point , its surface must have become uninhabitable by air-breathing organisms . With its rapid refrigeration , its surface air and water must have sunk into its interior and left it the mere lifeless ember that it is , - a type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the radiating and cooling members of the solar system . The moon would thus appear to be not merely an extinct world , but a partially aborted world , just as the still smaller asteroids and meteorites would seem to be totally aborted worlds ; the quantity of planetary matter being so small in the latter case that there is an apparent incongruity in speaking of these bodies as worlds in any sense . Nevertheless , from the earth down to the moon , from the moon down to the asteroid , and from the asteroid down to the meteorite , the differences are at bottom only differences of degree ; though the differences in result may range all the way from a world habitable by civilized men down to a mere dead ball of planetary matter . Here we are introduced to an interesting series of reflections on the continuity of cosmic phenomena , concerning which we hope to say more next month . For the // present we would change the subject , and allude to the discoveries recently made by Mr. Calvert , which seem to point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sir John Lubbock writes to AZ2*-lure , of March 27th , that he has learned by letter certain results obtained near the Dardanelles by Mr Frank Calvert , which are of striking significance for the antiquity of man . Mr. Calvert has found a fragment of a bone , either of a mastodon o* of a dinotherium , " on the corner side of which is engraved a representation of a horned quadruped , with arched neck , lozengeshaped chest , long body , straight fore-legs , and broad feet . " Along with this are traces of other figures , partly obliterated . In the same stratum Mr. Calvert has found " a flint flake , and several bones broken as if for the extraction of marrow . " Of course these statements await verification , and to draw a positive conclusion from them at present would be in the highest degree unwarrantable . It can only be said that if these data are verified , and if it turns out that Mr. Calvert is not mistaken in the character of the stratum which he has been examining , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ computed in millions of years rather than , as heretofore , in hundreds of thousands . But in this there need be nothing to surprise us . The non-existence of human remains in any Tertiary strata ( save possibly in the uppermost Pliocene ) has been an assumption based on purely negative evidence , like the older assumption as to the non-existence of fossiliferous rocks below the Silurian . We must be prepared at any moment , on the reception of positive evidence , to extend our conceptions of the antiquity of man , as well as of the number and duration of geologic epochs . The immense antiquity of the human race , even as at present established at something like a million of years , affords very powerful confirmatory proof of the derivation of man from some lower form belonging to the order of primates . Since the period during which man has possessed sufficient intelligence to leave a traditional record of himself is but a minute fraction of the period during which he has existed upon the earth , it is but fair to conclude that during those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his existence remains , he was by slow increments acquiring that superior intelligence which now so widely distinguishes him from other animals . Throughout an enormous period of time , his brain-structure and its correlated intellectual and emotional functions must have been gradually modified by natural selection and by direct adaptation , while his outward physical appearance has undergone few modifications ; even the most striking of these being directly or indirectly associated with increase in brain-structure . These inferences are in harmony with the beautiful principle announced by Mr. Wallace , that so soon as the intelligence of an animal has , through ages of natural selection and direct adaptation , become so considerable that a slight variation in it is of more use to the animal than any variation in physical structure , then such variations will be more and more constantly selected , while physical variations , being relatively of less vital importance to the species , will be more and more neglected . Thus while the external appearance , and his internal nutritive and muscular apparatus , may vary but little in many ages , his intellectual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comparative rapidity . Thus we may understand why man differs so little in general physical structure and external appearance from the other higher primates , while in the special point of cerebral structure and accompanying intelligence he differs so widely from his nearest living congeners. // POLITICS . RECENT events , as they say in France , connected with civil-service reform may be briefly summarized in this way . Mr. Curtis has resigned the chairmanship of the Civil-Service Advisory Board , on the ground that several important appointments , recently made , showed that the President was unfaithful both to the letter and the spirit of the civil-service regulations . Mr. Medill has resigned from the board , on the ground that his holding the two offices of Mayor of Chicago and Civil-Service Commissioner is incompatible with the rule issued some time ago by the President , forbidding United States officials from holding State or municipal offices . The President has publicly renewed his declaration of fidelity to civil-service reform , both in letter and in spirit . The President has requested Mr. F. J. Olmsted to accept the chairmanship vacated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President has requested Mr. Dorman B. Eaton of New York to the place of Mr. Curtis , and Mr. Shellabager of Ohio to take that of Medill . Mr. Eaton having accepted the appointment , it was immediately denied that he had been appointed at all ; and at the same time it was announced that the rules were to be modified so as to enable the President to select as appointees for positions in the civil service men who were more in sympathy with the administration than the competitive system seems likely to produce . For the latest fact or rumor on the subject we must refer the reader to the newspapers ; but of this at least there is no doubt that Mr. Olmsted and Mr. Eaton were actually approached on the subject , and that either selection was good . Mr. Eaton is a trained lawyer , a trained politician , and a trained reformer . He has studied politics too in the great national hot-bed of rotation and corruption , the city of New York . He knows what the evils of the present system are , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were no Caseys and no Sharpes in the service , the selection of Mr. Eaton might be accepted as a complete vindication of the President 's honesty . But under all the circumstances , it merely serves to render the existing confusion on the subject of the relation of General Grant to the civil service more confused than before . The mystery as to his real intentions we have not much hope of being able to dispel , because we do not believe that General Grant himself understands the meaning of civil-service reform well enough to have well-defined intentions on the subject . But some light may be thrown on the causes of the present confusion by one or two considerations which are generally overlooked . What is civil-service reform ? We have all been talking about it with great vehemence for the past six or seven years , but sometimes it seems as if we had ourselves forgotten what is its essential feature and fundamental peculiarity . It is generally spoken of as a political reform , like minority representation or the abolition of special legislation . Yet its nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not merely that we wish to put an end to rotation , and introduce stability of tenure ; we wish besides this , or rather by these means , to introduce into the American system the virtues of subordination , of obedience , of faithfulness in the discharge of duty , of respect for law , and to put an end to the recklessness , the extravagance , the lawlessness , selfishness , and corruption which now characterize it . Civil-service reform is merely a piece of machinery for giving sober , industrious , and thorough people the power and influence of which they have become , by force of circumstances , deprived . The essence of it is , after all , not the adoption of a series of rules for the examination of candidates for Treasury clerkships , but a real devotion on the part of the reforming power to those virtues we have named , a profound belief in the necessity of elevating the tone of the government ; in short , a little of that sacred " passion of perfection " which leads men in troubled times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love of ease . Without this spirit , there can be no life in the rules . General Grant , however , has never given the public any reason to believe that he is possessed by this spirit , while he has given a thousand reasons for believing that he is not . It is true that , if we go back to the opening of his first administration , we find him announcing his determination to turn 1873. 761 // Politics . the cold shoulder to the politicians , and make his appointments without regard to any other claims than those of fitness . We have no doubt that he was sincere in his professions , for he did nominate a Cab . net , selected with a view to what he considered fitness , and in doing so declared war upon the politicians , as he had promised . But it proved a bloodless conflict . He grew very tired of it . He was fond of popularity and ease , and in a few months a truce was declared . From that time to this he has not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the machine " to be worked by the old crew for their own profit , quite content himself if they will work it without pestering him with questions for which he has by nature and education no disposition to deal . It would not be difficult to select from the principal acts of General Grant 's administration tose in which he himself took a lively interest ; for when he does take a lively interest in anything , he is aptto make his friends and supporters , as well as his enemies , understand the fact . He did take a lively interest in the annexation of San Domingo . This was evident enough both from his messages , and from the urgency with which he half publicly importuned members of Congress . He took a warm interest in the Indian peace policy . He has showed a persistent determination to keep his brother-in-law Casey in the New Orleans Custom-House , and to support his government of Louisiana by force of arms if necessary . He has also wished , in an evident but unintelligent sort of way , to reduce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get the currency into a sound condition ; we say unintelligent , because he has never pretended to have any definite ideas on economical subjects , except some antique exploded fallacies which can hardly be supposed to furnish the grounds for his practical recommendations , so long as we have the much more plausible explanation , that he has allowed his Secretary of the Treasury to drift him into a policy of which he neither understands the virtues nor the defects . The general desire of the country that England should pay the Alabama claims he undoubtedly shared , but he shared it with that perfect confidence of success in the end which prevented any violent longing or imperious demands . But San Domingo and , Casey were very near his heart . This indifference to reform , rather than opposition to it , we will believe , explains June , much of General Grant 's apparently eccentric conduct . General Grant belongs to a generation which had other ideas than those with which ours is familiar . He belongs to the period of American life when the energies of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resources , " and boasting of our vast exploits ; when all that was asked of an American was , that he should be ready to lend a helping hand , whenever it was needed . General Grant , like thousands of others of us , was brought up to believe that ours is the best government the sun ever shone upon , and he believes it still . Besides this , his military education and experience , which we all supposed five years ago would certainly have prepared his mind for that kind of disgust at the existing political re*rime which would throw him into the reform camp , seems to have had in fact a precisely opposite effect . It has produced in him only that spirit of adaptability to the political s/a/us quo which is a virtue in a general , and a vice in a general who has undertaken to play the part of a statesman . The civil service he is willing enough should be reformed , as he would probably be willing that the Methodist church should be reformed ; but he does not wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to desire some civil-service rules , and he has got them made . He is willing enough that they should be enforced , so long as they do not conflict with his own plans ; but if they do , so much the worse for the rules . It was the misfortune of Mr. Curtis to mistake Gsneral Grant for a reformer , and this mistake undoubtedly made the situation absurd ; but we should not shut our eyes to the fact that a great deal has been accoml ) lished by getting the machinery in operation ; with a resolute and sceptical man at the head of the board , determined that the rules shall be enforced in any case , much may be done in the next three years . Gener* 1 Grant 's very love of repose and popularity would make him play the part of a reformer , in coors c of time ; and his rules will be enforced as soon as some one is found who will make it easier for him to enforce than to suspend or modify them . - The curious effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may have in confusing the judgment and perverting the moral notions of a people is very strikingly shown in the case of the " presumption in favor of innocence " // PO/iticA favored by the traditions of the English and American common law . It was long ago laid down that the " common law favored life , liberty , and dower , " though , with characteristic obscurity , the grounds of this selection were never explained . Why " dower " should have been selected as the only kind of property to be protected , except on the ground of the common law 's " tenderness for married women , " it is difficult to see . Certainly it was pretty much the only evidence of tenderness ever given ; for during the existence of marriage , the law considered " the husband and wife as one , and that one the husband . " " Life " and " liberty " are vague , general terms , too , which comprehend the life and liberty of the murderer as well as of the victim , the robber as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same law to be hung tomorrow , and the judge who condemns him . Indeed the maxim was so very vague , that hardly any serious attempt was ever made to explain its limits , except that so far as " life ' was concerned , there was a presumption in the case of a criminal accusation that the accused was innocent , and that the accusing party must prove substantively his connection with the crime . The presumption in question , however , rationally rests , whatever may be its historical or judicial origin , on no such foundation as the prejudice of the common law in favor of life and liberty . It was not because certain judges and lawyers whose minds were deeply impregnated with the spirit of common law , on inquiring of their legal consciousness what they liked , received as a reply , " life , liberty , and dower , " and in reply to the opposite question , " death , incarceration , and the abolition of dower " ; it was for a far wider and saner reason . The " presumption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common law , and was part of the established Aryan jurisprudence as long ago as the trial of Socrates for corrupting the minds of the Athenian youth . When a crime has been committed and an arrest has been made , and the government or the injured party have accused the prisoner , there is no presumption a priori of guilt or of innocence . There is really no reason a priori why , in the absence of proof ( and of course , so far as the jury is concerned , there has been no proof whatever , no matter what evidence may have been adduced before the committing magistrate ) , one man should be tried more than another . The reason why the prosecutor 763 must prove the connection of the prisoner with the crime is the same reason which compels any one who brings a civil action to prove that he has some ground of suit . The government says that a certain man , woman , or child has committed a certain crime ; of course such a charge , like any other affirmative statement , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no presumption at all in the case . In case of a failure of justice from want of proof , the common law , with its presumption in favor of innocence , says that nothing having been proved , the prisoner is innocent , and forthwith gives him the benefit of a verdict of " not guilty , " from which reason and morality alike revolt . The only verdict which expresses the truth is the Scotch verdict of " not proven . " The absurdity of the notion that there is any presumption in the *case of a man brought before a jury to be tried for the commission of a crime may be seen in this way . A presumption is merely a probability derived from the observed facts of life . It is an inference " drawn by a process of probable reasoning , " " affirmative or disaffirmative , " of a fact in the absence of proof or until proof can be attained . For example , there is a presumption that a man who was last seen several years ago in an open boat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and has never been heard from since , is dead . There is a presumption that when a letter has been sent through the mail , it has reached its destination . There is a presumption that a child born in wedlock is legitimate . No sensible man can deny the correctness of these inferences , because he knows that ninety-nine children out of a hundred born in wedlock are legitimate ; ninety-nine letters out of a hundred sent by mail do reach their destination ; ninety-nine out of a hundred who disappear in a storm at sea in an open boat are drowned . Therefore , in the absence of proof , he would say that there was preponderance of probability in favor of these conclusions . But no man could possibly say that , in the case of any one arrested on suspicion of a criminal act , there was a probability that it had not been committed by the suspected person . Whence could such an inference arise ? Not certainly from a comparison of the number of cases in which such a conclusion would be correct with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems much more probable that , in a majority of cases , persons arrested for crime are guilty . // qwq
