txt Mr. GEORGE H. PENDLETON is by far the most skillful and acute of the Democratic orators in Ohio with reference to finance . He is probably as sincere and as consistent as any of them , and he has a good deal more adroitness in clothing his doctrines in specious forms . Unfortunately for him , most of these doctrines are exploded . They have a vague historical interest , but they concern the present or the future very little . Time was when Mr. PENDLETON was an ardent advocate of the " payment " of the bonds in legal tenders . He may be called the inventor of the notion , and he is largely responsible for the fact that the Democratic Party made the campaign of 1868 on that absurd and suicidal proposition . Mr. PENDLETON was a zealous advocate of the payment of Customs dues in greenbacks so long as greenbacks were below par . He was a vigorous , and even desperate , opponent of specie , payments , regarding which he has for at least a half dozen years indulged in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ propositions have gone their way to the limbo of political fancies , condemned by the stern logic of facts . The bonds have been refunded or paid off . Resumption has come , with none of the dreadful consequences which it ought to have had . What can Mr. PENDLETON now find wherewith to alarm and warn his fellow-citizens ? What cry can he use to frighten them into the Democratic fold ? From what catastrophe can they be induced to flee the Republican ranks and rally under . Mr. PENDLETON 'S banner ? The problem is certainly a tough one , and with all Mr. PENDLETON 'S cleverness , his mode of attacking it does not fall short of being ridiculous . He revives the stale story about the demonetization of silver being secret and surreptitious . On this he rings the changes with monotonous insistence . It was done in the interest of the bondholder , to make his investment more valuable , to increase the value of gold , the value of debts . " No member of the Congress which passed the law will avow that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who signed it . " It was all a conspiracy to increase the gains , and confirm the sway of the creditor class . This is all so old as to have become offensive . So far from silver being demonetized by stealth , the law was openly discussed at two sessions of Congress , and Mr. WILLIAM D. KELLEY , of Pennsylvania , a gentleman for whom Mr. PENDLETON ought to have some regard , pointed out what the occasion was for the law , and predicted very justly ? Much more so than Mr. PENDLETON would like to admit the consequences which would flow from it . What sense , what common decency , can there be now in galvanizing the ridiculous invention that a law of such considerable magnitude was smuggled through Congress without that body 's knowing what it was doing ? And is it not a little late to hold up the image of the bloated bondholder to . the average American citizen as the author of all the woes , real or.imaginary , from which the country suffers ? Surely , the bondholder can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will , we may be sure , reduced his rate of interest by from 20 to 33 1-3 per cent . Nor is the bondholder of the national banks  --  the peculiar favorite of the Government , according to Mr. PENDLETON  --  able to resist the diminution of his profits . Two years ago they were estimated at 2.43 per cent . more than they would be outside of the national system ; now they are estimated at 1.43 per cent . by the same authority . It is a desperately-mistaken set of political doctrines which have to be bolstered by this absurdly false presentation of facts , and the tone of Mr. PENDLETON 'S speech indicates that he has found this out . The only germ of pertinency in Mr. PENDLETON 'S long speech on the finances is his indirect attack upon the national banks . He concedes that the currency which they furnish is , " in point of stability of value , facility of circulation , and safety of the note-holder , the best currency w ? 3 have ever had . " But , nevertheless , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too expensive . " Wo have already given an authoritative estimate of the net value to the banks of their circulation . It is far less than is generally supposed . Mr. PENDLETON insists that " the people " have to pay them an amount equal to the interest on the bonds , less the small tax on circulation ; and also interest for the loan of this currency . But the banks can not loan all their currency . Five per cont. of it must be covered by greenbacks at Washington . A varying proportion , often as high as 30 per cent. , is held as a reserve against outstanding notes . Besides the United States tax , they are heavily taxed by States and municipalities . And what is the advantage to the public from this system ? First . and most valuable of all , it gives us a portion , at least , of one currency which is beyond the reach of Congressional tinkering  --  a currency which can be expanded or contracted almost without the knowledge of the public , and yet in exact proportion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. PENDLETON is forced to admit , stable in value , easily circulated , safe . When we perceive the restless itching of men like Mr. PENDLETON to be changing and experimenting with the finances , we can hardly overvalue the independence of the national bank currency from Congressional control . These uneasy theorizers , who imagine that they have found a short cut , " ' cross lots , " to the millennium , by whichindustry , care , thrift , selfcontrol , and honesty are rendered useless in the affairs of private life and of Governments , would like to do away with a currency which rests on the solidest possible basis , which can not be inflated idly by vote of Congress , and only contracts when the use for it decreases . They would substitute a measure of value more variable than the winds , subject to the ignorant and often corrupt manipulation of political majorities in Congress , and utterly unfitted for the transaction of business outside of our own borders . It is to be hoped that no such impracticable , ill-digested , visionary conception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sight of Ohio voters .
