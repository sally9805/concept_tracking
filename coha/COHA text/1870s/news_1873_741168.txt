txt Savannah , Ga. , is rapidly becoming as famous for " ghost sensations " as Newburyport , Mass . Within a period of less than a month . according to authenticated reports , " manifestations " of startling character have been witnessed by several families in that city . At a house close to the cemetery , the agents of which have been named , the spirit of a " hideous man " has almost frightened the lives out of , numerous persons by Performing the act of decapitation in their presence . The mother of " quite an interesting group of boys and girls , " it appears , was the first to discover " the horror " in its worst form , the husband and father having only been permitted to hear " unearthly noises , " and see pieces of earthen-ware and china hob-nabbing " apparently without human intervention . " She was engaged in placing C11138 upon a closet shelf in one of the rooms , wnen her attention was attracted by " mysterious sounds . " Presently the cups were thrown from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visible in the door-way . " Transfixed with terror , she stood wildly gazing upon the spectre before her . With a horrible grimace the ghastly vision pointed toward his throat with one hand , while with the other he seized himself by the hair and threw back his head , revealing a bloody gash in his throat , which reached from earto ear ; then , with a jerk . he decapitated himself and disappeared with a loud shriek . " The result of the fearful experience , for the vivid description of which we are indebted to a reporter of the Savannah Herald , was a tenantless house on the following morning . Another family subsequently entered into occupation , and matters progressed most satisfactorily until the " mtsterious closet " was again opened , and an attempt made to use it . This time the spirit proved to be in a more playful temper . Instead of " swinging the head off , " it adopted the less troublesome method of throwing cups , plates , tea-pots. and . dishes at the intruder , and what , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sounds , " the work of clearing out the premisesowas accomplished very quickly . The agents , finding it : impossible to procure another tenant , announced that the house could be had rent free . This expedient , however , proved ineffectual . A few enterprising " heads of families " cheerfully undertook to solve the mystery , but had no better success than those who had been compelled to leave after having paid in advance . A colored man was the last who informed the agents that he proposed to take his family to the house , and live there in spite of the ghost . Unlike his predecessors , this person thought it would be better to try first to live in the garden , and afterward upon the steps of the door , before trusting his precious body inside of the house . With this purpose he approached the front gate in the dusk of evening , and . had just placed his hands upon the latch when , as he status it , the hall-door suddenly opened and a man walked forth , in such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landlord . Under this impression ; he was on the point of saluting him , when he ( the man ) stopped , at a distance of about ten feet , " raised a lifeless hand , pointed a finger toward the throat , while with the other hand he seized his hair , and with a quick motion swung his head from the body and disappeared . " The Door colored man , as may be supposed , made no further attempts at reconnoitering . Now , we all know how easy it is to work - upon the feelings of women and ignorant colored men , and from the fact that the Savannah ghost has not appeared once before anybody else , it does not seem unfair to presume that the character is being played by some eccentric person , who has a fancy . for occupying a /louse free of rent . The decapitating trick is rather an old one with wizards , and the noises might very reasonably be accounted for by the striking of a dozen or more tin pans , strung together with a piece of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very different way of . " looking at the phenomena . " They will probably assume that some man has committed suicide in the house , and that has spirit has to make the " manifestations " described in order to communicate the manner of his " taking off " to the friends yet in the " form . " The task of proving which of these theories is the correct one ought not to be very difficult , and there certainly must be enough men of inquiring minds in Savannah to undertake it .
