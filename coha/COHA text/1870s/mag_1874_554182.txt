OWEN BROWN 'S ESCAPE FROM HARPER 'S FERRY . ON the eastern shore of Put-in-Bay Island , in Lake Erie , quite out of the way of the summer pleasurer at the great hotels of the northern shore , stands the two-story frame farm-house of John Brown , Jr . It rises out of a fair landscape of sunny vineyards , the path to it from the main road leading through a tangle of grapes . A natural lawn slopes prettily from the house down to the water , across which , seven or eight miles away , Kelley 's Island and the Ohio mainland look dreamily , in the half-tropical manner of most Lake Erie scencry . All these wine islands , indeed , see one another dimly and drowsily , as if drunk with the mellowness of their own vintages . In this quiet place , after fighting his enemies in Kansas , and being driven by them in chains till the iron had worn its way into the flesh , after being hunted from place to place for the attempt at Harper 's Ferry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave the company he led to the late war on account of a disease contracted in the first battles a , ainst slavery - in this quiet place , I say , lives John Brown , Jr . He moved here nine or ten years ago when these pleasant vineyards were wild land ; and now so modest and peaceable is he that you would never imagine he had fired a gun in his life . When I called at this house and inquired for Mr. Brown , the plain , motherly-looking woman who came to the door , asked which Mr. Brown I wanted , John or Owen . This mild-voiced matron , as I afterward found , was John Brown , Jr . ' s , wife , who had sha ; red the dangers and hardships of Kansas border-life with her husband ; and it was from her , then and there , that I learned Owen Brown was on the island . She told me the two brothers were mowing in a neighboring field . And there I found them : John , a large , well-made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle height , and of the two looking the more like the old hero of Ossawattomie . They each have bushy eyebrows and wear a. full beard , sandy , as their father 's was once , and beginning to whiten as his did at their ages . Owen shows , perhaps , all his forty-nine years , while John looks younger at fifty-two . They were both in their hickory-shirt sleeves , and wore trousers of blue drilling ; but I have seen no handsomer men , among the throngs who have come and gone at the fashionable hotels , in the course of my summer ' s sojourn on the island . Certainly I have met no one , at Put-in-Bay , or anywhere else , who had to a higher degree that subtle quality which can make the texture of any given attire gentlemanly . There , coming up to the fence to salute me , was the eldest of old John Brown 's sons , the quiet , genial , warmhearted farmer , amateur geologist , and land surveyor , John Brown , Jr . And there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sole survivor of the little party he led through the mountains , in that marvelous escape of his , and-if , as is supposed , Osborn Anderson , the mulatto , is dead - the only one living of all the company that went with Captain John Brown to Harper 's Ferry . There was a gentle courtesy in the talk and manner of both these men that I can not write down for you ; and I surely never met more thorough , genuine modesty . At that first interview , I could get them to say little of themselves . They had h'eard somewhat of my own wayward story ; and with the curiosity , not off ignorant , but of well-read , well-bred men , they questioned me back , so to speak , into some of the by-ways of my early* experience . They were particularly curious about certain rarely visited places beyond the sea . I tell this , because it may help you to see the picture of these two men as I saw it , look-342 // ing back after parting with them that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their scythes on their shoulders , gazing silently after me ; and as the slanting sunlight fell upon their honest faces , I could see as plainly , it seems to me , as I ever saw anything , not the stern lineaments of historic warriors , who have gone back to their farms , but an artless aspiration , like that of the village boy for the sailor 's adventurous life . These men , unmindful of the part they had had in deeds which , well or ill advised , have sent the world along , were modestly putting my pigmy story ahead of their heroic one , in the eager wish that fate had sent them wandering among strange people and in far-off lands . it was not till after we had met very often that Owen Brown consented to tell inc the story of his escape , or that John told me enough of his father 's plans to give a dignity to the attempt at Harper 's Ferry , which I confess it had never before seemed to me , in my ignorance , to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ashtabula County , Ohio , at the time of the attack . He had just returned from Canada , where he had been organizing the pluckiest and most trustworthy of the escaped slaves , at some of the border towns . He would have been at Harper 's Ferry , if his father had not been driven to begin operations before the appointed time . The reason for striking the blow so soon was that he had been betrayed to the government . Moreover , the people in the neighborhood bad begun to suspect him . John Brown 's entire plan has never , I think , been published . his object , as his friends know , was to make slaveholding so unsafe and unstable as to render it unprofitable , and so lead to its abolition . He and his company had already in effect driven slavery out of Kansas , and lessened the value of slaves in Missouri and the Border States to the amount of at least a million dollars . This had been done by a handful of men , with the combined power and influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Seminoles were never fairly conquered , and had , twenty years before , while surveying in the neighborhood of Harper 's Ferry , resolved to make the Alleghany and Cumberland Mountains and the Dismal Swamp his everglades . The least he expected the government to send against him was an army of twenty thousand ; and his plans were so laid that they could never capture over one hundred of his men at a time , and of these all but two or three should be fugitive slaves . The risings were planned to take place in a dozen different directions in a night , the conipanies to be kept separate . The slaves were not to be taken to the North , but drilled and taught to conquer their homes in the South . They were to be officered by men who had proved worthy , and who were to restrain them from acts of violence . The slave-holders were to be taken prisoners where they stood in the way , and injured personally only if they resisted . It was John Brown 's desire to show the slave-holders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caused him to delay his escape from the engine-house at Harper 's Ferry until it was too late . Hundreds of men were sworn to be there , and if he could have waited till the time in the spring agreed upon for the attack , it would probably have been successful . The courage and fortitude of the wonderful old man have been allowed even by his enemies . It was hard for the Virginians , as it would have been hard for most men , to whom every black man counted a thousand dollars , to recognize the right of revolution in four millions of human beings , but they did acknowledge that John Brown was all through the stuff of which his answers were made when Governor Wise and Senator Mason questioned him , wounded and bleeding upon the engine-house floor and that was just the sort of insanity , it seems to me , that heroes and reformers have been made of ever since the world began . He had waited twenty years ; he was too old to wait twenty years longer . The blow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To him and his men 343 // Owen Drown 's Escape from Harper 's Perr** . March , life was nothing in comparison with what had been so long the one absorbing object of it . Even as it was , if he had cared less for the feelings of the wives and children of his prisoners , and had gone to the mountains when he could have gone , - and he accused himself of the mistake , without implicating his friends at the North , - the war would certainly have lasted longer , and would not have closed so disastrously . This last statement could have , I believe , no better confirmation than is in the fact of the remarkable escape of Owen Brown and his little band , with thousands of dollars upon their heads , and hundreds of thousands of people eager to catch them . In his father 's will and published letters , Owen Brown is spoken of as a cripple . He injured his right arm in throwing a stone when a boy , and has since had only the partial use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in his oneroomed shanty , a little way from his brother 's farm-house , that I wrote down , from his own lips , the following account of his escape from Harper 's Ferry . Upon the wall just above my head hung an overcoat , once worn by his father ; and on a bench beneath the window at my side lay the gun used , I believe , by the old warrior at the fight of Ossawattomie . The place , indeed , was full of mementos . Most of the homely furniture was , I think , heroic in its way , like the whole family . " None of us , " said Owen Brown , with his usu*d deliberation , stroking his full beard and looking at his father 's gun , when I in- , terrupted his narrative to ask if he were not afraid on a certain perilous occasion , " none of us ever made much pretension to being scared . " He had not told the story before , he assured me , in twelve years . The honesty and modesty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I imagine , who had listened to him , would have been willing to swear that Owen Brown was telliiig what he believed to be the truth . Where he did not know of his own personal knowledge , and even when a statement had the authority of trustworthy record , he would invariably say , " I have heard ; I do not know , I have heard . " Names of men and places he had strangely forgotten ; in their hun*ry wandering in the mountains , he and his little company had even lost their reckoning of the days of the week ; yet so strong is the woodsman in him , that he gave me not only the direction and probable extent of every moumitain and valley he passed , night or day , but the nature and quality of the timber almost everywhere in his way . I found him entirely free from malice , even a ainst the bitterest of his old enemies . He passed over the most dangerous and dramatic parts of his story without the least emphasis , giving them to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tones and look there were qualities that evaporate entirely , of course , from the written narrative . The only substitute I can think of for the reader is , that he shall bear constantly in mind what kind of men old John Brown told the Massachusetts legislature he wanted with him , - " men who fear God too much to fear anything human. ** And Owen Brown was one of them . The last time I saw my father that is the way Owen Brown began the account of his escape from Harper 's Ferry was on the Sunday night of the attack , the 16th of October , 1859 . It was about eleven o'clock that night when he and his little company started from what . we called our boarding-house , on the Kennedy farm , five miles north of Harper 's Ferry . The Kennedy farm , you will remember , was rented by father under the name of Isaac Smith . He left Barclay Coppoc , Frank J. Merriam , and myself to guard the arms and ammunition stored on the premises , until it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school-house , a mile from Harper 's Ferry , or to the Ferry itself . Barclay Coppoc was a brother to Edwin , who was , you recollect , hanged soon after my father , at Charlestown , Virginia . The mother of the Coppocs was a Quakeress ; their father was dead . Before they joined our company , they lived at 844 // Springdale , Iowa . They came originally from Colu*nbiana County , Ohio . Barclay Coppoc , the one who was with me through so much hardship , was a medium-sized young man , not over twenty-two or twenty-three years old . lie did not look very healthy , but could stand a great deal , as you shall see . Still he was not so well educated or so energetic as his brother who was hanged . Frank J. Merriam was of the wealthy Massachusetts Merriams . He was twenty-eight or thirty years old at the time . He had easy , unassuming manners . The only thing very positive about him was his hatred of slavery . Well , such were the two men my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the darkness . Neither of them had been with us in Kansas , and so I thought best to stand guard all night myself , letting them sleep . No echo of the events which were happening reached me in my long watch . But towards six o'clock in the morning , we all heard firing in the direction of Harper 's Ferry . The rain , which continued at intervals all that day and the next night , had already set in . About eleven o'clock that forenoon , a slave of Col. Lewis Washington , whom with others my father then held a prisoner , came up with a four-horse wagon after a load of arms . One of my father 's men came with him ; I forget now who it was . They knew little more about the details of the fight than we did . While they put their team under shelter and fed it , I got dinner for them . I had almost always been the cook for our company at the boardinghouse . Thea we loaded the wagon as quickly as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rifles , which father had managed to have shipped to him under the name of John Smith &amp; Sons . The wagon drove away to the school-house , before mentioned , where the arms were to be stored . Between two and three that afternoon , we heard a great deal of firing in the direction of Harper 's Ferry . Later in the afternoon a black man came up on horseback , and asked us to go over to the Ferry and help in the fight . I do n't know that he had any authority but his fears ; for I think he must have come from the school-house where some of Washington 's and Alstadt 's slaves were congregated . At any rate I put things in order , feeling somehow as if we were never going to get back there again . I told some of the neighbors where they could help themselves to the provisions and things , if they wanted them , and I tied to the rude stairway , so that he should not follow me , the pup , which I have heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accounts of the people who afterwards captured the vacant boarding-house . Then , arming ourselves well with rifles and revolvers , we started toward the Ferry through the rain , Coppoc , Merriam , and myself on foot , the negro riding his horse . We had got about a mile on our way , when we saw three men approaching us briskly on mules . It was getting towards night . I ordered them to halt , which they did with frightened readiness . We soon learned that they were not looking for us . All they knew about affairs at the Ferry was that folks were shooting one another down there , and they wanted to get home as soon as their mules would carry them . We let them pass , and pursued our way . Shortly after we saw coming towards us in the dusk , an armed man . I ordered him to halt . He hesitated , and I do n't know whether he would have obeyed or not , if we had not just then recognized each other . It was Tidd , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a large , strong , determined fellow , in the prime of life . He was once a lumberman in his native State of Maine . He had been with us in Kansas , and was a great friend of Stevens , my father 's gallant lieutenant , who was hanged at Charlestown . Tidd had been on duty at the school-house . He told us that our men were all hemmed in at Harper 's Ferry , that many of them were killed , and that there was no chance for any of them to escape . " The fact is , boys , " eoncluded Tidd , " we are used up ; the best thing we can do is to get away 345 // from here as quick as we can . " " We rtiust n't desert our friends , " I said , and proposed to go on to the schoolhouse , collect the slaves left there , and then cross the ravine up through the forest on to the point of rocks upon the mountain opposite Harper 's Ferry , where with our long-range @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and let oUr people escape . Tidd thought the case hopeless , but consented to go with us to the schoolhouse . We had not gone on together over a mile farther , . when we saw another armed man approaching us out of the dark . We ordered him to halt , and he replied by pluckily ordering us to halt ourselves . We recognized the voice of Cook , - John B. Cook , the same that was with us in Kansas and hanged in Charlestown . " Our men are all killed but seven , " said Cook . " Your father was killed at four o'clock this afternoon . " He did not know whether my two brothers - Oliver and Watson - were among the dead or not . Then he told us particulars , how the little band of seventeen whites and five blacks had surprised and taken the town and the armory , and held it , fighting all day long , but how at last companies amounting to eight hundred men had come in from suvrounding towns in Maryland and virginia , guarding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The best and only thing for us to do , in Cook 's opinion , was to make good our escape . I was opposed to deserting any friends who might want to escape with us , and we argued the case hastily there in the dark and rain . I prevailed on Cook to go reluctantly as far as the school-house , for provisions , and to see what had become of the liberated slaves . Cook had been exchanging shots with the enemy not far from the school-house , and now expected to find it occupied by hostile Virginians . When finally we came near it , Tidd and I left the others concealed in a thicket . Approaching nearer , we whistled and called for the black men , but got no answer . This seemed to confirm the idea of enemies there . Tidd hesitated , - but perhaps I ought not to tell you this about a comrade , - and I had difficulty in getting him to go into the school-house . He followed me , though , atlast , revolver in hand , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was in a corner nearly a barrelful of a kind of sweet biscuit which I had made myself , and I hurriedly thrust as many of them as I could into a bag . I took about twenty pounds of sugar in another bag - the common seamless bag . There lies one of them now under the bed , - the same one , I think . I 11 get it out . You see it has on it " J. B. , " father 's initials . XVc had it in Kansas , too . That s all the provisions we took . Knew that we dared not build fires in our flight . Coming out of the school-house and joined by Cook , Merriam , Coppoc , and the negro , we lingered in the neighborhood perhaps an hour , calling the black men . The only answer that came to us out of the rain and darkness was the firing at Harper 's Ferry , but a mile away . We saw no more of the liberated slaves . They probably went back to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the top of the mountain opposite the Ferry before morning . Then our retreat would be cut off . I bated to give up the idea of helping our friends to escape , but I had to . We might have shown our good-will by killing one or two of the enemy ; still it would have surely cost our lives . We finally decided to go back to the , boardinc-house on the Kennedy farm , and get our India-rubber blankets and other necessary things . I put the bags of biscuits and sugar across the negro 's horse , and on the way made up my plan of escape . I had bad some experience as an engineer on the underground railroad , and I had been a woodsman almost all my life . I told the boys if they stuck by me I felt pretty sure I could get them safely through to the North , and to Canada , if necessary . The firing by this time had spread gradually over the country , showing that the people were thoroughly aroused // and on the alert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hurriedly seized what things we could carry away , resolving to sort them over by daylight in the woods , the next morning , and bury what we did not absolutely need . I took an empty shot-bag , I remember , to put salt in , but in my hurry forgot to put any salt in it . That bag will appear again further along in my story . We resolved to camp on the mountain , as near the farm-house as we dared , so as to aid in the escape of any other stragglers who might find their way there . In point of fact , as I afterwards heard from one of them , two of our men who had escaped from the Ferry did reach the house the next day after we had gone . They were Hazlett and Anderson , the mulatto . Hazlett , as you know , was afterwards taken above Chambersburg , and hanged with the rest . Osborn Anderson made his way into Canada . I saw him the next July in Ashtabula County , Ohio , and at North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Anderson , it is said , has since gone to Liberia , and if he is living , - which something I have heard gives me reason to doubt , - he is the only other survivor of all my father 's company at Harper 's Ferry . When we began to ascend the mountain I ordered the negro to turn his horse loose . " Why , " exclaimed he , " dat horse is worth more n a hundred an ' fifty dollars ! " and he did n't like to part with it . I had hard work to convince him that his life was worth more than the horse . Up the base of the mountain about a mile from the boarding-house , we halted in the laurel , and made our beds . It was raining , and very cold . We had not all learned , as we did afterwards , to keep warm by sharing the same bed . We spread an India-rubber blanket upon the earth , then a woolen blanket upon that , to lie on ; then a woolen blanket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all . Thus two men , clubbing together , had furniture for a good bed in the wettest weathel- . Here I told the boys my plan , - here in this camp , dark as only a laurel thicket can be on a starless , rainy night , the firm0 still 0oing on at intervals , sometimes towards Harper 's Ferry , and sometimes nearer at hand in the neighboring valleys . I explained that the mountains there extended in a northeasterly direction , which was also for a while our best direction towards our friends , or Canada . We must therefore follow the mountain ranges , making to the northwest when we could ; traveling only at night upon the edges of the clearings ; sleeping and hiding by day in the thickets on the uninhabited mountain-tops ; shunning all traveled roads at all times , except as we were obliged to cross them in the night ; building no fires ; buying or stealing no provisions ; in fact , not speaking aloud till we should , at least , get beyond Chambersburg , Pennsylvania . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all along , began to complain of rheumatism . He was afraid he could n't go with us . I told him simply that he was certain to lose his life if he went back , and that 1 felt reasonably sure I could get him his freedom if he kept with us . Then the boys went to bed . Although I had had no sleep in two days and two nights , I sat up against a tree and watched . I began to feel suspicious of that negro , and 1 thought I had better keep an eye on him . He knew my plans , you see . He knew , also , that if he left us , his only hope of saving his life would be in divulging them . The beds were , for safety 's sake , four or five rods apart . After a while the negro began to groan and complain of his rheumatism ; said he could n't lie comfortably , an ( l wanted to sit up . I arose , and walking past him sat down on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten minutes , or more ; I do n't know . But when I came to look for the black man again , he was gone . I hunted and hallooed for him in vain . Then I roused up all the boys in a great hurry . They agreed with me that we must move at once , and change our plans as much as possible . All we could do to mislead pursuers was to make for another range of mountains 34T // which would take us in the same direction . There was a new road - just done that month - three miles north of us , across the mountains from the valley where our boarding-house was , to what I think was called Pleasant Valley . Our lives seemed to depend upon our getting across to the north of that road before daylight . So we hastily sorted our property there in the dark . The two guns intended for the negro , and which be had not taken with him in his flight , we buried with many other things . We each took two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ besides a full heavy cartridge-box to a man . More than this , I carried that ni* , ht about fifty pounds of l ) rovisions . The others were opposed to taking so much to eat , and one way or another , as you shall see , I carried the food almost all the time of our wanderings . We started up the mountains diagonally . It was very hard work getting through the laurel and up the steep places with our loads . We had to stop often to rest . While sitting on my pack I would sleep for two or three minutes . I had had so many chances to practice that I could always do that then . My father used to sleep when riding horseback . He got a good deal of his rest in Kansas in that way . Well , w* did n't reach the top of the mountain we had to cross till after daylight . The rain had stopped , but it was foggy . We could see part of our boarding-house two or three miles below ; there seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the Ferry and in differeRt directions about the country . We traveled the * , reater part of a mile , perhaps , along the rocky mountain-top before we came to the road which we were so anxious to get safely across . The fog was rising a little now with the sun . We could see no one on the road in the short distance open to view in both directions , and so we ventured across . We were not quite out of sight in the thicket on the northern side , when we heard the sound of horses ' hoofs upon the wet ground , and lo ! eight armed men rode briskly past over the mountain . We kept still till they had disappeared , and then we stole farther into the thicket , where we all five of us hid away in one bed for the rest of the day . Of course they did not see us . If they had seen us we would probably have had a desperate fight . We had determined never to be taken alive . IDid the negro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For all our narrow escape , I slept very soundly that day in the thicket . We awoke in the afternoon , and ate some of our biscuit and sugar , and discussed our affairs in a whisper . And by the way , I can give you no idea how tiresome and painful whispering becomes after two or three days . It is about as unnatural and soon grows as hard work as hallooing at the top of the voice . Another thing that became very wearisome was keeping my head in the position to watch the North star . Carrying the provisions over my shoulder , and looking up in that way night after night , guiding the party , got to be very painful indeed . Well , we discussed our affairs , as I said . Cook , in his fiery , quickthinking way , was always proposing bold , hazardous measures . He to some extent carried Tidd and Coppoc with him ; and so they were in favor of stealing horses , and riding right into death , which was lying in wait for us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reward on my head ? Yes , I believe so . IJow much ? Well , I 've heard that it was twenty-five thousand dollars in all ; more than it was worth , perhaps , but then I suppose I had done slavery more than that amount of damage in Kansas and around . Cook 's wife , - he was the only married man in the party , - his wife was then in Chambersburg ; and he was bent on going there . So were Tidd and Coppoc . Merriam always abided by my decision . Poor fellow ! he soon saw he could n't get through without me ; he began to show symptoms of giving out , only a day or two after leaving Harper 's Ferry . I waited for him and helped him along , especially in steep or rocky places ; and after four or five days , I // carried his luggage in addition to my own . Now , it was not in my original plan to go to Chambersburg , but I had to consent to go that way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any one , almost , except themselves , could have seen that they alone would lead themselves into destruction . Why , while we were lying there arguing in a whisper , a gray squirrel , attracted perhaps by the blue color of our blankets , mounted the tree right over us and chattered ; soon after he was joined by a black one , an ( l they both , chattering , approached within a few feet of us , and I had all I could do to keep Cook and Tidd from shooting them . Cook was probably the quickest and best shot with a revolver that I ever saw , and the temptation , I suppose , was very strong just then . Having prevailed upon the two men to spare their own lives with those of the squirrels , I could not keep them from going down to the edge of the clearing before dark . It was cold , and they would be moving . I insisted upon going ahead , as I always did afterwards in such places , the others being too apt to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I told the boys if I saw any one I would make a signal , and they should all drop down . Just as we were approaching the clearing where we could see Pleasant Valley extended before us , I beheld a man coming along the path through the woods . He was carrying on his shoulders what seemed to be a sack of flour . I made the signal , and we all dropped ( lown , not far from the patb . I think the man saw us , but he saw also that there were five of us , with two guns apiece , and with wonderful presence of mind he walked on without speaking or turning his head . That askant look of his , however , I have reason to believe , cost a sleepless night to the inhabitants of at least ten miles of territory . I had no difficulty now in prevailing upon the boys to wait till later in the night , before attempting to cross the valley . And when finally we did start , we were no more than half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard a horseman at full run upon 349 the nearest road , and making the most hideous , terrible noise I ever heard come from mortal lips . He was alarming the valley . We afterwards heard that he startled the quiet denizens of that region by shouting to them that Cook 's men were coining down from the mountains to massacre them all . Cook , you see , had been in the neighborhood of Harper 's Ferry , teaching school , for the last year nearly , and that is why they knew about him . So , as I have since heard , the inhabitants of Pleasant Valley fled for their lives precipitately across the Potomac , away over into Jefferson County , Virginia , and some of them as far as Winchester . In the face of all this dreadful noise there was nothing for us to do , but press right on across the field toward the next mountain range east of the valley . Reaching the mountain , we pursued our journey along its side just above the clearings . Towards daylight , we went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sugar and biscuits , and sleeping . This was our usual plan , and of course , we traveled very slowly . When we woke up in the afternoon , I had to argue myself hoarse , restraining the impetuosity of some of the others , especially Cook . He wanted to travel by the roads , and when the provisions began to get scarce , he insisted upon going to buy more . At last , to restrain hi , n , I offered and he took all my share of the biscuits and sugar ; so that I commenced a day and a half or two days before the other boys , to live upon the ( Iry , hard Indian corn which we found still stan ( ling in the fields . I would occasionally pull a hill of potatoes and eat some of them raw . When the biscuits and sugar finally gave out , and we were all reduced to the same diet of raw , hard corn , in order to restrain the boys from going after other provisions , I promised to share my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to travel by roads . I had about forty dollars in gold ; the others , excepting Merriam , had merely two or three dollars apiece . Thus we had passed perhaps five or six days , going up the mountains to sleep , and coining // down to the edges of the woods to travel , when one night a cold rain set in . Towards morning it changed into snow ; all day long the trees sagged with it , and our bed was covered with it - the one bed into which the whole five of us crawled , as I have told you , to keep warm . We slept beautifully . Starting on after dark , we came to where the mountain gave an unexpected turn too much to the east , and we had to cross a valley to . the next range . This entailed the half-wading , half-swimming of a bridgeless stream , and a journey of at least five miles through the snow and wet , before we reached the mountains again . A little way up on the border of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and here , in spite of all I could say , the boys made a fire . We were all wet and cold and exhausted by want of food , and I suppose the temptation was pretty strong . It was not yet daylight . Our fire , a very bright one , had been burning but a little while when we were visited and startled , for a moment , by - an owl . He took his seat on a neighboring tree and hooted at us . In the course of half an hour , while we were munching our corn - we had no potatoes or we might have roasted them - we heard what were unmistakably human voices , calling to one another , it seemed , in the valley below . Soon after we heard the baying of hounds , evidently in pursuit of something , as any one used to dogs could tell . Now we had just crossed this valley , leaving our tracks , of course , in the snow , and the idea that we were followed immediately flashed upon us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , scattering and covering every stick and ember in the snow and earth ; Then we hurried farther up the mountain into the thickets . We could hear all the time that the hounds were approaching us . On we pressed till after daylight . All of a sudden we came upon a clearing with a house on it , and a road runnin0 along the summit of the mountain , and a man driving a span of horses with a load of wood , along the road , - but a few rods away . Though the noise of the hounds was increasing and coming nearer and nearer , we had to wait till the man and team were out of sight . He fortunately did not see us . We traveled on perhaps a mile farther through the woods and laurel , until the day was so light and the hounds so near that we made up our minds it was time either to camp or fight . I counseled the boys , however , not to shoot the dogs , unless there were men with them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from them . I never saw one that would bite me . Dogs , you see , are like men : if you pretend to know them , they are not sure but you do , and at least believe that a certain civility is due to the doubt . The fact that you are n't afraid of them , too , has to both dogs and men a convincing , peace-making mystery about it . And so we stopped and waited for the hounds . In a little while there was a light crackling of the brush , and a red fox with his tongue out , showing that he was much blown , broke past us down towards the valley . Soon after came the hounds . They stopped and stared at us a moment , then went on after the game Had they been put on our track ? Of course I can not say for certain . If they were , they pursued the fox , instead , being no doubt more used to that sort of hunting . Some of us believed that if it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would have been ours . At any rate , the boys were not so prone to build fires after that . It was many days and nights , cold and wet ones too , before they attempted it again . We went on a mile or two farther , well out of the way of the dogs and fox , and there we camped , seeing no more of them or of any one else that day , or indeed the next two or three days . There is a gap in the mountains on the pike below Boonesboro ' , leading from Ha*erstown to Baltimore . That I knew would be a place of great danger ; there was nothing like safety for us till we should get across that pike . We had no other practicable way of getting // out of Maryland . And we heard enough firing both day and night to show us how thoro*ighly the country was aroused and after us . Already the want of salt , the scarcity of food , the change of night into day , the fatigue of carrying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dry corn for all of us began to make me dizzy . I noticed that the others staggered sometimes . We would almost always every one of us fall asleep , when we sat down to rest , and we would sleep soundly , no matter how frosty it was . Finally , one night , we became aware that we were approaching this perilous gap in the mountains . When we came in sight of the pike in question , we heard the baying of hounds , in nearly every direction , - hig hounds and little hounds and all sorts of dogs . I never heard so much barking before in my life . At a sudden trend in the mountain , the gap was opened up before us ; and what a sight it was ! There must have been a hundred fires in view , flaring out of the darkness , - alarm fires , we took them to be , of those who were watching for us . They had heard , as you know , that Cook had a large party of men , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head him off . Their hounds , probably , had followed them to camp , and had got after game in the neighborhood . There must have been a host of warriors , if there was any reasonable proportion between the men and dogs . I saw that our chances of getting out of that were very slight indeed . I did not say it to the boys , though . I told them very promptly that was no place for us . They were quite ready to follow me . We retraced our steps half a mile or more , came upon a road , and followed it , right past a tall log-house . Though a dog rushed out and barked at us , we thought best to keep straight on . We followed the road down the mountain till we came to a spring , where having hastily drunk and washed our faces , we turned off down to what we supposed was Cumberland Valley . Our object was to get across that Baltimore pike at some place out in the open valley , away from the gap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was already as late as midnight . We could not tell exactly , for there was no timepiece in the party . It was plain to every one of us that our safety depended upon our getting across the pike and valley to the mountains beyond , before daylight . Nothing but the excitement of this fact enabled some of us - especially Merriam - to accomplish what we did that night . Imagine our disappointment when , clambering down the rough mountainside , using our guns to lean upon , as we generally did , we found that we had reached , not Cumberland Valley , ! ut a ravine , with a steep mountain towering* right in our way on the other side . There was nothing to do but climb it , and we buckled to it for our lives . It was nearly morning when we finally got down into Cumberland Valley . We hurried on , and in a large field bordering upon the pike , we were brought to a sudden standstill by an unearthly noise , which soon resolved itself in my accustomed ears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rushed away at the top of his speed , leaving some of the boys more scared than he was . Pursuing our way toward the pike , we were startled again with some cause , for we found we were marching straight upon a toll-gate . Sheering quickly to one side , we crossed the terrible pike about forty rods farther on , just as the first light of morning appeared . The baying of the hounds had not yet wholly ceased . A few moments after we were obliged to wade quite a large creek . We were hurrying on from that toward the mountains , when I happened to look back and found that Merriam was nowhere to be seen . Hurrying back to the steep bank of the creek we had crossed , I discovered him , poor fellow , unable to climb it . I tried to help him up , but was too tired and weak . I called Tidd and he took hold of Merriam rather impatiently , and , in pulling him up together , we bruised him against a projecting root . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through a lately plowed field . The traveling of // course was very hard , and our tracks would be very plain to our hundreds of pursuers . And there we were in the middle of that field , when clatter , clatter along the pike came forty or fifty armed horsemen , galloping by in plain view down toward the gorge in the mountains . We dropped and watched them out of sight . Then away we struggled for a hiding-place . When at last we reached the woods , we found them too sparse for our purpose , and went on and up the mountain , still finding no safe camping-ground . On the summit we came upon a sort of monument , or perhaps an observatory , in the shape of an unfinished tower . A white rag was flying from a pole at the top of it . Satisfying myself that no one was about , I went up the winding stairs to take a view of the surrounding country . The others were too much fatigued to go with me . I could see what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough of the valley we had crossed to give me a vivid idea of the danger we had escaped . Hor*emen were scampering hither and thither on the highways , and the whole country , it seemed , was under arms . Descending hastily , I had little difficulty in impressing upon the boys how necessary it was that we should be in concealment . And still we followed along the ridge of that mountain-top for as much as three miles in broad dayli0ht without finding a safe place . We at one time passed not far from an inhabited house , - fortunately unobserved . Finally , as we were about to sink under fatigue , we came to a large fallen tree , and made our bed in the forks of that . Tired as I was , I spent an hour cutting laurel bushes and sticking them into the ground at distances from one another . Laurel you know , will not wilt ; and so with care the shrubs were made to conceal us , and look as if they grew there naturally . We were soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In our ' next night 's travel along the top of the mountain it was so rough that one of Cook 's boots gave out . You see I have plenty of pins sticking here in my shirt now . Well , I had a needle and thread with me then , and I stitched up Cook 's boot as well as I could , using my knife-blade for an awl . It was this or the next night that Cook fell down a steep , rocky place . I heard something snap , when he fell , and thought it was his leg . It was the limb of the tree which had broken with him . He was not yet over the effects of a similar fall near Harper 's Ferry . The other time he was taking aim at an enemy who was also taking aim at him , and got the first shot ; for the branch upon which Cook steadied himself was cut off , just above his hand , by his enemy 's bullet . He was now , therefore , pretty badly bruised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with us . It was only a day or so afterwards , I think , that we walked , besides all night , the whole forenoon , and into the afternoon . The woods were then so thick and extensive on the mountain-top that we thought it safe . The mountain range , after a while , swerved out of our direction , which now lay across a vall*y . Leaving Cook , Merriam , and Coppoc in the timber , I took I'idd and went to see if we could prudently cross that valley by daylight . We had gone on , Tidd and I , about a mile and a half when we came in sight of a road with teams going and coming on it . Farther on we could see a farm-house . While we were discussing the matter , and deciding that it would not be safe to cross the valley by daylight , there came wafted to our keen , hungry nostrils , from that farm-hiuse at least forty rods away , the smell of something like doughnuts cooking . Never before or since has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was too much for poor Tidd 's endurance , and , indeed , that smell of distant cooking , as you shall see , did in effect cost a life . We were both weak and faint enough to stagger . Tidd vowed he would n't go a step farther without food . " You 11 be all winter , " he said , " and never get through after all ; you 11 starve and freeze to death . It is just as well to expose ourselves one way as another , " and he took a long breath of the distant 352 // frying . I had the two arguments to withstand , Tidd 's , and the lard-laden air . The latter was the more powerful , but I withstood them both . I promised him , as I had promised the others , that as soon as we got three nights north of Chambersburg , I would steal all the chickens , milk , and apples we needed . It would not do , I contended , to go to buying or even stealing provisions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by the bye . But antislavery men would have been glad to give what little we needed to the cause , and proslavery men certainly owed it that much . That was the way I argued . Tidd , however , clung to the delightful , maddening odor , and his determination to go and buy food . As a great favor , I at last prevailed upon him to go first with me back to the place where we had left the other boys . And every one but myself agreed with Tidd . I had a large red silk handkerchief with white spots in it , given me by Mrs. Gerrit Smith . Well , this with the empty shot bag for salt , mentioned before , I gave to Cook , and told him , if they insisted on having food bought , he could wield the glibbest tongue , and tell the best story ; he should go . Still I did n't want , - an ( i I feel just as agitated now , almost , when I tell it , - I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I told them , as much as any of them ; and if they would go and get it , itwould be foolish in me not to help eat it . So , as I had more funds than the rest , I made him take my money to pay for it , begging him to the last not to go . In Cook 's confession , he says we sent him for food . That is the way it was . Cook was gone two or three hours , perhaps . He came back with a couple of loaves of bread , some salt in the bag , some good boiled beef , and a pie . He had had a splendid visit , he said . He had stayed to dinner - which happened to be a little late that day - with the people of the farm-house ; had made himself very agreeable , and told them the story we had concocted beforehand about our being a hunting-party , too far from home to get back to our dinners . VOL . XXXIII. - No. 197. 23 If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can form no idea how marvelously good that feast was that day . I felt more or less gloomy about it at the time , keeping it to myself , though . But the shadow of the danger hanging over us did not seem to affect the other boys , who were exceedingly merry . And after dinner we all went to sleep for an hour or so . Before sundown that same afternoon our lives were imperiled in what seemed to me at the time a most wanton manner . Cook had brought with him an 01 ( 1-fashioned , one-barrel horse pistol , once carried by General Washington . Cook got possession of it , when he and Stevens made Colonel Lewis Washington prisoner at Harper 's Ferry . Well , Cook took this old pistol and strolled off , shooting it around in the neighborhood . This enraged Tidd , who ordered him peremptorily to stop . Cook said he knew what he was doing and would not take orders from him ; " I am carrying out the story of our being hunters , " Cook said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were fast coming to blows and to pistol shots , when I rushed between them . Coppoc assisted me . Merriam lay quietly on the ground . It was not easy work to separate Cook and Tidd , but we finally got them still . They were both fearless men , and had faced many a gun ; they agreed to have it out when they could do it without endangering others . There is really no knowing whether one or both of them would not have been killed in this feud , if it had not been for the events of the succeeding day . In the course of that night we came to , a wide creek which we had to ford . Cook 's boots came off so hard that I offered to carry him across , if he would cling to my boots and luggage . His weight , the two bundles , four guns , mevolvers , and ammunition , upon my bare feet on the sharp stones were unendurable . I told Cook I must drop him , and drop him I did , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wet , but kept the guns and ammunition dry . We crossed two valleys and a mountain and got into 353 // the woods of another mountain before day . I was especially anxious to get as fax as possible from the place where Cook had bought provisions . The forest now seemed so extensive that , after resting a while , we thought it safe to go on by daylight ; and we traveled on in what we considered the direction of Chainbersburg till the middle of the afternoon , seeing no traces of inhabitants . All day long , whenever Cook and I would get a little in advance of the others he talked to me about his quarrel with Tidd , making threats against him . His anger seemed to increase rather than ( lecrease . He talked also a great deal about the prospective meeting with his wife and boy in Chambersburg . I remember as if it were yesterday , I told him his imprudence would be so great that he would never see his wife and child again . We stopped at a clear spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bought the day before . Then the boys said it would be a good time to go and get a new supply . More earnestly than ever I tried to dissuade them , but to no purpose . They outnumbered me . Coppoc wanted to go this time . I said , since they were determined that somebody must go , Cook was the man most fitted for the mission , and I gave him money , and the same red silk handkerchief . He left everything but one revolver , and took his leave of us , as nearly as we could judge , between three and four o'clock in the afternoon . As I have told you before , we had no time-piece in the party . I do n't know whether it was before or after this , that we lost all reckoning of the days of the week . That will be my excuse if . I have got them wrong in this narrative , and that , too , will give you some idea how bewildering fatigue is , and hunger , and a couple of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood . Cook had n't been gone long when two ravens flew over our heads , croaking dismally . You may think it queer , but it struck every one of us as a bad omen . We waited till dusk , but Cook did not return ; we waited till dark and starlight , still he did not come ; we waited till nine o clock , till midnight , and still he did not come . He might have got lost , we thought ; and we limzered about , calling and watching for him till at least two o'clock in the morning . Cook never came . We knew nothing of his fate till more than a week afterwards , when , as I shall tell you farther on , we got hold of a newspaper one night at a Pennsylvania farm-house , and read of his capture . I have heard since , that , going along in a clearing , he came upon two men chopping wood , and told his hunting-party story to them , asking where to buy food . They appeared very friendly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they walked along talking socially , one on each side of him . The report says - but I do not believe it - that Cook told them who he was . At a given signal they rushed upon him , seizing him by the arms . They must have taken some such advantage of him , for if he had had half a chance , he would have killed them both . He was , as I have told you , I think , already , the quickest and best shot with a pistol that I ever saw . Anyhow , poor Cook was taken that night to the Chambersburg jail , fifteen miles away . We knew we were about fifteen miles from Chambersburg , because Tidd had gone - very recklessly and without consulting us - down to the road that afternoon , and . asked a man who happened to be passing . The nearest village , the man said , if my bad memory of names does not deceive me , was called the Old Forge . The name of one of Cook 's captors I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hughes . They got the heavy reward offered for him , and drank it up in bad whisky , as I have heard , and were both killed in the rebel army . Daring to wait no longer for Cook , we made a bold push for the road . It was a little odd , and I hope it was in relenting , but Tidd , his mortal enemy , took most of the things left by Cook ; we all took some . This belt here , now , to carry a Sharpe 's rifle in - that was Cook 's . By th' way , there hangs the 354 // coat I escaped in . Do I keep it here in this shanty as a relic ? Oh , no ; I wear it sometimes yet . The fact is , I have always been very saving ever since that hungry trip . From that day to this , I have never seen the least morsel of any kind of food wasted without pain . I shall never get over that , I suppose . Well , we risked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see if we might in some way find Cook . It was quite a while before we reached the village which I have mentioned , doubtfully , as Old Forge . We walked straight through it , whatever its correct name , taking the middle of the street . Only a few lights were burning . We saw one in the bar-room and one in the barn of the tavern . We thought we heard voices , too , in the barn as we passed . A half mile or more beyond the village , we struck through a corn-field , helping ourselves to the dry , hard corn , to which we were again reduced . My purpose was just to touch upon the outskirts of Chainbersburg . I did n't approve of going there at all , you understand , but the others insisted upon it . They wanted to go to the house of a Mrs. Ritner , a kindhearted widow lady , whose husband , a son of ex-Governor Ritner of Pennsylvania , had been a conductor on the underground railroad , as well as upon a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ritner 's before . Father had boarded there , and so had Kagi , who was killed , as you know , fighting so splendidly at Harper 's Ferry . I consented to go to Chambersburg also , because I did not know but Cook might meet us at either of two hiding-places on a stream ; one a half snile , and the other a mile from the town . I had told him about them . I had discovered them , conducting to Harper 's Ferry recruits who had been slaves once and were going back again into danger to help liberate their friends and relatives . Shields Green , who was hanged , was one of these . Just across the corn-field before mentioned , we came upon a wide public high way , evidently leading to Chainbersburg . Here Coppoc and Tidd as-355 tonished Merriam and myself by announcing that they would have to leave us . They said Merriam , in his weak state , could not get into Chambersburg before daylight ; it was at least fifteen miles away . They knew that I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , leaving a gun or two extra for us to carry , and promising to meet us the next night at one of the hiding-places beyond Chambersburg , they started off , on the public highway , as fast as they could walk . It was a wild , desperate thing for them to do . Weak and worn as Merriam was , he saw as well as I did that they were exposing us as much as they were exposing themselves . Two could make little resistance in case of attack ; and , we argued , our safety depended upon keeping up with them , and preventing them , if possible , from running more foolish risks . So , picking up the guns they had left , we started after them , in the belief that it was a walk for life , and I have no doubt it was . On we went , unchallenged , through tollgates and past farm-houses . For the whole fifteen miles , Tidd and Coppoc never got over six rods ahead of us . During the race , some time before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to a house , waked the inmates , and asked the way to Chambersburg ! He felt pretty sure , he said afterwards , that this road led there , but he was not certain whether we were going towards or away from the town . Tidd was sitting in a fence-corner waiting for him as Merriam and I came up . I charged Tidd hurriedly , if at any time on the road he and Coppoc saw anybody , to conceal themselves ; if halted , or in any way shown that arrest was meant , we should be ready to make a desperate fight ; if merely spoken to they should let me answer for them . ' I had hardly said this , and Coppoc had not yet come out to us from the house , when a man came riding along the road . He had a fine horse , and looked like an officer of some kind . In the light of what I have since heard , I think he was . It is strange how we all felt like killing that // man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived like wild beasts so long that we felt blood-thirsty . We never knew for certain if he saw us . He did not at least think it prudent to speak , and rode on out of sight . Coppoc came out to us , and we rushed on - in the direction we had been taking all the time . As we drew nearer and nearer Chambersburg , I told the boys , as I had told them before , that it was not fair to expose Mrs. 2Ritner . She had probably disavowed any knowledge of us , and it . would be very easy to get her into trouble , without benefiting ourselves ; but they would go . In the outskirts of Chambersburg , finally , we stopped by a house on the corner of the street which led to Mrs. Ritner 's . Merriam , who had over-exerted himself , dropped down in the middle of this street , and lay with his luggage for a pillow . It was just before the break of day . As Tidd and Coppoc left us , I charged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come right back if they got no answer , and especially to make no alarm . They knocked at the door , but received no reply . Then Tidd went down into the garden and got a bean-pole and thumped on the secondstory window . Mrs. Ritner put her arm out of the window and motioned him away . At which be said , " Mrs. Ritner , do n't you know me ? I am Tidd . " " Leave , leave ! ** came back in a frightened whisper . " But we are hungry , " insisted Tidd . " I could n't help you if you were starving , " she whispered back again . " Leave ; the house is guarded by armed men ! " Tidd dropped his bean-pole , and the two came back to where we were lying in the street . It has always seemed to me next to a miracle that they were ever allowed to get away from that house . They were pretty well frightened and utterly discouraged . " What shall we do ? What shall we do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motionless on the ground , said nothing . " I will tell you what to do , " I said , picking up my bundle ; " but you 11 follow me this time ! " We could just see the first streaks of daylight . Telling Merriam to come on , we started . After we had gone some distance I turned to look for Merriam , but he was nowhere to be seen . I went back to the street-corner and found him still lying in the road . I jerked him up , and told him his life depended upon his walking a half mile or at most a mile farther to a hiding-place . Poor fellow ! he must have been fast asleep . I never got a chance , I believe , to ask him ; events were so hurried and exciting after that . We went out a suburban street till we came to a railroad which we followed as long as it went in the direction I wanted to take . Before we reached the thicket I intended to hide in , it became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught , if it had n't been for a cold mist that hung low upon the land after daylight . We went of course to the nearest hidingplace , a partially wooded field in the outskirts of the town . The falling of the leaves had made it much more dangerous than I had expected to find it . I had seen the place before in summer . We finally found a patch of briers in the middle of the field , and crawling into it , made our bed there . We could have been easily surrounded , as you see : so here almost all day long we did not dare even to sit up ; and , notwithstanding the extraordinary fatigue of the night before , we had not tune , even if we had thought it safe , to sleep . A railroad ran by one side of the field , and we could distinctly see the trains pass during the day . Our field was bounded on the other sides by traveled roads and the suburban streets of Chambersburg . It was a cold , frosty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys lie still . Indeed , ever after that , they oddly enough were always cautioning me to be prudent . A little before noon we heard martial music steadily approaching us , - not at all a pleasant sound under the circumstances . Then after a while it stopped ; and , in perhaps five or ten minutes more , a train went shooting by 356 // on the neighboring railroad . The martial music then started up again at what we supposed afterwards to be the railway station , and gradually marched out of hearing . It was , as I have since heard , the escort that took poor Cook from the jail to the depot : and the train we saw was the one that bore him away to Charlestown , and , as you know , to death . We of course were not aware of this at the time . We had some expectation , as I told you , that Cook might try to join us at this hiding-place ; and when , shortly afterwards , a man appeared in our field , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question soon made for the edge of the timber , and began firing a gun . We thought that a bold signal , but were really astonished at nothing from Cook . So we raised ourselves as nearly to our feet as we dared , in order to watch his movements . He was aiming his gun at the tree-tops , evidently at squirrels , and coming around to where we got a better view of him , we decided it was not Cook . A cold rain , with snow and sleet , set in about noon . This was no doubt a greater protection to us than the briers , - so near to a populous town as we were . There were three or four yokes of oxen running loose in the field . An ox came browsing near our thicket , and by his disturbed manner called the attention of the whole drove to us . They would stare at us , then start off and come back in a way that would give warning of something wrong to any one knowing oxen . We dared not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dogs know as quickly as anybody when people are acting strangely . At last , to our infinite relief , they seemed to have settled the matter among themselves , or at least satisfied their curiosity , for they went away of their own accord . While we were lying there we had determined that in the exhausted condition of Merriam , it would be best to run the risk of sending him on by rail . Extended on my back , I mended his overcoat , which had been torn , in our mountain travel , to a state of what I considered suspicious shabbiness . Being a bachelor , you know , I had a pair of scissors with my needles and thread ; and so when the tempest got worse , and it was safe to sit up a little , I clipped off his beard as close as I could shingle it . What was especially fortunate for Merriam just then was the fact that he wore a glass eye ; and this glass eye fitted him so well that he could turn it , or at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did the other one . That and his beard gone , Merriam was pretty thoroughly dis*uised . We discussed Merriam 's leaving , more or less , all day long . Coppoc wanted to go with him . I whispered myself hoarse , trying to convince him that he ought not to go . I was glad when , in the afternoon , a high wind arose as an accompaniment to the storm , and we dared speak aloud . We shivered with the rain and sleet as we argued . I told Coppoc he would excite suspicion if he went with Merriam . " We need you with us , " I said , " and you need yourself with us , - for defense , and especially to keep warm nights . We have lost too many already ; we shall freeze if we lose any more now . When it is safe , you shall be the next to go . " Merriam , poor fellow , was so weak and worn that there *was not much warmth in him . He was , you understand , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he could n't have walked any farther anyhow . The snow and sleet stopped for a while as we were still arguing , and as I turned over on my elbow and looked at Coppoc , I could see that great tears had fallen and hung quivering on his waistcoat . He was thinking , perhaps , of his Quaker home in Iowa , and of his widowed mother there ; perhaps of his brother whom he supposed killed ; or maybe , he was in utter despair . I never knew ; I never asked him . None of us spoke for a long time . The wind blew more violently than ever , and the rain and sleet came down again , and washed away the traces of the man 's weakness , - if it was weakness . Towards night a boy came riding a horse into our field , evidently in search of something . He rode clear around 357 ! // our brier-patch , passing within sixteen feet of us . As I lay on my back , I turned my head just enough to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years old . Suddenly his face brightened , and he began hallooing at the oxen , of which I suppose he had just caught sight . He had come after them , it seems ; and getting them all together he took them and himself from the field . I did not think the boy saw us . Some of the others thought he did ; and so we had added to the fatigues and dangers of the day , the uncertainty whether he had not gone to give the alarm to Chambersburg . It was my plan now to keep on still in a northwesterly direction , which would take me , I felt pretty sure , toward Meadville and some old friends in Crawford County , Pennsylvania . If it were not safe there , that was also in the direction of Ashtabula County , Ohio , where brother John was ; and that , if unsafe , was as good a way as any toward Canada . We thought best to leave in this brier-patch all of Merriam 's arms except a pistol and such ammunition as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three , who were to continue the journey afoot , left also , in the same place , three Sharp&amp;s carbines , three heavy full cartridge-boxes fitted with belts , and everything in the way of arms , in fact , except our navy revolvers and one heavy gun each . Merriam had furnished a good deal of money to the cause . He would take only five dollars from me when making his preparations to part with us . He said he had money enough to get through with . A driving snow set in that night , and it was as dark as I ever saw it in my life . We could see almost nothing at all . We started together for the road bordering the side of the field opposite the railway . In this road Tidd an ( l Coppoc bade Merriam goodby and God-speed . Leaving them in a fence-corner , I took Merriam by the hand - it was so dark and he was so feeble - and led him to the railroad . Then I walked a little way on the track with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , take the direction away from Chambersburg , and reach the first station outside of that town before taking a train . Our plan was that he should thereafter go north as directly as he could . So I left . him on the track - I will not tell you of the affecting leave-taking - and found my way back to Tidd and Coppoc , through the darkness and blinding snowstorm . Perhaps you would like to know that Merriam got safely back to his friends . The next I heard of him was some years afterward , out in the far West on the plains , with a hunting-party . He returned , and was one morning found dead in his bed in New York . Tidd , Coppoc , and I , leaving the public road , now started across the country . The first creek or mill-race in our way we got over well enough , for we trusted ourselves to a regular ford . After a while , however , we came to a creek swollen by the recent rain till it was at least five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Somehow we could see the stream much plainer than we could the snow on its banks . The water was very swift . We got in up to our hips . When I reached the other side , I could not feel my bare feet on the snow , they were so numb . Getting up the steep bank we were greeted by the boisterous bar king of a dog . A road passed along this bank with a farm-house on one side of it and a barn on the other . We went right on , following this road till it forked , and then taking the left hand , which we thought our direction . It was so very dark that of course we were not sure , and so , after going about a mile on this left-hand road , we decided to return to the barn and seek shelter in defiance of the dog . We made our bed in a shed at the end of the barn nearest to the road . The dog got tired of barking when he found we paid no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard some chickens in the barn .

Even hard corn had been scarce with us lately ; and we should not have waited Owen Brown 's Escape from iTnrper 's Perry . // to cook them . We slept two or three hours in the shed - slept beautifully , our blankets and ourselves steaming with the wet and warmth . Then it stopped snowing and the stars came out . The same left-hand road we had turned back from we found to be the right one , when we resumed our way . We walked on briskly in a northwest direction , pas5C ( l a house with a larger and even more boisterous dog , and kept up our speed for the rest of the night . We could see the black line of the mouitains in the distance , and saw , too , that we could not reach them before daylight . The snow was two or three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be obliged to stay all day in the midst of a thickly-inhabited country , where we could be easily surrounded . Finally , just before sunrise , we passed a farmhouse and followed a series of gullies about a mile , till we found a brier-patch , in the midst of which we spread our blankets , and cut other briers to cover ourselves with , and went to sleep . About noon that day the sun came out , melting the snow and waking us . Cows and sheep passed us occasionally . After a while a boy came along , leading a dog . It was very lucky for us that the boy was leading him , for the dog got scent of us , and tugged at his rope to get to us . Jerking him a long , the boy cursed the animal for his stupidity in wanting to hang himself . He probably came much nearer hanging us , as we thought at the time . In the open country that way , with such enormous rewards upon our heads , our lives , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dog 's cord . About dusk two pigs came wandering near us , andl sallied stealthily forth , hoping to catch and smother one of them . I tried for as much as an hour , and failed . It was an impruilent thing to do , I know , but .1 was very hungry and the pigs were very fat . So I stole up into a neighboring field and gathered what had become our somewhat irre0ular rations of dry , hard corn . Then we lay still in our brier-patchilli night . It was very dark , but I could see the dull line of the mountains in the distance , and we made for them with all possible speed and directness . Within a few miles of the mountains we brought up on a road leading straight towards them . Risking ourselves upon the highway , we after awhile came to one of those Pennsylvania barns , which we were sure was red without being able or needing to see the color . I went groping clear around this barn twice before I found the door , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in to search for chickens . I caught an old Jersey Blue hen and a rooster , and wrung their necks without allowing them to make any noise . Putting them into the provision bag , - the one that is under the bed there now. , - we hurried on . Suddenly we came upon a village . Tidd and Coppoc were in advance , and I was trying to catch up with them , when right in the heart of the village I met three or four men . I had got past them , when whisk ! away went my hat in the wind , and I had to run back with my bag of poultry , to pick it up . These men were so absorbed in talking about the " powerful exhortation " of Brother Somebody , that they did not take much notice of me . I suppose they had been at some prayermeeting . It might have been Sunday night , too . Catching up with Tidd and Coppoc , I remonstrated with them upon the danger of separating so , in such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came upon a gorge , where we built a fire and went to dressing our hen and rooster . As soon as Tidd had picked the leg of the hen , he cut it off and be0an roasting it . It was nowhere near done when be began upon it , crunching the bones , and swallowing everything . After we had had a taste none of us could wait for the old hen to cook . We ate her almost raw . Tidcl , burning the bones , ate them , too . Putting the dressed rooster into the bag and burning the feathers , we started farther up the mountain to a good hidin0-piace . It was a very thickly settled country . Men and teams passed not very far from us daring the day . The next night , as we 859 // were crossing a pleasant valley , we heard voices along the road on which we had ventured . We hastily crouched in the shadow of a fence-corner , and there walked by , in the bright moonlight , two pairs of young people , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could see their faces as well as hear what they said when they passed . Each couple was far enough from the other to speak confidentially . They were evidently returning from some late country merry-making . This same night we surprised an apple-orchard and helped ourselves plentifully , and filled our provision bag . Not till the second or third night after eating the hen did we dare build a fire to cook the rooster . It was a pleasant spot where we roasted him ; beside a spring in a little hollow surrounded by beech and hemlock , the mountain-top towering just above us , and bristling against the sky with pitch-pine . We had salt ! Tidd , besides eating perhaps too many apples , also ate the burned bones of the rooster . A night or so afterwards , I had the luck to catch four or five chickens in a barn . These of course went better , when we got a chance to cook them . That was not till we came to a little shanty in a wild place on the mountain-top . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had been there to peel hemlock bark for tanning . We came to this shanty just before daylight one rainy morning . It was a mere hut of logs , covered with bark . Some stones were laid up in a corner for a fire-place . The bare earth was the floor . We knew that the bark-peclers work in the spring , and so we felt comparatively safe and happy , - all but Tidd , who had been complaining ever since he ate so many hen and rooster bones . We built a comfortable fire in the hut , and cooked a couple of spring chickens , and ate what apples we had left . It was the first house we had been in for many a day and many a night ; it seemed several weeks , - I shall not attempt to tell you how many it really was , for I should , make some mistake . Coppoc and I slept splendidly as the rain poured down on our bark-roof . Waking up in the afternoon we found Tidd still complaining . Coppoc and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wild turkeys , but could not get a shot at them . When we reached the hut again we found Tidd groaning and unable to go on that night . * left Coppoc to nurse him , and after dark went down the mountain for more provisions . About three miles away , I discovered an orchard , and filled my bag with apples , climbed back again , and found Tidd pretty sick . We did not any of us sleep much that night , for watching and taking care of him . It was almost providential that we had a roof and a fire for the poor fellow , or he might never have recovered . It rained the next day , and we stayed at the hut with Tidd , who began to get better . Late the next night he felt able to travel , and we started . Our course to the northwest , now , and till we left the mountains altogether , took us from one range to another , instead of along the tops and sides , making our work much slower and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helped ourselves pretty freely to the chickens and apples of the wealthy Pennsylvanians as we passed ; occasionally milking their cows for them , too . One night I got hold of a guinea-fowl , and she made an infernal noise ; but we cooked her , nevertheless , in the neighboring mountains . Once an old cow would not stand to be milked , and I went after some corn to persuade her . The granary was within a few feet of the house where the people were sleeping ; I could not reach the grain from the outside of the granary , and so I had the temerity to open the door and climb in , and fill my pockets with corn . The cow yielded now , and we milked her dry . One night a red fox came around our bed and barked at us , in the way foxes have , circling off and coming back six or eight times . lit might have been dangerous for him , if he had been good to eat ; as it was , he finally disappeared , unharmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public roads by night . ' This had become our regular practice , when I had 360 March , // that terrible sick headache . It is strange that none of us seemed to have any ailments , on dry hard corn , - except a little dizziness from being so weak ; but as soon as we got the luxuries of chickens and guinea-fowl , apples , and salt , this sort of trouble commenced . It was about midnight when I crawled up into the woods , and lay down , telling the boys I could go no farther . I slept one or two hours , got up perfectly well , and walked on with the others . I never cured a sick headache so easily before or since . We did not know where we were , except that we were somewhere in the State of Pennsylvania , and we at last thought we would risk the roads by daylight . So one sunny morning , beside a clear spring , we made our toilets for that purpose , putting on clean shirts and mending our clothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We rolled our shoulder-straps and ammunition into our blankets , and drew our woolen covers over our guns , and started . Our first encounter was with a man on horseback , riding the same way we were going . He looked suspiciously at us , we were so gaunt , besides carrying guns . We talked him out of his suspicion , however , and into so friendly a mood that one of us , I think it was Coppoc , rode his horse as much as a mile for him , while the stranger walked along with us . I had heard there were Quakers at a place called Bellefonte , and I hoped we might be somewhere near there . Quakers , you know , were always our friends , being great antislavery people . I thought one or more of us might hire out to some Quaker , assuming a name or names , till the heat of the pursuit was over . The man told us that Bellefonte was a good way on , he did n't know how far . We were , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We were aching to ask about Harper 's Ferry , but dared not , and finally our informant mounting his horse , turned up a lane and disappeared . We shortly afterward went into an orchard in plain daylight and helped ourselves to some apples , - a feat which was thought nothing of in that country of abundance . Then we resumed our journey to the Juniata . We bought some doughnuts of the woman who ferried us over that river , and some bread and butter . We now took our way along the tow-path of the canal , which we came to on the other side of the stream . We kept on till long after dark , when a canal-boat overtaking us , we asked the captain where he was going . He said to some falls , - Hamilton Falls , I think , - about seven miles away , and invited us on board . We got into the place where the hay for the horses was kept , and had a comfortable bed , the captain joining us there in a friendly way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He refused to take money for our ride , and we left him at the town ( whatever its name was ) , before daylight , so that he never knew how shabby and haggard we . were . We walked on six or seven miles upon the main road toward Bellefonte , and then camped away from th' highway , near an old farm-house , occupied only by a couple of horses . We stayed there till about dark the next night , and starting upon the public road again , we had gone hardly a mile when we saw a nice little farm-house on our left , a short distance from the road . The light of the blaze in the old-fashioned fire-place came out through the curtainless window with so cheery an invitation to us , that we could not go by . We knocked at the door and obtained permission of the honest , simple-minded farmer to stay all night . The stout , Pennsylvanian woman , the farmer 's wife , when we were seated , gave the logs in the fireplace a vigorous punch , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way you ha ' *e seen them , I suppose , before now ; and it was not long till the fumes of frying flap-jacks went up after them . If she had not been so good-natured , her suspicions might have been aroused by the ravenous appetites with which we devoured what she put before us , when she bade us be seated at supper . Towards the close of that meal , the farmer in a casual sort of way men-361 // tioned harper 's Ferry , and then we asked him for news . We had already in some indirect manner learned from our host that it was the 4th of November . Thus we had been about three weeks in our houseless wanderings , without positive knowledge of the fate of our comrades , - it seemed at least six weeks ; and I can never get over a queer impression that it was longer than it really was . We told our host that we had heard something about the fight at Harper 's Ferry , but not all the particulars . This surprised him greatly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excited about anything in twenty years . He added that his weekly newspaper had just come that afternoon , and we could read it . Perhaps you can have an idea how painful was the suspense , waiting till we could decently rise from the table and lay hands upon that paper . Tidd 's stoicism broke down first ; he arose and caught up the paper and began reading aloud . The first thing that caught his eye was the account of Cook 's capture . You can imagine how eagerly Coppoc and I listened to the first we had heard of Cook since he had left us in the mountains . Our host interrupted the reading to assure me that one son of old Smith , who had proved to be old Brown of Kansas , had escaped with Cook and others , and was supposed to be still at large somewhere . Old man Brown was not dead , as we had heard . No , he was just severely wounded ; it was not certain yet whether he would live to be hanged , for he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had so long thought my father dead , this somehow had the effect of good news . In the mean time , Tidd had gone on , silently devouring the paper . I could see that he was much moved by what he read . He was probably reading how his friend Stevens was shot down while going on an errand of mercy and bearing a flag of truce . Coppoc sat gazing thou0htfully into the blaze of the great fire-place , and I happened to be looking at him when our host went on to say that the very latest news was that the man Coppoc had been tried , too , and found guilty . That was his brother Edwin , and the ruddy glare of the fire did not paint out the deathly white of our poor Coppoc 's face . He did not speak , but a little while after , he stealthily brushed away a tear from one of his cheeks , and sighed in a halfchoked way . Somehow my two brothers , Watson and Oliver , had not been mentioned . It might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was - I did not have the heart to ask about them . After a few moments of silence , Tidd handed the newspaper to me . I began reading aloud for Coppoc 's benefit . I saw my own name in large letters somewhere near the middle of the page , and I began on that . Before I was fully aware what I was doing , I was half-way through a minute description of myself . Then I dared not stop . Finishing that paragraph with the extravagant rewards offered for my capture , I turned and read from the beginning the account of the fight - how the little band had taken the town and held it all day against the States of Virginia and Maryland . But when I came to read the well-known passage from Governor Wise 's speech : " And Colonel Washington said that he - Brown - was the coolest man he ever saw in defying death and danger . With one son dead by his side , and another shot through , he felt the pulse of his dying son with one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commanded his men with the utmost composure , encouraging them to be firm and sell their lives as dearly as possible " - well , that told me too much ; my voice trembled so that I passed the paper to Coppoc . He read how our relative , Thompson , was butchered when a prisoner , and how my brother Watson was shot while carrying a flag of truce , and , though mortally woun ( led , fought till the gun fell from his hands . The farmer 's wife , detecting the tremor in my voice , - with the quick sympathy that women have , - paused in her domestic work until the reading was over , though , as she said , she had read it all before . The 4th of November is my 862 // birthday , and certainly that was the most memorable one of my life . We sat by the fire and talked of the dead and wounded as long as we dared , and then went to bed . After breakfast the next morning , having paid our host , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quaker families along the road . He told us of a Quaker by the name of Benjamin Wakefield , who lived some twenty miles off , not in the direction of Bellefonte , but , as I surmised , more nearly in the line of Towaville , Crawford County , Pennsylvania , where I had an old schoolmate . I resolved , without , of course , telling our host , that we would go to Wakefield 's . We had before this determined what names we should assume ; mine was Edward Clark ; Tidd 's was Charles Plummer ; Coppoc 's was George Barclay . It was a bright , cheerful day , and we walked on by the road through a village , where I let Tidd go into a store and buy a pocket map . Neither he nor Coppoc had been seen much about Harper 's Ferry , so they were not described , as I was . With the people we met or who overtook us during the day , we talked freely , telling them we were wood-choppers looking for work . When they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wages , or made some such difficulty . Our guns , however , were always against us , attracting too much notice . When Harper 's Ferry became the subject of our talk with strangers , we never of course seemed to know any more than what we had read in the paper . This was , if I am not mistaken , Saturday , and about sundown we came to a private lane leading , as we were told , from the public road up to Mr. Wakefield 's . We thought best to have Tidd go ahead to the house . He found Mr. Wakefield and his son loading wheat . He told the benevolent-faced old gentleman that we had heard of him as a kind , neighborly man , and that he and two more friends would like to put up with him for the night . " Thee and thy friends may come , " said the Quaker . But when we appeared with our guns , he held up his hands in awe , and told 363 us we could not bring our guns into his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rules , I do n't know ; but we argued the case a while and then hit upon the lucky compromise that we should take the loads out of the guns . We had hardly got inside the house , however , when he startled us by saying , in his calm way , that he knew who we were , - we were from Harper 's Ferry . We asked him how he knew that . He said we were so gaunt . He knew we were hunted like wild beasts , and that fact and our cause were a short cut to his heart . We found the house a nice , cleanly one , and the two trim ( laughters who were the housekeepers ( the mother I think was ( lead ) soon got us a splendid supper . While that was preparing we went out and helped load the wheat . After supper we talked long about slavery and the struggles and losses of our family in Kansas . He made us stay over the next day - Sunday , if my impression is right - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sight . He said that we had better travel for a while again only by night . lie knew that we were hotly pursued . lie stocked us with provisions enough to last two or three days , and would take no money for them or our entertainment . He showed us our way on the pocket-map , - this one here open before me now . We were to go about forty miles to a cousin of his , a Quaker living a mile out of a place called , I think , half-Moon . We parted with our good host on Sunday night , and traveled on two or three nights slowly as usual and as far as possible from the highway . Having eaten all our provisions we took to apples and corn again . Venturing once more upon the road , our guns excited so much suspicion that we were forced back into the woods and hills . Making a descent upon a hen-roost , we were pretty nearly betrayed by the squawking of our prey . Finally , late one night we approached what we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being near his cousin 's . We had the good fortune to meet a man just outside the little town , and he showed us our way // to the . Quaker 's . We walked boldly through the village out to the farmhouse , and aroused the inmates . I have forgotten this Quaker 's name , I am sorry to say . We told him as he leaned out of a window that Mr. Wakefield had sent us to him , and he seemed disposed to let us in ; but at this stage of the interview another window , apparently in the same second-story room , opened and three night-capped heads were thrust out . No , we could n't come in , any such thing , they cried in chorus . They knew who we were ; we were traitors ; and our lives were forfeit . We said that we had merely risked our lives for the freedom of millions of helpless slaves . They replied that they were not in favor of slavery , themselves , but they were also not in favor of putting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the night-caps . The man was on our side , but when he said anything in our favor it seemed to go worse with us than ever . His ar0uments excited more fury in the night-caps than - ours did . We offered to pay them twice any sum they would ask . What was money to them when we were traitors and carried wicked guns , besides ? We offered to give them up our guns . At this the voice of what I took to be the old lady said , " Oh , " and one night-cap disappeared ; it might have been in terror , it might have been in consenting . Then the two younger voices said , " Well , father , if you want to take in murderers , you may , but do n't ask us to wait on them ! " and the two other night-caps disappeared , and the windows both went down . It seems an amusing scene to you , yet it was pretty serious to us ; and we stood there wonderin0 what was to be our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the man of the house not daring to take us in - when the door opened and the Quaker told us we might enter . He showed us promptly to beds . At breakfast the next morning , the mother and her two daughters would not eat with us . The man would not take any money for his entertainment . So we all went out into his field with him , and fell to husking corn . At dinnertime the women folks seemed to be somewhat mollified , and we prevailed upon them to take some curious silver coins we had . Tidd and Coppoc went back to work in the field in the afternoon , while I went into the village and made my preparations for getting rid of our guns , and of sending Coppoc home by stage and railroad . I bought a carpet-bag for each of us . Here 's mine , now . I went to two or three shoeshops before I could get a box that would do to store our guns , cartridge-boxes , and all the little things once Cook 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quaker 's with the box on my shoulder , I proceeded to pack it . I put in these bags , with the rest , and the pistol formerly carried by General Washington , the one that Cook had , as I told you before . By the way , Colonel Washington next year wrote to Thaddeus Hyatt , I think , pleading for that ancestral relic . We sent it to him , asking for some things of ours , but we never got them . Well , our box was shipped by stage and rail with Coppoc for Salem , Columbiana County , Ohio . The next morning Coppoc very joyfully took the stage and arrived safely at his old home among the friendly Quakers . In the fall of 1861 , he enlisted a squad of men to join the company of W. R. Allen of Jefferson , Ashtabula County , for Lane 's Brigade in Kansas . While on the way with his men , and while passing over the railroad between Hannibal and St. Joseph , Missouri , he was killed by the falling of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which had been nearly sawed in two at night by the bushwhacking rebels of Missouri . The Quaker women were still more friendly at supper-time , and got up quite a sympathy with treason before we parted . The Quaker himself yet persisted in taking no money from us . Tidd and I started afoot with our carpetbags , the same morning on which Coppoe took the stage . We kept away from railways and telegraphs as much as possible , traveling right through 364 March , // towns and stopping at farm-houses , lest I should be recognized by my description . We still pretended to be woodchoppers , looking for work . We each had a good navy revolver with cartridges , and were resolved not to be taken alive . This here now is the one I had . I carried it in Kansas . Our plan was to go directly to my old friend 's at Townville . That too was about as straight a way as any to Ashtabula County , Ohio , where my brother John was . We went by daylight , averaging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snowed most of the time . At Brookville , I remember , Tidd wrote a letter and I mailed it to some of his people . It was some time after this that father , in Charlestown jail , heard of my safety , and sent me money and that opera-glass there . Passing through Clarion and Shippensville , we came after a while to Franklin , the present centre of the coaloil region . We stopped at a country tavern in the outskirts of the town . The oil business was just begun at that time . From Franklin we went up Sugar Creek to Randolph , where we stayed a day or so with old Mr. Gilbert , who helped my father build his first tannery in Richmond , Pennsylvania . One afternoon we walked over to Townville , and into the store of Mr. George B. DelamaLer , the old friend I have told you of . Mr. Delamater was not in , but his partner , Mr. Orange Noble , now of Erie , Pennsylvania , whom I had never seen before , took me aside and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had seen . He whispered to me that I might feel perfectly safe ; and when Delamater came in he knew me , although we had not met in twenty-five or thirty years . He took us both home , and un ( ler assumed names we went to work . Tidd , in the course of a week , was sent somewhere down on Oil Creek , where he stayed a long time . It is strange that the poor fellow should have lived through so much , to die with fever at last in the war of the Rebellion . I stayed at Townville several weeks , till suspicious persons came about looking for me , and then began a series of flights from one place to another , for myself and brothers John and Jason . Jason lived at Akron , Ohio . I went to Oil Creek , thence to Elk Creek , and finally to Ashtabula County , Ohio , for none of us for months dared stay very long in one place . On the 4th of July , 1860 , the first one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our family , and all of father 's company , then living , except Tidd , who was still in the oil regions , - came together at North Elba , New York . Through the instrumentality of Miss Kate Field , and the liberality of herself and others , the North Elba farm has been bought and given to our family ; to no one individual member , you understand , but to all of us , as the place where father 's body is buried . That 4th of July was the last time that our family has ever been together . John and I have been here on this island for some years . My stepmother , with my half-brother Salmon , and three half-sisters - one of them married - lives at Rohnerville , Humboldt County , California . My brother Jason lives at Akron , Ohio ; and my sister Ruth , married to Henry Thompson , lives in Wisconsin . Thus , you see , there are still eight of us children . Father 's was the last death in the family . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if we had only been allowed to live , - that is , if we had n't been murdered in Kansas , and shot and hanged in Virginia .
