txt The events of the last month have attracted an unusual degree of attention to the railway interest of the country . The fact that the first great failure , consequent on the break in stocks in September , was that of a firm which had devoted a , great part of its energies and its capital to the promotion of a monster railroad enterprise , led almost inevitably to an eager examination of railway enterprises generally , and this examination was made the more imperative by the fact that all but a very small fraction orthe stocks dealt in on the Stock Exchange wore those of railways . So far , the effects of the panic have been felt more largely by the owners of these stocks that by any others . How far this will continue to be the ease , can not nalt be determined with any certainty . There are , as we have said , some excellent reasons why the general trade of the country may be expected to recover a considerable part of the ground it has lost in consequence of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bear in mind that the effect of a severe check to the railway interest must , sooner or later , be shared by the whole country . It will not necessarily be disastrous . On the contrary , it is quite possible that the country may gradually adjust itself to the new order of things without permanent injury . But the railways are too great , and too much complicated with the other industries of the country , to admit of any decided injury happening to them without . making its mark in a great many directions . This will be seen if we consider for a moment the facts that disclose the enormous extent of our railway system . Our railroads now reach the unparalleled length of more than 60,000 miles . They have been constructed at a reputed cost of $3,000,000,000 . How much of this amount represents actual capital paid in , it is impossible to say . Good authorities place it at $2,400,000,000 . But it is plain that the roads are expected to pay profits on the whole , and this fact discloses the vastness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than forty per cent. ? that is , more than $1,200 , - 000,000 ? is in bonded indebtedness , the interest ou which the railways must pay . It is difficult to say exactly what the average rate of interest is , but it is certainly not less than seven per cent. , and ie probably more , calculated in currency . This tax on the roads reaches the sum of $84,000,000 , and may not improbably reach the sum of $100,000,000 , as the published figures do not come clown later than about the middle of the year 1872 . Uuder these circumstances , it is not strange that of the dozen or so leading stocks quoted on the . New-Turk Exchange , only three , before the panic , were selling at par , while nearly all the remainder brought less than seventy-five per cent . of par . Of the 364 railway lines enumerated in Mr. POOR 'S manual , for the years 1872 and 1E373 , only 104. are sot down as paying dividends , and the dividends which are reported are not on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the bonds . The same authority reports the gross earnings.of the railroads at $454,769,000 , which is about . fifteen per cent . on their nominal cost . The net earnings are about one-third of this amount , or $145,000,000 . At the same time , it must be borne in mind that there is another side to the picture . If railways have been built more rapidly , or at greater cost than would enable them to earn sure dividends an the capital invested in them , their proprietors have not been without reason to suppose that they could be made to pay . The railroads built have , iu almost every case , proved a marvelous stimulant to the traffic on which they depend . It is estimated by Mr. POOR that in 1851 the tonnage carried by the railways was at the rate of only 464 pounds to the head Of population . Ten years later , when the length of the roads had trebled , the ratio of tonnage to population was 1,912 pounds per head ; and in 1871 , the mileage having then doubled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same progress is shown still more strikingly by the record of the valve of the tonnage . In 1S51 this was $35 34 per head ; in 1861 it was $116 42 per head , and in 1871 it was $375 per head . These facts show the vast extent of our railway system , as well as the intrinsic connection with the general business of the country . It is not likely that for the next twelvemonth the new enterprises in railway building can be carried on . It is certain that the weaker roads will find it difficult to meet their interest , and , in order to do so , will require to cut down running expenses and repairs to the lowest safe point . This will reduce the demand for labor in the first instance . It will also reduce the demand for those products of labor which are employed by the railroads . This decrease in the demand for labor will compel a decrease in general expenditure , and therefore a falling off in the general demand for commodities , and a shrinkage of greater or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must make up its mind , and there is only one way by which it can be met  --  by steady and prudent economy . We need not say that the check this will impose on trade is very different from that imposed by fear in regard to general solvency , or in respect to the sufficiency of the currency . Prudence is not panic , and economy is not boarding . The latter ought to be , and probably will be , - temporary . The former are but the suggestions of common sense , and the country will be helped , not embarrassed , by their adoption .
