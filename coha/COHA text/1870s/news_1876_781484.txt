txt Judge KELLEY and the school of inflationists which he most accurately represents have a way of making figurative and metaphorical assertions in regard to matters of trade and finance which is very unsatisfactory to clear-headed people who are not fond of the marvelous . A year ago , when Judge KELLEY opened the campaign in Ohio for ancient WILLIAM ALLEN , and predicted that labor would soon take capital by the throat , and re-enact the manes of the French Revolution we understood him as being of opinion that matters here were in a desperate condition with the laboring classes . But the Judge has succeeded in picking up material for another speech , including a table of the duties levied on imports by the French Government. , which fills fodrieen pages of the Covgressional Record , and four pages of scraps from various authors who think the ocean was not made to be desecrated by navigation . In this second speech , which , after the manner of Sophomores , is labeled " Our country ; the means of maintaining its unity , increasing its power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Munchausen of economists tells us with a solemn face that free trade and internal taxation have in about a third of a century " shaken the foundations of England 's commercial and manufacturing supremacy ; " that more than half a century ago ( viz. , in 1821 ) she " impoverished " her working people by the premature resumption of specie payments ; ( 3 ) that " her condition is this hour more deplorable than our own in all save the accumulation in the hands of her plutocracy of almost countless capital , " and ( 4 ) that the British plutocrats , with countless capital , far from being in a state of bliss , " are emigrating by millions , not only to this broad continent , but to the remote and unexplored islands of the sea I " Here , indeed , is a pretty near approach to the oftpredicted general bankruptcy and ruin . Laborers impoverished fifty-five years agar by a premature resumption of specie pay-. ments , after a suspension . of only a quarter of a century ; the same laborers , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last man by free trade and an honest collection of the excise duties on whisky and tobacco ; the plutocrats , or " holders of capital. , " having nothing left on which to fatten , emi grating by millions to remote and unexplored islands in search of a judicious tariff  --  truly , it is a spectacle on which the congregation of the veracious KELLEY " may gaze with sympathy and pity . " ' Where are the evidences that such a state of wretchedness not only exists in England but has existed there ever since the resumption of gold payments in 1821 ? We search for them in vain in the mazes of the French tariff ; among metres and kilogrammes , carbonates and acetates . No doubt this country has natural advantages of soil . and climate and cheap and abundant land , which have lifted its laboring population to a position superior to that of the masses of any other country , nor do we think they could be altogether deprived of this advantage by the total suppression of their foreign trade . What surprises us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to knowledge of the social condition of the English laborer should deny that that condition has been one of gradual but almost uninterrupted improvement for the last forty years . We have a few statistics ' on this subject to present , bearing , in our opinion , very directly on the point at issue . We have taken them from the official British Statistical Abstract , and they give the quantities per head of the principal imported and excisable articles retained for home consumption by the inhabitants of the United Kingdom . The years taken for comparison are 1853 , when important reductions in the tariff were made by Mr. GLADSTONE and the income tax re-established for seven years to supply the revenue sacrificed in the Customs , and 1874 , the last year for which the Abstract has been issued . These official figures tell us that in 1853 the home consumption of raw and refined sugars was 303 pounds per head , and in 1874 had increased to 563 pounds  --  in other words , nearly doubled . The consumption of tea increased from 2.14 pounds to 4.23 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pounds ; of currants and raisins , from 1.78 pounds to 4.48 pounds . Each article is used by the impoverished laborer of England in double or treble the quantities that were used by him before free trade and honest excisemen undermined ' the pros . perity of Britain . But the class of men who , in their own opinion , were to be ruined by the removal of exorbitant protective duties on the products of agriculture , were the land-holders . We have not heard that they are ruined . But the consumers of wheat and wheat flour have increased their purchases of foreign products from an average of 78 pounds for the six years from 1853 to 1858 , inclusive , to 154 pounds for the years 1869 to 1874 , inclusive . Of bacon and hams , the importation and home consumption per head has increased nearly ten-fold  --  from 0.81 pounds in 1853 to 7.84 pounds in 1874 ; of cheese , from 1.57 pounds to 5.03 pounds ; of butter , from 1.60 pounds to 5.51 pounds , and of eggs , from 4 ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record of a people who start in an linpoyerished condition and are ruined without mercy every year for half a century ? We next come to spirits , the use of which has sc often been represented as ruining the Brit ? ish population . It is not disputed that tin excise and Customs duties have been collected during the whole period covered 133 our comparisons with extraordinary fidelity ? . We find that the combined consump tion of British and foreign spirits has increased from 1.10 gallons per head in 185i to 1.27 gallons in 1874 ? a rate of increase which is smaller than , is com mealy supposed . Of wine , the increase is from 0.25 gallons in.1853 to 0.53 gallons ii 1874 ; of tobacco , from 1.07 pounds to 1.44 pounds , and of malt , from 1.52 bushels te 1.94 bushels if any statistics bearing mon directly than these do on the economic con ? dition of the British laborer can be pro duced , we should be glad to see them . Un til they are produced we feel justified in de murrieg to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ payment and a revenue tariff throughout the King dom of great Britain and Ireland .
