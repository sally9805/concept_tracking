During the proceedings ' ne and his many friends shed tears . The House is rushing forward the impeachment proceedings against Treasurer Renfroe . It was to-day discussing the propriety of the removal of John Nelms , principal Keeper of the Penitentiary , for malfeasance in office , when a member , in a fiery speech , declared that not Nelms , but Gov . Colquitt , was guilty principally , as he knew all that was going on in Nelms 's office . This created a sensation on the floor and in the galleries . Another member heartily approved the sentiment , and offered resolutions declaring that the Governor is responsible to the people for this wrong , and expressing severe condemnation of him .

What the result to-morrow will be it is impossible to say certainly .
