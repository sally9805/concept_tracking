ARTICLE VIJI-MR . MORLEY 'S " VOLTAIRE " AND " ROUSSEAU ? ' Voltaire . By JOHN MORLEY . New York : D. Appleton &amp; Co. 1872. l2mo , pp. 354 . Rousseau . By JOHN MORLEY . Two volumes . London : Chapman &amp; HalL 1873. 8vo , pp. 344 , 342 . BooKs like these , whose titles we place at the head of this Article , are not written without a purpose . Accordingly , we are in no way surprised to find that the object of all this eloquent and elaborate criticism is no less than to assert the claims of Voltaire and Rousseau to be recognized as the two great apostles of the Religion of the Brotherhood of Humanity . We need hardly say that the Brotherhood of Humanity is no new faith . It was announced to the world in connection with the early days of the French Revolution ; when , according to the sanguine anticipations of its disciples , it was expected that it would not only chase away speedily the numberless superstitions which had become associated with Christianity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer to the religious aspirations of the advanced thought and feeling of modern times something final-something which no subsequent scepticism could make doubtful , and which all future discoveries in science should only serve to make more worthy of confidence . It will be remembered that the first triumphs of this religion were marked by the dedication in Paris of a " Pantheon , " in which the mortal remains of the two men who had done the most to prepare the way for the new order of things , after having been exhumed and transported " with the roar of cannon , the crash of trumpet and drum , and the wild acclamation of a populace gone mad in exultation , terror , fury , " were deposited with due solemnity , that they might prove there a solace and encouragement for mankind throughout all its subsequent generations . Then the days of reaction came . The disciples // of the new faith fell away . The Pantheon itself was reconsecrated to the worship of " the Tnfamous . " Yet a little band ever remained faithful ; and now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is less excuse for it-there are those , like Mr. Morley , who do not hesitate to avow that they can find rest and solace and spiritual nourishment only in these same views . In their opinion , the time of aggressive effort for the purpose of propagating their religious beliefs has come once more . Hence by a not unnatural coincidence this manifestation of increased life and power is heralded to the world by a new apotheosis of these same two great teachers of the eighteenth century ; and Voltaire and Rousseau are again singled out , and a place is demanded for them once more in the Pantheon of great men who deserve and should receive the veneration of an age which , it is claimed , is now reaping the fruits of their labors . Under these circumstances , some few words with regard to the character of the Religion of the Brotherhood of Mankind seem to be required . First of all , then , we may say that its disciples glory in the fact that they have thrown away all illusions . Their beliefs are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the influence of what they call an Oriental superstition , but they have been fashioned in conformity with the hard , uncompromising facts of existence . We have already said that they reject all theistic conceptions , and everything which can in any way flow from a belief in the existence of God . They , also , courageously reject all belief in a future state . Death is a final sleep . " We slide down into a sombre , echoless gulf of nothingness . " " The millions of the hewers of wood and drawers of water come on the earth , that greets them with no smile , stagger blindly under dull burdens for a season , and at last are shovelled silently back under the ground with no outlook and with no hope . " " The black and horrible grave is the end of our communion and we know one another no more . " But this religion is not all negation . There is a positive side Its disciples cherish positive beliefs to which they profess to be deeply attached , and in which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as truly as we do in our more complex faith . These beliefs , which they think will yet triumph over the dogmas of Christianity , they profess to have derived from their reading of the history of the past . They find that " there has been an awful procession of man from the region of impenetrable night . By his incessant struggle with the hardness of the material world , and his sublimer struggle with the hard world of his own egoistic passions , by pain and sacrifice , generation after generation has added some small piece to the temple of human freedom , or some new fragment to the ever incomplete sum of human knowledge , or some fresh line to the types of strong and beautiful character . " Accordingly , whatever this procession of good men , in all ages , in all countries , and of all religions , has gradually elaborated as highest and best , they accept as the rule of their spiritual life . The founders of Christianity have not failed to add something to the grand result . It is even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They have contributed " to the active intelligence of the West " such moods of holiness , as awe , reverence , and silent worship of an unseen not made with hands . But it is claimed that there is no necessity that these deepest moods of which man is capable " should ally themselves only with the anthropomorphic deities of a falling church . They may be connected with conceptions more spiritual " Accordingly the disciples of this faith connect them with " the great unseen host of our fellows who have gone before us , and who are to come after us . " They put themselves in sympathy with this unseen host- " the generations of the dead who have prepared the present and the generations of the future who may be affected by our activities " - and they profess that in the contemplation of this procession of good men , and in the consciousness that they are themselves in the line , as links in a chain , they find these moods of awe and reverence awakened within them . Mr. Morley says : " Those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no ecstasy and no terror , no heaven , no hell , in their religion , but they will have abundant moods of reverence , deep-seated gratitiide , and sovereign pitifulness. " // This religion , however , does not by any means expend itself in mere " moods . " Its disciples believe in action . They believe that by their efforts they can hasten on the time when a generation of men shall inherit the earth , who will be perfected in all that gives beauty and dignity and sweetness to character This may be long after they themselves have passed out of existence , and all memory of their lives has faded away forever . But in the contemplation of what they call the " sublime possibilities " of human destiny , they profess to find an encouragement to labor for the good of those who are to come after them . They claim that when these " imperial conceptions " have once taken possession of a man , they are not only sufficient to light up his soul with aspirations for all that is good and true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that henceforth " no natural energy of life shall be left idle or athirst . ' " Undivided love of his fellows , steadfast faith in human nature , steadfast search after justice , firm aspiration towards improvement , and generous contentment in the hope that others may reap whatever reward may be , will constitute the aim of his existence evermore . " Of the character , the claims , the prospects of this all-embracing faith , Mr. Morley has the right to speak with authority . He is perhaps its most able living hierophant . We accordingly transfer to our pages some of his utterances on the subject . He says : This IReligion " rests on a positive basis , which only becomes wider and firmer with the widening of experience , and the augmentation of our skill in interpreting it . " He contends that it is " not too transcendent for practical acceptance . " The moods of awe and reverence which it encourages " will not end in sterile exaltation , or the deathly chills of spiritual reaction . They will bring forth abundant fruit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " devout contemplation of the experience of the race , instead of raising a man into the clouds , brings him into the closest , loftiest , and most conscious relations with his kind , to whom he owes all that is of value in his own life , and to whom he can repay his debt by maintaining the beneficent tradition of service , by cherishing honor for all the true and // sage spirits that have shone upon the earth , and sorrow and reprobation for all the unworthier souls whose light has gone out in baseness . " Aceain . " One whose conscience has been strengthened from b youth in this faith , can know no greater bitterness than the stain east by wrong act or unworthy thought on the high memories with which he has been used to walk , and the discord wrought in the hopes which have become the ruling harmonies of his days . " And still again : " A man with this faith can have no foul spiritual pride , for there is no mysteriously accorded divine grace in which one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no incentives to that mutilation with which every branch of the church , from the oldest to the youngest and crudest , has in its degree afflicted and retarded mankind , because the key-note of his religion is the joyful energy of every faculty , practical , reflective , creative , contemplative , in pursuit , of a visible common good ; and he can be plunged into no fatal and paralyzing despair by any doctrine of mortal sin , because active faith in humanity , resting on recorded experience , discloses the many possibilities of moral recovery , and the work that may be done for men in the fragment of days , redeeming the contrite from their burdens by manful hope . ' Once more , as an illustration of the practical and sustaining power of such views , he points to Condorcet , and says : " One of the brightest and most scientific spirits of the Qighteenth century , while each moment expecting the knock of the executioner at his door , found as religious a solace as any early martyr had ever found in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason and freedom with the eternal chain of the destinies of man . This contemplation , ' he wrote and felt , is for him a refuge into which the rancor of his persecutors can never follow him ; in which , living in thought with man reinstated in the rights and the dignity of his nature , he forgets man tormented and corrupted by greed , by base fear , by envy ; it is here that he truly abides with his fellows , in an elysium that his reason has known how to create for itself and that his ove for humanity adorns with all purest delights . ' " // Such , then , is the IReligion of the Brotherhood of Humanity . Such , according to Mr. Morley , is the last word which philosophy has to give in answer to the momentous questions which confront us on the subject of man 's destiny . Now the honor of attaining to these last results is due to no one individual . It is shared by the long line of the good and the wise in all ages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own way done serviceable work ; and among those who have thus enabled subsequent generations to see with clearer vision stands prominent " the sublime mystic of the Galilean hills . " But it is claimed that the two men to whom we in these present times are most indebted are Voltaire and Rousseau , and to make good this claim in their behalf-as we said at the commencement of this Article-is the purpose for which these books were w ritten . It is admitted that their views were not those which are now accepted by the disciples of the Religion of the Brotherhood of Humanity . Manifold errors in their teaching , are pointed out , and commented upon freely and without hesitation . In fact , the doctrine of the one , on many of the most important subj ects , is the exact antithesis of the doctrine of the other . But the men who honor them profess to feel no responsibility for anything they said . They glory in the fact that we of the present generation have moved far beyond them . But , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they place these two above all others . The one was the gigantic Destroyer . He did a work to release men from the pressure of old superstitions , and old social abuses , which was all important , and which it would seem could have been done by no one but such a man of war as he was born to be . The other was the Builder . He laid the foundation of the present order of things . Notwithstanding all his errors , his weaknesses , his amazing inconsistencies , he contributed to mankind " a new way of understanding life , " which , " like a torrid stream flowing undiscernible amid the waters of a tumbling sea , " has been at the bottom of all the great moral changes which have taken place since his day , and which will continue to give direction to all future endeavors for the good of the race . // Of Voltaire , Mr. Mor*ley says : " The existence , character , and career of this extraordinary person constituted in themselves a new and prodigious era. " - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fully developed in men 's minds , his name will stand out like the names of the great decisive movements in the European advance ; like the revival of learning , or the Reformation . " - " The peculiarities of his individual genius changed the mind and spiritual conformation of France , and in a less degree of the whole of the West , with as far-spreading and invincible an effect as if the work had been wholly done , as it was actually aided , by the sweep of deeplying , collective forces . A new type of belief ; and of its shadow disbelief , was stamped by the impression of his character and work into the intelligence and feeling of his own and following times . We may think of Voltairism in France somewhat as we think of Catholicism , or the Renaissance , or Calvinism. ft was one of the cardinal liberations of the growing race ; one of the emphatic manifestations of some portion of the minds of men , which an immediately foregoing system and creed had either ignored or outraged . " Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teachers , whose distinction is neither correct thought , nor an eye for the exigencies of practical organization , but simply depth and fervor of the moral sentiment , bringing with it the indefinable gift of touching many hearts with love of virtue and the things of the spirit . The Christian organizations which saved western society from dissolution owe all to Saint Paul , Hildebrand , Luther , Calvin ; but the spiritual life of the West during all these generations has burnt with the pure flame first lighted by the sublime mystic of the Galilean hills . Aristotle acquired for men much knowledge and many instruments for gaining more , but it is his master who moves the soul with love of truth , and enthusiasm for excellence . There is peril in all such leaders of souls , inasmuch as they incline men to substitute warmth for light , and to be content with aspiration where they need direction . Yet no movement goes far which does not count one of them in the number of its chiefs . " Now it is contended that Rousseau took this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the eighteenth century . What Plato was to the // philosophy which was elaborated by Aristotle ; what Christ was to Christianity ; that Rousseau is to all the humanitarian effort of the last hundred years . Yet while Mr. Morley makes these claims for Voltaire and Rousseau , he is at no pains to dissemble or conceal the fact that they both present to us characters that are very condemnable . But then the Apostle Peter denied his Lord . Seven devils made their abode in Mary Magdalene . The patriarchs of the old dispensation and the saints of the new were not faultless . So Mr. Morley admits , with regard to Voltaire , that " it would be easy to pour overflowing vials of condemnation on many sides of his character and career . " He admits with regard to Rousseau , that his " personality has most equivocal and repulsive sides . " He says : " There is no one in the history of famous men , and our spiritual fathers that begat us , which makes more constant demands on the patience or pity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he " has deservedly fared ill in the esteem of the saner and more rational of those who have judged him . " He even goes out of his way to tell us that he is aware that men generally approve of the saying of Dr. Johnson , that " he would sooner sign a sentence for Rousseau 's transportation t*tan that of any felon who had gone from the Old Bailey these many years , and that the difference between him and Voltaire was so slight that it would be difficult to settle the proportion of iniquity between them . " Yet Mr. Morley contends " that we may forget much in the story of Rousseau that is grievous or hateful , in reflecting that if any man now deems a day basely passed in which he has given no thought to the hard life of garret and hovel , to the forlorn children and trampled women of wide squalid wildernesses in cities* it was he who first in our modern time sounded a new trumpet note for one more of the great battles of humanity . He makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some of his contemporaries followed the same vein of thought , and he was only continuing work which others had prepared . But he alone had the gift of the golden mouth . It was in Rousseau that polite Europe first hearkened to strange voices and faint reverberation from out of the vague and cavernous // shadow in which the common people move . Science has to feel the way toward light and solution , to prepare , to organize ; but the race owes something to one who not only helped to state the problem , and wrote up in letters of flame at the brutal feast of kings and the rich that civilization is as yet only a - mockery , but filled a generation of men and women with the stern resolve that they would rather perish than live on in a world where such things can be . " When we began to write , all that we proposed was to call attention to the fact that these books were not " memoirs , " at least in any ordinary sense of the word ; that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to claim very distinctly for Voltaire and IRousseau that they are the two men to whom we are indebted above all others for what is most valuable in modern civilization . At this point we might hold our pen . We have not sufficient space at command to attempt anything of the nature of criticism on the justice of these claims . There are still , however , one or two things which ought to be said about the manner in which the claims are supported ; we will accordingly add a few words by way of further explanation . As to Voltaire , it is enough to say , that he came on to the stage of action just at the close of the reign of Louis XIV . He was twenty years old at the death of the great king . In the public service , he found flagrant corruption and unnumbered abuses everywhere . The honor of France and every interest of the nation were daily sacrificed to the folly , the mismanagement , the whim of a set of dissolute courtiers . In the Church , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debauchery , and who had been raised to preferment by the intrigues of women , pursue their amours publicly , amuse themselves by the composition of gallant verses , give every day prolonged and luxurious suppers , and rise from them to implore the enlightenment of the Holy Spirit , boldly calling themselves the successors of the Apostles . " In every place of power and influence , the favored few , who boasted that they were descended from the old conquering Franks , had settled themselves down as an incubus , which could not be shaken off . The nation was bound // hand and foot . No one could interfere in its behalf , for absolutism was triumphant everywhere-triumphant in the State , and triumphant in the Church . Voltaire had had himself an early taste of what might be expected by any intermeddler . He had been caned publicly by the servants of a young sprig of nobility , who had been offended at a smart repartee which had come from his plebeian mouth . In the first year of the reign of Louis XV , he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having written a criticism on public affairs , of which he was in fact guiltless . He could get no redress . As soon as possible , therefore , he fled to England . There the philosophy of Locke at once attracted his attention . Then , having learned how to apply " common-sense thinking " to metaphysics , he began , on his return to France , to extend the application of this " common-sense thinking " to the abuses which were so rife and to the intolerance and superstition which went under the name of religion . But , bringing reason into such an atmosphere , Mr. Morley says , " was like admitting air to the chamber of a mummy . " The existing state of things began at once to crumble ! The attack thus commenced was kept up through a long life of eighty-four years . The war which he waged was relentless , and he was ever in the forefront of the battle . True , his arguments were often weak . Those who now esteem him most , acknowledge that his conceptions were very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sought weapons with which he could do immediate execution , and was notover nice in asking what they were . He meant , if possible , to crush the system of things which obstructed the progress of light and freedom and intelligence ; and he succeeded ! He will ever be known as the great " revolutionary destructive " of the eighteenth century . Mr. Morley follows him through this long career ; analyzes his character ; defends his reputation with a devotion which never fails ; describes his battles with words of ringing eloquence which stir the blood like the heavy cannonading of an army in action ; and finally claims for him , what Voltaire himself had before claimed for Montesquien , that when " Humanity had lost its title deeds , he recovered them . " // The two volumes on Rousseau contain more that may be considered new , more that deserves consideration than the volume of which we have just spoken . We have already intimated that no attempt is made to hide the terrible moral delinquencies of this strangely inconsistent man . There is scarcely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his life with Madame de Warens ; of his abandoning Le Maitre in the streets of Lyons ; of his sending the five children of Theresa Le Vasseur , one after another , as soon as they were born , to the asylum for foundlings , in spite of the tears and piteous entreaties of the poor mother ; of his insane passion for Madame D'Houdetot ; of his quarrels with Diderot , and Grimm , and all the rest ; of his vanity ; of his consummate selfishness , which displayed itself in such unnumbered ways . Mr. Morley has certainly not followed the example of the sons of the patriarch Noah , in attempting to conceal the nakedness of his " spiritual father . " He even reminds us of the old idol worshippers of the Hawaian Islands , who did not hesitate to find fault with their gods , and even , on occasion , to administer chastisement , when they were out of humor with them . But while it is admitted that these revolting moral delinquencies have left an indelible stain on the memory of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he is the man who , in an age of unparalleled corruption , dared to lift up his voice and say that there is such a thing as duty , there is such a thing as justice , there is such a being as God . What he said may not conform to our ideas on these subjects , but surely it was something to have such words as duty , and justice , and God , kept from dying out of the memories of a generation that was rushing madly into a negation of all belief . He is the man who insisted upon the sacredness of the family , and glorified the relation of marriage , when marriage was so lightly esteemed in France that we have even in this book a picture of the Count and Countess D ' Houdetot , Saint Lambert , her paramour , and Rousseau himself , who had vainly aspired to that position , all meeting in a friendly way around the same dinner table , with a full knowledge of the relation in which each stood to the other . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the education of their children , at a time when they seemed to have forgotten that there were any duties which they owed to them . He is the man who wrote on the nature and objects of government , on love of country , on patriotism , at a time when it had become fashionable to deride all such feelings and to boast of being only cosmopolitan . He is the man who dared to grapple with the arch mocker of his time and defend religion against Voltaire . He is the mau who , in an age when the many were everywhere sacrificed to the few , dared to write : " It is the common people who compose the human race . What is not the people is hardly worth taking into account . Man is the same in all ranks ; that being so , the ranks which are most numerous deserve most respect . " " If every king and every philosopher were cut off , they would scarcely be missed , and the world would be none the worse . " Mr. Morley says : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other man that France arose from the deadly decay which had laid hold of her whole social and political system and found that irresistible energy which warded off dissolution within and partition without . " " His writings produced that glow of enthusiastic feeling in France which led to the all important assistance rendered by that country to the American colonists in a struggle so momentous for mankind . " " I1* was he , and not the feeble controversialists put up from time to time by the Jesuits and other ecclesiastical bodies , who proved the effective champion of religion , and the only power who could make head against the triumphant onslaught of the Voltaireans . He beat back the army of emancipators with the loud and incessantly repeated cry that they were not come to deliver the human mind , but to root out all its most glorious and consolatory attributes . " Such , then , are the two sides of the character of Rousseau . Such are the amazing inconsistencies which are exhibited in his life . They have excited the wonder of the world ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explain these inconsistencies . His whole book is really a continuous argument for the purpose of showing that , after all , there is a unity in the life of this extraordinary man ; that he was sincere in his attack on the civilization of his time , and in his expressions // of sympathy for the poor , the wretched , and the despised ; that the Discourses , the New HeloYsa , the Social Contract , the Emilius , are all the natural outgrowth  --  the development-of the early experience of the apprentice of Geneva , the cateehumen of Turin , the Secretary of Legation of Venice , the servant of Annecy , the vagabond of the highways and byways of France . It is this feature of the book-this attempt to show that there is a vital connection between the two sides of the character of Rousseau - which , in our opinion , constitutes its main value . The mere story of the events in his career-gracefully as it is told-is a subordinate matter . The elaborate analyses of his various literary works-valuable as they are-are made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are put . The common conception is that Rousseau was originally led to take the position which he did , in what is known as his first Discourse , from his love of paradox . It has even been said that when he had made up his mind to compete for the prize offered by the Academy of Dijon for an essay on the questio ; " Has the revival of the arts and sciences contributed to purify morals ? " he " was about to answer the question with a commonplace affirmative , when Diderot persuaded him that the negative would attract more attention ; " that then , when he had become famous , he assumed the part of " censor of civilization , " an advocate of simplicity in life , in order to attract attention to himself and gain food to feed his vanity . Now Mr. Morley contends that this explanation is altogether inadequate and false . He says that no man ever became a great leader of opinion who was a deliberate hypocrite and a conscious charlatan . He shows that Rousseau 's whole previqus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrought . The argument begins with Iis childhood . Mr. Morley tells us that Rousseau had a nature which was morbidly sensitive and sympathetic . His home life , in his earlier years , was of a kind which served only to stimulate these constitutional traits . He read Richardson 's novels , Plutarch 's Lives , and the histories of Greece and Rome . Above all , he grew up , during the most impressionable years of his life , under the influence of the social and political life of that city of ideas , that city which still had VOL xxxii. 38 // the stamp of Calvin everywhere impressed on it-Geneva . He became imbued with its spirit ; and the impressions thus gained always maintained their power over him . Their influence appears on every page of the works which afterward electrified France and Europe . How he estimated the great legislator of the city of his birth appears from his own words : " Those who only look on Calvin as a theologian have a scanty idea of the extent of his genius . The preparation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a part , do him as much honor as his Institutes . " What Mr. Morley says on this subject deserves to be given in fall : " The diplomatist was right who called Geneva the fifth part of the world , nor was he wrong at the congress of Yienna , who , when some one , wearied at the enormous place taken by the hardly visible Geneva in the midst of negotiations involving momentous issues for the whole habitable globe , called out that it was after all no more than a grain of sand , made bold to reply- ' Geneva is no grain of sand ; t is a grain of musk that perfumes all Europe . ' We have to remember that it was at all events as a grain of musk ever pervading the character of Rousseau . lit happened in later years that he repudiated his allegiance to her , but however bitterly a man may quarrel with a parent , he can not change blood , and Rousseau ever remained a true son of the city of Calvin . We may perhaps conjecture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a community , free , energetic , and prosperous , whose institutions had been shaped and whose political temper had been inspired by one great law-giver , contributed even more powerfully than what he had picked up about Lycurgus and Laced*emon , to give him a turn for utopian speculation , and a conviction of the artificiality and easy modifiableness of the social structure . This , however , is less certain than that he unconsciously received impressions in his youth from the circumstances of Geneva , both as to government and religion , as to freedom , order , citizenship , manners , which formed the deepest part of him on the reflective side , and which made themselves visible whenever he exchanged the life of beatified sense for moods of speculative energy . Never , ' he says , did I see the walls of that happy city , I never went into // it , without feeling a certain faintness at my heart , due to excess of tender emotion . At the same time that the noble image of freedom elevated my soul , those of equajity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even to tears . ' His soul never ceased to haunt city and lake to the end , and he only paid the debt of an owed acknowledgment in the dedication of his Discourse on Inequality to the republic of Geneva . It was there it had its root . The honor in which industry was held in Geneva , the democratic phrases which constituted the dialect of its government , the proud tradition of the long battle which had won and kept its independence , the severity of its manners , the simplicity of its pleasures-all these things awoke in his memory as soon as ever occasion drew him to serious thought . More than that , he had in a peculiar manner drawn in with the breath of his earliest days , in this theocratically constituted city , the vital idea that there are sacred things , objects of reverence among men , and hence came to him , though with many stains and much misdirection , the most priceless excellence of a capacity for devout veneration . " At sixteen Rousseau ran away from his early home , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had been brought up , and commenced a life of vagabondage , which he kept up for years , and which brought him into close contact with the poorest and lowest classes of society . We see him , after leaving the Hospice of the Catechumens in Turin , taking delicious satisfaction in wandering among the mountains , the fields , the woods , the streams , of Piedmont , " without any feeling of duty , or constraint , or obligation to go or stay , other than it pleased him ; with no care as to what he should eat or wherewithal he should be clothed . " Afterwards , he wandered in this same way in his many journeyings up and down the roads of France . It is important that a picture or two should be given of the kind of life which he led . " I remember passing one delicious night outside the town ( Lyons ) in a road which ran by the side of either the Phone or the Scone , I forget which of the two . Gardens raised on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been very hot that day , and the evening was delightful ; the dew moistened the parched grass , the night was profoundly // still , the air fresh without being cold ; the sun after going down had left red vapors in the heaven which turned the water to a rose color ; the tre es on the terrace sheltered nightingales answering one another . I went on in a state of ecstasy , surrendering my heart and every sense to the enjoyment of it all , and only sighing for regret that I was enjoying it alone . Absorbed in the sweetness of my musings , I prolonged my ramble far into the night , without preceiving that I was tired . At last I found it out I lay down voluptuously on the shelf of a niche or false doorway made in the wall of the terrace ; the canopy of my bed was formed by overarching tree-tops ; a nightingale was perched exactly over my head , and I fell asleep to his singing . My slumber was delicious , my awaking. still more delicious , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on tree and water and green things and an adorable landscape . I rose up and gave myself a shake ; I felt hungry , and quickly started for the town , resolved to spend on a good breakfast the two pieces of money which I still had left ii was in such joyful spirits , that I went along the road singing lustily . " Here is another picture : " One day when he had lost himself in wandering in search of some site which he expected to find beautiful , he entered the hovel of a peasant , half dead with hunger and thirst His entertainer offered him nothing more restoring than coarse barley bread and skimmed milk . Presently , after seeing what manner of guest he had , the worthy man descended by a small trap into his cellar , and brought up some good brown bread , some n*ieat , and a*bottle of wine , and an omelet was added afterwards . Then he explained to the wondering Rousseau , who was a Swiss , and knew none of the mysteries of the French fise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the duties , and his bread on account of the taille , and declared that he should be a ruined man if they suspected that he was not dying of hunger . All this made an impression on Rousseau which he never forgot . Here , ' he says , was the germ of the inextinguishable hatred which afterwards grew up in my heart against the vexations that harass the common people , and against their oppressors . This man did not dare to eat the bread which he had won by the sweat of his brow , // and only avoided ruin by showing the same misery as reigned around him . " It was thus that this emotional , sympathetic , vagabond , republican exile from the city of Calvin , learned by experience the hardships and miseries of the poor ; and all the sympathies of his heart were aroused . What the hardships and miseries of the toiling millions of France were at that time , we may learn from La Bruy*re . He says : " There are in France certain wild animals , male and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all burnt up by the sun , bound to the earth that they dig and work with unconquerable pertinacity . They have a sort of articulate voice , and when they rise on their feet they show a human face and in fact are men . " Mr. Morley says : " It was because Rousseau had thus seen the wrongs of the poor , not from without but from within , not as a pitying spectator but as of their own company , that by and by he brought such fire to the attack upon the old order , and changed the blank practice of the elder philosophers into a deadly affair of ball and shell . The man who had been a servant , who had wanted bread , who knew the horrors of the midnight street , who had slept in dens , who had been befriended by rough men and rougher women , who saw the goodness of humanity under its coarsest outside , and who above all never tried to shut these things out from his memory , but accepted them as the most interesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' all his experiences , might well be expected to penetrate to the root of the matter , and protest to the few who usurp liter. ature and policy with their ideas , aspirations , interests , that it is not they but the many whose existence stirs the heart and fills the eye with the great prime elements of the human lot . " At last , this greatest of the precursors of the Revolution , all nnconscious of what is before him , goes to Paris , to push his way , and if possible to make his fortune , with " a new system of musical notation . " He is presented to one or two " great ladies . " At first , he is left to dine in the servants ' hall . But he shows marks of genius . He is taken up . He makes the acquaintance of the great lights of literature . He is admitted to the society of the men who meet around the hospitable table // of Baron D ' ilolbach .

He even gets some glimpse of the court , and might have had preferment , if he had been willing to play the part of a courtier . But he remains true to himself He never loses his simplicity . Surrounded by the men of the encyclopaedia , he stands firm in his early convictions . On one occasion , when the tide of mockery set in upon him , on account of his old-fashioned notions , he said : " If it is a piece of cowardice to suffer ill to be spoken of one 's friend behind his back , t is a crime to suffer ill to be spoken of one 's God , who is present ; and for my part , sirs , I believe in God ! " And when the pleasantries were continued in the same vein , he rose , and said : " Sirs , I leave the room , if you say another word more . " Neither does he lose his love for the poor and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as when he is with them . He even forms a connection , at this time , with a poor servant woman , with whom he shared his fortunes during all the rest of his days ; one of so little ability and so few attainments that it is said she " could never he taught to read , or follow the order of the twelve months of the year , or master a single arithmetical figure , or count a sum of money , or reckon the price of anything . " " She never could be taught to tell the hour of the day on the dial plate . " Yet he was as contented for long years with this woman , he says , as with the finest genius in the universe . ' ' The heart of my Theresa , " he wrote , long after the first tenderness had changed into riper emotion on his side and alas ! into indifference on hers , " was that of an angel ; our attachment waxed stronger with our intimacy , and we felt more and more each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our pleasures could be described , their simplicity would make you laugh ; our excursions together out of town , in which I would munificently expend eight or ten halfpence in some rural tavern ; our modest supper at my window , seated in front of one another on two small chairs placed on a trunk that filled up the breadth of the embrasure . Here the window did duty for a table , we breathed the fresh air , we could see the neighborhood , the people passing by , and though on the fourth story , could look down into the street as // we ate . Who shall describe , who shall feel the charms of those meals , consisting of a coarse quartern loaf ; some cherries , a tiny morsel of cheese , and a pint of wine , which we drank between us ? AhI what delicious seasoning there is in friendship , confidence , intimacy , gentleness of soul ! We used sometimes to remain there till midnight , without once thinking of the time . " We have reached the turning point in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has shown what was the character of the seed that had been sowed during these long years of preparation . The harvest was now to be gathered : It proved to be abundant-far beyond all calculation . Even to our time men look back upon it with wonder . But there was nothing unnatural about it . Whatever else may be true of it , it was the seed that had been sowed , that brought forth fruit after its own kind . There had been a regular progression : first the blade , then the ear , and after that the full corn in the ear . We proceed with the story . One hot summer afternoon , in the year 1749 , Rousseau was walking from Paris to Vincennes , for the purpose of paying a visit to iDiderot , who was then in prison for his Letter on the Blind . On the road he came across a newspaper , in which was the announcement of a theme propounded by the Academy of Dijon for a prize essay : " Has the revival of the arts and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rousseau 's own account of what took place . " If ever anything resembled a sudden inspiration , it was the movement which began in me as I read this . All at once I felt myself dazzled by a thousand sparkling lights ; crowds of vivid ideas thronged into my mind with a force and confusion that threw me into unspeakable agitation . A violent palpitation oppressed me ; unable to walk for difficulty of breathing , I sank under one of the trees of the avenue , and passed half an hour there in such a condition of excitement that when I woke I saw that the front of my waistcoat was all wet with my tears , * though * Mr. Morley speaks , in another place , of the facility with which persons of that age shed tears , as " a performance deeply incredible to a generation that has lost that particular fashion of sensibility , without realisingfor the honor of its ancestors the physiological truth of the power of the will over the secretions . " // I was wholly UilCOIISCiOuS of shedding them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what I saw and felt under that tree , with what clearness should I have brought out all the contradictions of our social system ; with what simplicity I should have demonstrated that man is good naturally , and that it is by institutions only that he is made bad . Diderot encouraged him to compete for the prize , and to give full flight to the ideas which had come to him in this singular way . ' ' Such were the circumstances which attended the writing of the first Discourse . Mr. Morley has given an excellent analysis of it ; at least as good as it is possible to give of what , he says , " is not vertebrate . " Few persons will have patience to read the Discourse in full . It is like an exploded shell , preserved in some military museum , for the reason that it has done fa . mous execution on some great battle field . It is full of error , prejudice , platitude , and false reasoning . " It is a torrent of one-sided rhetoric . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inconsequence of the argument , Rousseau caught the ear of France ; and the one thing of importance about it  --  the one thing which makes it memorable-is that it contained a protest against the so-called civilization of the age ; and made men feel that " it could not forever be tolerable that the masses should *rear their lives in unbroken toil , without hope or aim , in order that the few might live selfish , vacuous days . " The Discourse on the Origin of Inequality , a sort of supplement to the other , followed . This is another exploded shell . The forces that were once locked up in it have expended themselves . It is difficult to understand how it could ever have been so dangerous a thing . " More than half of it is devoted to a glowing imaginary description , from which no reader would con , jecture what thesis it was designed to support . " In addition to this , there are very obvious and grave difficulties connected with the view which it presents . It makes anything like society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It made thinking men ask themselves , and the bondsmen of society ask their masters , whether the last word of social philosophy had been uttered and the last experiment in the relations of men to one another decisively tried and irrevocably accepted . " Some of the ideas which it contained were " the starting point of movements // that have had all the fervor and intensity of religions ; and have made men feel about social inequalities the burning shame and wrath with which a Christian saw the flourishing temples of unclean Gods . " The Discourses were followed by the New ileloYsa . This is a romance ; but it was just as much an attack on the existing order of things as the graver work which had already made their author one of the most conspicuous of the literary characters of the day . The Discourses had presented his views in the abstract . The New HeloYsa now presented them in the concrete . Rousseau 's object was to bring contempt upon the scandalous lives which were then everywhere so common in the houses of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virtuous , serene , well-ordered , happy household . It is true that , at first , his heroine , Julie , falls from the paths of virtue . But she returns to duty and to the exercise of religious faith . She marries Wolmar , and a life of ideal happiness follows in the regular discharge of every duty and the enjoyment of all simple home pleasures . We do not propose to sketch the story . It is sufficient to say that the book is a glorification of the family ; and the foundation of the family is made to be marriage , which is held up as a sacred thing . What is said of it may be gathered from the description which Julie gives of her emotions at the moment of her union with Wolmar : " I seemed to behold the organ of Providence , and to hear the voice of God , as the minister gravely pronounced the words of the holy service . The purity , the dignity , the sanctity of marriage , so vividly set forth in the words of Scripture , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happiness , order , and peace of the human race , so sweet to fulfill , even for their own sake - all this made such an impression on me that I seemed to feel within my breast a sudden revolution . An unknown power seemed all at once to arrest the disorder of my affections , and to restore them in accordance with the law of duty and of nature . " The book contains , also , a plea for religion . A religious life is presented in such a light , and in such connections , as to make it attractive . It must be admitted that the New HeloYsa is not at all adapted to the taste of the present day . // Air . Morley 's " Voltaire " and " Rousseau . " July , There are descriptions of a kind which are not tolerated in our contemporary American and English literature . But these undoubtedly attracted little attention in that corrupt age . The characters also seem excessively stilted , and everything about the book is painfully artificial . How it could have been so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember that even in this country , and in this century , it is reported of that distinguished man , President Dwight , that he was in the habit of saying to the students of Yale College , that every gentleman ought to read through " Sir Charles Grandison " every year of his life . Rousseau 's romance and the novels of Richardson are very similar in form and style ; but to us of the present age they are even more monotonous and stupid . However , the New HeloYsa was written for Rousseau 's contemporaries , and for an express purpose ; and as Diderot said of his first Discourse : " It took right above the clouds ; never was such a success . " " The book-sellers were unable to meet the demand . The book was let out at the rate of twelve sons a volume , and the volume could not be detained beyond an hour . All classes shared the excitement ; courtiers , soldiers , lawyers , and bourgeois . Stories were told of fine ladies , dressed for the ball , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time should come for starting ; who read until midnight , and when informed that the carriage waited answered not a word , and when reminded by and by that it was two o'clock read on ; and then at four , having ordered the horses to be taken out of the carriage , disrobed , went to bed , and passed the whole night in reading . " But the more important question is what was the effect of the book on French society at the time . Mr. Morley claims that it was thoroughly wholesome . He says : " To the people who read Cr6billon and Voltaire 's Pucelle it was elevating . Henri Martin also says : " The book , which might have been dangerous to a simple and innocent community , produced a salutary agitation in a vitiated community . " The contrast between the sober , cheerful , prosperous scenes of the romance , and the sad , unnatural , flashy , disgusting reality in French chateaux , made a profound impression , and filled the minds of men and women everywhere with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better , purer , and more peaceful life could be realised . // To satisfy these questionings , the Emilius was next written . Rousseau felt that the only hope was in the rising generation . Accordingly he proceeded to discuss at length the subject of education , which was made to comprehend all the relations between parents and their children from earliest infancy to maturity . In his system , religion was to be an all important feature ; and this led to the introduction of the famous and beautiful episode of the " Savoyard Vicar , " in which he made his profession of religious faith . Mr. Morley says that this book is one of the " seminal books in the history of literature . " Its value lies not in its details , but in the spirit which animates it and communicates itself with vivid force to the reader . He says : " It touched the deeper things of character . It filled parents with a sense of the dignity and moment of their task . It cleared away the accumulation of clogging prejudices and obscure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formalistic arts ; and it admitted floods of light and air into the tightly closed nurseries and school-rooms . It effected the substittition of growth for mechanism . A strong current of manliness , wholesomeness , simplicity , self-reliance , was sent by it through Europe , while its eloquence was the most powerful adjuration ever addressed to parental affection to cherish the young life in all love and considerate solicitude . It was the veritable charter of youthful deliverance . " Henri Martin says : " This book , it may be said without exaggeration , was an ark of safety , launched by Providence on the waves of scepticism and materialism , and it collected all the essential sentiments , all the fundamental principles of moral life , which were about to be swallowed up . Suppose Rousseau stricken ont of the eighteenth century , whither , we ask seriously and sincerely , would the progress of the human mind have drifted ? " The Social Contract may be considered as a supplement to the Emilius . Having presented his views , in that book , with regard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this new volume to consider the position of man as a member of society . According to him , society has its origin in a compact between individuals . " The problem which he undertook to solve was : To find a form of association which // will defend and protect with all the common power the person and property of each associate , and by which each one uniting with all will nevertheless obey none but himself and remain as free as before . " ' His solution was " A social compact , reducible to these words : Each of us places in common his person and his whole power under the supreme direction of the general will ; and we further receive each member as an indivisible part of the whole . " This act of association constitutes a collective body ; and the collective body thus constituted by convention is the sovereign , and is endowed of right with all the attributes of sovereignty . It does not fall within our plan to analyse this book . But the obvious deduction from his theories was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not consist of an order , or a caste , but of the great body of its members , the army of toilers who make the most painful of the sacrifices that are needed for the continuous nutrition of the social organization . " It was these theories which served as the match to kindle the revolutionary fire in France and all over Europe . " Men read the Social Contract as men of old had read the Gospel . " It kindled the fire of patriotism in the breasts of millions ; and evoked " that virile and patriotic energy which saved France from partition , and European civilization from the crushing supremacy of powers even more dark than the first French empire . " Not by any means the least interesting of the works of IRonsseau , and certainly not the least significant , is his Letter to D'Alembert on Stage Plays . ID'Alembert , in an Article in the Encyclop*edia , on Geneva , had expressed a regret that " the austerity of the tradition of the city had deprived it of the manifold advantages of a theater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and took the position " that the moral effect of the stage can never be salutary in itself while it may easily be extremely pernicious ; and that the habit of frequenting the theater , the taste for imitating the style of the actors , the cost in money , the waste in time , and all the other accessory conditions , apart from the morality of the matter represented , are bad things in themselves , absolutely , and in every circumstance . Secondly , that these effects , in all kinds , are specially // bad in relation to the social condition and habits of Geneva . " This Letter of Rousseau is an important one for many reasons , and especially as being the " definite mark of Rousseau 's schism from the philosophic congregation . " Voltaire asked in his mocking way : " Has Jean Jacques turned a Father of the Church ? " He said : " This arch-madman , who might have been something , if he would only have been guided by his brethren of the Encycloptndia , takes it into his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the stage , after writing a bad play of his own ; he finds four or five rotten staves of Diogenes ' tub , and installs himself therein* to bark at his friends . " There is also Rousseau 's letter to Voltaire , in which he criticises his Poem on the Great Earthquake of Lisbon , November , 1755 ; the Letters from the Mountain ; and the " Confessions . " But we must pass all these without a word of comment . The account which we have now given of the different works of Rousseau has been designedly brief . Mr. Morley furnishes extended analyses of them alL But we have referred to them only so far as seemed necessary , for the purpose of illustrating what we have said is his special object in writing these volumes . We have already stated that this object is to show that the works of Rousseau , in their origin , influence , and meaning , are marked by unity of purpose and conception ; that they are the natural outgrowth of his previous life ; and that whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all a point of view in which they may be and are all harmonised . Mr. Morley says that Rousseau was " a citizen of Geneva transplanted . " " Bred in Puritan and republican tradition , with love of God , and love of law and freedom , and love of country , " penetrating his soul , his lot was cast in a city which was " actively fermenting with ideas that were the direct abuegation of all these . " " The idea of a God was either repudiated along with many other ancestral conceptions , or else it was fatally entangled with the worst superstition , and not sei ( Iom with the vilest cruelties . The idea of freedom was unknown , and that of law was benumbed by abuses and exceptions . The idea of country was enfeebled in some , and displaced in others , // by a growing passion for the captivating something styled citizenship of the world . " Now , if Rousseau had never left Geneva , he says himself " I should have passed , in the bosom of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and my friends , a mild and peaceful life , such as my character required , in the uniformity of work which suited my taste and of a society after my heart . I should have been a good Christian , good citizen , good father of a family , good friend , good craftsman , good man in all . I should have been happy in my condition , perhaps I might have honored it ; and after living a life obscure and simple , but even and gentle , I should have died peacefully in the midst of my own people . " But , instead of this , by a strange turn of fortune , he was brought to the city of all others most unlike Geneva , and introduced there to the society of the foremost men and women in it . He was no saint . In fact , his life was stained by much that was exceptionally revolting . But he could not rid himself of the impressions of his childhood . There were some things which he esteemed sacred , some things which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and among the people with whom he was thrown there was nothing held sacred , there was nothing taken for granted . " The past was held in contempt . " " Like the Athenians of old , every one was asking for some new thing . Simplicity of life was counted as an antique barbarism ; literary curiousness the master virtue . " In Paris , " all questions were held to be open ; " the men around him revelled in a reflective and didactic morality which had no root in the heart . and so made things easy for the practical conscience . " " A whole company of habitual adulterers and adulteresses would melt into floods of tears over a hymn to virtue ; which they must surely have held of too sacred an essence to mix itself with any one virtue in particular , except that very considerable one of charitably letting all do as they please " These fine gentlemen and ladies were " as full of quibble as the wrong interlocutors in a Platonic dialogue , and babbled about God , and state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the soul , much as Boswell may have done when Johnson complained of him for asking questions that would make a man hang himself " " The highest things were brought down to the // level of the banalities of discourse ! " " Subjects which the wise take care only to discuss with the wise were here everyday topics for all corners . " Now , Mr. Morley says , " all this was an outrage to the serious side of Rousseau . " He was disgusted by the materialism and the atheism around him . Besides , his tastes were simple , and the glare , the ostentation , the artificiality , and the moral hollowness of the society in which he moved wearied him . " He said himself " I was so tired of fine rooms , fountains , artificial groves and flower beds , and the still more tiresome people who displayed all these ; II was so worn out with pamphlets , card-playing , music , silly jokes , stupid airs , great suppers , that as II spied a poor hawthorn copse , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passing through a hamlet I snuffed the odor of a good chervil omelette , as I heard from a distance the rude refrain of the shepherd 's songs , I used to wish at the devil the whole tale of rouge and furbelows . " Thus wearied , and disgusted , and out of humor with all about him , he takes his famous walk from Paris to Vincennes on that hot summer afternoon , when he is roused by the theme proposed by the Dijon Academy to ask himself What is this civilization worth ? Surely , Rousseau could answer the question in but one way-in the way in which he actually did answer it ; first , in the Discourses , and then in the New lleloisa , the Emilius , and the Social Contract . In the excitement of his attack on the evils of the existing order of things he doubtless went further sometimes than he meant to go , as when he declares that " if he were the chief of an African tribe , he would erect on his frontier a gallows , on which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ venture to pass into his territory , and the first native who should dare to pass out of it ; " but what Mr. Morley claims , is that he had a definite purpose ; that he wrote in all sincerity ; and that his whole doctrine hangs compactly and consistently together . He says that " that ecstatic vision under the oak tree was the opening of a life of thought and production which lasted , to be sure , only a dozen years , but which in that brief space gave to Europe a new Gospel . " Here we are brought back to the point from which we started . It is claimed that the Gospel of Jesus is superannuated . It // accomplished some good in its day , but it has now done its work . It has lost its hold on the masses . They are no longer found in Christian* temples . Christianity has ceased to be aggressive . It is passing away ; and the new Gospel of Rousseau is to take its place . It teaches that men are to labor for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may enjoy his full proportion of the good things of life . Much has been already accomplished since the day of Rousseau . Immense changes have been made in the direction pointed out by him . But the goal is not yet reached . There are still multitudes everywhere who are mere pariahs , and mighty influences are at work to keep them in degradation . For examples of the distribution among the few of the privileges and delights which have been procured by the labors of the many , it is not necessary to turn to such Asiatic potentates as the Shah of Persia , surrounded by all the splendor of Oriental luxury , spending millions in an ostentatious visit to a distant land , who yet did not lift a finger or make one small contribution from his abundant treasury to save his subjects from literally dying by thousands of starva-. tion . Even in England there are great landed proprietors who may ride for hours through their broad acres by rail , while the peasantry around are deprived of almost everything which can make life pleasant . Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been so long known as the paradise of the laborer , the tendency now is to roll up great estates as in older countries , and separate the rich and the poor by a wide chasm . Now Mr. Morley asks : " Is it possible that the last word of civilization has been heard in our existing arrangements ? " He answers that generations will come to whom our present system " will seem just as wasteful , as morally hideous , and as scientifically indefensible , as that older system which impoverished and depopulated empires , that a despot or a caste might have no least wish ungratified , for which the lives or the treasure of others could suffice . " Here , then , say the disciples of the Brotherhood of Humanity , is abundant field for effort . They inscribe on their banners " the good causes of enlightenment and justice in all lands . " Mr. Morley says " men are to be made to feel that they are not mere atoms floating independent and apart , to suck up as much // more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizens of the world with no more definite duty than to keep their feelings towards all their fellows in a steady simmer of bland complacency ; but soldiers in a host , citizens of a polity whose boundaries are not set down in maps , members of a church , the handwriting of whose ordinances is not in the hieroglypbs of idle mystery , nor its hope and recompense in the lands beyond death . " Men are to be made to feel that " they owe a share of their energies to the great struggle which is in ceaseless progress in all societies in an endless variety of forms , between new trath and old prejudice , between love of self or class and solicitous passion for justice , between the obstructive indolence and inertia of the many and the generous mental activity of the few . " " This is the church militant in which they should enrol themselves ; this the true state to which they should be taught that they own the duties of active and arduous citizenship ; these the struggles with which they should associate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outspoken energy , readiness to assert themselves , and readiness to efface themselves , willingness to suffer and resolution to inflict suffering , which men of old knew how to show for their sovereign or their God .
