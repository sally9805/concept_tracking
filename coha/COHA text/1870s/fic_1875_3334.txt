One evening , in the month of October , 1861 , the Manly family were gathered together in their little sitting-room , discussing a question of the most serious importance to all of them , and to Frank in particular . Mrs. Manly sat by the table , pretending to sew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes , and dropped upon her work , in spite of all she could do to keep them back . Frank watched her with a swelling breast , sorry to see his mother so grieved , and yet glad in one little corner of his heart ; for , although she had declared that she could not think of granting his request , he knew well , by those tears of hers , that she was already thinking of granting it . " A pretty soldier you 'll make , Frank ! " said Helen , his elder sister , laughing at his ambition . " You never fired a gun in your life ; and if you should see a rebel , you would n't know which end of the gun to point at him , you 'd be so frightened . " " Yes , I know it , " retorted Frank , stoutly , determined not to be dissuaded from his purpose either by entreaties or ridicule ; " and for that reason I am going to enlist as a drummer boy . " " Well , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no doubt you can roll the drumsticks admirably . " " Yes , to be sure , " replied Frank , with a meaning smile ; for he thought within himself , " If she really thinks I am such a coward , never mind ; she 'll learn better some day . " " O , do n't go to war , dear Frank , " pleaded , in a low , sweet voice , his younger sister , little Hattie , the invalid , who lay upon the lounge , listening with painful interest to the conversation ; " do , brother , stay at home with me . " That affectionate appeal touched the boy 's heart more deeply than his mother 's tears , his elder sister 's ridicule , and his father 's opposition , all combined . He knelt down by little Hattie 's side , put his arms about her neck , and kissed her . " But somebody must go and fight , little sister , " he said , as soon as he could choke back his tears . " The rebels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't keep me at home -- would you ?  - -  when it needs the services of every true patriot ? " " Which of the newspapers did you get that speech out of ? " asked Helen . " If Jeff Davis could hear you , I think he 'd give up the Confederacy at once . He would say , ' It 's no use , since Young America has spoken . ' " " Yes ; like the coon in the tree , when he saw Colonel Crockett taking aim at him , " added Frank : " says the coon , ' Do n't shoot ! If it 's you , colonel , I 'll come down ! ' And I tell ye , " cried the boy , enthusiastically , " there 's something besides a joke in it . Jeff 'll be glad to come down out of his tree , before we hang him on it . " " But if you go to war , Frank , " exclaimed the little invalid , from her pillow , " you will be shot . " " I expect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replied ; " but every man that 's shot at is n't shot , sissy ; and every man that 's shot is n't killed ; and every man that 's killed is n't dead -- if what the Bible says is true . " " O my son , " said Mrs. Manly , regarding him with affectionate earnestness , " do you know what you say ? have you considered it well ? " " Yes , " said Frank , " I 've thought it all over . It has n't been out of my thoughts , day or night , this ever so long ; though I was determined not to open my lips about it to any one , till my mind was made up . I know five or six that have enlisted , and I 'm just as well able to serve my country as any of them . I believe I can go through all the hardships any of them can . And though Helen laughs at me now for a coward , before I 've been in a fight , she wo n't laugh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice broke , and he dashed a tear from his eye . " No , no , Frank , " said Helen , remorsefully , thinking suddenly of those whose brothers have gone forth bravely to battle , and never come home again . And she saw in imagination her own dear , brave , loving brother carried bleeding from the field , his bright , handsome face deathly pale , the eyes that now beamed so hopefully and tenderly , closing -- perhaps forever . " Forgive my jokes , Frank ; but you are too young to go to war . We have lost one brother by secession , and we ca n't afford to lose another . " She alluded to George , the oldest of the children , who had been several years in the Carolinas ; who had married a wife there , and become a slave-owner ; and who , when the war broke out , forgot his native north , and the free institutions under which he had been bred , to side with the south and slavery . This had proved a source of deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had derived from him , up to the fall of Fort Sumter , was now cut off , greatly to their distress , for they were poor ,  - -  but because , when he saw the Union flag fall at Charleston , he had written home that it was a glorious sight ; and they knew that the love of his wife , and the love of his property , had made him a traitor to his country . " If I 've a brother enlisted on the wrong side , " said Frank , " so much the more reason that I should enlist on the right side . And I am not so young but that I can be doing something for my country , and something for you here at home , at the same time . If I volunteer , you will be allowed state aid , and I mean to send home all my pay , to the last dollar . I wish you would tell me , father , that I can have your consent . " Mr. Manly sat in his easy-chair , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head sunk upon his breast . For a long time he had not spoken . He was a feeble man , who had not succeeded well in the business of life ; his great fault being that he always relied too much upon others , and not enough upon himself . The result was , that his wife had become more the head of the family than he was , and every important question of this kind , as Frank well knew , was referred to her for decision . " O , I do n't know , I do n't know , my son , " Mr. Manly groaned ; and , uncrossing his legs , he crossed them again in another posture . " I have said all I can ; now you must talk with your mother . " " There , mother , " said Frank , who had got the answer he expected , and now proceeded to make good use of it ; " father is willing , you see . All I want now is for you to say yes . I must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the same company with the other boys ; and I 'm sure you 'd rather I 'd go with the fellows I know , than with strangers . We are going to befriend each other , and stand by each other to the last . " " Some of them , I am afraid , are not such persons as I would wish to have you on very intimate terms with , any where , my child , " answered Mrs. Manly ; " for there is one danger I should dread for you worse than the chances of the battle-field . " " What 's that ? " " That you might be led away by bad company . To have you become corrupted by their evil influences -- to know that my boy was no longer the pure , truthful child he was ; that he would blush to have his sisters know his habits and companions ; to see him come home , if he ever does , reckless and dissipated -- O , I could endure any thing , even his death , better than that . " " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with indignation , at the thought of any one , especially his mother , suspecting him of such baseness , " there 's one thing -- you shall hear of my death , before you hear of my drinking , or gambling , or swearing , or any thing of that kind . I promise you that . " " Where is your Testament , my son ? " asked his mother . " Here it is . " " Have you a pencil ? " " He may take mine , " said Hattie . " Now write on this blank leaf what you have just promised . " Mrs. Manly spoke with a solemn and tender earnestness which made Frank tremble , as he obeyed ; for he felt now that her consent was certain , and that the words he was writing were a sacred pledge . " Now read what you have written , so that we can all hear what you promise , and remember it when you are away . " After some bashful hesitation , Frank took courage , and read . A long silence followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But you ought to keep this -- for I make the promise to you , " he said , reflecting that he had used his own Testament to write in . " No , you are to keep it , " said his mother , " for I 'm afraid we shall remember your promise a great deal better than you will . " " No , you wo n't ! " cried Frank , full of resolution . " I shall keep that promise to the letter . " Mrs. Manly took the Testament , read over the pledge carefully , and wrote under it a little prayer . " Now , " said she , " go to your room , and read there what I have written . Then go to bed , and try to sleep . We all need rest -- for to-morrow . " " O ! and you give your consent ? " " My son , " said Mrs. Manly , holding his hand , and looking into his face with affectionate , misty eyes , " it is right that you should do something for your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sister is sick , your father is feeble , and I -- my hand may fail any day . And it is right that you should wish to do something for your country ; and , but that you are so young , so very young , I should not have opposed you at all . As it is , I shall not oppose you any more . Think of it well , if you have not done so already . Consider the hardships , the dangers -- every thing . Then decide for yourself . I intrust you , I give you into the hands of our heavenly Father . " She folded him to her heart , kissing him and weeping . Frank then kissed his sisters good-night , his resolution almost failing him , and his heart almost bursting with the thought that this might be the last evening he would ever be with them , or kiss them good-night . II . OFF TO THE WAR . It was a calm , clear October night . The moonlight streamed through the window of Frank 's room , an he lay in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of the morning that was to come . Little Willie , his younger brother , was sleeping sweetly at his side . He had heard his sisters come up stairs and go to bed in the room next to his ; and they were conversing now in low tones ,  - -  about him he was sure . Would he ever sleep in that nice warm bed again ? Would he ever again fold dear little Willie in his arms , and feel his dewy cheek against his own , as he did now ? What was the future that awaited him ? Who would fill his mother 's place when he was gone from her ? He had read over the prayer she wrote for him ; it was still fresh in his thoughts , and he repeated it now to himself in the silence of the moonlit chamber . When he opened his eyes , he saw a white shape enter softly and approach his bedside . There it stood in the moonlight , white and still . Was it a ghost ? Was it an angel ? Frank was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awake , my darling ? " " O , yes , mother . I have n't slept at all . " " I did n't mean to awake you , if you were asleep , " she said , kneeling down beside him . " But I could not sleep ; and I thought I would come and look at you , and kiss you once more ; for perhaps I shall never see you in your bed again . " " O , mother , do n't talk so . I hope I shall be spared to you a long , long time yet . " " I hope you will ; but we must think of the worst , and be prepared for it , my son . If it is God 's will , I can give you up . And you -- you must make up your mind to brave all dangers , even to die , if necessary . It is a great and holy cause you are engaging in . It is no gay and pleasant adventure , as perhaps you think . Are you sure you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " responded Frank . " I am going ; and I am going to do my duty , whatever it is . For a few minutes after I came to bed , thinking of what you had said , and of leaving you , and of "  - -  here he choked --  " I was almost sorry I had said a word about going ; it looked so dreary and sad to me . But I said my prayers , and now I feel better about it . I do n't think any thing can shake my resolution again . " " If it is so , " replied his mother , " I have nothing more to say . " And she kissed him , and gave him plentiful good advice , and finally prayed with him , kneeling by his bedside . " O , do n't go , mother , " said Frank ; " it is such a comfort to have you here ! May-be it is the last time . " " May-be it is , my son . But I must bid you goodnight . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time ! He do n't know that he is losing a brother . " After she was gone , Frank felt more lonesome than ever , the house was so silent , the moonshine in his chamber was so cold . But he hugged his warm little brother close to his heart , and cried very softly , if he cried at all . I do not know how much he slept that night . No doubt his excited thoughts kept him awake until very late , for he was fast asleep the next morning when Helen came to call him . " Hurrah ! " he exclaimed , starting up ; " fight for the old flag ! " for he was dreaming of a battle . " Hallo ! " he said , rubbing his eyes open . " That you , Helen ? " " A wide-awake drummer boy you are , " she replied , with her usual good-natured irony . " You 'll have to rouse up earlier than this , I tell you , if you ever beat the reveille for the soldiers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a good nap in the morning , when I can , " said Frank . " Well , lie and sleep , if you want to , " she added , with a touch of tenderness . " I thought I 'd let you know breakfast was ready . " But Frank was wide awake enough now . He felt there was something great and grand in the day before him , and he was anxious to meet it . He was up and dressed in a minute . He threw open his window , and looked away towards the city , which lay dim and strange in the beautiful mists of the morning , with the crimson clouds of the sunrise lifting like curtains behind it . And the far-off roar of the rumbling streets reached his ear , inspiring him freshly with hope and action . All the family were at breakfast , except Hattie , the sick one , when Frank came down stairs . Even Willie had crept out of bed before him , wondering what made his brother sleep so long that morning . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his breakfast and his toy gun , which had acquired a new interest in his eyes since Helen had told him Frank was going to the war . " I 'm going with my bwother Fwank , " he declared , shouldering arms over his johnny-cake . " And if any body -- any webel "  - -  breathing earnestly --  " hurt my bwother Fwank , me shoot ' em me will ! " " Yes , " remarked Helen , " you and Frank will put down the rebellion , I 've not the least doubt . " This was meant for a sly hit at Frank 's youthful patriotism ; but Willie took it quite seriously . " Yes , " he lisped ; " me and Fwank -- we put down the webellion . Take aim ! "  - -  pointing his toy at his father 's nose . " Fire ! bang ! See , me kill a webel . " " How little the child realizes what it is to fight the rebels , " said his mother , with a sigh . " I 'm afraid , " said Helen , " Frank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He has just about as correct a notion about putting down the webellion . " " Very likely , " said Frank , who had learned that the beat way to treat a joke of this kind is always to humor it , instead of being offended . For a joke is often like a little barking dog -- perfectly harmless , if you pass serenely by without noticing it , or if you just say , " Poor fellow ! brave dog ! " and pat its neck ; but which , if you get angry and raise your stick , will worry you all the more for your trouble , and perhaps be provoked to bite . There was a silence of several minutes -- Willie alone manifesting a desire to keep up the conversation on war matters . He stuck his johnny-cake on the end of his gun , and bombarded his mother 's coffee-cup with it ; and was about to procure more johnny-cake , in order to shell the sugar-bowl , which he called " Fort Sumter , " when Helen put an end to his sport by disarming him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , to the recruiting office , " said Frank ; " for I do n't suppose I will be accepted , unless he does . " That sounded like proceeding at once to business , which Mr. Manly never liked to do . He was one of those easily discouraged men , whose rule is always to postpone until to-morrow what they are not absolutely obliged to do to-day . He waited , however , as usual , to hear what his wife would say to the proposition , before expressing himself decidedly against it . Fortunately , Mrs. Manly had energy and self-reliance enough for both . " If you are still firmly resolved to go , then your father will go with you to the recruiting office , " she said ; and that settled it : for Frank was resolved -- his character resembling his mother 's in respect to energy and determination . Accordingly , after breakfast , Mr. Manly , with frequent sighs of foreboding and discouragement , made a lather , honed his razor , and shaved himself , preparatory to a visit to town . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his departure . He put in order the personal effects which he intended to leave at home , and packed into a bundle a few things he purposed to take with him . An hour passed quickly away , with all its busy preparations , consultations , and leave takings ; and the last moment arrived . " Say good-by twice to me , " said Hattie , the little invalid , rising up on her lounge to give him a farewell kiss . " Why twice to you ? " asked Frank . " Because , " she answered , with a sad , sweet smile , " If you do come home from the war , perhaps you wo n't find me here ; " for the child had a notion that she was going to die . " O sissy , " exclaimed Frank , " do n't say so ; I shall come back , and I shall find you well . " " Yes , " replied Hattie , sorry that she had said any thing to make him feel bad ; " we will think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; just as angels smile , Frank thought . " Besides , this is n't my good-by for good , you know , " said he . " I shall get a furlough , and come home and see you all , before I leave for the seat of war with my regiment . " Frank could n't help feeling a sort of pride in speaking of his regiment . " And may-be you will all visit me in camp before I go . " " Come , " called his father , at the door ; " if we are going to catch this car , we must be off . " So Frank abbreviated his adieus , and ran . " Wait , wait ! " screamed Willie , pulling his cap on " Me go , me go ! " " Go where , you little witch ? " cried Helen . " Me go to war , along with my bwother Fwank . Put down webellion , " pouted the child , shouldering his gun , and trudging out of the door in eager haste , fearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parting from her son on the doorstep , putting back a stray curl from his cheek , smoothing his collar , and whispering , with wet eyes and quivering lips , " My child , remember ! " " I will -- good-by ! " were Frank 's last words ; and he hastened after his father , just pausing on the next corner to look around at the faces in the door of his home , and wave his hat at them . There was Hattie , leaning on Helen 's arm , and waving her handkerchief , which was scarcely whiter than that thin white face of hers ; and there was his mother gazing after him with steadfast eyes of affection and blessing , while her hands were fully occupied in restraining that small but fiery patriot , Willie , who , with his cap over his eyes , was vehemently struggling to go with his bwother Fwank . This was the tableau , the final picture of home , which remained imprinted on Frank 's memory . For the corner was passed , and the doorway and windows of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were lost to sight . He would have delayed , in order to get one more look ; but already the tinkling bells gave warning of the near approach of the horse-car , and he and his father had no more than time to reach the Main Street , when it came up , and stopped to take them in . In but little more than an hour 's time , by far the most important step in Frank 's life had been taken . He had enlisted . " Well , " said his father , after Frank , with a firm and steady hand , had written his name , " it is done now . You are a brave boy ! " with a tear of pride , as he regarded his handsome , spirited young volunteer , and thought that not many fathers had such promising sons . While they were at the recruiting office , one of their neighbors came in . " What ! " he exclaimed , " you here ? on business ? " " Patriotic business , " replied Mr. Manly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He has volunteered , neighbor Winch . " " And you give your consent ? " " I do , most certainly , since he feels it his duty to go , and his mother is willing . " Neighbor Winch stood speechless for a moment , the muscles of his mouth working . " I have just heard , " he said , in an agitated voice , " that my son John has enlisted without my consent ; and I have come here to ascertain the fact . Do you know any thing about it , Frank ? " " I suppose I do , " replied Frank , with some reluctance . " He enlisted three days ago . He wanted me to go with him then ; but I --  --  " " You what ? " said neighbor Winch . " I could n't , without first getting permission from my father and mother , " explained Frank . " O , if my John had only acted as noble a part ! " said the neighbor . " It 's a bad beginning for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother 's heart . " " Well , well , neighbor , " observed Mr. Manly , consolingly , " reflect that it 's in a good cause . Jack might have done worse , you know . " " Yes , yes . He never was a steady boy , as you know . He has set out to learn three different trades , and got sick of them all . I could n't keep him at school , neither . Of late nothing would do but he must be a soldier . If I thought he 'd stick to it , and do his duty , I would n't say a word . But he 'll get tired of carrying a gun , too , before he has seen hard service . Where is he ? Do you know , Frank ? " " He is in camp , in the Jackson Blues , " mid Frank . " I am going as drummer in the same company . " " I 'm glad of that , " replied Mr. Winch . " For , though he is so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had an influence over him , Frank -- a good influence , too . " And the neighbor took the young volunteer 's hand . Frank 's eyes glistened -- he felt so touched by this compliment , and so proud that his father had heard it , and could go home and tell it to his mother and sisters . Neighbor Winch went on : " I want you to see John , as soon as you can , Frank , and talk with him , and try to make him feel how wrongly he has acted --  --  " Here the poor man 's voice failed him ; and Frank , sympathizing with his sorrow , was filled with gratitude to think that he had never been tempted to grieve his parents in the same way . Mr. Manly accompanied his son to the railroad depot , and saw him safely in the cars that were to convey him to camp , and then took leave of him . The young volunteer would have forgotten his manhood , and cried , if the eyes of strangers had not been upon him ; even as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good-by , and sent back his love to his mother and sisters and little Willie . III . UNDER CANVAS . The cars were soon off ; and the heart of Frank swelled within him as he felt himself now fairly embarked in his new adventure . Soon enough the white tents of the camp rose in sight . The Stars and Stripes floating under the blue sky , the soldiers in their blue uniforms , the sentinels with their glittering bayoneted guns pacing up and down , and above all , the sound of a drum , which he considered now to be a part of his life , made him feel himself already a hero . Several other recruits had come down in the train with him , accompanied by an officer . Frank was a stranger to them all . But he was not long without acquaintances , for he had scarcely alighted at the depot when he saw coming towards him his neighbor and chum , Jack Winch , in soldier clothes -- a good-looking young fellow , a head taller and some two years older than himself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Tip-top ! " said Jack , looking happy as a prince . The officer who had brought down the recruits went with them to the quartermaster 's department , and gave orders for their outfit . When Frank 's turn came , his measure was taken , and an astonishing quantity of army clothing issued to him . He had two pairs of drawers , two shirts , two pairs of stockings , a blouse , a dress coat , an overcoat , a cap , a pair of shoes , a pair of pantaloons , and a towel . Besides these he received a knapsack , with two blankets ; a haversack , with a tin plate , knife and fork , and spoon ; and a tin cup and canteen . He had also been told that he should get his drum and drumsticks ; but in this he was disappointed . The department was out of drums . " Never mind ! " said Jack , consolingly . " You may consider yourself lucky to draw your clothes so soon . I had to wait for mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are so lazy , or have so much to do , or something , it may be a week before you 'll be examined . " Frank was soon surrounded by acquaintances whom he scarcely recognized at first , they looked so changed and strange to him in their uniforms . " How funny it seems , " said he , " to be shaking hands with soldiers ! " " These are our tents , " said Jack . " They all have their names , you see . " Which fact Frank had already noticed with no little astonishment . The names were lettered on the canvas of the tents in characters far more grotesque than elegant One was called the " Crystal Palace ; " another , the " Mammoth Cave ; " a third bore the mystical title of " Owl House ; " while a fourth displayed the sign of the " Arab 's Home ; " etc . " My traps are in the ' Young Volunteer , ' " said Jack . " We give it that name , because we are all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here too , "  - -  entering the tent ,  --  " if you want to . " Frank gladly accepted the proposition . " How odd it must seem , " he said , " to live and sleep under canvas ! " " You 'll like it tip-top , when you get used to it , " remarked Jack , with an air of old experience . Frank made haste to take off his civil suit and put on his soldier clothes . Jack pronounced the uniform a splendid fit , and declared that his friend looked " stunning . " " But you must have your hair cut , Frank . Look here ; this is the fighting trim ! " and Jack Winch , pulling off his cap , made Frank laugh till the tears came into his eyes , at the ludicrous sight . Jack 's hair had been clipped so close to his head that it was no longer than mouse 's hair , giving him a peculiarly grim and antique appearance . " You look like Sinbad 's Old Man of the Sea ! " exclaimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that way ! "  - -  feeling of his own soft brown curls , which his mother was so fond of , and which he meant to preserve , if only for her sake . " Pshaw ! you look like a girl ! Come , Frank , there 's a fellow in the ' Owl House ' that cuts all the hair for our company . " But here an end was put to the discussion by some of the boys without crying , " Dinner ! " " Dinner ! " repeated Jack . " Hurrah ! let 's go and draw our rations . " Three or four young volunteers now came into the tent , and , opening their haversacks , drew forth their tin plates , knives and forks . Frank did the same , and observing that they all took their tin cups , he took his also , and followed them , with quite as much curiosity as appetite , to the cook-shop , where a large piece of bread and a thick slice of boiled beef was dealt out to each , together with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat rations ! " said Frank , on their return , seating himself on his bed ,  - -  a tick filled with straw ,  - -  and using his lap for a table . The bread was sweet ; but the beef was of not quite so fine a quality as Frank had been used to at home and the coffee was not exactly like his mother 's . " Here , have some milk , " said Jack . " I 've an account open with this woman "  - -  a wrinkled old creature , who came into the tent with a little girl , bearing baskets of cakes and fruits , and a can of milk . " No , I thank you , " said Frank . " I may as well begin with the fare I shall have to get used to some time , for I mean to send all my pay home to my folks except what I 'm actually obliged to use myself . " " You 'll be a goose if you do ! " retorted Jack . " I sha n't send home any of mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and what I earn of Uncle Sam I 'm going to have a gallus old time with , you may bet your life on that ! " Frank drew a long breath , for he felt that the time had now come to have the talk with his friend which Mr. Winch had requested . " I saw your father , this morning , Jack . " " Did ye though ? What did the old sinner have to say ? " " I do n't like to hear you call your father such names , " said Frank , seriously . " And if you had seen how bad he felt , when he spoke of your enlisting --  --  " " Pshaw , now , Frank ! do n't be green ! do n't get into a pious strain , I beg of ye ! You 'll be the laughing-stock of all the boys , if ye do . " Frank blushed to the eyes , not knowing what reply to make . He had felt no little pride in Mr. Winch 's responsible charge to him , and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sound , moral discourse on this occasion . But to have his overtures received in this manner was discouraging . " Come , " continued Jack , taking something from the straw , " we are soldiers now , and must do as soldiers do . Have a drink , Frank ? "  - -  presenting a small bottle . " What is it ? " Frank asked , and when told , " Brandy , " he quickly withdrew the hand he had extended . " No , I thank you , Jack , I am not going to drink any thing of that sort , unless I need it as a medicine . And I am sorry to see you getting into such habits so soon . " " Habits ? what habits ? " retorted Jack , blushing in his turn . " A little liquor do n't hurt a fellow . I take it only as a medicine . You must n't go to being squeamish down here , I tell you . " And Jack drank a swallow or two , smacking his lips afterwards , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time Frank 's courage was up -- his moral courage , I mean , which is more rare , as it is far more noble , than any merely physical bravery in the face of danger . " I do n't mean to be squeamish , " he said ; " but right is right , and wrong is wrong , Jack . And what was wrong for us at home is n't going to be right for us here . I , for one , believe we can go through this war without doing any thing that will make our parents ashamed of us when we return . " " My eye ! " jeered his companion ; " and do you fancy a little swallow of brandy is going to make my folks ashamed of me ? " " It is n't the single swallow I object to , Jack ; it 's the habit of drinking . That 's a foolish thing , to say the least , for young fellows , like you and me , to get into ; and we all know what it leads to . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old man ? " " Ha , ha , ha , " laughed Jack ; rather feebly , however , for he could not help feeling that Frank was as much in the right as he was in the wrong . " You look a long ways ahead , it seems to me . I have n't thought of being an old man yet . " " If we live , we shall be men , and old men , too , some day , " said Frank , without minding his sneers . " And you know we are laying the foundations of our future characters now . " " That 's what your mother , or your Sunday school teacher , has been saying to you . " " No matter who has said it . I know it 's true , and I hope I never shall forget it . I mean to become a true , honest man if I live ; and now , I believe , is the time to begin . " " O , no doubt you 'll be great things , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was highly offensive ; and Frank was provoked to retort ,  --  " You do n't seem even to have thought what you are going to be . You try first one thing , then another , and stick to nothing . That 's what your father said this morning , with tears in his eyes . " Jack turned red as fire , either with anger or shame , or both , and seemed meditating a passionate reply , when some of his companions , who had been eating their rations outside , entered the tent . " Come in , boys , " cried Jack , " and hear Frank preach . You did n't know we had a chaplain in our company -- did ye ? That 's the parson , there , with the girl 's hair . He can reel you off sermons like any thing . Fire away , Frank , and show the boys . " " Yes , steam up , parson , " said Joe Harris , " and give us a specimen . " " Play away , seven , " cried Ned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that number . These , together with other facetious remarks , made Frank so ashamed and confused that he could not say a word . For experience had not yet taught him that even the most reckless and depraved , however they may laugh at honest seriousness in a companion , can not help respecting him for it in their hearts . " You need n't blush so , young chap , " said tall Abram Atwater , a stalwart , square-shouldered , square-featured young man of twenty , who alone had not joined in the derisive merriment . " It wo n't hurt any of these fellows to preach to them , and they know it . " Frank cast a grateful look at the tall soldier , who , though almost a stranger to him , had thus generously taken his part against some who professed to be his friends . He tried to speak , but could not articulate a word , he was still feeling so hurt by Jack 's ingratitude . Perhaps his pride was as much wounded as his friendship ; for , as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with the idea of his influence over Jack . This incident , as we shall see , had a bad effect upon Frank himself ; for , instead of persevering in the good work he had undertaken , he was inclined to give up all hope of exerting an influence upon any body . In the mean time Jack was washing down the sermon , as he said , with more brandy . " ' T was such an awful dry discourse , boys ; " and he passed the bottle around to the others , who all drank , except Abram Atwater . That stalwart young soldier stood in the midst of the tent , straight and tall , with his arms calmly folded under his blue cape ( a favorite attitude of his ) , and merely shook his head , with a mild and tolerant smile , when the liquor was passed to him . Such was the beginning of Frank 's camp life . It was not long before he had recovered from his confusion , and was apparently on good terms with his messmates . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching some raw recruits at their drill ; watching others playing cards , or checkers , or backgammon ; getting acquainted , and learning the ways of the camp generally . So the day passed ; and that night Frank lay for the first time soldier-fashion , under canvas . He went to bed with his clothes on , and drew his blanket over him . It was not like going to bed in his nice little room at home , with Willie snuggled warmly beside him ; yet there was a novelty in this rude and simple mode of life that was charming . His companions , who lay upon the ground around him , kept him awake with their stories long after the lights were out ; but at length , weary with the day 's excitement , he fell asleep . There ,  - -  a dweller now in the picturesque white city of tents gleaming in the moonlight , ruggedly pillowed on his soldier 's couch , those soft brown curls tossed over the arm beneath his head ,  - -  the drummer boy dreamed of home . The last night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again in the visions of his brain ; and once more his mother visited his bedside ; and again his father accompanied him to the recruiting office . But now the recruiting office was changed into a barber 's shop , which seemed to be a tent supported by a striped pole ; where , at John Winch 's suggestion , he was to have his hair trimmed to the fighting-cut . The barber was a stiff-looking officer in epaulets , who heated a sword red-hot in an oven , while Frank preached to him a neat little sermon over his ration . Then the epaulets changed to a pair of roosters with flaming red combs , that flapped their wings and crowed . And the barber , approaching Frank with his red-hot sword , made him lie on his back to be shaved . Then followed an excruciating sense of having his hair pulled and his face scraped and burnt , which made him move and murmur in his sleep ; until , a ruthless attempt being made to thrust the sword up his nostrils , he awoke . Shouts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at midnight , lighted a candle , and burnt a cork , with which they had been giving him an artificial mustache and whiskers . He must have been a ludicrous sight , with his countenance thus ornamented , sitting up on his bed , rubbing his eyes open , and staring about him , while Winch and Harris shrieked with mirth , and Ned Ellis flapped his arms and crowed . Frank put up his hand to his head . O grief ! his curls had been mangled by dull shears in the unskilful hands of John Winch . The depredator was still brandishing the miserable instrument , which he had borrowed for the occasion of the fellow who cut the company 's hair in the " Owl House . " Frank 's sudden awaking , astonishment , and chagrin were almost too much for him . He could have cried to think of a friend playing him such a trick ; and to think of his lost curls ! But he had made up his mind to endure every thing that might befall him with unflinching fortitude . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His future standing with his comrades might depend upon what he should say and do next . So he summoned all his stoutness of heart , and accepted the joke as good-naturedly as was possible under the circumstances . " I wish you 'd tell me what the fun is , " he said , " so that I can laugh too . " " Give him the looking-glass , " cried Jack Winch , holding the candle , while Ellis stopped crowing , to bring a little three-cornered fragment of a broken mirror , by which Frank was shown the artistic burnt-cork work on his face . He could hardly help laughing himself at his own hideousness , now that the first disagreeable sense of being the sport of his friends had passed . " I hope you have had fun enough to pay for waking me up out of the queerest dream any body ever had , " he said . And he told all about the barber , and the epaulets that became roosters , and the red-hot sword for a razor , etc . Then , looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called out , " Give me those shears ; " and taking them , he manfully cut off his mutilated curls . " There , that is n't exactly the fighting-cut , Jack , but ' twill do . Now , boys , tell some more of those dull stories , and I guess I can go to sleep again . " And he lay down once more , declining to accept an urgent invitation to preach . " There , boys , " said stout Abram Atwater , who had sat all the time cross-legged , a silent , gravely-smiling spectator of the scene , " you sha n't fool him any more . He has got pluck ; he has shown it . And now let him alone . " IV . THE OLD DRUMMER AND THE NEW DRUM . As yet , Frank had no drum . Neither had he any scientific knowledge of the instrument . He was ambitious of entering upon his novel occupation , and was elated to learn , the next morning , that he was to begin his acquaintance with the noble art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inquiring for you , " said Abram Atwater , with his mild , pleasant smile , calling him out of the tent . Frank , who was writing a letter to his mother , on his knapsack , jumped up with alacrity , hid his paper , and ran out to see what was wanted . " This way , Manly , " said the sergeant . " Here 's the man that 's to give you lessons . Go with him . " The teacher was a veteran drummer , with a twinkling gray eye , a long , thick , gray mustache , and a rather cynical way of showing his teeth under it . He had some drumsticks thrust into his pocket , but no drum . " I suppose , " thought Frank , " we shall find our drums in the woods ; " into which his instructor straightway conducted him in order to be away from the diversions and noises of the camp . Frank was disappointed . The veteran gave him his first exercise -- on a board ! " I thought I was to learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking up , not without awe , at the bushy mustache . " You do n't want a drum till you know how to drum , " said the veteran . " But I should think it would be better --  --  " " Wait ! " lifting his drumstick . " Do you understand what we are here for ? " " To learn to drum , " replied Frank , in some astonishment . " To learn to drum , " repeated the veteran , a curious smile just raising the corners of that grizzled mustache . " You understand correctly . Now , am I your teacher , or are you mine ? " " You are mine , sir , " answered the boy , still more amazed . " Right again ! " exclaimed the professor . " That 's the way I understood it ; but I might be wrong , you know . We are all liable to be wrong -- are we not ? " " Yes , sir . " Frank stared . " Good again ! But now it is understood correctly ; I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is it . " Frank assented . " Very well ! Now listen . Since I am to give you lessons , and you are not to give me lessons , you will follow the method I propose , and excuse me if I decline to follow your method . That is reasonable ,  - -  is n't it ? " " Certainly , sir , " murmured the abashed pupil . " The point settled , then , we will proceed , " said the veteran , with the same incomprehensible , half-sarcastic , half-humorous , but now quite good-natured smile lighting up his grim visage . " But before we proceed , " said Frank , " may I just say what I was going to ? " The old drummer lifted both his sticks , and his eyebrows too ( not to speak of his shaggy mustache ) , in surprise at the lad 's audacity . " Do you want me to report you as insubordinate ? " he asked , after a pause , during which the two regarded each other somewhat after the fashion of two dogs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the advances of an anxious yet stout and unflinching young spaniel . " No , sir , " answered Frank . " But I thought --  --  " " You thought ! What business have you to think ? " " No business , perhaps , " Frank admitted , confronting the weather-beaten old drummer with his truthful , undaunted , fine young face . " But I ca n't help thinking sir , for all that . " " You can help expressing your thoughts out of season , though , " said the veteran . " I will try to in future , sir , " answered Frank , laughing . At the same time a smile of genuine benevolence softened the tough , ancient visage of the veteran ; and they proceeded with the lesson . After it was over , the teacher said to the pupil ,  --  " Now , my young friend , I will hear that observation or question of yours , whatever it is . " " I think I have answered it for myself , " said Frank . " I was going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to learn to drum on a drum ; but I see now , if I get to roll the sticks on a board , which is hard , I can roll them so much the better on a drumhead , which is elastic . " " Right , my young friend , " replied the veteran , approvingly . " And in the mean time , we avoid a good deal of unpleasant noise , as you see . " For he had other pupils practising under his eye in the woods , not far from Frank . " And I should like to ask -- if I could have permission , " began Frank , archly . " Ask me any thing you please , out of lesson-hours . " And the old drummer patted the young drummer 's shoulder . Frank felt encouraged . He was beginning to like his teacher , notwithstanding his odd ways ; and he hoped the old man was beginning to like him . " I want to know , then , if you think I will make a drummer ? " " And what if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ought to give up the idea of it at once ; for I do n't want to be second-rate in any thing I once undertake . " " And you have been just a little discouraged over your first lesson ? and would be willing now to give up ? " " No , sir . I should feel very bad to be obliged to give up the drum . " " Very well . Then I can say something to comfort you . Stick to it , as you have begun , and you will make a drummer . " " A first-rate one ? " Frank asked , eagerly . " First-rate , or else I am no judge . " " I am glad ! " and the delighted pupil fairly jumped for joy . From that time the two got on capitally together . Frank soon become accustomed to the veteran 's eccentric manners , and made great proficiency in his exercises . And it was not long before the hard-featured old drummer began to manifest , in his way , a great deal of friendly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy , " said he one day , after Frank had been practising successfully the " seven-stroke roll , " greatly to the satisfaction of his instructor ,  --  " now , my boy , I think you can be safely intrusted with your comrade . " " My comrade ? " queried the pupil . " I mean , your better half . " " My better half ? " Frank was mystified . " Yes , your wife . " And the grizzly mustache curled with quiet humor . " I must be a married man without knowing it ! " laughed Frank . " Your ship , then , " said the veteran , dryly . " Come with me . " And conducting Frank to his tent , he took from one side an object covered with a blanket . " My ship ! " cried Frank , joyfully , already guessing what treasure was now to be his . " Your sword , then , if you like that name better . For what his sword is to a hero , what his ship is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true husband , such , my young friend , to a genuine drummer is his drum . " So saying , the veteran threw aside the covering , and presented to his pupil the long-coveted prize . The boy 's eyes shone with pleasure , and ( as he wrote that evening to his parents ) he was so happy he could have hugged both the old drummer and the new drum . " I selected it for you , and you may be sure it is a good one . It wo n't be any handsomer , but , if you use it well , it wo n't be really much the worse , for going through a campaign or two with you . For it is with drums as it is with the drummers ; they grow old , and get some honorable scratches , and some unlucky bruises , and now and then a broken head ; but , God prospering them , they come out , at last , ugly to look at , perhaps " ( the veteran stroked his mustache ) , " but well-seasoned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Frank thought be saw a tear in his twinkling gray eye , and he was so much affected by it , that he caught his hand in both of his , exclaiming , " Bless you , dear sir ! Dear , good sir , God bless you ! " The old man winked away the moisture from his eye , smiling still , but with a quivering lip , and patted him gently on the shoulder , without saying a word . Frank had the sense to perceive that the interview was now over ; the veteran wished to be left alone ; and , with the new drum at his side , he left the tent , proud and happy , and wishing in his heart that he could do something for that singular , kind old man . As Frank was hastening to his tent , he was met by one of the captains in his regiment , who , seeing the bright beaming face and new drum , accosted him . " So , you are a drummer boy -- are you ? " " Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Frank , modestly . Now , these two had seen each other often in camp and the captain had always regarded Frank with a smile of interest and kindness , and Frank ( as he wrote home ) had " always liked the looks of the captain first-rate . " " I saw you , I think , the day you came here , " said the captain . " You had some curls then . What has become of them ? " Frank 's lip twitched , and he cast down his eyes , ashamed to betray any lingering feeling on that subject . " The boys cut them off in my sleep , sir . " " The rogues ! " exclaimed the captain . " And what did you do ? " Frank lifted his eyes with a smile . " I partly finished them myself -- they had haggled them so ; and the next day I found a man to cut my hair nicely . " " Well , it is better so , perhaps : short hair for a soldier . But I liked those curls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is gone now --  , " in a low , mellow tone . " Are you attached to any company ? " " I am enlisted in the Jackson Blues . " " What is your name ? " " Frank Manly , sir . " " Are you any relation to Mrs. Manly , of --  --  ? " " She is my mother , sir , " said Frank , with proud affection . " Is it possible ! Mrs. Manly 's son ! Indeed , you look like her . " " Do you know my mother , sir ? " " My lad , " said the captain , " I used to go to school to her . But , though I have heard of her often , I have n't seen her for years . " " I shall write to her , and tell her about you , " said Frank , delighted . " She will be glad to hear that I have found so good a friend . " " Ask her , " said the captain , " If she remembers Henry Edney , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She will recollect me , I am sure . And give my very kind regards to her , and to your father ; and tell them I regret I did n't see you before you enlisted , for I want just such a drummer boy in my company . But never mind , " he added quickly , as if conscious of having spoken indiscreetly , " you will do your duty where you are , and I will try to do mine , for we must have only one thought now -- to serve our country . " They separated , with more kind words on the captain 's part , and with expressions of gratitude on the part of Frank , who felt that , to compensate him for John Winch 's treachery , he was already securing the friendship of a few of the best of men . You may be sure the boy wrote to his mother all about the interview , and told her how sorry he was that he had not enlisted in Captain Edney 's company ; not only because he liked his new friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because there existed in the ranks of the Jackson Blues a strong prejudice against their own officers . Captain  - -   - -   was almost a stranger to his men , and seemed determined to continue so . He seldom appeared amongst them , or showed any interest in their welfare . He had never once drilled them , but left that duty entirely to the sergeant . They consequently accused him boldly of laziness , ignorance , and conceit -- three qualities which men always dislike in their superiors . How different was Captain Edney ! V. FUN IN CAMP . Frank now practised his lessons on his drum , and was very happy . He had passed the surgical examination a few days after his arrival in camp , and been duly sworn into the service . This latter ceremony made a strong impression on his mind . He stood in the open air , together with a number of new recruits , and heard the Articles of War read ; after which they all took off their caps , and held up their right hands , while the oath was administered . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the woods , he was astonished to see Jack Winch , with his cap off , his fighting-cut displayed to all beholders , and his fist shaking , marched off by armed soldiers . " What are they doing with Jack ? " he hastened to inquire of Abram Atwater , who stood among his comrades with his arms composedly crossed under his cape . " He is put under guard , " said the tall , taciturn soldier . " You see , " cried Joe Harris , coming up , " Jack had tipped the bottle once too often , and got noisy . The sergeant told him to keep still . ' Dry up yourself , ' said Jack . ' Start , ' says the sergeant ; and he took hold of him to push him towards the tent ; but the next he knew , he got a blow square in the face ,  - -  Jack was so mad ! " " Come , boys , " said Ned Ellis , " Le 's go over and see how he likes the fun . " The proposal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blues went to pay a visit to their disgraced comrade . Arrived at the guard tent , a couple of sentinels crossed their bayonets before them . But although they could not enter , they could look in ; and there , seated on the ground , they saw Jack , in a position which would have appeared excessively ludicrous to Frank , but that it seemed to him too pitiful to behold any comrade so degraded . In consequence of his continued fury and violence , Jack had been secured in this fashion . Imagine a grotesque letter N , to which feet , arms , and a head have been added , and you have some idea of his posture , as seen in profile . His knees were elevated ; forming the upper angle of the letter . The lower angle was represented by that portion of the body which forms the seat of the human animal . The arms were passed over the upper angle , that is , the knees , and kept in their place by handcuffs on the wrists , and by a musket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Ca n't you untie them iron knots with your teeth , Jack ? " said Joe , meaning the handcuffs . " How do you like the back to your chair ? " said Ned . " Let 's see ye turn a somerset backwards , Jack . " And so forth . But Frank did not insult him in his disgrace . Winch was by this time sufficiently sobered and humbled . He destroyed the symmetry of the N by doubling himself ingloriously over his knees and hiding his face between them . " Got the colic , Jack ? " asked Harris --  " you double up so . " Winch glared up at him a moment ,  - -  a ludicrous picture , with that writhing face and that curious fighting-cut ,  - -  but cast down his eyes again , sulkily , and said nothing . " Come away , boys , " whispered Frank . " Do n't stay here , making fun of him . Why do you ? " " Jack , " said Ellis , " we 're going to take a drink . Wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Blues dispersed , leaving poor Jack to his own bitter reflections . He had learned one thing -- who his friends were . On being released , he shunned Harris and Ellis especially , for a day or two , and paid his court to Frank . " I am going to tell you something , Frank , " said he , as they were once at the pond-side , washing their plates after dinner . " I 'm going to leave the company . " " Leave the Blues ? " said Frank . " Yes , and quit the service . I 've got sick of it . " " But I thought you liked it so well . " " Well , I did at first . It was a kind of novelty . Come , let 's leave it . I will . " " But how can you ? " " Easy enough . I am under age , and my father ' ll get me off . " " I should think you would be ashamed to ask him to , " Frank could not help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time by his plainness , for he had learned that those are not , by any means , our worst friends , who truly tell us our faults . " I do n't care , " he said , putting on an air of recklessness . " I ai n't going to lead this miserable dog 's life in camp any longer , if I have to desert "  - -  lowering his voice to a whisper ; " we can desert just as easy as not , Frank , if we take a notion . " " I , for one , " said Frank , indignantly , " sha n't take a notion to do anything so dishonorable . We enlisted of our own free will , and I think it would be the meanest and most dishonest thing we could do to --  --  " " Hush ! " whispered Jack . " There 's Atwater ; he 'll hear us. " * * * * At midnight the drummer boy was awakened by a commotion in the tent . " Come , Frank , " said some one , pulling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great fun . Hurrah ! " Frank jumped up . The boys were leaving the tent . He had already suspected that mischief was meditated , and , anxious to see what it was , he ran out after them . He found the company assembled in a dark , mysterious mass in the street before the row of tents . " Get a rope around his neck , " said one . " Burn the tent , " said another . " With him in it , " said a third . " What does it all mean ? " Frank inquired of his friend Atwater , whom he found quietly listening to the conspirators . " A little fun with the Gosling , I believe , " said Atwater , with a shrug . " They 'd better let him alone . " " The Gosling " was the nickname which the Blues had bestowed on their captain . After a hurried consultation among the ringleaders , the company marched to the tent where the Gosling slept . Only Atwater , Frank , and a few others lingered in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , " said Frank . " Ought we not to give the alarm ? " " And get the lasting ill-will of the boys ? " said Atwater . " We ca n't afford that . " The captain 's tent was surrounded . Knives were drawn . Then , at a concerted signal , the ropes supporting the tent were cut . At the same time the captain 's bed , which made a convenient protuberance in the side of the tent , was seized and tipped over , while tent-pole , canvas , and all , came down upon him in a mass . " Help ! guard ! help ! " he shrieked , struggling under the heap . At the instant a large pile of straw , belonging to the quartermaster 's department close by , burst forth in a sheet of flame which illumined the camp with its glare . The boys now ran to their tents , laughing at the plight of their captain , as he issued , furious , from the ruins . Frank began to run too ; but thinking that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped . Atwater was at his side . " We are caught , " said Atwater , coolly . " There 's the guard . " And he folded his arms under his cape and waited . " What shall we do ? " said Frank , in great distress , not that he feared the advancing bayonets , but he remembered John Winch 's arrest , and dreaded a similar degradation . " There are two of them , " said the half-dressed captain , pointing out Frank and his friend to the officer of the guard . In his excitement he would have had them hurried off at once to the guard-tent . But fortunately the colonel of the regiment , who had been writing late in his tent , heard the alarm , and was already on the spot . He regarded the prisoners by the light of the burning straw . Frank , recovering from the trepidation of finding himself for the first time surrounded by a guard , and subject to a serious accusation returned his look with a face beaming with courage and innocence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Captain  - -   - -   's bed and cutting his tent down ? " he asked . " No , sir , " said Frank , with a mien which bore witness to the truth . " Do you know who set that fire ? " " No , sir . " " What are you out of your tent for ? " " I came to see the fun , sir . If it was wrong I am very sorry . " " What fun ? " " The boys were going to have some fun ; I did n't know what , and I came to see . " " What boys ? " " All the boys in our company . " " Which of them did the things your captain complains of ? " " I do n't know , sir . They were all together ; and who tipped the bed , or cut the ropes , or set the fire , I ca n't tell . " " It seems they were all concerned , then . " " No , sir , not all . Some did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Did this person with you do any of the mischief ? " " No , sir ; he was with me all the time , and we kept out of it . " " How happens it , then , that only you two are caught ? " " All the rest ran . " " And why did n't you run ? " " We had not been doing anything to run for , " said Frank , with convincing sincerity . Atwater was then questioned , and gave similar answers . " Captain  - -   - -   , " said the colonel , " I think it is evident these are not the persons who are most deserving of punishment . This boy , certainly , could not have been very deeply concerned in the assault , and I am inclined to place entire confidence in his story . " The captain himself appeared not a little ashamed of having accused one so young and ingenuous as the drummer boy . The prisoners were accordingly released , and the investigation of the affair was postponed until the morrow . Returning with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joy he felt at their fortunate escape . But Atwater took the whole affair with astonishing coolness , exhibiting no more emotion at their release than he had betrayed at their entrapment . " What a fellow you are ! " said Frank , staying his enthusiastic step , while his companion , with slow and stately pace , came up with him . " You do n't seem to care for any thing . " " Those that care the most do n't always show it , " said Atwater , laconically , as they crept back into the tent . All was hushed and dark within ; but soon they heard whispers . " Abe ! Frank ! that you ? " And they soon found that the tent was full of the fugitives , awaiting their return . " What made you let ' em catch you ? How did you get off ? " were the first eager inquiries . Dark as it was , Frank thought he could see Atwater shrug his shoulders and look to him for the required explanation . For Abram was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speech . So Frank , seated on his bed , related their adventure , to the great delight of the boys , who bestowed the warmest praises upon them for their spirit and fidelity . They had stood their ground when deserted by their companions ; and , although they had told the truth about the whole company , they had not inculpated individuals . Thus Frank , as he afterwards learned with pleasure , had by his courage and truthfulness won both the confidence of his officers and the good will of his comrades . The next day the company was called to an account for the offence . In reply to the captain 's charges , the sergeant , acting as spokesman for the rest , stated the grievances of the men . The result was , that the captain received directions to exercise his company in the colonel 's presence ; and , complying reluctantly , demonstrated his own inefficiency in a manner which elicited the merriment of spectators , and even provoked the colonel to smile . Soon after , in order to get rid of so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the insubordination of the men , it was resolved to disband the company . Thus was afforded to Frank the opportunity , which seemed to him almost providential , of joining Captain Edney 's company , and to John Winch the desired chance to quit the service , of which he had so soon grown weary . At this time the boys ' fathers came down together to visit them . John had written home a pitiful letter , and Mr. Winch went to see about getting him off . But Jack was no sooner out of the service than he wished to be in again . Frank , Atwater , and several others , had joined Captain Edney 's company , and he determined to follow their example . " O John ! " groaned Mr. Winch , in despair at this inconstancy , " when will you learn to be a little more steady-minded ? Here I have come expressly to plead your cause , and get you off ; but before I have a chance , you change your mind again , and now nothing can persuade you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John , " I did n't like the company I was in . I 'm satisfied now , and I 'm going to serve my country . " " Well , well , " said Mr. Winch , " I shall let you do as you please . But reflect ; you enlist with my consent now , and you must dismiss all hope of getting off next time you are sick of your bargain . " " O , I sha n't be sick of it again , " said John , as full of ambition as he had lately been of discontent and disloyalty . In the mean time Frank made the most of his father 's visit . He showed him his new tent , his knapsack and accoutrements , and his handsome drum . He introduced him to the old drummer , and to Atwater , and to Captain Edney . The latter invited them both into his tent , and was so kind to them that Frank almost shed tears of gratitude , to think that his father could go home and tell what a favorite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came , Frank drew a ration for his father , in order that he might know just what sort of fare the soldiers had , and how they ate it . And so the day passed . And Frank accompanied his father to the cars , and saw him off , sending a thousand good wishes home , and promising that he would certainly get a furlough the coming week , and visit them . VI . BREAKING CAMP . Frank was disappointed in not being able to keep that promise . An order came for the regiment to be ready to march in two days ; in the mean time no furloughs could be granted . " I am sorry for you , Frank , " said Captain Edney ; " and I would make an exception in your case , if possible . " " No , I do n't ask that , sir , " said Frank , stoutly . " I did want to see my folks again , but --  --  " He turned away his face . " Well , " said the captain , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them again , if only for a short time . You can warn them in season of our breaking camp , and they will meet you as we pass through Boston . " This was some consolation ; although it was hard for Frank to give up the long-anticipated pleasure of visiting his family , and the satisfaction of relating his experience of a soldier 's life to his sisters and mates . He had thought a good deal , with innocent vanity , of the wonder and admiration he would excite , in his uniform , fresh from camp , and bound for the battlefields of his country ; but he had thought a great deal more of the happiness of breathing again the atmosphere of love and sympathy which we find nowhere but at home . The excitement which filled the camp helped him forget his disappointment . The regiment was in fine spirits . It was impatient to be on the march . Its destination was not known ; some said it was to be moved directly to Washington ; others , that it was to rendezvous at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about to be launched against the rebellion ; but all agreed that what every soldier ardently desired was now before them -- active service , and an enemy to be conquered . The two days in which time the regiment was to prepare to move , became three days -- four days -- a week ; unavoidable obstacles still delayed its departure , to the infinite vexation of Frank , who saw what a long furlough he might have enjoyed , and who repeatedly sent to his friends directions when and where to meet him , which he found himself obliged , each time , to write in haste and countermand the next morning . Such are some of the annoyances of a soldier 's life . But at length the long-delayed orders came . They were received with tumultuous joy by the impatient troops . It was necessary to send the ponderous baggage train forward a day in advance ; and the tents were struck at once . All was bustle , animation , and hilarity in the camp ; and a night of jubilee followed . The drummer boy never forgot that night , amid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shouting , and kindling fires , he could not help thinking , as he watched their animated figures lighted up by the flames , that this was , probably , the last night many of them would ever pass in their native states ; that many would fall in battle , and find their graves in a southern soil ; and that , perhaps , he himself was one of those who would never return . " What are you thinking about , my bold soldier boy ? " said a familiar voice , while a gentle hand slapped him on the back . He turned and saw the bushy mustache of his friend and master , the old drummer , peering over his shoulder . " O Mr. Sinjin ! " said Frank . ( The veteran wrote his name St. John , but every body called him Sinjin . ) " I was afraid I should not see you again . " " Eh , and why not ? " " Because we are off in the morning , you know , and I could n't find you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " said the old man , regarding him with a very tender smile . " I could n't bear the thought of going without seeing you once more . " " And what should a young fellow like you want to see an ugly , battered , miserable old hulk like me , for ? " " You have been very kind to me , " said Frank , getting hold of the old man 's hard , rough hand ; " and I shall be sorry to part with you , sir , very sorry . " " Well , well . " The veteran tried in vain to appear careless and cynical , as he commonly did to other people . " You are young yet . You believe in friendship , do you ? " " And do n't you ? " Frank earnestly inquired . " I did once . A great while ago . But never mind about that . I believe in you , my boy . You have not seen the world and grown corrupted ; you are still capable of a disinterested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of some , and the treachery of others , and the selfishness of all , convince you that there is no such thing as a true friend . " And the old drummer gave his mustache a fierce jerk , as if he had some grudge against it . " O Mr. Sinjin , " said Frank , " I shall never think so and I am sure you do not . Have n't you any friends ? Do n't you really care for any body ? Here are all these boys ; you know a good many of us , and every body that knows you half as well as I do , likes you , and we are going off now in a few hours , and some of us will never come back ; and do n't you care ? " " Few , I fancy , think of me as you do , " said the old man , in a slightly choking voice . " They call me Old Sinjin , without very much respect , " grinning grimly under his mustache . " But they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you all the time , sir , " Frank assured him . " Well , like me or not , " said the veteran , his smile softening as he looked down at the boy 's face upturned so earnestly to his in the fire-light , " I have determined , if only for your sake , to share the fortunes of the regiment . " " You have ? O , good ! And go with us ? " cried Frank , ready to dance for joy . " I 've got tired , like the rest of you , of this dull camp life , " said the old drummer ; " and seeing you pack your knapsack has stirred a little youthful blood in my veins which I did n't suppose was there . I 'm off for the war with the rest of you , my boy ; " and he poked a coal from the fire to light his cigar , hiding his face from Frank at the same time . Frank , who could not help thinking that it was partly for his sake that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both rejoiced and sobered by this evidence of friendship in one who pretended not to believe there was such a thing as true friendship in the world . " I am so glad you are going ; but I am afraid you are too old ; and if any thing should happen to you --  --  " Frank somehow felt that , in that case , he would be to blame . The old man said nothing , but kept poking at the coal with a trembling hand . " Here , Old Sinjin , " said Jack Winch , " have a match . Do n't be singin ' your mustaches over the fire for nothing ; " with an irreverent pun on the old man 's name . " Mr. Sinjin is going with us , Jack , " said Frank . " Is he ? Bully for you , old chap ! " said Jack , as the veteran , with a somewhat contemptuous smile , accepted the proffered match , and smoked away in silence . " We are going to have a gallus old time ; nothing could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when inspired by the idea of change , was always enthusiastic ; he was then always going to have a gallus old time , if any body knows what that is . " Here goes my shoes , " pitching those which he had worn from home into the fire . " Why , Jack , " said Frank , " what do you burn them for ? Those were good shoes yet . " " I know it . But I could n't carry them . The other boys are burning up all their old boots and shoes . Uncle Sam furnishes us shoes now . " " But you should have sent them home , Jack ; I sent mine along with my clothes . If you do n't ever want them again yourself , somebody else may . " " What do I care for somebody else ? I care more for seeing the old things curl and fry in the fire as if they was mad . O , ai n't that a splendid blaze ! It 's light as day all over the camp . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dance . " John ran off . Old Sinjin had also taken his departure , evidently not liking young Winch 's company . Frank was left once more to his own thoughts , watching the picturesque groups about the fires . It was now midnight . The last of the old straw from the emptied ticks had been cast into the flames , and the broken tent-floors were burning brilliantly . Some of the wiser ones were bent on getting a little sleep . Frank saw Atwater spreading his rubber blanket on the ground , and resolved to follow his example . Others did the same ; and with their woollen blankets over them ; their knapsacks under their heads , and their feet to the fire , they bivouacked merrily under the lurid sky . It was Frank 's first experience of a night in the open air . The weather was mild , although it was now November ; the fires kept them warm ; and but for the noises made by the wilder sort of fellows they would have slept well in that novel fashion . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but as often started up , to hear the singing and laughter , and to see Atwater sleeping all the while calmly at his side , the wakeful ones making sport and keeping up the fires , and the flames glittering dimly on the stacks of arms . The last time he awoke it was day ; and the short-lived camp-fires were paling their sad rays before the eternal glory of the sunrise . The veteran Sinjin beat the drummer 's call . Frank seized his drum and hurried to join his friend ,  - -  beating with him the last reveille which was to rouse up the regiment in the Old Bay State . After roll-call , breakfast ; then the troops were drawn up under arms , preparatory to their departure . A long train of a dozen cars was at the depot , in readiness to receive the regiment , which now marched out of the old camping-ground to the gay music of a band from a neighboring city . After waiting an hour on the train , they heard the welcome whistle of the engine , and the still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they went amid loud cheers and silent tears . Frank had no relatives or near friends in the crowd left behind , as many of his comrades had , but his heart beat fast with the thought that there were loved ones whom he should meet soon . But the regiment reached Boston , and marched through the streets , and paraded on the Common ; and all the while his longing eyes looked in vain for his friends , who never appeared . It seemed to him that nearly every other fellow in his company saw friends either on the march or at the halt , while he alone was left unnoticed and uncomforted . And so his anticipated hour of enjoyment was changed to one of bitterness . Why was it ? His last letter must have had time to reach his family . Besides , they might have seen by the newspapers that the regiment was coming . Why then did they fail to meet him ? His heart swelled with grief as he thought of it ,  - -  he was there , so near home , for perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him during those precious , wasting moments . But , suddenly , as he was casting his eyes for the twentieth time along the lines of spectators , searching for some familiar face , he heard a voice -- not father 's or mother 's , or sister 's , but one scarcely less dear than the dearest . " My bwother Fwank ! me want my bwother Fwank ! " And turning , he saw little Willie running towards him , almost between the legs of the policemen stationed to keep back the crowd . VII . THROUGH BOSTON . If ever " bwother Fwank " felt a thrill of joy , it was then . Willie ran straight to his arms , in spite of the long-legged officer striding to catch him , and pulling down his neck , hugged him , and kissed him , and hugged and kissed him again , with such ardor that the delighted bystanders cheered , and the pursuing policeman stepped back with a laugh of melting human kindness . " He 's too much for me , that little midget is , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he belong to you , ma'am ? " addressing a lady whose humid eyes betrayed something more than a stranger 's interest in the scene . " They are my children , " said the lady . " Will you be so good , sir , as to tell the drummer boy to step this way ? " But already Frank was coming . How thankful he then felt that he was not a private , confined to the ranks ! In a minute his mother 's arm was about him , and her kiss was on his cheek , and Helen was squeezing one hand , and his father the other , while Willie was playing with his drumsticks . " I am all the more glad , " he said , his face shining with gratitude and pleasure , " because I was just giving you up -- thinking you would n't come at all . " " Only think , " said Helen , " because you wrote on your letter , In haste , the postmaster gave it to Maggie Simpson yesterday to deliver , for she was going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and asked her to ride , and she forgot all about the letter , and would never have thought of it again , I suppose , if I had n't seen the postmaster and set off on the track of it this morning . She had gone over to her aunt 's , and I had to follow her there ; and then she had to go home again , to get the letter out of her other dress pocket ; but her sister Jane had by this time got on the dress , in place of her own , which was being washed , and worn it to school ; and so we had to go on a wild-goose chase after Jane . " " Well , I hope you had trouble enough for one letter ! " said Frank . " But you have n't heard all yet , " said Helen , laughing , " for when we found Jane , she had not the letter , she had taken it out of the pocket , when she put the dress on , and left it on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maggie and I , but before we got to her house , the letter had gone again -- her mother had found it in the mean time , and sent it to us by the butcher boy . Well , I ran home , but no butcher boy had made his appearance ; and , do you think , when I got to the meat shop , I found him deliberately sawing off a bone for his dog , with your letter in his greasy pocket . " " He had forgotten it too ! " said Frank . " Not he ! but he did n't think it of very much importance , and he intended to bring it to us some time during the day -- after he had fed his dog ! By this time father had got news that the regiment was in town ; and such a rush as we made for the horse-cars you never did see ! " " But Hattie ! where is she ? " Frank asked , anxiously . Helen 's vivacious face saddened a little . " O , we came away in such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had been well enough . " " In she worse ? " " She gets no better , " said Mrs. Manly , " and she herself thought she ought not to try to come . Maggie Simpson offered to stay with her . " " I am so sorry ! I wanted to see her . Did she send any message to me ? " " Yes , " said his mother . " She said , ' Give my love to dear brother , and tell him to think of me sometimes . ' " " Think of her sometimes ! " said Frank . " Tell her I shall always think of her and love her . " By this time Captain Edney , seeing Frank with his friends , came towards them . Frank hastened to hide his emotion ; and , saluting the officer respectfully , said to him , with a glow of pleasure :  --  " Captain Edney , this is my mother . " Captain Edney lifted his cap , with a bright smile . " Well , " he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us ever looked forward to , when we used to spend those long summer days in the old schoolhouse , which I hope you remember . " " I remember it well -- and one bright-faced boy in particular , " said Mrs. Manly , pressing his hand cordially . " A rather mischievous boy , I am afraid I was ; a little rebel myself , in those days , " said the captain . " Yet a boy that I always hoped much good of , " said Mrs. Manly . " I can not tell you how gratified I am to feel that my son is entrusted in your hands . " " You may be sure I will do what I can for him , " said the captain , " if only to repay your early care of me . " He then conversed a few moments with Mr. Manly , who was always well satisfied to stand a little in the background , and let his wife have her say first . " And this , I suppose , is Frank 's sister , " turning to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think , for she looks so much as you used to , Mrs. Manly , that I can almost fancy myself stepping up to her with my slate , and saying , ' Please , ma'am , show me about this sum ? ' " Frank , in the mean time , was occupied in exhibiting to Willie his drum , and in preventing him , partly by moral suasion , but chiefly by main force , from gratifying his ardent desire to pound upon it . " And here is our little brother , " said the captain , lifting Willie , notwithstanding his struggles and kicks , and kissing his shy , pouting cheeks . " He 'll make a nice drummer boy too , one of these days . " This royal flattery won the child over to his new friend immediately . " Me go to war with my bwother Fwank ! dwum , and scare webels ! " panting earnestly over his important little story , which the captain was obliged to cut short . " Well , Frank , I suppose you would like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Be at the Old Colony depot at five o'clock . Meanwhile , "  - -  touching his cap ,  --  " a pleasant time to all of you . " So saying , be left them , and Frank departed with his friends , carrying his drum with him , to the great delight of little Willie , whose heart would have been broken if all hope of being allowed to drum upon it had been cut off by leaving it behind . " Mrs. Gillett has invited us to bring you to her house , " said Mrs. Manly . " I want to have a long talk with you there ; and I want Mrs. Gillett 's brother , the minister , to see you . " Frank was not passionately fond of ministers ; and immediately an unpleasant image rose in his mind , of a solemn , black-coated individual , who took a mournful satisfaction in damping the spirits of young people by his long and serious conversations . " You need n't strut so , Frank , if you have got soldier clothes on , " laughed Helen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you are so particular to have them know it . " " Do , if you please , " said Frank . " And I 'll tell ' em you 're handsome , if you 'll put your veil down so they wo n't know but that I am telling the truth . " " There , Helen , " said Mrs. Manly , " you 've got your joke back with interest . Now I 'd hold my tongue , if I was you . " " Frank and I would n't know each other if we did n't have a little fun together , " said Helen . " Besides , we 'll all feel serious enough by and by , I guess . " For she loved her brother devotedly , much as she delighted to tease him ; and she would have been glad to drown in merry jests the thought of the final parting , which was now so near at hand . They were cordially received at Mrs. Gillett 's house ; and there Mrs. Manly enjoyed the wished-for opportunity of talking with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drum in the attic , and Mrs. Gillett secretly emptied Frank 's haversack of its rations of pork and hard tack , and filled it again with excellent bread and butter , slices of cold lamb , and sponge cake . Moreover , a delightful repast was prepared for the visitors , at which Frank laughed at his own awkwardness , declaring that he had eaten from a tin plate so long , with his drumhead for a table , that he had almost forgotten the use of china and napkins . " If Hattie was only here now ! " he said , again and again . For it needed only his invalid sister 's presence , during these few hours , to make him perfectly happy . " Eat generously , " said the minister , " for it may be long before you sit at a table again . " " Perhaps I never shall , " thought Frank , but he did not say so lest he might hurt his mother 's feelings . The minister was not at all such a person as he had expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not at all stiffened with the idea that he had the dignity of the profession to sustain . He was natural , friendly , and quite free from that solemn affectation which now and then becomes second nature in ministers some of us know , but which never fails to repel the sympathies of the young . Mr. Egglestone was expecting soon to go out on a mission to the troops , and it was for this reason Mrs. Manly wished them to become acquainted . " I wish you were going with our regiment , " said Frank . " We have got a chaplain , I believe , but I have never seen him yet , or seen any body who has seen him . " " Well , I hope at least I shall meet you , if we both reach the seat of war , " said the minister , drawing him aside . " But whether I do or not , I am sure that , with such a good mother as you have , and such dear sisters as you leave behind , you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something to preserve more precious than this mortal life of ours ,  - -  the purity and rectitude of your heart . " This was spoken so sincerely and affectionately that Frank felt those few words sink deeper into his soul than the most labored sermon could have done . Mr. Egglestone said no more , but putting his arm confidingly over the boy 's shoulder , led him back to his mother . And now the hour of parting had come . Frank 's friends , including the minister , went with him to the cars . Arrived at the depot , they found it thronged with soldiers , and surrounded by crowds of citizens . " O , mother ! " said Frank , " you must see our drum-major , old Mr. Sinjin -- my teacher , you know . There he is ; I 'll run and fetch him ! " He returned immediately , dragging after him the grizzled veteran , who seemed reluctant , and looked unusually stern . " It 's my mother and father , you know , " said Frank . " They want to shake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me ? " said the old man , frowning . Frank persisted , and introduced his father . The veteran returned Mr. Manly 's salute with rigid military courtesy , without relaxing a muscle of his austere countenance . " And this is my mother , " said Frank . With still more formal and lofty politeness , the old man bent his martial figure , and quite raised his cap from his old gray head . " Madam , your very humble servant ! " " Mr. St. John ! " exclaimed Mrs. Manly , in astonishment . " Is it possible that this is my old friend St. John ? " " Madam , " said the veteran , with difficulty keeping up his cold , formal exterior , " I hardly expected you would do me the honor to remember one so unworthy ; " bending lower than before , and raising his hat again , while his lips twitched nervously under his thick mustache . " Why , where did you ever see him , mother ? " cried Frank , with eager interest . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's , Frank . Surely , sir , you have not forgotten the little girl you used to take on your knee and feed with candy ? " for the old man was still looking severe and distant . " I have not forgotten many pleasant things -- and some not so pleasant , which I would have forgotten by every body . " And the old drummer gave his mustache a vindictive pull . " Be sure , " said Mrs. Manly , " I remember nothing of you that was not kind and honorable . I think you must have known who my son was , you have been so good to him . But why did you not inform him , or me through him , who you were ? I would have been so glad to know about you . " " I hardly imagined that . "  - -  The old cynical smile curled the heavy mustache.  --  " And if I could be of any service to your son , it was needless for you to know of it . I was Mr. St. John when you knew me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Madam , I wish you a very good-day , and much happiness . Your servant , sir ! " And shaking hands stiffly , first with Mrs. Manly , then with her husband , the strange old man stalked away . " Who is he ? what is it about him ? " asked Frank , stung with curiosity . " Never did I think you knew Old Sinjin . " " Your father knows about him , and I will tell you some time , " said Mrs. Manly , her eyes following the retreating figure with looks of deep compassion . " In the mean time , be very kind to him , very gentle and respectful , my son . " " I will , " said Frank , " but it is all so strange ! I ca n't understand it . " " Well , never mind now . Here is Captain Edney talking with Helen and Mr. Egglestone , and Willie is playing with his scabbard . Pretty well acquainted this young gentleman is getting ! " said Mrs. Manly , hastening to take the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pitty man ! " lisped Willie , who had fallen violently in love with the captain and his accoutrements . " Me and Helen , we like pitty man ! We go with pitty man ! " Helen blushed ; while the captain , laughing , took a piece of money from his pocket and gave it to Willie for the compliment . Frank , who had been absent a moment , now joined the group , evidently much pleased at something . " The funniest thing has happened ! A fellow in our company ,  - -  and one of the best fellows he is too ! but I ca n't help laughing !  - -  he met his girl to-day , and they suddenly took it into their heads to get married ; so they sent two of their friends to get their licenses for them , one , one way , and the other another way , for they live in different places . And the fellow 's license has come , and the girl 's has n't , and they would n't have time to go to a minister 's now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't it funny ? The fellow is one of my very best friends . I wrote to you about him ; Abe Atwater . There he is , with his girl ! " And Frank pointed out the tall young soldier , standing stately and taciturn , but with a strong emotion in that usually mild , grave face of his , perceptible enough to those who knew him . His girl was at his side , crying . " How I pity her ! " said Helen . " But he takes it coolly enough , I should think . " " He takes every thing that way , " said Frank ; " but you ca n't tell much by his face how he feels , though I can see he is biting hard to keep his heart down now , straight as he stands . " " I 'll speak to her , " said Helen ; and while Frank accosted Atwater , she made acquaintance with the girl . " Yes , " said the soldier , " it would be better to know I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look for my coming back . But I never knew she cared so much for me ; and now it 's too late . " " To think , " said the girl to Helen , " he has loved me all along , but never told me , because he thought I would n't have him ! And now he is going , and may be I shall never see him again ! And we want to be married , and my license has n't come ! " And she poured out her sorrows into the bosom of the sympathizing Helen , with whom suffering and sympathy made her at once acquainted . Just then the signal sounded for the train to be in readiness to start . And there were hurried partings , and tears in many a soldier 's eye . And Frank 's mother breathed into his ear her good-by counsel and blessing . And Atwater was bidding his girl farewell , when a man came bounding along the platform with a paper in his hand -- the marriage license . " Too late now ! " said Atwater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " " But here is a minister ! " cried Helen ,  --  " Mr. Eggleston !  - -  O , Captain Edney ! have the train wait until this couple can be married . It wo n't take a minute ! " The case of the lovers was by this time well understood , not only by Captain Edney and Mr. Egglestone , but also by the conductor of the train and scores of soldiers and citizens . An interested throng crowded to witness the ceremony . The licenses were in the hands of the minister , and with his musket at order arms by his right side , and his girl at his left , Atwater stood up to be married , as erect and attentive as if he had been going through the company drill . And in a few words Mr. Egglestone married them , Frank holding Atwater 's musket while he joined hands with his bride . In the midst of the laughter and applause which followed , the soldier , with unchanging features , fumbled in his pocket for the marriage fee . He gave it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bride . But she returned it to her husband . " You will need it more than I shall , Abram ! "  - -  forcing it , in spite of him , back into his pocket . " Good-by ! " she sobbed , kissing him . " Good-by , my husband ! " This pleasing incident had served to lighten the pain of Frank 's parting with his friends . When sorrowful farewells are to be said , no matter how quickly they are over . And they were over now ; and Frank was on the departing train , waving his cap for the last time to the friends he could not see for the tears that dimmed his eyes . And the cars rolled slowly away , amid cheers which drowned the sound of weeping . And the bride who had had her husband for a moment only , and lost him -- perhaps forever ,  - -  and the mother who had given her son to her country , perhaps never to receive him back ,  - -  and other wives , and mothers , and fathers , and sisters , were left behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love in their hearts , gazing after the long swift train that bore their loved ones away to the war . VIII . ANNAPOLIS . And the train sped on ; and the daylight faded fast ; and darkness shut down upon the world . And still the train sped on . When it was too dark to see any thing out of the car windows , and Frank was tired of the loud talking around him , he thought he would amuse himself by nibbling a little " hard tack . " So he opened his haversack , and discovered the cake , and bread and butter , and cold lamb , with which some one who loved him had stored it . He was so moved by this evidence of thoughtful kindness that it was some time before be could make up his mind to break in upon the little stock of provisions , which there was really more satisfaction in contemplating than in eating any ordinary supper . But the sight of some of his comrades resorting for solace to their rations decided him , and he shared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached Fall River at nine o'clock , and the passengers were transferred to the steamer " Metropolis . " The boat was soon swarming with soldiers , stacking their arms , and hurrying this way and that in the lamp-light . Then the clanking of the engine , the trembling of the steamer , and the sound of rushing water , announced that they were once more in motion . Frank had never been on salt water before , and he was sorry this was in the night ; but he was destined before long to have experience enough of the sea , both by night and by day . When he went upon deck the next morning , the steamer was cutting her way gayly through the waters of New York harbor ,  - -  a wonderful scene to the untravelled drummer boy , who had never before witnessed such an animated picture of dancing waters , ships under full sail , and steamboats trailing long dragon-tails of smoke in the morning air . Then there was the city , with its forests of masts , its spires rising dimly in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far , faint sound of its bells musically ringing . Then came the excitement of landing ; the troops forming , and , after a patriotic reception by the " Sons of Massachusetts , " marching through the city to the barracks ; then dinner ; and a whole afternoon of sight-seeing afterwards . The next day the regiment was off again , crossing the ferry , and taking the cars for Philadelphia . From Philadelphia it kept on into the night again , until it reached a steamer , in waiting to receive it , on Chesapeake Bay . The next morning was rainy ; and the rain continued all day , pouring dismally ; and it was raining still when , at midnight , the boat arrived at Annapolis . In the darkness and storm the troops landed , and took up their temporary quarters in the Naval Academy . In one of the recitation halls , Frank and his comrades spread their blankets on the floor , put their knapsacks under their heads , and slept as soundly after their wearisome journey as they ever did in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asleep as promptly as if by word of command , and to snore by platoons . The next morning the rain was over . At seven o'clock , breakfast ; after which the regiment was reviewed on the Academy parade . Then Frank and a squad of jovial companions set out to see the town ,  - -  taking care to have with them an intelligent young corporal , named Gray , who had been there before , and knew the sights . " Boys , " said young Gray , as they sallied forth , " we are now in Queen Anne 's city , for that , I suppose you know , is what the word Annapolis means . It was the busiest city in Maryland once ; but , by degrees , all its trade and fashion went over to Baltimore , and left the old town to go to sleep ,  - -  though it has woke up and rubbed its eyes a little since the rebellion broke out . " " When was you here , Gray ? " asked Jack Winch . Gray smiled at his ignorance , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , Jack , he was here with the Eighth Massachusetts , last April , when they saved Washington and the Union ? " " The Union ai n't saved yet ! " said Jack . " But we saved Washington ; that 's every where admitted , " said Gray , proudly . " On the 19th of April the mob attacked the Sixth Massachusetts in Baltimore , took possession of the city , and destroyed the communication with Washington . You remember that , for it was the first blood shed in this war ; and April 19 , 1861 , takes its place with April 19 , 1775 , when the first blood was shed at Lexington , in the Revolution . " " Of course I know all that ! " said Jack , who never liked to be thought ignorant of any thing . " Well , there was the government at Washington in danger , the Eighth Massachusetts on its way to save it , and Baltimore in the hands of the rebels . I tell you , every man of us was furious to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 19th . But General Butler hit upon a wiser plan , and instead of keeping on to Baltimore , we switched off , seized a ferry-boat on the Chesapeake , just as she was about to be taken by the secessionists , ran down here to Annapolis , saved the city , saved the old frigate ' Constitution , ' and , with the New York Seventh , went to work to open a new route to Washington . " Our boys repaired the railroad track , which the traitors had torn up , and put in shape again the engine they had disabled . We had men that could do anything ; and that very engine was one they had made , for the South never did its own engine-building , but sent to Massachusetts to have it done . Charley Homans knew every joint and pin in that old machine , and soon had her running over the road again . " " How far is it to Washington ? " asked Frank . " About forty miles ; but then we thought it a hundred , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we had ! all day and all night , the engine helping us a little , and we helping the engine by hunting up and replacing now and then a stray rail which the traitors had torn from the track . A good many got used up , and Charley Homans took ' em aboard the train . It was on that march I fell in with one of the pleasantest fellows I ever saw ; always full of wit and good-humor , with a cheery word for every body . He belonged to the New York Seventh . He told me his name was Winthrop . But I did not know till afterwards that he was Theodore Winthrop , the author ; afterwards Major Winthrop , who fell last June -- only two months after -- at Big Bethel . " " It was a North Carolina drummer boy that shot him , " said Frank . " Winthrop was heading the attack on the battery ; he jumped upon a log , and was calling to the men , ' Come on ! ' when the drummer boy took a gun , aimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't want to be killed by a miserable drummer boy ! " said Jack Winch , envious because Frank remembered the incident . " A drummer boy may be as brave as any body , " said Frank , keeping his temper . " But I would n't want to be even the bravest drummer boy , in a bad cause . " " And as for being shot , " said Gray , " I think Jack would n't willingly place himself where there was much danger of being killed by any body . " " You 'll see ! you 'll see ! " said Jack , testily . " Just wait till the time comes . " " What water is this the town fronts on ? " asked Frank . " The Chesapeake , of course ! Who do n't know that ? " said Jack , contemptuously . " Only it ai n't ! " said Gray , with a quiet laugh . " This is the River Severn . The Chesapeake is some two miles below . " " There , Jack , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You do n't know quite so much as you thought you did . " " What a queer old town it is , " said Frank , generously wishing to draw attention from Jack 's mortification . " It is n't a bit like Boston . It do n't begin to be as smart a place . " " Of course not ! " said Jack , more eager than ever now to appear knowing . " And why should it be ? Boston is the capital of Massachusetts ; and if Annapolis was only the capital of this state , it would be smart enough . " " What is the capital of this state ? " asked Gray , winking slyly at Frank . " Baltimore ! I thought every body knew that , " said Jack , with an air of importance . This ludicrous blunder raised a great laugh . " O Jack ! O Jack Winch ! where did you go to school ? " said Joe Harris , " not to know that Frederick is the capital of Maryland . " " So it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Of course I knew Frederick was the capital , if I had only thought . " At this the boys laughed louder than ever , and Jack flew into a passion . " Harris was fooling you , " whispered Frank . " Annapolis is the capital . Gray is taking us now to see the State House . " " Ha , ha , ha ! " Winch suddenly burst forth . " Did you think I did n't know ? Annapolis is the capital ; and there 's the State House . " " Is it possible ? " said Gray . " The rebels must have changed it then , for that was St. John 's College when I was here before . " The boys shouted with merriment ; all except Jack , who was angry . He had been as fickle at his studies , when at school , as he had always been at every thing else ; never sticking long to any of them , but forever beginning something new ; until , at last , ignorant of all , he gave up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world with , and that he was n't going to bother his brain with books any longer . It added now to his chagrin to think that he had not education enough to prevent him from appearing ridiculous among his mates , and that the golden opportunity of acquiring useful information in his youth was lost forever . Meanwhile Frank 's reflections were very different . Gray 's reminiscences of April had strongly impressed upon his mind the fact that he was now on the verge of his country 's battle-fields ; that this was the first soil that had been wrested from the grasp of treason , and saved for the Union ,  - -  that the ground he stood upon was already historic . And now the sight of some negroes reminded him that he was for the first time in his life in a slave state . " These are the fellows that are the cause of this war , " said Gray , indicating the blacks . " Yes , " said Winch , anxious to agree with him , " it 's the abolitionists that have brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the rights of the south , and so the south rebelled . " " We never interfered with slavery in the states where it belonged , " said Frank , warmly . " The north opposed the extension of slavery over new territory , and took the power of the government out of the hands of the slaveholders , who had used it for their own purposes so long ; and that is what made them rebel . " " Well , the north is partly to blame , " insisted Jack , thinking he had Gray on his side . " Yes ; to blame for letting the slaveholders have their own way so long , " said Frank . " And just as much to blame for this rebellion , as my father would be for my conduct , if he should attempt to enforce discipline at home , and I should get mad at it and set the house on fire . " " A good comparison , " said Gray . " Because we were going to restore the spirit of the constitution , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been obliged to tolerate slavery , the slaveholders , as Frank says , got mad and set Uncle Sam 's house afire . " " He had heard somebody else say so , or he would n't have thought of it , " said Jack , sullenly . " No matter ; it 's true ! " said Gray . " The south is fighting for slavery ,  - -  the corner-stone of the confederacy , as the rebel vice-president calls it ,  - -  while the north --  --  " " We are fighting for the Constitution and the Union ! " said Jack . " That 's true , too ; for the constitution , as I said , means freedom ; and now the Union means , union without slavery , since we have seen that union with slavery is impossible . We are fighting for the same thing our forefathers fought for -- Liberty ! " " They won liberty for the whites only , " said Frank . " Now we are going to have liberty for all men . " " If I had a brother that was a slaveholder and secessionist , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Frank felt cut by the taunt ; but he said , gayly ,  --  " I wo n't spoil a story for relation 's sake ! Come , boys , politics do n't suit Jack , so let 's have a song ; the one you copied out of the newspaper , Gray . It 's just the thing for the occasion . " Franks voice was a fine treble ; Gray 's a mellow bass . Others joined them , and the party returned to the Academy , singing high and clear these words :  --  " The traitor 's foot is on thy shore , Maryland , my Maryland ! His touch is on thy senate door , Maryland , my Maryland ! Avenge the patriotic gore That stained the streets of Baltimore , When vandal mobs our banners tore , Maryland , my Maryland ! " Drum out thy phalanx brave and strong , Maryland , my Maryland ! Drum forth to balance right and wrong , Maryland , my Maryland ! Drum to thy old heroic song , When forth to fight went Freedom 's throng @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my Maryland ! " " That 's first rate ! " said Frank , who delighted in music . " Gray altered the words a little , and Mr. Sinjin found us the tune . " " Frank likes any thing that has a drum in it , " said John Winch , enviously . " He 'll get sick of drums , though , soon enough , I guess . " " Jack judges me by himself , " said Frank , gayly , setting out to run a race with Gray to the parade-ground . IX . THANKSGIVING IN CAMP . St. John 's College stands on a beautiful eminence overlooking the city . The college , like the naval school , had been broken up by the rebellion ; its halls and dormitories were appropriated to government uses , and the regiment was removed thither the next day . " You will be surprised , " Frank wrote home , " to hear that I have been through the naval school since I came here , and that I am now in college . " Few boys get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following day the regiment abandoned its new quarters also , and encamped two miles without the city . In the afternoon the tents were pitched ; and where was only a barren field before , arose in the red sunset light the canvas city , with its regular streets , its rows of tent doors opening upon them , and its animated , laughing , lounging , working inhabitants . The next morning was fine . All around the camp were pleasant growths of pine , oak , gum , and persimmon trees , and now and then a tree festooned with wild grape-vines . Near by were a few scattered ancient-looking farm-houses , with their out-door chimneys , dilapidated out-buildings , negro huts , and tobacco fields . There were several other regiments in the vicinity ,  - -  two of Massachusetts boys . And there the New York Zouaves , in their beautiful Oriental costumes , were encamped . Frank climbed a tree , and looked far around on the picturesque and warlike scene . The pickets , which had gone out the night before , now returning , discharged their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the near and distant roll of drums . " What is the cheering for ? " asked Frank , as he came in that day from a ramble in the woods . " For General Burnside , " said Gray . " All the troops rendezvousing at Annapolis are to be under his command , to be called the Coast Division . It is to be another Great Armada ; and our colonel thinks we shall see fighting soon . " This good news had made the regiment almost wild with joy ; for it desired nothing so much as to be led against the enemy by some brave and famous general . Frank loved the woods ; and the next day he induced his companions to go with him and hunt for nuts and fruits . Although it was late in autumn , there were still persimmons and wild grapes to be had , and walnuts , and butternuts . But Frank had another object in view than that of simply pleasing his appetite . Thanksgiving day , which is bred in the bones of the New Englander , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , and the drummer boy had thought of something which he fancied would suit well the festal occasion . " What are you there after ? " said John Winch , from a persimmon tree ; " filling your hands with all that green stuff . Come here ; O , these little plums are delicious , I tell you . " " These grapes are the thing , " said Harris , from another tree . " I 'm going to eat all I can ; then I 'm going to get my pockets full of nuts and carry back to camp . " Frank busied himself in his own way , however , and returned to camp with his arms loaded with evergreens . " What in time are you about ? " said Winch , as Frank set himself industriously to work with twigs and strings . " Oh , I know ; wreaths ! Boys , le 's make some wreaths . Give me some of your holly , wo n't you , Frank ? " " Yes , " said Frank , " take all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have you help me . " " Will you show me how ? " " Yes , " said Frank ; " sit down here . Bend your twigs and tie them together , in the first place , for a frame . Then bind the holly on it , this way . " " O , ai n't it fun ? " said Winch , with his usual enthusiasm over a new thing . " When we get these evergreens used up , we 'll get some more , and make wreaths for all the tents . " He worked for about ten minutes ; then began to yawn . " Where 's my pipe ? I 'm going to have a smoke . How can you have patience with that nonsense , Frank ? What 's the use of a wreath , anyhow , after it 's made ? Girl 's play , I call it . " And off went Winch , having used up a ball of Frank 's strings to no purpose , and leaving his wreath half finished . But Frank , never easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only when duty called him . Thursday came ,  - -  THANKSGIVING . A holiday in camp . The regiment had made ample preparations to celebrate it . Instead of pork and salt junk , the men were allowed turkeys ; and in place of boiled hominy and molasses , they had plum pudding . And they feasted , and told gay stories , and sang brave songs , and thought of home , where parents , wives , sisters , and friends were , they fondly believed , eating turkey and plum pudding at the same time , and thinking of them . There was no drill that day ; and no practise with any drumsticks but those of the devoted turkeys . One of the most pleasing incidents of the day occurred in the morning . This was the presentation of wreaths . Frank had made one for each of the company tents , and a fine one for Captain Edney , and one equally fine for Mr. Sinjin , the drum-major , and a noble one for the colonel of the regiment . He presented them all in person , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present for him . The captain consented , and at the head of a strong delegation of officers and men , proceeded to Colonel  - -   - -   's tent , called him out , and made a neat little speech , and presented the wreath on the end of his sword . The colonel seemed greatly pleased . " I accept this wreath , " he said , " as the emblemof a noble thought , which I am sure must have inspired our favorite young drummer boy in making it . " Frank blushed like a girl with surprise and pleasure at this unexpected compliment . " The wreath , " continued the colonel , " is the crown of victory ; and we will hang up ours , my fellow-soldiers , on this memorable Thanksgiving day , as beautiful and certain symbols of the success of BURNSIDE 'S EXPEDITION . " This short speech was greeted with enthusiastic applause . Frank was delighted with the result of his little undertaking , feeling himself a thousand times repaid for all his pains ; while John Winch , seeing him in such high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with many a jealous pang , that he had not assisted in making the wreaths , and so become one of the heroes of the occasion . That evening another incident occurred , not less pleasing to the drummer boy . With a block of wood for a seat , and the head of his drum for a desk , he was writing a letter to his mother , by a solitary candle , around which his comrades were playing cards on a table constructed of a rough board and four sticks . Amid the confusion of laughter and disputes , with heads or arms continually intervening between him and the uncertain light , he was pursuing his task through difficulties which would have made many a boy give up in vexation and despair , when a voice suddenly exclaimed , with startling emphasis ,  --  " Frank Manly , drummer ! " And at the same instant something was thrown into the tent , like a bombshell , passing the table , knocking over the candle , and extinguishing the light . " Well , that 's manners , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a fellow , as Frank described him , " who makes lots of fun for us , partly because he is full of it himself , and partly because he is green , and do n't know any better . " Tucket muttered and spat , then broke forth again , " I be darned ef that pesky football did n't take me right in the face , and spatter my mouth full of taller . " " Well , save the taller , Seth , for we 're getting short of candles , " said Frank . " Here , who is walking on my feet ? " " It 's me , " said Atwater . " I 'm going out to see who threw that thing in . " " You 're too late , " said Frank . " Strike a light , somebody , and let 's see what it is . It tumbled down here by my drum , I believe . " There was a general scratching of matches , and after a while the broken candle was set up and relighted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " jest look at that jack-of-spades . He got it in the physiognomy wus'n I did . ' Alas , the mother that him bare , if she had been in presence there , in his greased cheeks and greasier hair , she had not known her child . ' " These words from Marmion , aptly altered to suit the occasion , Seth , who was not so green but that he knew pages of poetry by heart , repeated in a high-keyed , nasal sing-song , which set all the boys laughing . " A pretty way , too , to turn up Jack , I should say , " he added , in allusion to the candlestick ,  - -  a turnip , with a hole in it ,  - -  which had rolled over his cards . In the mean time , Frank and Jack Winch were scrambling for the missile . " Let me have it , " snarled Jack . " It 's mine ; my name was called when it was flung in , " said Frank , maintaining his hold . " Well , keep it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing but a great wad of paper . " " It 's a torpedo ! an infernal machine ! " cried Tucket . " Look out , Manly ! it 'll blow us all into the next Fourth of July . " Frank laughed , as he began to undo the package . The first wrapper was of brown paper with these words written upon it , in large characters :  --  " FRANK MANLY , Drummer . Inquire Within . " Beneath that wrapper was another , and beneath that another , and so on , apparently an endless series . The boys all gathered around Frank , looking on as he removed the papers one by one , until the package , originally as big as his head , had dwindled to the dimensions of his fist . " It 's got as many peels as an onion , " said Tucket . " Nothing but papers . I told ye so ! " said Jack Winch . But Frank perceived that the core of the package was becoming comparatively solid and weighty . There was certainly something besides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? But what an odd-shaped stone it was ! Stones are not often of such regular shape , so uniformly round and flattened . He had almost reached the last wrapper ; his heart was beating anxiously ; but , before he removed it , he thought he heard a peculiar sound , and held down his ear . A flush of delight overspread his countenance , and he clasped the ball in both hands , as if it had been something precious . " O , boys ! " he exclaimed , looking up eagerly for their sympathy , " where did it come from ? Atwater , did you see any body ? " Nobody . It was all a mystery . " Boys , it 's for me , is n't it ? " said Frank , still hugging his treasure , as if afraid even of looking at it , lest it should fly away . " Come , let 's see ! " and Winch impatiently made a snatch to get at it . Atwater coolly took him by the arm , and pulled him back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the face of her sleeping baby , removed the tinsel paper , which now alone intervened between the object and his hand , and revealed to the astonished eyes of his comrades a tiny , beautiful , smiling-faced silver watch . " O , is n't it a beauty ? " said Frank , almost beside himself with delight ; for a watch was a thing of which he had greatly felt the need in beating his calls , and wished for in vain . " Who could have sent it ? Do n't you know , boys , any of you ? " he asked , the mystery that came with the gift filling him with strange , perplexed gladness . " All I know is , " said Tucket , " I 'd be willing to have six candles , all lit , knocked down my throat , and eat taller for a fortnight , ef such a kind of a football , infernal machine ,  - -  watch you call it ,  - -  would only come to me . " " Frank 'll feel bigger ' n ever now , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jack Winch , with a bitter grin . All had some remark to make except Atwater , who stood with his arms drawn up under his cape , and smiled down upon Frank well pleased . Frank in the mean time was busily engaged in trying to discover , among all the papers , some scrap of writing by which the unknown donor might be traced . But writing there was none . And the mystery remained unsolved . X. FRANK 'S PROGRESS . So passed Thanksgiving in camp . The next day the boys , with somewhat lugubrious faces , returned to their hard diet of pork and hominy , heaving now and then a sigh of fond remembrance , as they thought of yesterday 's puddings and turkeys . And now came other hardships . The days were generally warm , sometimes hot even , like those of July in New England . But the nights were cold , and growing colder and colder as the winter came on . And the tents were but a thin shelter , and clothing was scanty , and the men suffered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought , with a swelling and homesick heart , of Willie in his soft , warm bed , of his mother 's inexhaustible store of comforters , and of the kitchen stove and the family breakfast , those raw wintry mornings . From the day the regiment encamped , the men had expected that they were soon to move again . But now they determined that , even though they should have orders to march in three days , they would make themselves comfortable in the mean while . They accordingly set to work constructing underground stoves , covered with flat stones , with a channel on one side to convey away the smoke , and a deeper channel on the other for the draft . These warmed the earth , and kept up an even temperature in the tents all night . I said Frank sometimes had homesick feelings . It was not alone the hardships of camp life that caused them . But as yet he had not received a single letter from his friends , and his longing to get news from them was such as only those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until they have suddenly gone upon a long and comfortless journey , and who then begin to realize , as never before , all the loving care of their parents , the kindness of brothers and sisters , and the blessedness of the dear old nest from which they have untimely flown . Owing to the uncertainty of the regiment 's destination , Captain Edney had told his men to have all their friends ' letters to them directed to Washington . There they had been sent , and there , through some misunderstanding or neglect , they remained . And though a small mail-bag full had been written to Frank , this was the reason he had never yet received one . Alas for those missing letters ! The lack of them injured Frank more deeply and lastingly than simply by wounding his heart . For soon that hurt began to heal . He was fast getting used to living without news from his family . He consoled himself by entering more fully than he had done at first into the excitements of the camp . And the sacred influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even at a distance , was wanting . And here begins a portion of Frank 's history which I would be glad to pass over in silence . But , as many boys will probably read this story who are not altogether superior to temptation , and who do not yet know how easy it is for even a good-hearted , honest , and generous lad sometimes to forget his mother 's lessons and his own promises , and commence that slow , gradual , downward course , which nearly always begins before we are aware , and from which it is then so hard to turn back ; and as many may learn from his experience , and so save themselves much shame and their friends much anguish , it is better that Frank 's history should be related without reserve . In the first place , he learned to smoke . He began by taking a whiff , now and then , out of the pipe of a comrade , just to be in fashion , and to keep himself warm those chill evenings and mornings . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polite act on his part , a bunch of tobacco leaves , which Frank , with his usual ingenuity , made up into cigars for himself and friends . The cigars consumed , he obtained more tobacco of some negroes , addicted himself to a pipe , and became a regular smoker . Now , I do n't mean to say that this , of itself , was a very great sin . It was , however , a foolish thing in Frank to form at his age a habit which might tyrannize over him for life , and make him in the end , as he himself once said to John Winch , " a filthy , tobacco-spitting old man . " But the worst of it was , he had promised his mother he would not smoke . He thought he had a good excuse for breaking his word to her . " I am sure , " he said , " if she knew how cold I am sometimes , she would n't blame me . " Unfortunately , however , when one promise has been broken , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ardent , sympathetic , fond of good-fellowship , Frank caught quickly the spirit of those around him . He loved approbation , and dreaded any thing that savored of ridicule . He disliked particularly the appellation of " the parson , " which John Winch , finding that it annoyed him , used now whenever he wished to speak of him injuriously . Others soon fell into the habit of applying to him the offensive title , without malice indeed , and for no other reason , I suppose , than that nicknames are the fashion in the army . To call a man simply by his honest name seems commonplace ; but to christen him the " Owl " if his eyes are big , or " Old Tongs " if his legs are long , or " Step-and-fetch-it " if he suffers himself to be made the underling and cats-paw of his comrades ,  - -  that is considered picturesque and amusing . Frank would have preferred any of these epithets to the one Winch had fastened upon him . Perhaps it was to show how little he deserved it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , swaggering , and , I am sorry to add , swearing . Imbibing unconsciously the spirit of his companions , and imitating by degrees their habits and conversation , he became profane before he knew it ,  - -  excusing himself on the plea that every body swore in the army . This was only too near the truth . Men who had never before indulged in profanity , now frequently let slip a light oath , and thought nothing of it . For it is one of the great evils of war that men , however refined at home , soon forget themselves amid the hardships , roughness , and turbulence of a soldier 's life . It seems not only to disguise their persons , but their characters also ; so that those vices which would have shocked them when surrounded by the old social influences appear rather to belong to their new rude , half barbarous existence . And we all know the pernicious effect when numbers of one sex associate exclusively together , unblessed by the naturally refining influence of the other . Such being the case with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Frank should follow their example . Indeed , from the first , we had but one strong ground of hope for one so young and susceptible -- that he would remember his pledges to his mother . These violated , the career of ill begun , where would he end ? Here , however , I should state that Frank never thought , as some boys do , that it is smart and manly to swear . Sometimes we hear a man talk , whom the vicious habit so controls that he can not speak without blasphemy . With such , oaths become as necessary a part of speech as articles or prepositions . If deprived of them they are crippled ; they seem lost , and can not express themselves . They are therefore unfit for any society but that of loafers and brawlers . Such slavery to an idle and foolish custom Frank had the sense to detest , even while he himself was coming under its yoke . Here , too , before quitting the subject , justice requires us to bear witness in favor of those distinguished exceptions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were few . Although , generally speaking , officers and men were addicted to the practice , the language of here and there an officer , and here and there a private , shone like streaks of unsullied snow amid ways of trodden mire . Captain Edney never swore . Atwater never did . No profane word ever fell from the lips of young Gray . And there were others whose example in this respect was equally pure . Fortunately , Frank was kept pretty busy these times ; else , with that uneasy hankering for excitement which possesses unoccupied minds , and that inclination to mischief which possesses unoccupied hands , he might have acquired worse vices . No doubt some of our young readers will be interested to know what he had to do . The following were some of his duties :  --  At daybreak the drummer 's call was beat by the drums of the guard-tent . Frank , though once so profound a sleeper , had learned to wake instantly at the sound ; and , before any of his comrades were astir , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That call was a signal for all the drummers to assemble before the colors of the regiment , and beat the reveille . Then Frank and his fellow-drummers practised the double-quick for two hours . Then they beat the breakfast call . Then they ate their breakfast . At eight o'clock they had to turn out again , and beat the sergeant 's call . At nine o'clock they beat for guard mounting . Then they practised two hours more at wheeling , double-quick , etc . They then beat the dinner call . Then they had the pleasure of laying aside the drumsticks , and taking up the knife and fork once more . After dinner more calls and similar practice . The time from supper ( five o'clock ) until the beat for the evening roll-call ( at eight ) , the drummers had to themselves . After that the men were dismissed for the night , and could go to bed if they chose ,  - -  all except the drummers , who must sit up and beat the tattoo at nine . That is the signal for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extinguish lights ) , beat by each drummer in the company , going down the line of tents . There were other calls besides those mentioned , such as the company drill call , the adjutants call , to the color , etc. , all of which were beat differently ; so that , as you see , the drummer boy 's situation was no sinecure . He found his watch of great assistance to him , in giving him warning of the moment to be ready for the stated calls . Although evidently a new watch , it had been well regulated , and it kept excellent time . The secret donor of this handsome present was still undiscovered . Sometimes he suspected the colonel , sometimes Captain Edney ; then he surmised that it must somehow have come to him from home . But all his conjectures and inquiries on the subject were alike in vain ; and he enjoyed the exquisite torment of feeling that he had a lover somewhere who was unknown to him . XI . A CHRISTMAS FROLIC . Christmas came . The men had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , except such as had come to individuals in private boxes from home . The sight of these boxes was not very edifying to those who had none . Frank , who was once more in communication with his friends , had expected such a box , and been disappointed . " You just come along with me , boys , " said Seth Tucket , " and we 'll lay in for as merry a Christmas as any of ' em . It may come a little later in the day ; but patient waiters are no losers , as the waiter said when he picked the pockets of the six gentlemen at dinner . " " What 's the fun ? " asked the boys , who were generally ready for any sport into which Seth would lead them . He answered them enigmatically . " ' Evil , be thou my good ! '  - -  that 's what Milton 's bad angel said . ' Fowl , be thou my fare ! '  - -  that 's what I say . " From which significant response , followed by an apt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had some device for obtaining poultry for dinner . It was a holiday , and I have said , and they had already got permission to go beyond the lines . There were some twenty of them in all , Frank included . Tucket led them to a thicket about two miles from camp , where they halted . " You see that house yonder ? That 's where old Buckley lives -- the meanest man in Maryland . " " I know him , " said Frank . " He 's a rebel ; he threatened to set his dog on us one day . He hates the Union uniform worse than he does the Old Scratch . " " He has got lots of turkeys , " said Ellis , " which he told the sergeant he 'd see die in the pen before he 'd sell one to a Yankee . " " I know where the pen is , " said John Winch ; " he keeps ' em shut up , so our boys sha n't steal ' em , and he and his dog and his nigger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Seth , " now the thing is to get the turkeys . As rebel property , it 's our duty to confiscate ' em , and use ' em for the support of the Union cause . Now I 've an idee . I 'll go over in the woods there , and wait , while one of you goes to the house and asks him if he has got any turkeys to sell . He 'll say no , of course . Then ask him if you may have the one out in the woods there . He 'll say there ai n't none in the woods ; but you must insist there is one , and say if ' tai n't his you 'll take it , and settle with the owner when he calls . That 'll start him , and I 'll see that he goes into the woods fur enough , so that the rest of you can rush up , grab every man his turkey , and skedaddle . Winch ' ll show you the way ; he says he knows the pen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harris , on ! Shall be the words of private John . ' But who 'll go first to the house ? " asked Seth , coming down from the high key in which he usually got off his poetry . " Let Frank , " said Harris ; " for he knows the man . " " He ? He das n't go ! " sneered Jack . " He 's afraid of the dog . " This base imputation decided Frank to undertake the errand , which , after all , notwithstanding the danger attending it , was less repugnant to his feelings than more direct participation in the robbery . Seth departed to ensconce himself in the woods . Frank then went on to the secessionists house , quieting his conscience by the way with reflections like these : It was owing to such men as this disloyal Marylander that the Union troops were now suffering so many hardships . The good things possessed by traitors , or by those who sympathised with traitors , were fairly forfeited to patriots who were giving their blood to their country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ robbery . And so forth , and so forth -- sentiments which prevailed pretty generally in the army . Besides , there was fun in the adventure ; and with boys a little fun covers a multitude of sins . The fun , however , was considerably dampened , on Frank 's part , as he approached the house . " Bow , wow ! " suddenly spoke the deep , dreadful tones of the rebel mastiff . He hated the national uniform as intensely as his master did , and came bounding towards Frank as if his intention was to eat him up at once . Now , the truth is , Frank was afraid of the dog . His heart beat fast , his flesh felt an electric chill , and there was a curious stirring in the roots of his hair . The dog came right on , bristling up as large as two dogs , opening his ferocious maw , and barking and growling terribly . Then the fun of the thing was still more dampened , to the boy 's appreciation , by a sudden suspicion . Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enterprise upon him , the youngest of the party ? It was mean ; it was cowardly ; and the whole affair was intended to make sport for the rest , by getting him into a scrape . So , at least , thought Frank . " But I 'll show them I 've got some pluck , " said something within him , proud and determined . To fear danger is one thing . To face it boldly , in spite of that fear , is quite another . The first is common ; the last is rare as true courage . The dog came straight up to Frank , and Frank marched straight up to the dog . " Even if I had known he would bite , " said Frank , afterwards , " I 'd have done it . " For he did not know at the time that this was the very best way to avoid being bitten . The dog , astonished by this straightforward proceeding , and probably thinking that one who advanced unflinchingly , with so brave a face , without weapons , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and growlingly let him pass . " Where 's your master ? " said Frank , coolly , to an old negro , who was shuffling across the yard . " I want to see him a minute . " " Yes , massa , " said the black , pulling at his cap , and bowing obsequiously . He disappeared , and presently " old Buckley " came out , looking worthy to be the dog 's master . " Perhaps , " thought Frank , " if I treat him in the same way , he wo n't bite , either ; " and he walked straight up to him . The biped did not bark or growl , as the quadruped had done , but he looked wickedly at the intruder . " How about those turkeys ? " said Frank . " What turkeys ? " returned the man , surlily . " It is Christmas now , and I thought you might be ready to sell some of them , " continued Frank , nothing daunted . " I 've no turkeys to sell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of them , " said Frank . " I had fifty . " Buckley looked sternly at Frank , and continued : " Half of them have been stolen by you Yankee thieves . And you know it . " " Stolen ! If that is n't too bad ! " exclaimed Frank . " I am sure I have never had one of them . Are you certain they have been stolen ? I heard a gobbler over in the woods here , as I came along . " " You did ? " said the man . Frank thought it only a very white lie he was telling , having heard , at all events , a very good imitation of a gobbler . He repeated roundly his assertion . The man regarded him with a steady scowling scrutiny for near a minute , his surly lips apart , his hands thrust into his pockets . Frank , who could speak the truth with as clear and beautiful a brow as ever was seen , could not help wincing a little under the old fellow 's slow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man , without taking his hands from his pockets , " you 're a lying to me ! " " Very well , " said Frank , turning on his heel , " if you think so , then I suppose it is n't your turkey . " " And what are you going to do about it ? " said the man . " The federal army , " said Frank , with a smile , " has need of that turkey . I shall take him , and settle with the owner when he turns up . " And he walked off . The man was evidently more than half convinced there was a turkey in the woods -- probably one that had escaped when a part of his flock was stolen . " Toby , " said he , " fetch my gun . " The old negro trotted into the house , and trotted out again , bringing a double-barrelled shot-gun , which Frank did not like the looks of at all . " There 's some Yankee trick here , " said the secessionist , cocking the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; " but I reckon they 'll find me enough for ' em . Toby , you stay here with the dog , and take care of things . Now , boy , march ahead there , and show me that gobbler . " The old negro grinned . So did his master , in a way Frank did not fancy . It was a morose , menacing , savage grin -- a very appropriate prelude , Frank thought , to a shot from behind out of that two-barrelled fowling-piece . But it was too late now to retreat . So , putting on a bold and confident air , he started for the woods , followed by the grim man with the gun . His sensations by the way were not greatly to be envied . He had never felt , as he afterwards expressed it , so streaked in his life . By that term I suppose he alluded to those peculiar thrills which sometimes creep over one , from the scalp to the ankles , when some great danger is apprehended . For it was evident that this man was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after Frank , with his left hand on the stock of his gun , the other on the lock , ready to pop him over the moment he should discover he had been trifled with . No doubt their departure had been watched by the boys from the thicket , and the unlucky drummer expected every moment to hear the alarm of a premature attack upon the turkey-pen , which would , unquestionably , prove the signal for his own immediate execution . " He will shoot me first , " thought Frank , " to be revenged ; then he 'll ran back to defend his property . " And now , although he had long since made up his mind that he was willing to die , if necessary , fighting for his country , his whole soul shrunk with fear and dread from the shameful death , in a shameful cause , with which he was menaced . " Shot , by a secessionist , in the act of stealing turkeys . " How would that sound , reported to his friends at home ? " Shot while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would read ! and the poor boy wished that he had let the miserable turkeys alone , and waited to try his fortunes on the battle-field . However , being once in the scrape , although the cause was a bad one , he determined to show no craven spirit . With a heart like hot lead within him , he marched with every appearance of willingness and confidence into the woods , regarding the gun no more than if it had been designed for the obvious purpose of shooting the gobbler . " When we come in sight of him , " said Frank , " let me shoot him , wo n't you ? " " H 'm ! I reckon I 'll give you a shot ! " muttered the man , with darkly dubious meaning . " I wish you would , " said Frank . " Our boys have two cartridges apiece given them every day now , and they practise shooting at a target . But as I am a drummer , I do n't have any chance to shoot . There 's your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just then heard farther on in the woods . " May I take the gun and go on and shoot him ? " Frank asked , with an innocent air . And he stopped , determined now to get behind the man , if he could not obtain the gun . The rebel laughed grimly at the idea of giving up his weapon . But the sound of the turkey , together with the boy 's cool and self-possessed conduct , had so far deceived him that he no longer drove Frank inexorably before him , but permitted him to walk by his side , and even to lag a little behind . " Gobble , obble , obble ! " said the turkey , behind some bushes , still several rods off . " Yes , that 's my turkey ! " said the man , ready enough to claim the unseen fowl . " How do you know he is yours ? " asked Frank . " I know his gobble . One I had stole gobbled jest like that . " And the secessionist 's stern features relaxed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; for , serious as his dilemma had seemed a minute since , he could not but be amused by the man 's undoubting recognition of that gobble . " All turkeys make a noise alike , " said Frank . " No they do n't , no they do n't ! " said the man , positively , no doubt fearing a plot to get the fowl away from him , and anxious to set up his claim in season . " I reckon I know about turkeys . Hear that ? "  - -  as the sound was heard again , still at a distance . " That 's my bird . I should know that gobble among five hundred . " Frank suppressed his merriment , thinking that now was his time to get away . " Well , " said he , " unless you 'll sell me the bird , I do n't know that there 's any use of my going any farther with you . " He expected a repetition of the refusal to sell , when he would have the best excuse in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of some trick ,  - -  fearing , perhaps , that Frank would run off and get help to secure the turkey . " We 'll see ; we 'll see . Wait till we get the bird , " said the man . " You 've done me a good turn telling me about him , and mayhap I 'll sell him to you for your honesty . But wait a bit ; wait a bit . " They were fast approaching the bushes where the supposed turkey was . " Quit , quit , quit ! Gobble , obble , obble ! " said the pretended fowl . " He must know now , " thought Frank , with renewed apprehension ; but he dared not run . In fact , the old fellow was beginning to see that his recognition of his gobbler had been premature . A patch of blue uniform was visible through the brush . The rebel stopped , and drew up his gun . As Hamlet killed Polonius for a rat , so would he kill a Yankee for a turkey . Click ! the piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clodhopper , you ; do n't you shoot ! do n't you shoot ! " screamed Seth Tucket , rushing wildly out of the bushes just as the rebel pulled the trigger . XII . THE SECESSIONIST 'S TURKEYS . In the mean time the boys watching from their ambush , and seeing that the rebel had gone off with Frank , but left his dog and negro behind , armed themselves with clubs . When all was ready , Winch gave the word , and forward they dashed at the doublequick , clearing more than half the space intervening between them and the barns , before they were discovered by the enemy . Then the dog bounded out with a bark , and the old negro began to " holler , " and the rebel 's wife and daughter ran out and screamed , and an old negress also appeared , brandishing a broom , and adding her voice to the chorus . At this moment the report of a gun came from the direction in which the secessionist had gone off with Frank . John Winch heard it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was killed ? Frank or Seth ? John did not know , but he was frightened . He had come for fun and poultry , not for fighting and bullets . Neither was he particularly ambitions to be bitten by that monstrous dog . He lost faith in his club , and dropped it . He lost confidence in the prowess of his companions , and deserted them . In short , Jack Winch , who had been one of the most eager to engage in the adventure , took ignominiously to his heels . He reached the thicket before venturing to look behind him . Then he saw that his comrades had frightened away the negro , beaten back the dog , and taken the turkey-pen by storm . He would now have been but too glad to join them ; but it was too late . Having accomplished their undertaking , they were returning , each bringing , pendent by the legs , a flopping fowl . It is better to be a brave man than a coward , even in a bad cause . Fortune often favors brave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right , for Fortune loves not a poltroon . John Winch felt at that moment that nobody henceforth would love or favor him , and he began to frame excuses for his shameful conduct . " Hello , Jack Winch , " cried Ellis , coming up with a turkey in one hand and a chicken in the other , " you 're a smart leader -- to run away from a yelping dog like that ! " " Coward ! coward ! " chimed in the others , with angry contempt . " I sprained my ankle . Did n't you know it ? " said the miserable Jack , with a writhing countenance , limping . " Sprained your granny ! " exclaimed Harris . " I never saw a sprained ankle go over the ground as fast as yours did , just as we came to the dog . " " Then I heard the gun , " said Jack , " and I was afraid either Seth or Frank was shot . " " Woe to the man of turkeys if they are ! " said Joe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We 'll serve him as I am serving this hen . " The boys hastened to a rendezvous they had appointed with the absent ones , followed by Jack at a very creditable pace , considering his excruciating lameness . As yet , neither Frank nor Seth had been shot . The charge of buck shot fired from the rebel fowling-piece had entered the bushes just as the blue uniform left them . But the secessionist cocked the other barrel of his piece immediately , with the intention of making up for the error of his first aim . " Shoot me , " shouted Seth , " and you 'll be swinging from that limb in five minutes ! " The man hesitated , glancing quickly about for those who were expected to put Seth 's threat into execution . " I 've twenty fellows with me , " added Seth , " and they 'll string you up in no time , by darn ! " The secessionist was not so much impressed by the rather slender oath with which Seth clinched his speech , as by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  - -  Seth walking savagely up to him as he spoke . All the while , the alarm raised by the negro , and the dog , and the women , was sounding in the man 's ears . " They 're after my turkeys ! This is your trick , boy ! " and he sprang upon Frank , lifting his gun as if to level him to the earth . But Seth sprang after him , and seized the weapon before it descended . That green down-easter was cool as if he had been at a game of ball . He was an athletic youth , and he readily saw that Buckley , though a sturdy farmer , was no match for him . He pushed him back , shouting shrilly , at the same time , in the words of his favorite poet ,  --  " ' Now , if thou strik'st him but one blow , I 'll hurl thee from the brink as far as ever peasant pitched a bar ! ' " This strange form of salutation astonished the rebel even more than the rough treatment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tucket . He saw that it was no time to stay and parley . He knew that his turkeys were going , and , muttering a parting malediction at Frank , he set off at a run to protect his poultry-yard . " Now 's our time , " said Tucket , starting for the rendezvous , and striking into another quotation from his favorite minstrel , parodied for the occasion . " ' Speed , Manly , speed ! the cow 's tough hide on fleeter foot was ne'er tied . Speed , Manly , speed ! such cause of haste a drummer 's sinews never braced . For turkey 's doom and rebel deed are in thy course -- speed , Manly , speed ! ' " And speed they did , arriving at the place of meeting just as their companions came up with the poultry . " Hello , Jack ! " said Frank ; " what 's the matter with you ? " " He stumbled over a great piece of bark , " Ellis answered for Winch . " Did you , Jack ? " " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anguish . He had not thought of the bark before , but supposing Ellis had seen such a piece as he spoke of , he accepted his theory of the stumbling as readily as the rebel had recognized in Seth 's gobbling one of his own lost turkeys . " And broke my ankle , " added Jack . " What kind of bark was it ? do you know ? " said Ellis . " No . I was hurt so I did n't stop to look . " " Well , I 'll tell you . It was the dog 's bark . " And Ellis and his comrades shouted with laughter , all except poor Jack Winch , who knew too well that no other kind of bark had checked his progress . Then the turkey-stealers had their adventure to relate , and Frank had his amusing story to tell , and Tucket could brag how near he had come to being shot for one of Buckley 's gobblers , and all were merry but Jack , who had brought from the field nothing but a counterfeit lameness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sulky and dumb . " He limps dreadfully -- when any body is looking at him , " said Harris . " Nobody killed , and only one wounded , " said Frank . " The sight of old Buckley coming with his dog would be better than a surgeon , to cure that wound , " said Tucket . " You 'd see Winch leg it faster ' n any of us -- like the old woman that had the hypo 's , and had n't walked a step for twenty years , and thought she could n't ; but one day her friends got up a ghost to scare her , and she ran a mile before they could ketch her . " Do you know how these jokes , and the laughter that followed , sounded on the ear of Jack Winch ? Even the bark of the rebel mastiff was music in comparison , and his bite would have hurt him less . " By the way , " said Seth , " the old skinflint will be after us , sure as guns . Hurry ! or we 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , and faint , from farther distance borne , the darned old rebel 's dinner horn . ' Give me that chicken , Ellis . And , boys , we must manage some way to smuggle these fowls into camp . I can carry this chicken under my coat ; but how in Sam Hill you 'll manage with the turkeys , I do n't see . " " I know , " said Frank , always full of invention . " If nobody else has a better plan , I 've thought of a good one . " Several devices were suggested , but none met with general approbation . Then Frank explained his . " Cover up the turkeys with evergreens , and we will go in with our arms full , as if we were going to make wreaths for the regiment . " This plan was agreed upon , and shortly after the adventurers might have been seen returning to camp loaded down with boughs and vines . Jack alone came in empty-handed . Frank had no turkey , and so he threw down his load @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was not long before the owner of the turkeys made his appearance , carrying to headquarters his complaint of the robbery . Unfortunately , Frank was not only known as a drummer boy , but he wore the letter of his company on his cap . Besides , his youth rendered his identification comparatively easy . As might have been expected , therefore , he was soon called to an account . Captain Edney himself came to investigate the matter , accompanied by the secessionist . " That 's the boy , " said Buckley , with determined vindictiveness , when Frank was arraigned before him . Frank could not help looking a little pale , for he felt that he was in a bad scrape , and how he was to get out of it , without either lying or betraying his accomplices , he could not see . He did not care so much about himself , but he would not for any thing have borne witness against the others . He had almost made up his mind to tell a sturdy falsehood , if necessary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another , which he considered even more damaging to his character . For such is commonly the result of wrongdoing ; one step taken , you must take another to retrieve that . One foot in the mire , you must put the other in to get that out . However , the drummer boy still hoped that by putting a bold face on the matter , and prevaricating a little , he might still keep clear of that thing he had been taught always to abhor -- a downright untruth . " This man brings serious charges against you , Frank , " said Captain Edney . " I should think it was for me to bring charges against him , " replied Frank , trying to look indignant . " Why , what has he done to you ? " The captain could not help smiling as he spoke , and Frank felt encouraged . " He 's a rebel of the worst kind . He is always insulting the federal uniform , and he seems to think that whoever wears it is a villain . He threatened to set his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was going to knock me down with his gun . " " What was he going to knock you down for ? You must have done something to provoke him . " " Yes , I did ! " said Frank , boldly . " I went to his house , and asked him , in the politest way I could , if he would sell us fellows a turkey . I might have known that it would provoke him , for he has been heard to say he 'd rather his turkeys should die in the pen than that a Union soldier should have one , even for money . " It was evident to the secessionist that instead of making out a case against the boy , the boy was fast making out a case against him . In his impatience he broke forth into violent denunciations of Frank , but Captain Edney stopped him . " None of that , sir , or I 'll send you out of the camp forthwith . He says , "  - -  turning to Frank ,  --  " that you decoyed him into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Decoyed him ? " said Frank . " He may call it what he pleases . I 'll tell you just what I did , sir . He said he had n't any turkeys . So I said , ' Then the one I heard in the woods , as I came along , is n't yours -- is it ? ' " " Had you heard one ? " " I had heard a noise so much like one , "  - -  laughing ,  --  " that he himself , when he heard it , was ready to swear it was his gobbler . " " And was it really a turkey ? " " No , sir . It was Seth Tucket hid behind the bushes . " Frank was now conscious of making abundant fun for his comrades , who all crowded around , listening with delight to the investigation . Even Captain Edney smiled , as he gave a glance at the green-looking , seriously-winking Seth . " So it was you that played the gobbler , Tucket , " said the captain . " I hope there wa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sir , " replied Seth , with ludicrous mock solemnity . " Bein ' Christmas so , I thought I 'd like a little bit of turkey , sir , ef ' twant no more than the gobble . And there I was , enjoying it all by myself , hevin ' a nice time , when this man comes up and lays claim to me for his turkey . " This sober declaration , uttered in a high key , with certain jerks of the arms and twists of the down-east features , which Seth could use with the drollest effect , excited unrestrained mirth among the men , and made the officer 's sword-belts shake not a little with the suppressed merriment inside . " What do you mean by his claiming you ? " asked the captain . " He told Manly I belonged to him , and that some thieving Yankee had stolen me. " said Seth , with open eyes and mouth , as if he had been making the most earnest statement . " Now I 'll leave it to any body ef that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complaints of hevin ' turkeys stole amounts to ; for ef he can make a mistake so easy in my case , he may in others . Though mabby he means I stole the gobble of one of his turkeys . I own it 's a gobble I picked up somewheres , but I did n't know ' t was his . " And Tucket drew down his face with an expression of incorruptible innocence . " Well , boys , " said the captain , silencing the laughter , " we have had fun enough for the occasion , though it is a merry Christmas . No more buffoonery . Tucket . Were you aware , Frank , that it was Tucket , and not a turkey , in the bushes , when you took this man to the woods ? " " I rather thought it was Tucket , " said Frank , " though the man stuck to it so stoutly that ' t was his gobbler , I did n't know but --  --  " " Never mind about that . " The captain saw that it was Frank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the business , and promptly checked him . " What was your motive in deceiving him ? " " To have a little fun , sir . " " Did you not know that there was a design to rob his poultry pen ? " Frank recollected his momentary doubts as to the good faith of his companions , when the dog assailed him , and thought he could make that uncertainty the base of a strong " No , sir . " " But you know his pen was robbed ? " " No , sir , I do not know it --  --  , " Frank reflecting as he spoke , that a man can not really know any thing of which he has not been an eye-witness , and comforting his conscience with the fact that he had not seen the turkeys stolen . " Now , "  - -  Captain Edney did not betray by look or word whether he believed or doubted the boy 's assertion ,  --  " tell me who was with you in the woods . " " Seth Tucket , sir . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellows had been with me . " " Name them . " And Frank proceeded to name several who had really been with him that morning , but not on the forage after poultry . On being called up and questioned , they were able to give the most positive testimony , to the effect that they had neither stolen any fowls themselves nor been with any party that had . In the mean time the sergeant and second lieutenant instituted a search through the company 's tents , and succeeded in finding a solitary turkey , which nobody could give any account of , and which nobody claimed . This the secessionist identified ; averring that there were also a dozen more , besides several chickens , for which redress was due . But not one of them could be discovered , perhaps because they were so skilfully concealed , but more probably because those who searched were not anxious to find . Captain Edney accordingly paid the man for the loss of the single turkey , which he ordered sent immediately to the hospital . He also told the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was ready to swear had been appropriated by the men of his company , provided he would first take the oath of allegiance to the United States . This Buckley sullenly refused to do , and he was immediately conducted by a guard outside the lines . Seth Tucket followed at a short distance , saying , as he put his hand in his pocket , as if to produce some money , " Say , friend ! better le ' me pay ye for that gobble I stole . Any thing in reason , ye know . " But Buckley gave him only a glance of compressed rage , and marched off in silence , with disappointment and revenge in his heart . XIII . THE EXPEDITION MOVES . Frank won the greatest credit from his comrades by the manner in which he had gone through the investigation . And the fowls , which those who searched could not discover , found their way somehow to the cooks , and back again to the boys , and were shared among their companions , who had a feast and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the excitement which carried Frank through had subsided , and it was night , and he lay in the darkness and solitude of the tent , with his comrades asleep around him ,  - -  then came sober reflection ; and he thought of the poor man who had lost his turkeys , and who , for one , had got no fun out of the business ; and he remembered that he had , to all intents and purposes , lied to Captain Edney ; and he knew in his heart that he had done a dishonest thing . Yes , he had actually been engaged in stealing turkeys . He was guilty of an act of which , a few weeks before , he would have deemed himself absolutely incapable . All the mitigating circumstances of the case , which had lately stood out so clear and strong as almost to hide the offence from his moral vision , now faded , and shrunk away , and the wrong itself stood forth , alone , in its undisguised ugliness . " What is it to me that the man is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to rob him . He is not in arms against the government ; and we do n't know that he assists the rebels in any way , either by giving them information or money . Perhaps he had good reason to hate the Union soldiers . If he had not before , he has now . I wish I had let his turkeys alone . " These words Frank did not exactly frame to himself , lying there in the dark and silent tent ; but so said the soul within him . And the next day the culpability of his conduct was brought home still more forcibly to his conscience by the receipt of a box from home . It contained , besides a turkey , pies , cakes , apples , and letters . And in one of the letters his mother wrote ,  --  " I hope these things will reach you by Christmas , and that you will enjoy them , and share them with those who have been good to you , and be very happy . We all think of the hardships you have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our comforts if you could only have them . We shall not have any turkey at Christmas -- we shall all be so much happier to think you have one . For I would not have you so much as tempted to do what you say some of the soldiers have done -- that is , steal the turkeys belonging to the secessionists . If there are rebels at heart , not yet in open opposition to the government , I would have you treat them kindly , and not provoke them to hate our cause worse than they do already . And always remember that , whatever the government may see fit to do to punish such men , you have no right to interfere with either their private opinions or their private property . " Why was it that the contents of Frank 's Christmas box did not taste so good to him as he had anticipated ? Simply because he could partake of neither pie nor turkey without the sorry sauce of a reproving conscience . He thought to atone for his fault by magnanimity in sharing with others what he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mates , and carried a large piece of the turkey , together with a generous supply of stuffing , and an entire mince pie , to his old friend Sinjin . Now , Frank had not , for the past month , been on as good terms with the veteran as formerly . The meeting with Mrs. Manly in Boston seemed to have awakened unpleasant remembrances in the old drummer 's mind , and to render him unpleasantly stiff and cold towards her son . He had received the thanksgiving wreath with a very formal and stately acknowledgment , and Frank , who knew not what warm torrents might be gushing beneath the stern old man 's icy exterior , had kept himself somewhat resentfully aloof from him ever since . But he still felt a yearning for their former friendship , and he now hoped , with the aid of the good gifts of which he was the bearer , to make up with him . " I wish you a merry Christmas , " said Frank , arrived at the old man 's tent . " You are rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replied Sinjin , lifting his brows , as he sat in his tent and looked quietly over his shoulder at the visitor . " I know it , " said Frank . " But the truth is , I had n't any thing to wish you a merry Christmas with yesterday . But this morning I got a box by express , full of goodies , direct from home . " " Ah ! " said the old man , with a singular unsteadiness of eye , while he tried to look cold and unconcerned . " Yes ; is n't it grand ? A turkey of my mother 's own stuffing , and pies of her own baking , and every thing that 's splendid . And she said she hoped you would accept a share , with her very kind regards . And so I 've brought you some . " The old man had got up on his feet . But he did not offer to relieve Frank 's hands . He made no reply to his little speech ; and he seemed not so much to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past far away . Perhaps it was not the drummer boy he saw at all , but fairer features , still like his -- a sweet young girl ; the same he used to trot upon his knees , in those unforgotten years , so long ago , when he was in his manhood 's prime , and life was still fresh to him , and he had not lost his early faith in friendship and love . There Frank stood , holding the cover of the Christmas box , with the good things from home upon it , and waited , and wondered ; and there the old man stood and dreamed . " Please , sir , will you let me leave them here ? " said Frank , ready to cry with disappointment at this strange reception . The old man heaved a sigh , brushed his hand across his eyes , and came back to the present . He stooped and took the gift with a tremulous smile , but without a word . He did not tell the drummer boy that he had , in that instant of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age , and that his old heart now , though seemingly withered and embittered , gushed again with love so sorrowful and yearning , that he could have taken her son in his arms , even as he had so often taken her , and have wept over him . And Frank , in his ignorance , went away , feeling more hurt than ever at his old friend 's apparent indifference . * * * * And now matters were assuming a more and more warlike appearance . For some time Frank 's regiment had been out on brigade drill twice a week , and he had written home a glowing description of the scene . But an incomparably grander sight was the inspection and review of the entire division , which took place the last week of December . The parade ground , comprising two thousand acres , at once smooth and undulating , was admirably fitted to show off , with picturesque and splendid effect , the evolutions of regiment , brigade , and division . Thousands of spectators flocked from Annapolis and the vicinity , in vehicles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the display . Frank was with his company , carrying his knapsack , haversack , tin cup , and canteen , like the rest , and with his drum at his side . He could not but feel a pride in the grand spectacle of which he formed a part . At eleven o'clock , Brigadier-General Foster , commanding the department in Burnside 's absence , passed down the line , accompanied by a numerous staff , and followed by the governor of the state and members of the legislature . They inspected each regiment in turn ; and many were the looks of interest and pleased surprise which the young drummer boy received from officers and civilians . The reviewing party then took its position on the right , the words of command rang along the line , and regiment after regiment , breaking into battalion column , filed , with steady tramp , in superb , glittering array , to the sound of music , past the general and his assistants . No wonder the drummer boy 's heart beat high with military enthusiasm , as he marched with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could withstand such disciplined masses of troops . And now the fleet of transports , which were to convey them to their destination , were gathering at Annapolis . The camp was full of rumors respecting the blow which was to be struck , and the troops were eager to strike it . So ended the old year , the first of the war ; and the new year came in . It was now January , 1862 . On the 3d , the regiment was for the first time paid off . Frank received pay for two months ' service , at twelve dollars a month . He kept only four dollars for his own use , and sent home the remaining twenty dollars in a check , to be drawn by his father in Boston . It was a source of great pride and satisfaction to him that he could send money to his parents ; and he wondered at the greedy selfishness of John Winch , who immediately commenced spending his pay for pies and cakes , at the sutler 's enormous prices . On the 6th , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was snow on the ground , which had fallen the night before ; and the weather was very cold . The city was a scene of busy activity . The fleet lay in the harbor . Troops and baggage trains crowded to the wharves . Transport after transport took on board its precious freight of lives , and hauling out into the stream to make room for others , dropped anchor off the town . After waiting five hours -- five long and dreary hours -- at the Naval Academy , our regiment took its turn . One half went on board an armed steamer , whose decks were soon swarming with soldiers and bristling with guns . The other half took passage in a schooner . And the steamer took the schooner in tow , and anchored with her in the river . And so Frank and his comrades bade farewell to the soil of Maryland . The excitement of these scenes had served to put Frank 's conscience to sleep again . However , it received a sting , when , on the day of leaving Annapolis , he learned that the secessionist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his wrongs , quitted his farm , and gone to join the rebel army . XIV . THE VOYAGE AND THE STORM . On the morning of the 9th of January the fleet sailed . Frank was on board the schooner towed out by her steam consort . Although the morning was cold and wet , the decks of the transports were crowded with troops witnessing the magnificent spectacle of their own departure . Just before they got under way , a jubilant cheering was heard . Frank made his way to the vessel 's side , to see what was going on . A small row-boat passed , conveying some officer of distinction to his ship . Frank observed that he was a person of quite unpretending appearance , but of pleasant and noble features . " Burnside ! Burnside ! Burnside ! " shouted a hundred voices . And in acknowledgment of the compliment , the modest hero of the expedition stood up in the boat , and uncovered his high , bald forehead and dome-like head . The rowers pulled at their oars , and the boat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enthusiasm every where , until the general 's flag-ship , the little steamer Picket , took him on board . And now the anchors were up , the smoke-pipes trailed their cloudy streamers on the breeze , flags and pennants were flying , paddle-wheels began to turn and plash , the bands played gay music , and the fleet drew off , in a long line of countless steamers and sailing vessels , down the Severn , and down the Chesapeake . All day , through a cold , drizzling rain , the fleet sailed on , the transports still keeping in sight of each other , in a line extending for miles along the bleak , inhospitable bay . The next morning , Frank went on deck , and found the schooner at anchor in a fog . The steamer lay alongside . No other object was visible -- only the restlessly-dashing waters . The wild shrieking of the steamer 's whistle , blowing in the fog to warn other vessels of the fleet to avoid running down upon them , the near and far responses of similarly screaming whistles , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At nine o'clock , anchors were weighed again , and the fleet proceeded slowly , feeling its way , as it were , in the obscurity . There was more or less fog throughout the day ; but towards sundown a breeze blew from the shore , the fog rolled back upon the sea , the clouds broke into wild flying masses , the blue sky shone through , and the sunset poured its placid glory upon the scene . Again the troops crowded the decks . The fleet was entering Hampton Roads . Upon the right , basking in the golden sunset as in the light of an eternal calm , a stupendous fortress lay , like some vast monster of old time , asleep . Frank shivered with strange sensations as he gazed upon that immense and powerful stronghold of force ; trying to realize that , dreaming so quietly there in the sunset , those gilded walls , which seemed those of an ancient city of peace , meant horrible , deadly war . " By hooky ! " said Seth Tucket , coming to his side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she ? I 'd no idee the old woman spread her hoop skirts over so much ground . " " You can see the big Union gun there on the beach , " said Atwater . " To look at that , then just turn your eye over to Sewell 's Point there , where the rebel batteries are , makes it seem like war . " And the tall , grave soldier smiled , with a light in his eye Frank had seldom seen before . The evening was fine , the sky clear , the moon shining , the air balmy and spring-like . The fleet had come to anchor in the Roads . The bands were playing , and the troops cheering from deck to deck . The moonlight glittered on the water , and whitened the dim ships riding at anchor , and lay mistily upon the bastions of the great slumbering fortress . At a late hour , Frank , with his eyes full of beauty and his ears full of music , went below , crept into his berth , and thought of home , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , until he fell asleep . The next day the fleet still lay in Hampton Roads . There were belonging to the expedition over one hundred and twenty-five vessels of all classes , freighted with troops , horses , forage , and all the paraphernalia of war . And this was the last morning which was to behold that magnificent and powerful armada entire and unscattered . At night the fleet sailed . Once at sea , the sealed orders , by which each vessel was to shape its course , were opened , and Hatteras Inlet was found to be its first destination . The next day was Sunday , January 12 . The morning was densely foggy . Frank , who had been seasick all night , went on deck to breathe the fresh sea air . The steamer , still towing the Schooner , was just visible in the fog , at the other end of the great sagging hawser . And the sea was rolling , rolling , rolling . And the ship was tossing , tossing , tossing . And Frank 's poor stomach , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the night before , recommenced heaving , heaving , heaving . He clung to the rail of the schooner , and every time it went down , and every time it came up , he seemed to grow dizzier and sicker than ever . He consoled himself by reflecting that he was only one of hundreds on hoard , who were , or had been , in the same condition ; and when he was sickest he could not help laughing at Seth Tucket 's inexhaustible drollery . " Well , try again , ef ye want to , " said that poetical private , addressing his stomach . " Be mean , and stick to it . Keep heaving , and be darned ! " Stomach took him at his word , and for a few minutes he leaned heavily by Frank 's side . " There ! " he said to it , triumphantly , " ye could n't do any thing , and I told ye so . Now I hope ye 'll keep quiet a minute . Ye wo n't ? Going at it again ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none o ' my business -- by gosh ! "  - -  lifting up his head with a bitter grin ; " that inside of me is like Milton 's chaos , in Paradise Lost . ' Up from the bottom turned by raging wind and furious assault ! '  - -  Here it goes again ! " Frank had been scarcely less amused by the misery of Jack Winch , who declared repeatedly that he should die , that he wished he was dead , and so forth , with groanings unutterable . But Frank kept up his courage , and after eating a piece of hard bread for breakfast , began to feel better . Towards noon the fog blew off , and the beach was visible on the right ,  - -  long , low , desolate , a shore of interminable sand , over which the breakers leaped and ran like hordes of wild horses with streaming tails and manes . Not a sign of vegetation was to be seen on that barren coast , nor any trace of human existence , save here a lonely house on the ridge , and yonder a dismantled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of some half-buried hulk protruding from the sand . On the other side was an unbroken horizon of water . Numerous vessels of the fleet were still in sight And now a little steamer came dashing gayly along , hailed with cheers . It was the Picket , General Burnside 's flag-ship . In the afternoon , more fog . But at sunset it was clear . The wind was light , blowing from the south . But now the ocean rolled in long , enormous swells , showing that the vessels were approaching Cape Hatteras ; for , whatever may be the aspect of the sea elsewhere , here its billows are never at rest . So the sun went down , and the night came on , with its cold moon and stars , and Hatteras lighthouse shot its arrowy ray far out across the dark water . The breeze freshened and increased to a gale ; and the violence of the waves increased with it , until the schooner creaked and groaned in every part , and it seemed as if she must break in pieces . Sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , sweeping over it , poured in cataracts from her sides . Now a heavy cross-sea struck her beams with the jarring force of an avalanche of rocks , flinging more than one unlucky fellow clear from his berth . And now her bows went under , sunk by a weight of rolling water , from which it seemed for an instant impossible that she could ever emerge . But rise she did , each time , slowly , laboring , quivering , and groaning , like a living thing in mortal agony . Once , as she plunged , the great cable that united her fortunes with those of the steamer , unable to bear the tremendous strain , snapped like a wet string ; and immediately she fell off helplessly before the gale . The troops had a terrible night of it . Many were deathly sick . Two or three broke their watches , besides getting badly bruised , by pitching from their bunks . Frank would not have dared to go to sleep , even if he could . Once , when the ship gave a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wave , he heard somebody tumble . " Who 's that ? " he asked . And the nasal sing-song of the poetical Tucket answered , " ' Awaking with a start , the waters heave around me , and on high the winds lift up their voices ; I depart , whither I know not ; but the hour 's gone by when Boston 's lessening shores can grieve or glad mine eye . ' " And Tucket crept back into his bunk . " We 're all going to the bottom , I 'm sure , " whined John Winch , from the top berth , over Frank . " I believe we 're sinking now . " " Well , " said Frank , " the water will reach me first , and you 'll be one of the last to go under ; you 've that for a satisfaction . " " I believe that 's what he chose the top berth for , " said Harris . " How can you be joking , such a time as this ? " said John . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Atwater ? " " No , " said the soldier , who lay sick , with his thoughts far away . " Ellis is ; ai n't you , Ellis ? " And Jack reached to shake his comrade . " How can you be asleep , Ned , when we 're all going to the bottom ? " " Let me alone ! " growled Ned . " We are going to the bottom , " said Jack ,  - -  the ship just then rolling in the trough of the sea . " I ca n't help it if we are , " replied Ellis , sick and stupefied ; " and I do n't care much . Let me go to the bottom in peace . " " O Lord ! O Lord ! O Lord ! " moaned Jack , in despair , feeling more like praying than ever before in his life . Tucket had a line of poetry to suit his case :  --  " ' And then some prayed -- the first time in some years ; ' " he said , quoting Byron . And he proceeded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very edifying to the unhappy Winch : " ' Then rose from sea to sky the wild farewell , ' " etc . " I never would have enlisted if I was such a coward as Jack , " said Harris , contemptuously . " I ai n't a coward , " retorted Jack . " I enlisted to fight , not to go to sea and be drowned . " " Drownded -- ded -- ded -- dead ! " said Tucket . " O , yes , " said Harris , " you are mighty fierce for getting ashore and fighting . But when you were on land you were just as glad to get to sea . Now I hope you 'll get enough of it . I would n't mind a shipwreck myself , just to hear you scream . " Then Tucket : " ' At first one universal shriek there rushed , louder than the loud ocean ,  - -  like a crash of echoing thunder ; and then all was hushed , save the wild wind , and the remorseless dash of billows ; but at intervals there gushed , accompanied with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private Winch , in his last agony ! ' " After this , conversation ceased for a time , and there was no noise but of the storm , and the groanings of the ship and of the sick . Frank could not sleep , but , clinging to his berth , and listening to the shock of billows , thought of the other vessels of that brave fleet , scattered and tossed , and wondered at the awful power of the sea . Then he remembered the story Corporal Gray had that day told them of the great Spanish Armada , which sailed in the days of Queen Elizabeth to invade England , and was blown to its destruction by the storms of the Almighty ; and he questioned within himself whether this proud expedition was destined for a similar fate . Already he seemed to hear the lamentations of those at home , and the frantic rejoicings of the rebels . The next morning the wind lulled ; but the sea still ran high . The sun rose upon a scene of awful grandeur . The schooner was sailing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gale . The steamer was nowhere in sight ; but other vessels of the shattered fleet could be seen , some near , and some half below the horizon , far out at sea . The waves , white-capped , green-streaked , ceaselessly shifting , with dark blue hollows and high-curved crests all bursting into foam , came chasing each other , and passed on like sliding liquid hills , spurning the schooner from their slippery backs . " ' Roll on , thou deep and dark blue ocean ! roll ! ten thousand fleets sweep over thee in vain ! ' " observed Tucket , coming on deck with Frank , and gazing around at the few tossed remnants of the storm-scattered expedition . Wild and terribly beautiful the scene was ; and Frank , who had often wished to behold the ocean in its fury , was now sufficiently recovered from his sickness to enjoy the opportunity . Nor was the wondering delight with which he saw the sun rise out of the deep , and shine across the tumbling yeasty waves , at all diminished by the drolleries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , saying the queerest things , and ever and anon shouting poetry to the running seas . " ' Though the strained mast should quiver as a reed , and the rent canvas fluttering strew the gale , still must I on ; for I am as a weed flung from the rocks on Ocean 's foam to sail , where'er secession breeds , or treason 's works prevail , ' "  - -  added Seth , altering the verse to suit the occasion . The fleet had indeed been rudely handled in that rough night off the cape . But now sail after sail hove in sight , all making their way as best they could towards the inlet . This some reached , and got safely in before night . Others , attempting to enter , got aground , and were with difficulty got off again . Some anchored outside , and some lay off and on , waiting for morning , to be piloted past the shoals , and through the narrow channel , to a safe anchorage inside . XV . HATTERAS INLET . But what a morning dawned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been raging all night , and its violence was still increasing . And now it came on to rain ; and rain and wind and sea appeared to vie with each other in wreaking their fury on the ill-starred expedition . Tuesday night the storm abated , and Wednesday brought fair weather . The fleet in the mean time had suffered perils and hardships which can never be told . Many of the transports were still missing . Many were at anchor outside the inlet , waiting for pilots to bring them in . Some had been lost . The " City of New York , " a large steam propeller , freighted with stores and munitions of war , had struck on the bar , and foundered in the breakers . The crew , after clinging for twenty-four hours in the rigging to avoid being washed off by the sea , which made a clean breach over her , had been saved , but vessel and cargo were a total loss . Frank had watched the wreck , which seemed at one moment to emerge from the waves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and enveloped in a white shroud of foam . The schooner had escaped the dangers of the sea , and was safe at last inside the inlet ; as safe , at least , as any of the fleet , in so precarious an anchorage . There was still another formidable bar to pass before the open waters of Pamlico Sound could be entered . The transports that had got in were lying in a basin , full of shoals , with but little room to swing with the tide , and they were continually running into each other , or getting aground . Nor was it encouraging to see bales of hay from one of the wrecks lodge at low water upon the very sand-bar which the fleet had still to cross . Frank and his comrades took advantage of the fair weather to make observation of the two forts , Hatteras and Clark , which command the situation . These were constructed by the rebels , but had been captured from them by General Butler and Commodore Stringham , in August , 1861 , and were now garrisoned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of one of the low , barren islands which separate this part of Pamlico Sound from the Atlantic . Between two narrow sand-spits the tides rush in and out with great force and rapidity ; and this is the inlet -- a mere passage cut through into the sound by the action of the sea . As the schooner was being towed farther in , some men in a boat , who had been ashore at Fort Hatteras , and were returning to their ship , came alongside . The party consisted of some officers belonging to a New Jersey regiment , together with a boat 's crew of six men . " Throw us a line , " they said ; " and tow us along . " A line was flung to them from the schooner ; but they had some difficulty in getting it , for the waves were running high in the channel . Pending the effort , the tiller slipped from the hands of the officer who was steering ; a heavy sea struck the boat on the quarter , and she capsized . Boats were lowered from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a scene of intense and anxious interest to Frank , who was on deck and saw it all . The men in the water righted the boat several times , but she filled and capsized as often . One officer was seen to get his feet entangled , sink with his head downward , and drown in that position before he could be extricated . He was the colonel of the regiment . The surgeon of the regiment also perished . All the rest were saved . The drowned bodies were brought upon deck , and every effort was made to bring back life into them ; but in vain . And there they lay ; so full of hope , and courage , and throbbing human life an hour ago -- now two pale , livid corpses . The incident made a strong impression on Frank , not yet accustomed to the aspect of death , which was destined to become so familiar to his eyes a few days later . Still the dangers and delays that threatened to prove fatal to the expedition were far from ended . It seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear . Avarice , incapacity , and treachery at home had conspired with the elements against it . Many of the larger vessels drew too much water for the passage into the sound , and were wholly unfit for the voyage . " The contractors , " said Burnside , " have ruined me ; but God holds me in his palm , and all will yet be well . " With nothing to distinguish him but his yellow belt , in blue shirt , slouched hat , and high boots , he stood like a sea-god ( says an eye-witness ) in the bows of his light boat , speaking every vessel , and inquiring affectionately about the welfare of the men . Storm succeeded storm , while the fleet was yet at the inlet ; many days elapsing before the principal vessels could be got over the " bulkhead , " as the bar is called , which still intervened between them and the sound . To add to the sufferings of the troops , the supply of fresh water gave out . Much of that with which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been put up in old oil casks , which imparted to it a taste and odor far from agreeable . But even of such wretched stuff as this , there was at length none to be had . " We had ham for dinner yesterday , " wrote Frank ; " but as we had nothing to drink after it , we thought we should die of thirst . I never suffered so in my life ; and O , what would I have given for a good drink out of our well at home ! We were as glad as so many ducks , this morning , to see it rain . O , it did pour beautifully ! I never knew what a blessing rain was before . I went on deck , and got wet through , catching water where it dripped from the rigging . But I did n't care for the soaking -- I had filled my canteen ; and I tell you , that nasty rain-water was a luxury . " The noble-hearted general was grieved to the soul by the sufferings of his men . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment from his efforts to atone , by his own vigilance and activity , for the culpable inefficiency and negligence of others . He hastened to Fort Clark , where there was a condenser for converting salt water into fresh , and attended personally to putting it into operation . By this means a miserably meager supply was obtained ,  - -  enough , however , together with the rain that was caught , to keep the demon of thirst at bay until the water vessels could arrive . Ten days elapsed after the schooner entered the inlet before she was got over the bulkhead into the open sound . And still ten days more were destined to slip by before any general movement against the enemy was attempted by the fleet . In the mean while the troops confined on shipboard resorted to a thousand devices for passing away the time . There was dancing , there was card-playing , there was singing ; and many new games were invented for the occasion . Frank learned the manual of arms . Something else he learned , not so much to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to remind the reader of the peculiar circumstances in which he was placed -- the tedious hours ; the hardships , which he was glad to forget at any cost ; the example of companions , all older , and many so much older than himself ; and , not least by any means , his own ardent and susceptible nature . One day he joined his comrades in a game of bluff . Now , bluff is a game there is no fun in unless some stake is played for . The boys had been ashore , and gathered some pebbles and shells from the beach , and these were used for the purpose . Frank had great success . He won more shells than any body . In the excitement , he forgot his thirst , and all the accompanying troubles . He forgot , too , that this was a kind of gambling . And he was so elated , that when somebody proposed to play for pennies , he did not think that it would be much worse to do that than to play for shells and pebbles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cents in about an hour . He did not intend to keep them , for he did not think that would be right . " I 'll play , " said he , " and let the boys win them back again . " But , at the next sitting , he won still more pennies ; so that he thought he could well afford to play a bolder game . His success was all the more gratifying when he considered that he was the youngest of the party , and that by skill and good fortune he was beating his elders . One day , after he had won more than a dollar ,  - -  which seems a good deal of money to a boy in his condition ,  - -  he began to lose . This was not so amusing . He had made up his mind that when his winnings were gone , he would stop playing ; and the idea of stopping was not pleasant to contemplate . How could he give up a sport which surpassed everything else in the way of excitement ? However , he determined to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a test . The luck had turned , and Frank found himself where he began . If he played any more , he must risk his own money . He did n't mind losing a few pennies ,  - -  that was nothing serious ; but the boys were not playing for simple pennies now . " I believe I 've played enough , boys , " said he , passing his hand across his heated brow , and casting his eyes around at objects which looked strange to them after their long and intense application to the cards . " O , of course ! " sneered Jack Winch , who was watching the game , " Frank 'll stop as soon as he is beginning to lose a little . " Jack was not playing , for a very good reason . He had spent nearly all his money , and lost the rest . He had lost some of it to Frank , and was consequently very desirous of seeing the latter brought to the same condition as himself . The sneering remark stung Frank . He would gladly have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he had still in his pocket over two dollars of the money he had reserved for himself when the troops were paid off . And it did seem rather mean in him , now he thought of it , to throw up the game the moment others were serving him as he had been only too willing to serve them . " I 'm not afraid of losing my money , " said he , blushing ; " but I 've had enough play for one day . " " You did n't get sick of it so easy when the luck was on your side , " said Harris , who had lost money to Frank , and now wanted his revenge . " For instance , yesterday , when the Parrott was talking to the boy , " said Seth . The Parrott he spoke of was one of the twelve-pound Parrott guns the schooner carried ; and the boy was the buoy , or target , in the water , at which the gunners had practised firing round shot . Frank remembered how all wanted to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At another time he would have taken great interest in it , and have been on hand to cheer as enthusiastically as any body when the well-aimed shots struck the water ; but his mind was completely absorbed in winning money . There was no such noble diversion on deck to-day ; and it was only too easy to set ? his real reason for getting so soon tired of bluff . " That 's right , Frank ; stop ! Now 's a good time , " said Atwater , who watched the game a good deal , but never took a hand in it . " Well , I sha n't urge him , ef he 's in ' arnest , " said Seth ; " though he has kep ' me at it a darned sight longer ' n I wanted to , sometimes , when ' t was my tin ' stid of his'n that was goin ' by the board . Stop where ye be , my bold drummer boy ; keep yer money , ef ye 've got any left ; that is the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I approve it , too ; I know the wrong , and yet the wrong pursue , ' " added Tucket , dealing the cards . No doubt he meant to give Frank good advice . But to the sensitive and proud spirit of the boy , it sounded like withering sarcasm . He could n't stand that . " I 'll play fifteen minutes longer , " said he , looking at his watch , " if that 'll please you . " " A quarter of an hour ! " said Harris , contemptuously . " We 'd better all stop now , and come at it fresh again , by and by . " The proposition was acceded to ; for what could Frank say against it ? He had not the courage to say , " Boys , I feel that I have been doing wrong , and I mean to stop at once ; " but he thought it more manly to play once more , if only to show that he was not afraid of losing . " And perhaps , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ win . " XVI . HOW FRANK LOST HIS WATCH . Play again he did accordingly ; and , sure enough , he won . He brought Tucket to his last dime . The poetical and philosophic spirit in which that good-humored young man contemplated his losses , was worthy of a better cause . " ' Fare thee well , and , if forever , still forever fare thee well , ' " he remarked , staking the said dime . And when it was lost ,  - -  for Frank " raked the pile , "  - -  he added , pathetically , going from Byron to Burns , " ' Fare thee weel , thou brightest , fairest ; fare thee weel , thou last and dearest ! Had we never loved sae kindly , had we never loved sae blindly , never met , or never parted , I had ne'er been broken-hearted . ' Boys , I 'm dead broke , and must quit off , without some of you that are flush will lend me a quarter . " " Ask Frank , " said Ellis ; " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarter , and with that quarter Seth won back all his money , and , in the course of two more sittings , cleaned Frank out , as the phrase is . Then , one would say , Frank had a valid excuse to retire , if not before . He had risked his money , and lost it . Certainly nothing more could be expected of him . Seth grinned , and Jack Winch rubbed his hands with delight . But now Frank was not content . His heart was gnawed by chagrin . He had not really wished to stop playing at all ; for the sense of vacancy and craving which always , in such natures , succeeds the cessation of unhealthy excitement , is misery enough in itself . But to have left off with as much money in his pocket as he began with , would have been felicity , compared with the bitter consciousness of folly , the stinging vexation and regret , which came with his misfortunes . " I 'll lend ye , if ye like , " said the good-natured Seth -- perhaps in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather because he pitied the boy , and meant to let him win back his money ; for , with all his mischief and drollery , this Tucket was one of the most generous and kind-hearted of Frank 's friends . The offer was gladly accepted ; and Frank , praying Fortune to favor him , made a promise in his heart , that , if she would aid him to recover his losses , he would then bid farewell forever to the enticing game . But the capricious goddess does not answer prayers . On the contrary , she delights to side with those who need her least , spurning away the supplicants at her feet . Frank borrowed a quarter , and lost it immediately . He borrowed again , determined to play more carefully . He waited until he had an excellent hand , then staked his money . Tucket and Ellis did not play ; and the game was between Frank and Harris . Both were confident , and they kept doubling their stakes , Frank borrowing again and again of Seth for the purpose . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the game . He knew Harris 's style of playing too well to be much daunted by his audacity , not believing that he held that one stronger hand than his . " I 'll lend ye as long as ye call for more , " said Seth ; " only , seeing you 've borrowed already more'n I 've won of ye , s'posin ' ye give me some security ? " " I 've nothing to give , " said Frank . " There 's your watch , " suggested Winch , who had had a glimpse of Joe 's cards . And at the same time he winked significantly , giving Frank to understand that his antagonist had not a hand of very great strength . Thus encouraged , sure of victory , and too much beside himself to consider the sacred nature of the object he was placing in pawn , Frank handed over his watch to Seth , and received from him loan after loan , until he was eight dollars in his debt . Seth did not like to advance any more than that on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with flushed face and trembling hands , placed his all upon the board . Then Harris , showing his cards , with a smile , swept the pile towards his cap . " Let me see ! " cried Frank , incredulous , staying his arm until he could be sure of the cards . His flushed face turned white ; his hand fell upon the bench as if suddenly palsied . " Two pairs of aces ! that 's what I call luck , Joe , " said Winch , scarce able to restrain his joyous chuckling . Frank looked up at him with wild distress and kindling fury in his face . " It was you , Jack Winch ! You made me --  --  " " Made you what ? " said John , insolently . What , indeed ? He had by looks , which spoke as plainly as words , assured Frank that Harris held but an indifferent hand ; whereas he held the best the pack afforded . By that falsehood , for , with looks and actions at your command , it is not necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ downright , absolute lie ,  - -  he had induced Frank to play on boldly to his own ruin . But was he alone to blame ? Even if he had told the truth about Joe 's hand , ought Frank to have been influenced by it ? He had no right to that knowledge , and to take advantage of it was dishonest . No doubt Frank himself thought so , now he reflected upon it . To accuse Jack was to confess his own disingenuousness . He was by nature as fair and open as the day ; he despised a base deception ; and it was only as an inevitable consequence of such wrong doings as lead directly to faithlessness and duplicity , that he could ever become guilty of these immoralities . Such is the vice of gambling -- a process by which men hope to obtain their neighbors ' goods without yielding an equivalent for them ; and which , therefore , inflames covetousness , and accustoms the mind to the contemplation of unjust gains , until it is ready to resort to any unjust means of securing them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a contradiction . You might , with equal consistency , talk of truthful liars . To get your money , or any thing else , without rendering an equitable return , is the core of all dishonesty , whether in the gamester , the pickpocket , the man who cheats in trade , or the boy who robs orchards . And a conscience once debauched by dishonest aims , will not , as I said , long scruple at unfair means . Singularly enough , Frank was more abashed by the betrayal of the unfair means he had attempted to use , than he had yet been by any consciousness of the immorality of the practice which led to them . He could not say to Winch , " You told me I was sure of winning , and so deceived me . " He only looked at him a moment , with wild distress and exasperation on his face , which quickly changed to an expression of morose and bitter despair ; and dropping his head , and putting up his hands , he burst into irrepressible sobs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me --  " and which he had so ignominiously gambled away . No wonder he wept . No wonder he shook from head to foot with the passion of grief , as the conviction of his own folly and infatuation burned like intolerable fire in his soul . " Dry up , baby ! " said Jack , through his teeth . " There comes the captain . " Baby ? Poor Frank ! It was because he was not altogether given over to recklessness and vice that he cried at the thought of his lost watch , and of his gross ingratitude to the unknown giver . Still he felt that it was weak in him to cry . He who risks his property in order to get possession of another 's should be philosopher enough to take with equanimity the loss of his own . " Do n't be childish , Frank ; do n't be silly ! " said his friends . And , indeed , he had the strongest reason for suppressing his sobs . Captain Edney was approaching . He was the last person to whom he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He loved and respected him ; and we fear most the disapprobation of those we love and respect . Moreover , through him the heart-breaking intelligence of her son 's evil courses might reach Mrs. Manly . But no doubt Frank 's chief motive for concealing the cause of his grief from Captain Edney was the suspicion he still entertained , notwithstanding that officer 's professed ignorance of the entire matter , that he was in reality the secret donor of the watch . So he choked back his sobs , and pretended to be assorting some pebbles , which the boys used as counters , especially when certain officers were passing , who would have reproved them if they had seen money on the board . And Captain Edney , whether he suspected any thing wrong , or not , walked on ; and that restraint upon Frank 's feelings was removed . But having once controlled the outburst , he did not suffer them to get the better of him again . With a look of silent and sullen despair , he got up , and went to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turning his face to the wall , refused to be comforted . It was the wooden wall of the ship 's timbers -- the same he had looked at in sickness , in storms at sea , by day , and at night by the dim light of the swinging ship 's lanterns ; and when he lay calmly at rest , in the palm of God , amid the convulsions and dangers of the deep , and when , in the tediousness of long , dull days of waiting , he had lain there , and solaced himself with sweet thoughts of home . But never had the ribbed ship 's side appeared to him as now . And yet it was the same ; but he was not the same . He was no longer the bright , hopeful , happy boy as before , but miserable , guilty , broken-hearted . And as we are , so is the world to us ; the most familiar objects changing their aspect with every change in the soul . Does the sunshine , which was bright yesterday , look cold to-day ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mockery to the ear ? and the faces of friends , late so pleasant to see , have they grown strange and reproachful ? and is life , before so full of hope , turned sour , and vapid , and bitter ? O , my friend , I pity you ; but the change , which you probably think is in the world , is only in yourself . " The parson seems to have fallen from grace , " said John Winch , sarcastically . " Hold your tongue ! " said Atwater , sternly . " You are all more to blame than he is . Of course , a boy of his age will do what he sees older ones do . It 's a shame to get his money and watch away from him so . " And the honest fellow went and sat by Frank , and tried to console him . " Go away ! go away ! " said Frank , in his anguish . " Do n't trouble yourself about such a miserable fool as I am . I deserve it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sadly deficient in what is called the gift of gab , had no soothing words at his command , full as his heart was of compassion . And after sitting some time by the unhappy boy , patting him softly on the shoulder , he arose , and went away ; concluding that his absence would be a relief to one so utterly miserable . Then Seth Tucket came , and took his place . " That 's always the way with bad luck , I swan , " he said , sympathizingly . " Misfortunes always come in heaps . It never rains but it pours . " " I wish you 'd let me alone ! " said the boy , peevishly . " That 's fair , I swan ! " said Seth . " But le ' me tell ye . Ef I hed won the watch , I 'd give it back to ye in a minute . But Harris is the winner , and I 've only the watch now to show for my money . But here 's a half dollar to begin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  - -  how it shifts , now this way , now that , like a cow 's tail in fly-time ,  - -  and I hai n't the least doubt but with that half dollar you 'll win back all your money , and your watch too . " The offer was kindly meant ; and it encouraged a little spark of comfort in Frank 's heart . To win back his losses -- that was his only hope . He took the money , silently pressing Seth 's hand . After that he struggled to forget his grief in thoughts of his former good fortune , which he believed would now return to him . XVII . IN WHICH FRANK SEES STRANGE THINGS . In this frame of mind , Frank went on deck . He saw the old drum-major coming towards him . Being in any thing but a social mood , he tried to avoid him ; and turning his back , walked away . But the veteran followed , and came to his side . " Well , my young man , " said the old cynic , exhibiting a little agitation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , " I hear brave tidings of you . " His voice sounded harsh and sarcastic to the irritated boy ; and , indeed , there was resentment enough in the veteran 's breast , as well as a bitter sense of injury and disappointment , as he spoke . Frank , nursing his sore heart , the wounds of which he could not bear to have touched by the most friendly hand , compressed his lips together , and made no reply . " So you have been really gambling -- have you ? " added the old man , in tones of suppressed emotion . " That 's my business , " said Frank , curtly . He regretted the undutiful words the instant they escaped his lips . But he was too proud to ask pardon for them . As for the old man , he stood silent for a long time , looking down at the boy , who looked not up again at him . And there was a tremor in his lip , and a dilatation in his eye , which at length grew misty with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And with a sigh , he turned away . " Well , be it so ! " Frank heard him say , as if to himself . " I thought -- I hoped -- but no matter . " He thought -- he hoped -- what ? That his early faith in love and friendship , which had so long been dead , might be raised to life again by this boy , for whom he had conceived so singular a liking , and who , like all the rest , proved ungrateful and unworthy when the hour of trial came . Alas ! such is the result of our transgressions . Once having offended our own souls , we are quick to offend others . And vice makes us irritable , ungenerous , unjust . And not a crime can be committed , but its evil consequences follow , not the author of it only , but also the innocent , upon whom its blighting shadow falls . " Frank , if you want some fun ! " said an eager whisper , with a promise of mischief in it ; a hand at the same time twitching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had come for him , and was hastening away again . Frank followed -- all too ready for any enterprise that would bring the balm of forgetfulness to his hurt mind . The boys entered the hold of the vessel , where , in the hush and obscurity , a group of their companions ; stood or sat , among the barrels and boxes , still as statues , until they recognized the new comers . " All right ! nobody but us , " whispered Ned , clambering over the freight , accompanied by Frank . " Come along , and make no noise , if you value your hides , " said Harris . " Here , Frank , is something to console ye for your bad luck . " And he held out something in a tin cup . " What is it ? " said Frank ; " water ? " " Something almost as good , " said Harris . " It was water the boys came down here in search of ; and they 've tapped five barrels of sirup in the operation , and finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't . " Frank knew what it was by the smell . It was not the first time he had smelt whiskey ; or tasted it , either . But hitherto he had stopped at the taste , having nothing but his curiosity to gratify . Now , however , he bad something else to gratify -- a burning thirst of the body , aggravated by his feverish excitement , and a burning thirst of the soul , which demanded stimulus of any kind whatsoever that would allay the inward torment . And so he drank . He did not love the liquor , although the rank taste of it was ameliorated by a liberal admixture of sirup . But he felt the internal sinking and wretchedness of heart and stomach braced up and assuaged by the first draught ; so he took another . And for the same reason he indulged in a third . And so it happened that his head began shortly to swim , his eyes to see double , and things to look queer to them generally . The dim hold of the vessel might have been the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his comrades might have been those of imps therein abiding , for aught he knew to the contrary , or cared . He began to laugh . " What 's the matter , Frank ? " " Nothing , " he said , thickly ; " only it 's so droll . " And he sat down on a cask , laughing again with uncontrollable merriment -- at nothing ; an infallible symptom that a person is either tipsy or a fool . But Frank was not a fool . Ergo : he was tipsy . " Get him up as quick as we can , boys , " he heard some one saying , " or else we ca n't get him up at all . " " Better leave him here till he gets over it , " said another . " That 'll be the best way . " " Who 'd have thought a little dodger like that would upset him ? " said somebody else . " By George we 'll all get found out , through him . " " Whads mare ? " said Frank , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " but somehow he could not make his organs of articulation go off right . " ' Zis wachecall drung ? " ( Is this what you call drunk ? ) " Can ye walk ? "  - -  He recognized the voice of his friend Tucket.  --  " It 's too bad to leave him here , boys . We must get him to his berth ' fore he 's any worse . " " Zhue , Sef ? " ( Is it you , Seth ? ) Frank , with the help of his friend , got upon his feet . " No , I don ' breeve I 'm drung ; I be bernaliddlewile ; " meaning to say he did not believe he was intoxicated , and to express his conviction that he would be better in a little while . Seth repeated his first inquiry . " Izzindee ! I kung wong ! " ( Yes , indeed , I can walk . ) And Frank , as if to demonstrate the absurdity of the pretence , went stumbling loosely over the freight , saved from falling only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ladder , " said Tucket ; " now be careful . " " ' M I goung upthlarer , or am I goung downth larer ? " ( Was he going up the ladder or was he going down the ladder ? ) Tucket proceeded to show him that the ladder was to be ascended ; and , directing him how to hold on , and how to place his feet , boosted him gently , while a comrade above drew him also gently , until he was got safely out . " I did that perrywell ! " said Frank . " Now lemme hell Sef ! " ( Now let me help Seth . ) " You 're a bully fellel , Sef . I 'll hellup ye ! " " Thank ye , boy , " said Tucket ; indulging him in the ludicrous notion that he was helping his friends . " Much obliged . " " Nod tall ! " ( Not at all , ) said Frank . " Bully fellels like youme mushellpitchuthth . " ( Must help each other . ) " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I understand you . But keep quiet now , and come along with me . " So saying , the athletic soldier threw his arm affectionately around Frank , hurried him away to his bunk , and tumbled him into it without much ceremony . Not unobserved , however . Captain Edney , who had had an anxious eye on Frank of late , saw him retire to his quarters in this rather suspicious manner . " What 's the matter with him ? " he inquired of Seth . " Nothing very serious , I believe , sir , " replied Tucket , with the most perfect seriousness . " A little seasick , or sunthin of the kind . He 'll git over it in a jiffy . " The waves were not running sufficiently high in the sound , however , to render the theory of seasickness very plausible ; and , to satisfy his mind , Captain Edney approached Frank 's bunk , putting to him the same question . Frank replied in scarcely intelligible language , with a swimming gaze , tending to the cross-eyed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partiggler the mare with him , but he was very busy . " Busy ? " said Captain Edney , severely ; " what do you mean ? " " Not busy ; but busy , busy ! " repeated Frank . " You mean dizzy ? " " Yes , thad 's it ! bizzy . " He had somehow got boozy and dizzy mixed up . " What makes you dizzy ? " " Boys gim me some drink , I donowat . " " The boys gave you some drink ? You do n't know what ?  - -  Tucket , " said Captain Edney , " what 's all this ? Who has been getting that boy drunk ? " Seth perceived that any attempt to disguise the truth would be futile , except so far as it might be possible by ingenious subtleties to shield his companions . The alarm , be believed , must have reached them by this time , and have scattered the group at the whiskey barrel ; so he answered boldly ,  --  " The fact , sir , is jest this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know , for the past week or two ; and men 'll do almost any thing for relief , under such circumstances . It got rumored around , somehow , that there was plenty of water in the vessel , and the boys went to hunting for't , and stumbled on the quartermaster 's stores , and tapped a few casks , I believe , mostly sirup , but one turned out to be whiskey . Dry as we be , it 's no more'n nat'ral ' t we should drink a drop , under the circumstances . " " Who tapped the casks ? " " That 's more'n I know . I did n't see it done , " said Seth . " Who drank ? " " I drinked a little , for one ; jest enough to know ' t wa n't water . " And how many of you are drunk ? " demanded Captain Edney . " I a' n't , for one . But I believe Manly is a little how-come ye-so . I 'll say this for him , though : he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did n't seem to know what it was the boys gin him . He was dry ; it tasted sweet , and he drinked , nat'rally . " " Who gave him the whiskey ? " " I did n't notice , particularly , " said Seth . His accomplices were summoned , the quartermaster was notified , and the affair was still further investigated . All confessed to having tasted the liquor , but nobody knew who tapped the casks , or who had given the whiskey to Frank , and all had the same plausible excuse for their offence -- intolerable thirst . It was impossible , where all were leagued together , and all seemed equally culpable , to single out the ringleaders for punishment , and it was not desirable to punish all . After a while , therefore , the men were dismissed with a reprimand , and the subject postponed indefinitely . That very afternoon forty barrels of water came on board , and the men had no longer a pretext for tapping casks in the hold ; and a few days later was the battle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memory of past transgressions . And Frank ? The muss , as the boys called it , was over before his senses recovered from their infinite bewilderment . He lay stupefied in his bunk , which went whirling round and round with him , sinking down and down and down , into void and bottomless chaos , where solid earth was none -- type of the drunkard 's moral state , where virtue has lost its foot-hold , and there is no firm ground of self-respect , and conscience is a loosened ledge toppling treacherously , and there is no steady hope to stay his horrible whirling and sinking . Stupefaction became sleep ; with sleep inebriation passed ; and Frank awoke to misery . It was evening . The boys were playing cards again by the light of the ship 's lantern . The noise and the glimmer reached Frank in his berth , and called him back to time and space and memory . He remembered his watch , his insolent reply to his old friend Sinjin , the scene in the hold of the vessel , the sweet-tasting stuff , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had either climbed or dreamed of climbing ; and he thought of his mother and sisters with a pang like the sting of a scorpion . He could bear any thing but that . He got up , determined not to let vain regrets torment him . He shut out from his mind those pure images of home , the presence of which was maddening to him . Having stepped so deep into guilt , he would not , he could not , turn back . For Frank carried even into his vices that steadiness of resolution which distinguishes such natures from those of the Jack Winch stamp , wavering and fickle alike in good and ill . He possessed that perseverance and purpose which go to form either the best and noblest men , or , turned to evil , the most hardy and efficient villains . Frank was no milksop . " O , I 'm all right , " said he , with a reckless laugh , in reply to his comrades ' bantering . " Give me a chance there -- ca n't you ? " For he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing short of the impossible could turn him aside from that intent . The players made room for him , and he prepared his counters , and took up his cards . " What do you do , Frank ? " was asked impatiently ; all were waiting for him . What ailed the boy ? He held his cards , but he was not looking at them . His eyes were not on the board , nor on his companions , nor on any object there . But he was staring with a pallid , intense expression -- at something . There were anguish , and alarm , and yearning affection in his look . His hair was disordered , his countenance was white and amazed ; his comrades were astonished as they watched him . " What 's the matter , Frank ? what 's the matter ? " Their importunity brought him to himself . " Did you see ? " he asked in a whisper . They had seen nothing that he had seen . Then it was all an illusion ? a fragment of his drunken dreams ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , I 'll play , " he said , trying to collect himself thinking that he would forget the illusion , and remembering he had his watch to win back . But his heart failed him . His brain , his hand failed him also . Absolutely , he could not play . " Boys , I 'm not very well . Excuse me -- I ca n't play to-night . " And hesitatingly , like a person who has been stunned , he got up , and left the place . Few felt inclined to jeer him . John Winch begun to say something about " the parson going to pray , " but it was frowned down . Frank went on deck . The evening was mild , the wind was south , the sky was clear and starry ; it was like a May night in New England . The schooner was riding at anchor in the sound ; other vessels of the fleet lay around her , rocking gently on the tide -- dim hulls , with glowing , fiery eyes ; and here there was a band playing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wafted on the wind . And the water was all a weltering waste of waves and molten stars . But little of all this Frank saw , or heard , or heeded . His soul was rapt from him ; he was lost in wonder and grief . " Can you tell me any thing ? " said a voice at his side . " O , Atwater , " said Frank , clutching his hand , " what does it mean ? As I was playing , I saw -- I saw -- every thing else disappeared ; cards , counters , the bench we were playing on , and there before me , as plainly as I ever saw any thing in my life --  --  " " What was it ? " asked Atwater , as Frank paused , unable to proceed . " My sister Hattie. " then said Frank , in a whisper of awe , " in her coffin ! in her shroud ! But she did not seem dead at all . She was white as the purest snow ; and she smiled up at me -- such a sweet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands . XVIII . BITTER THINGS . Atwater could not have said much to comfort him , even if he had had the opportunity . Some young fellows who had heard of Frank 's losses at bluff , and of his intoxication , saw him on deck , and came crowding around to have some jokes with him . Atwater retired . And Frank , who had little relish for jokes just then , went below , and got into his berth , where he could be quiet , and think a little . But thinking alone there with his conscience was torture to him . He turned on his bed and looked , and saw Atwater sitting in his bunk , with a book in his hand , reading by the dim light . The card-playing was going on close by , and jokes and oaths and laughter were heard on all sides ; but Atwater heeded no one , and no one heeded him . Only Frank : he regarded the still , earnest soldier a long time , silently admiring his calmness and strength , so perfectly expressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and wondering what book he had . " What are you reading , Atwater ? " he at length asked . " My Bible , " replied the soldier , giving him a grave , pleasant smile . Frank felt pained ,  - -  almost jealous . I ca n't tell how it is , but we do n't like too well the sight of our companions cheerfully performing those duties which we neglect or hate . Cain slew Abel for that cause . " I did n't know you read that , " said Frank . " I never have too much . But my wife --  --  " The soldier 's voice always sunk with a peculiarly tender thrill whenever he spoke of his bride of an hour , or rather of a minute , whom he had wedded and left in such haste . " She slipped a Bible in my knapsack unbeknown to me . I had a letter from her to-day , in which she asked me if I read it . So I must read it , and say yes , if only to please her . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brightening eye , " I find good in it I never thought was there before . " Frank had no word to answer him . Conscience-stricken , sick at heart , miserable as he could be , he could only lie there in his berth , and look at the brave soldier , and envy him . He remembered how , not long ago , when his mother 's wishes were more to him than they had been of late , he had desired to read his Testament for her sake , but had not dared to do so openly , fearing the sneers of his comrades . And his mother , in every letter , repeated her injunction , " My son , read your Testament ; "  - -  which had become to him as the idle wind . For never now , either by stealth or openly , did he read that book . Yet here was this plain , honest soldier , many called him dull , for whom a word from one he loved was sufficient ; he took the book as if that word were law . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feared , were nothing to him . Ashamed , remorseful , angry with himself , the boy lay thinking what he should do . A few bitter moments only . Then , opening his knapsack , he took out his Testament , and sitting in his bunk so that the light would shine on the page , opened it and read . His companions saw , and were surprised enough . But nobody jeered . What was the reason , I wonder ? And this was what Frank read . Written on a blank leaf , with a pencil , in his own hand , were these words :  --  " I do now solemnly promise my mother and sisters that , when I am in the army , I will never be guilty of swearing , or gambling , or drinking , or any other mean thing I know they would not approve of . And I do solemnly pledge my word that they shall sooner hear of my death than of my being guilty of any of those things . Frank Manly . " And beneath those words were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " O heavenly Father ! I beseech Thee , help my dear son to keep his promises . Give him strength to resist temptation . Save him , I pray Thee , from those who kill the body , but above all from those who kill the soul . If it be Thy gracious will , let him pass safely through whatever evils may beset him , and return to us uncontaminated and unhurt . But if this may not be , then , O , our Saviour ! take him , take my precious child , I implore Thee , pure unto Thyself . And help us all so to live , that we shall meet again in joy and peace , if not here , hereafter . Amen . " Frank did not turn that page , but sat looking at it long . And he saw something besides the words there written . He saw himself once more a boy at home , the evening before his enlistment ; pencil in hand , writing that solemn promise ; his mother watching near ; the bright face of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his going ; the little invalid Hattie on the lounge , her sad face smiling very much as he saw it smiling out just now from the flowers in the coffin . He saw his mother also , pencil in hand , writing that prayer ,  - -  her countenance full of anxious love and tears , her gentle lips tremulous with blessings . He saw her come to his bed in the moonlight night , when last he slept there with little Willie at his side , as maybe he will never sleep again . And he heard her counsels and entreaties , as she knelt there beside him ; and felt her kisses ; and lived over once more the thoughts of that night after she was gone , and when he lay sleepless with the moonlight on his bed . But here he was now -- not away there in the room at home , but here , among soldiers , on shipboard . And the pure , innocent Frank of that night lived no more . And all those promises had been broken , one by one . And he knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet -- the sudden thought warmed and thrilled his breast -- he might be pure as then , he might be innocent as then , and all the stronger for having known what temptation was , and fallen , and risen again . And he might keep those promises in a higher and nobler sense than he dreamed of when he made them ; and his mother 's prayer might , after all , be answered . " Frank , " said the voice of Captain Edney . He had come to visit the quarters of his company , and , seeing the boy sitting there so absorbed , his young face charged with thought and grief , had stopped some moments to regard him , without speaking . Frank started , almost like a guilty person , and gave the military salute rather awkwardly as he got upon his feet . He had been secretly dreading Captain Edney 's displeasure , and now he thought he was to be called to an account . " I have something for you in my room , " said the officer , with a look of serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with which he formerly regarded the drummer boy . Frank accompanied him , wondering what that something was . A reproof for his drunkenness , or for gambling away the watch , he expected more than any thing else ; and his heart was heavy by the way . " Did you know a mail came on board to-day ? " said the captain , as they entered his stateroom . Frank remembered hearing Atwater say he had that day got a letter from his wife . But his mind had been too much agitated by other things to consider the subject then . " No , sir , I did n't know it . " " How happens that ? You are generally one of the most eager to receive letters . " Frank hung his head . What answer could he make ? That he was intoxicated in his berth when the mail arrived ? A sweat of shame covered him . He was silent . " Well , well , my boy ! "  - -  Captain Edney patted him gently on the shoulder ,  --  " you are forgiven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get drunk . " " O , sir ! " began Frank , but stopped there , over whelmed by the captain 's kindness . " I know all about it , " said Captain Edney . " Tucket assures me that he and the rest were more to blame than you . But , for the sake of your friends , Frank , take warning by this experience , and never be betrayed into any thing of the kind again . I trust you . And here , my boy , are your letters . " He put half a dozen into Frank 's hands . And Frank , as he took them , felt his very heart melt within him with gratitude and contrition . He was not thinking so much of the letters as of Captain Edney and his watch . " Forgive me ; forgive me ! " he humbly entreated . " I do , freely , as I told you , " said the captain . " But -- the watch you gave me ! " " Dear boy ! "  - -  the captain put his arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told you I knew nothing about the watch ? I did not give it to you , nor do I know what generous friend did . " " It is true , then ? " Frank looked up with a half-glad , half-disappointed expression . He was disappointed to know that so good a friend was not the donor of the watch , and yet glad that he had not wronged him by gambling it away . " Then , Captain Edney , I wish you would tell me what to do . I have done the worst and meanest thing . I have lost the watch . " And he went on to relate how he had lost it . Captain Edney heard him with deep concern . He had all along felt a sense of responsibility for the boy Mrs. Manly had intrusted to him , as well as a genuine affection for him ; he had therefore double cause to be pained by this unexpected development . " Frank , " said he , " I am glad I did not first hear this story from any body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your thorough repentance accompanies the confession . That breaks the pain of it . To-morrow I will see what can be done about the watch . Perhaps we shall get it again . To-night I have only one piece of advice to give . Do n't think of winning it back with cards . " " Then how shall I ever get it ? " asked Frank , in despair . For he did not wish his mother to know of the circumstances ; and to buy the watch back when he was paid off again , would be to withhold money which he felt belonged to her . Captain Edney could not solve the difficulty ; and with that burden upon his mind , Frank returned to his bunk with his letters . He bent over them with doubt and foreboding . The first he selected was from his mother . As he opened it , his eye caught these words :  --  " ... He says that you beat some of the worst men in the regiment at their own vices . He says you are generally smoking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ According to his account , you are one of the profanest of the profane . And he tells of your going with others to steal turkeys of a secessionist in Maryland , and how you got out of the scrape by the most downright lying . He gives the story so circumstantially that I can not think he invented it , but am compelled to believe there is something in it . O , my child , is it possible ? Ill as your sister is , to hear these things of you is a greater trial than the thought of parting with her so soon . Have you forgotten your promises to me ? Have you forgotten --  --  " Frank could read no more . He gnashed his teeth together , and held them tight , like a person struggling against some insupportable pain . His sister so ill ? That was Hattie . He saw the name written farther back . " He says , "  --  " according to his account , "  - -  who was it sending home such stories about him ? He glanced up the page , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Winch --  --  " O , but this was too much ! To be accused of swearing by him ! To be charged with stealing by one who went with him to steal , and did not , only because he was a coward ! Frank felt an impulse to fall instantly upon that wretched youth , and choke the unmanly life out of him . John was at that moment writing a letter under the lantern , probably filling it with more tales about him ;  - -  and could n't he tell some great ones now !  - -  grinning , too , as he wrote ; quite unaware what a tiger was watching him , athirst for his blood . Yes . Winch had got letters to-day , and , learning what a lively sensation his stories of Frank created , had set to work to furnish the sequel to them ; giving interesting particulars up to latest dates . N. B. He was writing on the head of Frank 's drum , which he had borrowed for the purpose . He had written his previous letters on the same . It was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was abusing to contribute some needful assistance towards the work ; it added a flavor to treachery . But Frank did not so much enjoy the pleasantry . He was wild to be beating the tattoo , not on the said drum , but on the head of the rogue who was writing on the drum , and with his fist for drumsticks . But he reflected , " I shall only be getting deeper into trouble , if I pitch into him . Besides , he is a good deal bigger than I , "  - -  a powerful argument in favor of forbearance . " I 'll wait ; but I 'll be revenged on him some way . " Little did he know -- and as little did Winch surmise -- how that revenge was to be accomplished . But it was to be , and soon . For the present , Frank had other things to think of . He read of Hattie 's fading away ; of her love for him ; and the tender messages she sent , perhaps the last she would ever send to him . And he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tears came to cool and soften his heart . And so we quit him for the night , leaving him alone with his letters , his grief , and his remorse . XIX . SETH GETS " RILED . " There is in the life of nearly every young person a turning-point of destiny . It may be some choice which he makes for himself , or which others make for him , whether of occupation , or companion , or rule of life . It may be some deep thought which comes to him in solitary hours , some seed of wisdom dropped from the lips of teacher , parent , or friend , sinking silently as starlight into the soul , and taking immortal root there , unconsciously , perhaps , even to himself . Now it is the quickening of the spirit at the sight of God 's beautiful universe -- a rapture of love awakened by a morning in spring , by the blue infinity of the sky , by the eternal loneliness and sublimity of the sea . Or , in some moment of susceptibility , the smiles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice , a surge of solemn music , may have power over the young heart to change its entire future . And again , it is some vivid experience of temptation and suffering that shapes the great hereafter . For the Divinity that maketh and loveth us is forever showering hints of beauty and blessedness to win back our wandering affections ,  - -  dropping cords of gentlest influences to draw home again all hearts that will come . Then the spirit of the youth rises up within him , and says ,  --  " Whereas I was blind , now I am beginning to see . And whereas I was weak , now , with God 's help , I will strive for better things . Long enough have I been the companion of folly , and all the days of my life have I been a child . But now I perceive that I am to become a man , and I will henceforth think the thoughts and do the deeds of a man . " Such an experience had come to Frank ; and thus , on the new morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his spirit spake unto him . He answered his mother 's letter , confessing that his conduct had afforded only too good a foundation for Jack 's stories . " The trouble , I think , is , " said he , " that I wrote my promises first with a pencil . They did get a little rubbed out I own . I have since taken a pen , and written them all over again , word by word , and letter by letter , with ink . So you may depend upon it , dear mother , that not another syllable of my pledge will get blurred or dimmed , either on the leaf of my Testament ; or on the page of my heart . Only believe this , and then you may believe as much as you please of what J. W. writes . " Not a word to the same J. W. did Frank say of the base thing he had done ; and as for the revenge he had vowed , the impulse to wreak it in tigerish fashion had passed like a night-fog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dawned . In a couple of days Frank had mostly recovered his equanimity . The loss of the watch was still a source of anxious grief to him , however ; less on his own account , let me say , than for the sake of the unknown giver . Nor had he , as yet , found any opportunity to atone for his rudeness to the old drum-major , who had lately , for some cause , gone over to the other wing of the regiment on board the steamer , so that Frank yearned in vain to go to him and humbly beg forgiveness for his fault . " What has taken Mr. Sinjin away ? " he asked of his friend , the young corporal . Gray shrugged his shoulders , and looked at Frank as if he had a good mind to tell a secret . " How should I know ? He 's such a crotchety old boy . I do n't think he could account for his conduct himself . He asked permission to remove his quarters to the steamer , and got it ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accommodations there . " " And I believe , " said Frank , " that you know more about it than you will own . " " Well , I have my suspicions . Shall I be candid with you , Frank ? and you 'll forgive me if I hurt your feelings ? " " Yes , " said Frank , anxiously . " Well , then , " said Gray . " I suppose you know Sinjin had taken a great fancy to you . " " I thought at one time he liked me . " " At one time ? I 'll wager my head he was liking you the most when he appeared to the least -- he 's such a queer old cove ! I 've heard he was disappointed in love once , and that some friend of his proved traitor to him ; and that 's what has made him so shy of showing any thing like affection for any body . Well , he heard of your gambling , and went to talk with you about it , and you said something to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sight of you afterwards . " The boy 's heart was wrung by this revelation . What reason , he demanded to know , had Gray for thinking thus ? " Because I know the man , and because I know something which I think you ought to know . " Gray drew Frank confidentially aside . " He may anathematize me for betraying his secret ; but I think it is time to do him justice , even against his will . Frank , it was Old Sinjin who gave you the watch . " Frank 's heart leaped up , but fell again instantly , convulsed with pain and regret . " Are you sure , Gray ? " " Sure as this : I was with him when he bought the watch in Annapolis . I helped him to do it up in the wrappers . And it was I that pitched it into the tent at you Thanksgiving-day evening . That is being pretty sure -- is n't it ? " " And he knows that I lost it ? " said Frank . " He had just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gambling . " " And I told him it was none of his business , " said Frank , remorsefully . " O , he will never forgive me now ; and who can blame him ? Good old man ! dear , good old man ! My mother told me to be always very kind to him -- and how have I repaid his goodness to me ! " It seemed now that the boy could not control his impatience until once more he had seen his benefactor , confessed all to him , and heard him say he was forgiven for his unkindness and ingratitude . But the old drummer still remained on board the steamer . And Frank had only this faith to comfort him -- that if his repentance was sincere , and he henceforth did only what was right , all would yet be well . The next morning he was viewing the sunrise from the deck , when Seth Tucket came to his side . " ' Once more upon the waters ! yet once more ! and the waves bound beneath me as the steed that knows his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bound much , and they do n't roar to-day , " said Seth . " The boys have found out it 's Sunday ; and as we 're to have a battle ' fore the week 's out , they seem to think it 's about as well to remember there 's a difference in days . How are you , Manly ? " " Better , " said Frank , with a smile . " Happy ? " with a grimace meant to be sympathizing , but which was droll enough to be laughable . " Happier than I was , " said the drummer boy . " Happier than I 've been for a long time . " " What ! not happier , now you 've lost every thing , than when you was hevin ' such luck at play ? " " I was n't happy then . I thought I was . But I was only excited . I am happier now that I 've lost every thing ; it 's true , Tucket . " " Well , I swan to man ! I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bringing ye sunthin ' to kind o ' cheer ye up . Glad to hear you 've no need . Fine day , but rather windy . Wonder what 's the time ! " So saying , Seth drew out the watch , and regarded it with provoking coolness . " I 'm plagued ef the darned thing hai n't run down ! Say , Frank , ye could n't think of throwin ' in the key , too -- could ye ? I ca n't wind her up without a key . " Frank choked a little , but his look was cheerful , as he put his hand in his pocket , and , without a word , delivered over to the new owner of the watch the key also . " Thank ye ; much obleeged ; " and Seth " wound her up " with extraordinary parade . Then he shook it , and held it to his ear . Then he said , " All right ! she 's a puttin ' in again , lickety-switch ! Good watch , that . " Then he set it " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his pocket , when a new thought seemed to strike him . " What do ye do for a watch-pocket , Frank ? Gov'ment do n't provide watch-pockets , seems . " " I made one for myself , " said Frank . " Sho now ! ye did n't , though -- did ye ? What with ? " " With a needle and thread I brought from home , and with another old pocket , " said Frank . " Well , you air the cutest ! Say , what 'll ye tax to make me one ? I do n't care to hev it very large ; a small watch , so . " A dry proposal , that . It was not enough to furnish watch and watch-key ; but Frank was required also to provide a watch-pocket . " What do ye say ? " asked Seth , with a shrewd squint . " I 'll make you one for nothing , " said Frank . " Come , by darn ! " exclaimed Seth ; " none o ' that , now ! " " None of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  - -  And , indeed , Tucket was visibly moved ; there was a tear in his eye -- a bona fide tear . " I 've a good disposition , nat'rally ; but I shall git riled ef you say much more . I 've got your watch , and that 's all right . I 've got the key , and that 's all right , too . But when you talk of makin ' a watch-pocket for nothin ' , I tell ye a saint could n't stand that . " Frank , who thought he had learned to know pretty well the man 's oddities , was puzzled this time . " I did n't mean to offend you , Tucket . " " No , you did n't . And now see here , Manly . We 'll jest compromise this matter , ef you 've no ' bjection . I 've no watch-pocket , and you 've no watch . So , s'posin ' you carry the watch for me , and tell me what time it is when I ax ye ? That wo n't be too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " asked Frank . " Yes , I be , clean up to the hub . The truth is , I ca n't carry that watch with any kind o ' comfort , and I 'm bent on gitt'n ' it off my hands , ef I hef to throw it overboard . Here ! It 's yours ; take it , and be darned ! " said Seth . " I was going to propose to you , "  - -  stammered Frank from his too full heart ,  --  " to take the watch , and pay you for it when I can . " " Ez for that the pay 's no consequence . I was more to blame than you ; and the loss ought to be mine . " " But --  --  " insisted Frank . " No buts ! Besides , I never make bargains Sundays . " And Seth turned away , abruptly , leaving the watch in Frank 's hand . The boy would have called him back , but a rush of emotions -- joy , gratitude , contrition -- choked his voice . A dash of tears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pressed it , and would have kissed it , had he been alone . It was his again ; and that , after all , was an unalloyed satisfaction . He could lie awake nights and study days to devise means to reward Seth 's generosity . And he would do it , he resolved . And Mr. Sinjin should know that he had recovered the prize , and that he held it all the more precious since he had found out the giver . XX . SUNDAY BEFORE THE BATTLE . Frank was leaning over the rail of the schooner gazing down at the beautiful flashing water , and thinking of home . It was Sunday there , too , he remembered ; and he could almost hear the sweet-toned bells solemnly chiming , and see the atmosphere of Sabbath peace brooding over field and village , and feel the serious gladness of the time . The folks were getting ready for church . There was his father , shaved and clean , in his black stock and somewhat threadbare , but still respectable , best coat . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bonnet on , and with her Bible and question-book in her hand , setting out for the morning Sunday-school . His mother was not going to meeting ; she was to stay at home with Hattie , and read to her , or , what was better , comfort her with affectionate , gentle , confiding words . But Willie was going with Helen , as he seemed anxious , by strut , and hurry , and loud , impatient talk , to let every body know . And Frank wished from his heart that he could be with them that day ; and he wondered , did they miss him , and were they thinking of him , far off here in Carolina waters , alone in the midst of such crowds of men ? " Would n't I like to be in that boat , boys ! " said Ellis . " Do n't she come dancing on the waves ! " " She 's pulling towards us , " said Atwater . " I believe they 're coming aboard . " " O , Atwater ! " cried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a face there I know ! One you know , too ! " And he clapped his hands with joy ; for it was a face he had seen in Boston , and he felt that it came with news from home . The rare brightness kindled in Atwater 's eyes as he gazed , and remembered . The boat came alongside , and hailed the schooner . And a man in the bow , as it rose upon a wave , seizing hold of the ladder of tarred rope , stepped quickly upon it , and came on board , cordially received by Captain Edney , who appeared to have been expecting him . " It 's the minister that married Atwater ! " the rumor ran round among the troops . " What 's his name , Frank ? " " His name 's Egglestone , " said Frank , his heart swelling with anxiety to speak with him . The minister had come on a mission of Christian love to the soldiers of the expedition ; and having , the day before , sent word to Captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an invitation to visit the schooner and preach to the men this Sunday morning . A previous announcement that religious services would probably be held on board , had excited little interest ; the troops surmising that the chaplain of the regiment , who had never been with them enough to win their hearts or awaken their attention , was to rejoin them , and preach one of his formal discourses . But far different was the feeling when it was known that the " man that married Atwater " was to conduct the exercises . Then the soldiers remembered that they were New Englanders ; and that here also God 's Sabbath shed its silent influence , far though they were from the rude hills and rocky shores of home . ' T is curious how a little leaven of memory will sometimes work in the heart . Here was half a regiment of men , who had come to fight the battles of their country . As with one accord they had left the amenities of peaceful life behind them , and assumed the rugged manners of war . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that God , and Christian worship , and Christian rules of life were still in existence . But to-day they were reminded . To-day the child was awakened -- the child that had known the wholesome New England nurture , that had sat on mother 's knee , and had its earliest thought tuned to the music of Sunday bells ; the child that lay hidden in the deep heart of every man of them , the same lived again , and looked forth from the eyes , and smiled once more in the softened visage of the man . And the man was carried back , far from these strange scenes , far from the relentless iron front of war , across alien lands , and over stormy seas ,  - -  carried back by the child yearning within , to the old door yard , the village trees , the family fireside , the family pew , and the hushed congregation . It was Mr. Egglestone 's aim , in the beginning of the sermon he preached that morning , to remind the soldiers of their childhood . " It is a thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tears ,  - -  that all these hardy frames around me were but the soft , warm , dimpled forms of so many infants once . And nearly every one of you was , I suppose , watched over by tender parents , who beheld , with mutual joy , the development of each beautiful faculty . The first step taken by the babe 's unassisted feet , the first articulate word spoken by the little lisping lips ,  - -  what delight they gave , and how long were they remembered ! And what thoughts of the child 's future came day and night to those parents ' breasts ! and of what earnest prayers was it the subject ! And of all the parents of all those children who are here as men to-day , not one foresaw a scene like this ; none dreamed that they were raising up patriots to fight for freedom 's second birth on this continent , in the most stupendous of civil wars . " But Providence leads us by strange ways , and by hidden paths we come upon brinks of destiny which no prophet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many of you who were children are now the fathers of children . But your place is not at home to watch over them as you were watched over , but to strive by some means to work out a harder problem than any ever ciphered on slates at school . " Then he explained to his audience the origin of the war ; for he believed it best that every soldier should understand well the cause he was fighting for . He spoke of the compact of States , which could not be rightfully broken . He spoke of the serpent that had been nursed in the bosom of those States . He related how slavery , from being at first a merely tolerated evil , which all good men hoped soon to see abolished , had grown arrogant , aggressive , monstrous ; until , angered by resistance to its claims , it had deluged the land with blood . Such was the nature of an institution based upon selfishness and wrong . And such was the bitter result of building a LIE into the foundations of our national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principle of our republican form of government , that " all men are created free and equal , " we had at the same time held a race in bondage . " Neither nation nor individual , " said he , " can in any noble sense succeed , with such rotten inconsistency woven into its life . It was this shoddy in the garment of our Goddess of Liberty , which has occasioned the rent which those needles there "  - -  pointing to some bayonets --  " must mend . And it is this shoddy of contradiction and infidelity which makes many a man 's prosperity , seemingly substantial at first , promising warmth and wear , fall suddenly to pieces , and leave his soul naked to the winds of heaven . " It was not so much a sermon as a friendly , affectionate , earnest talk with the men , whom he sought to counsel and encourage . There was a melting love in his tones which went to their inmost souls . And when he exhorted them to do the work of men who feared God , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not death , he made every heart ring with the stirring appeal . Then suddenly his voice sank to a tone of solemn sweetness , as he said ,  --  " Peace ! O , my brothers ! struggle and violence are not the all of life . But God 's love , the love of man to man , holiness , blessedness , it is for these realities we are created , and placed here on this beautiful earth , under this blue sky , with human faces and throbbing human hearts around us . And the end of all is PEACE . But only through fiery trial and valiant doing can any peace worth the name come to us ; and to make the future truly blessed , we must make the present truly brave . " Before and after the discourse the men sang some of the good old tunes which all had been familiar with at home , and which descended like warm rain upon the ground where the scattered seed of the sermon fell . The services ended , Mr. Egglestone went freely among the soldiers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him ; especially with Atwater ; whose wife he had seen a few days before leaving Boston , where she came to see him , having learned who he was , and that he was about departing for the army in which her husband served . After long waiting , Frank 's turn came at last . They sat down on a bench apart ; and the clergyman told him he had lately seen his mother , and that she had charged him with many messages . And one was a message of sorrow . " She had heard unwelcome news of you , " he said , holding the boy 's hand . " And she wished me to say to you what I could to save you from what she dreads most -- what any wise , loving mother dreads most for her child . But is there need of my saying any thing ? By what your captain tells me , and still more by what your face tells me , I am convinced that I may spare my words . You have had in your own experience a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have erred , you have suffered . And "  - -  he took a letter from his pocket --  " I have something here to make you remember what you have learned -- I think , for always . " Frank had listened , humbly , tremblingly , full of tears which he did not shed for the eyes that were about them . But now he started , and took the letter eagerly . " What 's it ? any bad news ? " for he felt an alarming presentiment . " I do not think it is bad . If you had seen what I saw , you would not think so either . " Mr. Egglestone 's manner was exceedingly tender , and his voice was liquid and low . " All is well with your folks at home ; both with those who are there as you left them , and with the one whose true home is not there any longer , but in a brighter land , we trust . " " O ! " it was almost a cry of pain that broke from Frank . " Hattie ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am speaking . She has passed away . I was present , and saw her depart . And she was very calm and happy , and her last look was a smile , and her last words were words of hope and love . The letter will tell you all about it . I recall one thing , however , which I will repeat , since it so nearly concerns you . They were speaking of you . And she said , ' Maybe I shall see him before any of you will ! Yes ! ' she added , her face shining already like a spirit 's with the joyful thought , ' tell him how I love him ; and say that I shall be with him when he does not know ! ' And I am sure that , if it is possible for souls that have escaped from these environments of flesh to be near us still , she will often be near you , loving you , influencing you . Perhaps she is present now , and hears all we say , and sees how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite so badly if you knew that she is happy . " Frank would have spoken , to ask some earnest question which arose in his heart ; but his feelings were too much agitated , and he could not trust his voice . " We will believe such things are true of our lost ones , " Mr. Egglestone said , with a parting pressure of the boy 's hand . " For , with that faith , we shall surely try so to live that , when they approach us , they will not be repelled ; and thus we will be guarded from evil , if not by any direct influence of theirs , then by our own reverence and love for them . " With this he took his leave . And Frank crept into his bunk , and turned away his face , before he dared to open and read his mother 's letter . In that letter there were no reproofs for his misconduct . But in place of such his mother had written the simple story of Hattie 's death , with many affecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her cheerful sweetness , and her love for Frank . Then followed affectionate messages from them at home , who were very lonely now , and longed to have him with them -- all which had a power beyond any reproaches to win the boy back to that purity of heart and life which belonged to his home-affections , and was safe when they were strong , and was imperilled when they were forgotten . " O , to think , " he said to himself , " only this morning I was imagining how it looked at home to-day -- and it is all so different ! I am gone , and now Hattie is gone too ! " XXI . UP THE SOUND . So passed that Sunday , memorable to the expedition ; for it ushered in the battle-week . Besides the transports and store-ships belonging to the coast division , a squadron of United States gunboats , under command of Commodore Goldsborough , had rendezvoused at the inlet . These were to take care of the rebel fleet , attend to the shore batteries , and prepare the way for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take part in the advance were now over the bulkhead , in Pamlico Sound . On Monday , the sailing vessels were hauled into position , each astern of its steam-consort , by which it was to be towed . Sixty-five vessels of various classes were to participate in the movement ; while upwards of fifty were to remain behind at the inlet , holding in reserve sixty days ' supply of stores for the entire expedition . The stay at the inlet had occasionally been enlivened by the arrival of refugees , white and black , from the coast of North Carolina . Some of these were citizens escaped from the persecutions meted out by the rebels to all who still remained loyal to the old flag . Some were deserters from the confederate army , in which they had been compelled to serve . Others were slaves fleeing from bondage to freedom . Again , on Monday , a sail-boat hove in sight , and , being overhauled by one of the gunboats , proved to be loaded with these fugitives . They were mostly negroes ; two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such evidence of joy at their escape , of loyalty to the Union , and of a thorough knowledge of the country , that Flag-officer Goldsborough retained them for the information they might be able to give , while the rest were sent ashore . And now , general orders were read to the troops , announcing to them that they were soon to land on the coast of North Carolina , and reminding them that they were there , not to pillage or destroy private property , but to subdue the rebellion , and to maintain the Constitution and the laws . Monday and Tuesday were occupied with preparations . But early Wednesday morning -- more than three weeks after the arrival of the expedition at the inlet -- the signals to weigh anchor and set sail were given . Commodore Goldsborough 's gunboat took the lead . Other vessels of the naval squadron followed . Then came the transports -- a goodly spectacle . " ' ' T were wuth ten years of peaceful life , one glance at our array , ' " observed the poetical Tucket . Each brigade formed three columns of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brigade . The shallow water of the sound was scarcely ruffled by a breeze . It lay like a field of silver before the furrows of the fleet . The tall , taper masts of the schooners pointed like needles to the sky under which they moved . The aisles between the three columns of ships were unbroken through the whole length of the fleet , which extended for two miles over the surface of the sound , and advanced with such slow and uniform motion , each vessel keeping its position , that now all seemed moving as one , and again all seemed at rest , with the waters of the sound flowing past their steady keels . As yet , the destination of the fleet was unknown . As it proceeded at first southward and westward , the rumor grew that Newbern was to be attacked . But it was only the course of the channel which thus far shaped its course ; and after a few zigzag turns , the cause of which was inexplicable to the green ones , ignorant of the shoals , it began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to its destination vanished . " Roanoke Island , boys ! Roanoke Island ! " was echoed from mouth to mouth on board the schooner . The day was beautiful -- only a light breeze blowing , and a few light clouds floating in the blue ether . And now the vessels at the inlet began to sink below the horizon ; first , the hulls , then the decks disappeared ; and lastly , spars and rigging went down behind the curve of the sphere , and were visible no more to the clearest glass . At the same time emerged in the west the main land of North Carolina . At first , tall cypresses rose to view , growing as it were " out of a mirror . " Then appeared the long swampy shores , lying dim and low , with here and there a miserable fish-house , the sole trace of human habitation . At sundown the fleet was within ten miles of Roanoke Island . The signal from the flag-ship was given , at which the vessels of each brigade drew together , the clank of running-out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the fleet was moored for the night . As yet there were no signs of rebels . What the morrow , what the night , might bring forth was all uncertainty . The night set in dark enough . But soon the sky cleared , the moon came out resplendent , and the stars looked down from their far eternal calm upon the evanescent shows of mortal conflict -- the batteries of the rebellion yonder , and here the fleet , no more than the tiniest shells to those distant , serene , awful eyes of Deity . And Frank looked up at the stars ; and the spirit within him said , " They will shine the same to-morrow night , and the next night , and forever ; and whether there is war or peace , whether victory comes or defeat , and whether thou , child , art living or art dead , they know not , they change not , neither do they rejoice or mourn . " And the thought sank deep into the heart of the boy as he retired to his bed , and closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the rebel gunboats all night , but they never made their appearance . The next morning the weather was heavy -- promising rain . At eight o'clock , however , the signal to weigh anchor -- the Union Jack at the foremast , and the American flag at the stern -- was telegraphed from the flag-ship , and repeated by the flag-ship of each brigade . Again the fleet got in motion , approaching the entrance to Croatan Sound . The water was shoal , and progress was slow , and soon it came on to rain . It was a dismal day ; rain on the decks , rain on the water , rain on the marshy shores of the main land , and over the forests beyond , where the ghosts of blasted trees stretched their naked arms despairingly to the dripping clouds . And now a low swampy point of Roanoke Island pushes out into the dim water , under a veil of rain . At about noon , most of the vessels came to anchor . But some of the gunboats advanced to the entrance of Croatan Sound , and reconnoitred . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of battle on the west side of the island , awaiting the conflict . A fog coming on , active operations against the enemy were postponed , and the gunboats , withdrawing also , came to anchor for the night . During the day , several of the armed steamers , which had served as transports , prepared to cooperate with the naval squadron in their true character as gunboats ; the troops on board of them being distributed among other vessels of the coast division . Among the steamers thus cleared was the schooner 's consort ; and thus it happened that Mr. Sinjin returned to his old quarters , to the great joy of the drummer boy , whose heart burned within him at the thought of meeting his old friend once more , after their unhappy parting . They met , indeed ; but the schooner was now so crowded , and such was the stir on board , that Frank scarce found an opportunity to offer the veteran his hand , and get one look out of those serious gray eyes . The drummers being assembled , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strip of red flannel to tie on his arm as a token , at the same time informing them that , when the troops landed , they were to go with him and help carry the wounded . " This begins to look like serious business , my boy , " said the old drummer , kindly , as he stooped to assist Frank in tying on his badge . His touch was very gentle . Frank 's breast began to swell . But before he could speak the old man had disappeared in the crowd . " He do n't know yet that I know he gave me the watch , " thought the boy , " and he would n't look and see that I have it again . " Then he regarded the red token on his arm , and remembered that they all had other things to think of now . Picket-boats were out in advance all night , at the entrance to Croatan Sound , in the darkness and fog , keeping watch for the enemy . No enemy appeared . Towards morning , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking to their heels , having come down in the obscurity to see what they could see . It was Friday , the 7th of February . The morning was beautiful ; the sunrise came in clouds of glory ; there was as yet no taint of battle in the purity of the air . It was a lovely day for a sea fight . Frank climbed into the rigging to observe . At ten o'clock Goldsborough 's gunboats could be seen making their way , one by one , cautiously , through the narrow channel between marshy islands into Croatan Sound . There were nineteen of them . The gunboats of the coast division followed , six in number . The S. R. Spaulding , to which Burnside had transferred his flag , next went in , making signals for the transports to follow . Far off a gun was heard . It was only a signal fired by a rebel steamer to announce the approach of the squadron ; but it thrilled the hearts of the troops waiting to go into battle . An hour later another cannon boomed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the commodore 's flag-ship at the rebels , who promptly responded . The flag-ship now hoisted the signal ,  --  " THIS DAY OUR COUNTRY EXPECTS EVERY MAN TO DO HIS DUTY . " From ship to ship , from man to man , from heart to heart , thrilled the electric message . It was greeted by cheers and the thunder of guns . This was at half past eleven o'clock . XXII . THE ATTACK OF THE GUNBOATS . The spars of the transports were beginning to be thronged . Corporal Gray brought up a glass to Frank . " O , good ! " cried Frank . " Is it yours ? " " No ; it belongs to Mr. Sinjin . " " Did he send it to me ? " " Not he ! But he had been casting that sharp eye of his up at you , and I knew what he meant when he said , ' Corporal , there 's a good lookout from the masthead , if you 'd like to take a glass up there . " " Did he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treatment of him ? " said Frank . " Bless his old heart ! " With his naked eye for the general view , and the glass to bring out the details , Frank enjoyed a rare spectacle that day . Roanoke Island and its surroundings lay outspread before him like a map . On the west of it was Croatan Sound , separating it from the marshes and forests of the main land . On the east was Roanoke Sound , a much narrower sheet of water ; beyond which stretched that long , low , interminable strip of land which forms the outer coast , or seaboard , of this double-coasted country . Still east of that glimmered the blue rim of the Atlantic , a dozen miles away . At about the same distance , on the north , beyond Roanoke Island and the two sounds each side of it , opened the broad basin of Albemarle Sound , like an inland sea . The island itself appeared to be some twelve miles in its greatest length , and two or three in breadth , indented with numerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Croatan Sound . It was within this curve that the naval battle took place . It had now fairly begun . At noon the flag-officer 's ship displayed the signal for closer action , and the engagement soon became general . The enemy 's gunboats , seven in number , showed a disposition to fight at long range , retreating up the sound as the fleet advanced -- a movement which soon brought the latter under the fire of a battery that opened from the shore . The air , which had previously been perfectly clear that morning , was now loaded with clouds of smoke , which puffed from a hundred guns , and surging up from the vessels of the squadron , from the rebel gunboats , and from the shore battery , rolled away in broken , sun-illumined masses , wafted by a light northeasterly breeze . The soldiers in the rigging of the transports could see the flashes burst from the cannons ' mouths , the spouted smoke , the shots throwing up high in air the water or sand as they struck , or coming skip-skip across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the battle filled the air . For a time the fire of the attack was about equally divided between the rebel steamers and the fortification on the island . It was soon discovered , however , that boats had been sunk and a line of piles driven across the channel abreast of the battery , to prevent the farther advance of our gunboats in that direction . Behind those the retreating steamers discreetly withdrew , where they were presently reenforced by several other armed vessels . The gunboats made no attempt to follow , but took positions to give their principal attention to the battery . The fire from the shore gradually slackened , and thousands of hearts swelled anew as the hour seemed at hand when the troops were to land and carry the works at the point of the bayonet . Burnside paced the deck of the Spaulding , keeping an eye on the fort , watching the enemy 's shots , and looking impatiently for the arrival of the transports . At length they came crowding through the inlet , dropping their anchors in the sound just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gunboats , they were a sight not less astonishing than that which they themselves were coming to witness . Troops , eagerly watching the conflict , crowded the decks and hung upon the rigging like swarms of bees . Ropes , masts , and yards were festooned with the heavy , clinging clusters , which seemed ready to part and fall with their own weight . The effect of the picture was enhanced by the mellow brilliancy of the afternoon sky , against which the dark masses were clearly defined , and by the perfect tranquility of the water , like a sea of glass mirroring the ships and their loaded spars . The gunboats sent to the ships the roar of their artillery , and the ships sent back the chorus of thousands of cheering voices for every well-aimed shot . Frank was in the rigging of the schooner , watching the fight , making drawings to send to his mother , and talking with his comrades , among whom Sinjin 's glass passed from hand to hand . " I tell ye , boys ! " remarks Seth Tucket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bluff ever I took a hand in ! The battery is about used up . S'pose you look at your -- my -- our watch , Frank , and see how often the darned rebels fire . " " Once in about ten minutes now , " Frank informs him . " O ! did you see that shell burst ? Right over one of our gunboats ! " " She 's aground , " says Gray , with the glass . " She can neither use her guns nor get off ! A little tug is going to help her . " " Bully for the tug ! " says Jack Winch . " Hurrah ! hurrah ! " ring the deafening plaudits from the ships . " What is it ? " is eagerly asked . " The battery 's flag-staff is shot away ! " shouts Frank at the top of his voice . " Hooray ! " " Some think the flag has been hauled down , to surrender the fort , but it 's a mistake , " declares Gray . " See ! up it goes again on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at it again . " " Where 's Burnside ? " asks some one . And Tucket quotes ,  --  " ' O , where was Roderick then ? One blast upon his bugle horn were worth a thousand men ! ' " " He is sending off a boat to the shore yonder , to look for a landing-place . We 'll be going in there soon , boys ! " The boat approaches a cove called Ashby 's Harbor , taking soundings as it nears the land . On board of her is one of the negro lads , who fearlessly pilots her towards scenes familiar to his days of bondage . " They 'd better keep their eyes skinned ! " says Tucket . " There 's rebels in the mash there , I bet ye a dollar ! " The officers of the boat land safely , and reconnoitre . As they are reembarking , however , up spring from the tall grass a company of rebels , and flash , flash , goes a volley of musketry . " I wish somebody had took me up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t would have been a dollar in my pocket . " " They 're off ; nobody left behind ; nobody hurt , I hope , " says Gray , watching the boat . " Look , boys ! the rebels works are afire ! " is now the cry . Flames break through the smoke , and the firing slackens on both sides for a short time . " It 's only the barracks , probably , fired by a shell , " says Gray . " They 've no idea of surrendering . They hold out well ! " The battery is completely enveloped in black smoke , out of which leaps the white puff of the cannon , showing that the gunners are still at work . " See ! the gunboat that was aground is getting off ! that 's a brave tug that 's handling her ! " cries Frank " O ! " an exclamation of surprise and wonder . For just then the gunboat , swinging around so that she can bring her guns to bear , lets fly her broadside , dropping shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's about time , " says Jack Winch , " for us boys to go ashore and clean the rebels out . I 'm a gitting tired of this slow work . " " You 'll get ashore soon enough , and have enough to do when you get there , " says Atwater . " There are strong batteries towards the centre of the islands , that 'll have to be taken when we go in . " " Abe 's afraid , " mutters Jack to some comrades near him . " Did ye see him , and Frank , and Seth Tucket , reading their Testaments ? " " It was the ' Lady of the Lake ' Seth was reading , " says Harris . " He carries it in his pocket , and pitches into it odd spells . " " Winch do n't know the Lady of the Lake from the Bible ! " chimes in Tucket 's high nasal voice . " Yes , I do , too ! The Lady of the Lake , that 's one of Bryon 's poems ! S'pose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " sneers Ellis , amid the laughter Jack 's blunder elicits . " And no doubt you 'll soon find out who the cowards are among us , if you do n't know already . " " What 's that , afire , away up the sound , close into the main land ? " asks the phlegmatic Atwater . " I swan , ef ' ta n't one of the rebel steamers ! She 's got disabled , and they 've run her ashore . She 's all a sheet of fire now ! " " What 's that saucy little tug around here for ? " " Burnside 's aboard of her . He 's coming to see if we 're all right . We shall land soon , " says Gray . " See ! " cries Frank ; " our gunboats are shelling the shore , to make a landing-place for us . I would n't like to be in the woods there ! " " I guess Frank would n't ! " observes Jack . " But I would ; I 'd like no better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the bayonet ; that 's the way to do it ! " " The woods are afire ! Our shells have set them afire ! " cries Ellis . " Look ! there come the rebel steamers again , down the western shore . They think they can get down at us , now our gunboats are busy off there . " " When the cat 's away the mice will play , " says Tucket . " But the kittens are after ' em ! " " There goes Burnside 's tug to see what the row is ! " " The battery scarcely fires at all now , " says Frank , looking at his watch . " It 's twenty minutes since it has fired a shot . " " There goes one ! And see ! the gunboats are fighting each other now like mad -- again ! " cries Gray . " They 're all so wrapped in smoke you can hardly see one of ' em . "  - -  Bang , bang , bang !  --  " Is n't it grand ? " " A shell burst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It burst , and sprinkled the water all around it ! " XXIII . THE TROOPS DISEMBARK.  - -  THE ISLAND . At four o'clock the last of the transports had entered the inlet , and rejoined the fleet . Soon after commenced preparations for the landing of the troops . The boats were lowered and manned , and the soldiers , descending from decks and spars , began to crowd into them . Knapsacks were left behind ; the men taking with them only their arms , overcoats , canteens , haversacks , and cartridge-boxes , with three days ' rations of pork , beef , and hard bread , and forty rounds of ball cartridges . Down both sides of the vessels they passed , in rapid regular files , pouring into the boats . Their guns were taken as they stepped upon the stairs , and passed down to them as soon as they were embarked . Some took places at the oars ; the rest filed in fore and aft . It must have been an amazing spectacle to the enemy to witness these stirring and formidable preparations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troops were jubilant , and eager for battle . As fast as the boats were filled , they pushed from the stairs to make room for others , and lay upon their oars watching for the signals . These were telegraphed from the flag-ship of each brigade . At the instant , the boats swarmed the water in miniature fleets , with oars flashing , flags flying , and arms gleaming in the sun . Rowing to the flag-ship , or steamer detailed for the purpose , they attached themselves under her stern in two lines as they arrived , each boat taking the painter of the one behind it Then , at a signal whistle , the steamers started for the shore , each towing its double string of boats . In the mean time the fight between the fleet and the battery was continued ,  - -  rather languidly , however , on the part of the battery ; and a couple of light draught gunboats , running in close to the shore , continued shelling the woods about Ashby 's Harbor , to cover the landing of the troops . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near as the depth of water would permit , the signal whistles were sounded , the painters were cast off , the lines of boats broke simultaneously , the rowers took to their oars and pulled with all speed for the shore . As soon as the prows struck , the men jumped out , dashing through mud and water to the land . Many did not wait for the boats to get in , but , in their eagerness to follow their comrades , leaped overboard where the water was up to their waists . Some got stuck in the mire , and were helped out by those who came after them . Six thousand men were thus thrown upon the island at the first disembarkation ; while the remainder of the troops on the transports watched the brilliant scene , and cheered lustily when they saw the flag of the Union waving on the shore . Frank 's regiment was not yet disembarked . The boys were still in the rigging , following with eager eyes the movements of the boats . An exciting incident added interest to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rebels in ambush , waiting to receive them , were betrayed by the gleam of their muskets . A shell dropped discreetly into their hiding-place , by one of the gunboats , sent them scampering , and the troops landed without opposition . " It 's our turn now , boys ! " cried Tucket . And they slipped from the rigging , impatient to leap into the boats , and be put ashore . " I tell ye , wo n't it feel good to straighten out a fellow 's legs once , on dry land ! " The men were generally of Seth 's opinion ; their long confinement on shipboard having become exceedingly monotonous and tiresome . Frank was with his company . They loaded the boats to the gunwales . The water was still smooth , save where it was broken into waves and whirling eddies by the sweep of oars . The men shouted joyously , and waved their caps . Frank stood in the bow , and swung his cap with the rest . But looking back across the shining wakes at the forsaken schooner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regretful memory , as of one leaving home . There she lay , motionless ; hull and spars painted dark against the sunset sky ; her rigging , to the finest cordage , traced in exquisitely distinct lines upon that shining background -- a picture of exceeding loveliness and peace . As the boats swept down towards the shore , and the schooner seemed to recede into the flaming west , the network of cordage became black cobwebs on the sky , then melted away and vanished altogether . At the same time , the water , which the boats had troubled , grew smooth again , reflecting the sunset glow , with the sombre hull and ebon spars painted upon it , until Frank saw the spectre of a double ship suspended in a double heaven . And as the last view of the schooner was all beautiful , so his last thoughts of her were all tender . He remembered no more against her the hardships of the voyage , the seasickness , the two gills of water a day . But that she had borne them faithfully through storms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them ,  - -  this he remembered . And his sister 's death , and all his sufferings and errors , and the peace of soul which had come to him at last , were associated now and henceforth , with his memory of the ship swimming there in the illumined horizon . Only for a brief interval , like a wind that comes we know not whence , and goes again we know not whither , touching us with invisible perfumed wings , these thoughts swept over the boy , and passed as quickly . And he turned from gazing after the schooner to face the scenes before him . Nearer and nearer drew the boats to the island . Its woods and shores lay cool and tranquil in the evening light , and the troops there , half-hidden by the tall grass and the trees , were tinted with a gleam of romance . It was now fast growing dark . Clouds were gathering in the sky . From their edges the last hues of the sunset faded , the moon was hid , and a portentous gloom fell upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The shells flew screaming through the air , and fell bursting on the fort or in the woods . It was now so dark that the flash of the guns had become lurid and sharp , and the meteoric course of the projectiles could be traced by their fiery wake . Amid this scene the boats entered the cove , and as the prows struck , or before , the excited soldiers leaped out , regardless of mud and water . " Should n't wonder if somebody got a wet foot , " said Tucket , in the midst of the plunging and plashing -- himself in up to his hips . " ' A horse ! a horse ! my kingdom for a horse ! ' Here , Manly , take a grip of my coat tail . I 'm longer legged than you . " " I 'm all right , " said Frank . " I 've no gun to carry , and I can get along . " And he floundered on as fast as the deep , clinging ooze would permit . " This is what they call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thing , I should say , to breed rattle-snakes and rebels . " " I swan to man ! " chimed in Tucket 's voice from a distance , for his long legs had given him an advantage in the general race ,  --  " there ai n't no shore after ye get to't . It 's nothin ' but salt ma'sh , all trod to pudd'n ' by the fellers that have been in ahead of us . I thought we was to be landed ; ' stead of that , we 're swamped ! " The men pushed on , through marsh and swamp , sometimes in mire and water knee-deep , and now in tall , rank grass up to their eyes ; the darkness adding to their dismal prospect . " By Grimes ! " mutters Jack Winch , " I do n't think an island of this kind is worth taking . It 's jest fit for secesh and niggers , and nobody else . " " We must have the island , because it 's a key to the coast , " says Frank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't carry a gun , " retorts Jack , made cross by the cold and wet . " Perhaps before we get through you 'll be glad to lend me yours , " is Frank 's pleasant response , as he hastens forward through grass which waves about his ears or lies trodden and tangled under foot . " The gunboats have stopped firing , " observes Atwater . In fact , both gunboats and battery were now silent , the former having drawn off for the night . XXIV . THE BIVOUAC . " There 's a good time coming , and near , boys ! there 's a good time coming , and near ! " sings out Tucket , holding his head high as he strides along , for he has caught a sight of fires beyond , and the company are now emerging upon a tract of sandy barrens , thinly covered with pines . A road runs through the island . The advance of the column has already taken possession of it . Skirmishers have been thrown forward into the woods , and pickets are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the night . Fires are kindled , and soon the generous flames blaze up , illumining picturesque groups of men , and casting a wild glare far into the depths of the great , black , silent woods . The trees seem to stand out like startled giants , gazing at the unusual scene ; and all above and around the frightened shadows lurk , in ghostly boughs , behind dark trunks , among the deep grasses , and in hollows of the black morass . And the darkness of the night overhangs the army like a vast tent , sombrely flickering . A dry fence of cypress and pine rails is , without hesitation , appropriated to feed the fires of the bivouac ; and the chilled , soaked soldiers gather around them to get warm and dry . " My brave fellows , " says Captain Edney , passing among them , " do the best you can for yourselves for the night . Try to keep warm , and get what rest and sleep you can . You will need all your strength to-morrow . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ braggart air , " we 're going to give the rebels the almightiest thrashing they 've had yet ! To wade in their blood as deep as I 've waded to-night in this mud and water , that 's what 'll just suit me ! " " The less blood the better , boys , " says Captain Edney . " But we must be prepared to shed our own to the last drop , if need be , for we 're bound to sweep this island of every traitor to his country , before we leave it . Make up your minds to that , boys ! " There is that in his tone which promises something besides child 's play on the morrow . He is calm , serious , spirited , resolute ; and the hearts of his men are fired by his words . The troops are full of jest and merriment as they kick off their shoes , and empty the water out of them , squeeze their dripping trousers , and , lying on the ground , toast their steaming legs by the fires . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to-night , to pay for our ducking , " suggests Jack Winch . " I do n't want to sleep . " " You ought to be off in the swamps , on picket duty , then , " says Harris . " Let them sleep that have a chance . For my part , I 'm going to take the captain 's advice . There 's no knowing what sounds will wake us up , or how early . " " The sounds of muskets , I hope ; and the earlier the better , " says the valiant Jack . " Dang that shoe ! I believe I 've roasted it ! Bah ! look at Abe there , diving into his Testament , sure 's you live . " And Winch , perceiving that Atwater paid no attention to the sneer , flung his shoe at him . The soldier was reading by the light of the flames , when the missile came , striking the book from his hands . " Shame , shame ! " cried Frank , indignantly . " Jack Winch , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to "  - -   - -  France ,  - -  only Jack used a worse word ,  --  " with that red rag on your arm ! I do n't have any thing to say to non-combatants . " Frank might not have been able to stifle his indignation but for the grave example of Atwater , who gave no more heed to Jack 's shoe than he had given to his base taunt , but , silently gathering up his book again , brushed the sand from it , found his place , and resumed his reading , as composedly as if nothing had happened . Neither did Frank say any thing . But Ellis , near whom the shoe had fallen , tossed it back with a threat to consign it to the fire if it came that way again . " Wonder if my pocket-book got wet any , " said Harris , taking out his money and examining it . " O , you feel mighty proud of your winnings ! " said Jack , who seemed bent on picking a quarrel with some one . " Yes , I do , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it as this , "  - -  reaching something towards the drummer boy . " Here , Frank , is all the money , I believe , that I 've won off you . We 're going into a fight to-morrow , and nobody knows how we shall come out of it . I want to stand right with every body , if I can . " Frank was too much astonished to accept the money . He seemed to think there was some joke in it . " I 'm in earnest , " insisted Harris . " The truth is , I 've been ashamed of winning your money , ever since . You did n't mean it , but you 've acted in a way to make me ashamed . " " I have ! How ? " Frank was more amazed than ever . " Because you gave over play , though you had a chance to try again , and acted as if you had got above such foolish things . It 's time we all got above them . You 're a good-hearted fellow , Frank , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've robbed you . " Frank took the money with a heart too full for thanks . He thought Harris a fellow of unexampled generosity , never considering how much his own example had had to do with bringing about this most gratifying result . Atwater stopped reading , and looked over his book at Harris with a smile of pleasure and approval clear as daybreak . But the silent man did not speak . " Well ! the idea of a battle makes some folks awful pious all at once ! " was Winch 's comment . Nobody heeded him . As for Frank , with triumph in his heart and money in his fist , he ran barefoot to where Seth Tucket lay sprawled before the blazing rails , feeling of his stockings , to see if they were dry enough to put on . " Hello , young chap ! how goes it ? ' Stranger what dost thou require ? Rest , and a guide , and food and fire . ' Get down here and have a toasting . It comes cheap . " Frank sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's all that ? " demanded Seth . " All I owe you , and a little to spare ! " cried Frank , elated . " Sho , ye do n't say ! See here , Frank ! I never meant you should trouble yourself about that . I 'm all right , money or no money . I 'm an independent sort of nabob -- do n't need the vile stuff . ' Kings may be great , but Seth is glorious , o'er all the ills of life victorious ! ' So put it away , and keep it , Frank . " But when the drummer boy told him how he had come by the money , and that it was his wish to settle his accounts before the battle , Tucket screwed up his face with a resigned expression , and received back the loan . A great weight was now lifted from Frank 's mind . The vexing problem , how he was to retain the watch and yet satisfy Seth 's rightful claims , was thus happily solved . He could have danced for joy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than ever now to see Mr. Sinjin , and make up with him . A few rods off , in the rear of the soldiers ' bivouacs , the old drummer could be seen , sitting with a group of officers around a fire of their own . His stockings were hung upon the end of a rail , and he was busy roasting a piece of pork on the end of a stick , held out at arm 's length to the fire . Frank saw that it was no time to speak with him then ; so he returned to his place , and sat down to put on his shoes and join those who had not yet been to supper , over their rations . XXV . ATWATER . As the evening wore on , Atwater was observed sitting apart from the rest , unusually silent and grave even for him ; gazing at the fire , with the book he had been reading closed and folded thoughtfully between his hands . Now Frank , following his example , had lately formed the resolution to read a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only for his mother 's sake . " But to-night his Testament was in his knapsack , and his knapsack was on board the schooner . " I 'll borrow Atwater 's , " he thought ; and with this purpose he approached the tall private . " Sit down here , Frank , " said Atwater , with a serious smile . " I want to talk with you . " It was so extraordinary for the phlegmatic Abe to express a wish to talk with any body , that Frank almost felt awed by the summons . Something within him said that a communication of no trivial import was coming . So he sat down . And the tongue of the taciturn was that night , for once in his life , strangely loosened . " I ca n't say it to the rest , Frank ; I do n't know why . But I feel as if I could say it to you . " " Do , " said Frank , thrilling with sympathy to the soldier 's mysterious emotion . " What is it , Abe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the fire . Then he lifted from the book , which he held so tenderly , his right hand , and laid it upon Frank 's . And he turned to the boy with a smile . " I 've liked you from the first , Frank . Did you know it ? " " If you have , I do n't know why , " said Frank , deeply touched . " Nor do I , " said the private . " Some we like , and some we do n't , without the reason for it appearing altogether clear . I liked you even when you did n't please me very well . " " You mean when --  --  " began Frank , stammeringly . " Yes , you know when . It used to hurt me to see and hear you -- but that is past . " " I hope so , " said Frank , from his heart . " Yes . And I like you better than ever now . And do you know , Frank , I do n't think I could say to you what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in trouble yourself , lately ? That makes me feel I can come near you . " " O ! are you in trouble , Abe ? " " Yes , " with another mild , serious smile . " Not just such trouble as you were in , though . It is nothing on my own account . It is on hers . " And the soldier 's voice sunk , as it always did , when he alluded to his wife . " You have heard from her ? " asked Frank , with sympathizing interest . " Nothing but good news ; nothing but good news , " said Atwater , pressing the pocket where his letters were . " I wish you could know that girl 's heart . I am just beginning to know it . She has blessed me ! She is a simple creature -- not so smart as some ; but she has , what is better than all that , a heart , Frank ! " Frank , not knowing what else to say , answered earnestly , that he was sure of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the soldier continued , his features tremblingly alive with emotion . " I never looked into it much before . I never thought much about it -- whether it was true or not . But whether it is true or not , there is something in it that reaches me here , "  - -  laying his hand on his heart ,  --  " something that sinks into me . I ca n't tell how . It gives me comfort . " Frank , still not knowing how to reply , murmured that he was glad to hear it . " Now , this is what I have been wanting to say to somebody , " Abram went on , in a calm but suppressed voice . " I am going into battle to-morrow . Do n't think I am afraid . I have no fear . But of one thing I am tolerably certain . I shall not come out of that fight unhurt . " The smile which accompanied these words , quite as much as the words themselves , alarmed Frank . " Do n't say that ! " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; that 's it . " " O , no ! I am not low-spirited in the least . My country demands sacrifices . I , for one , am willing to die . " This was said with singular calmness and cheerfulness . But the soldier 's voice failed him , as he added , " It is only when I think of her --  --  " Frank , powerfully wrought upon , endeavored in vain to dissuade his friend from indulging in such sad presentiments . " Well , we will hope that they are false , " said Atwater , but with a look that betrayed how thoroughly he was convinced of their truth . " If I go through safely , then we can laugh at them afterwards . But much may happen in these coming twenty-four hours . Now , I am sitting here with you , talking by these fires that light up the woods so . To-morrow night , this which you call me , "  - -  the soldier smilingly designated his body ,  --  " may be stretched upon this same earth , and you may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We do n't know ,  - -  that 's true , " Frank agreed . " But I hope for the best . " " And that may be the best -- for me . God knows . And for her , too ,  - -  though I dread the stroke for her ! This is what I want you to do for me , Frank . If I fall , if I fall , you know , you will write to her . Send back to her my last words , with the book she gave me , and her letters . You will find them all in this pocket , here . Will you ? " Frank could not refrain from tears , as he made the promise . " That is all , " said Atwater , cheerfully . " Now , my mind is easier . Now , whatever comes , I am ready . Stay with me , if you like , and we will talk of something else . Or shall we read a little together ? " " I 'd like to read a little , " said Frank . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ' Fear not them which kill the body , but are not able to kill the soul .... Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing ? and one of them shall not fall to the ground without your Father . But the very hairs of your head are all numbered . Fear not , therefore ; ye are of more value than many sparrows . ' " " How came you to read there ? " said Atwater with a smile . " I do n't know , " said Frank . " But it seems meant for you -- do n't it ? " " Yes , and it somehow makes me happy . Go on . " And Frank read ,  --  " ' Think not I am come to send peace on earth : I came not to send peace , but a sword . ' " " That is for both of us , for all of us , for all our people to-day , " said Atwater . " I believe it is the struggle of Satan against Christ that has brought on this war . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Satan . And I believe , wicked as we are at the north too , that the principle of freedom we are fighting for is the opposite of Satan . And whoever brings that into the world , brings a war that will never cease until the right triumphs , and the wrong ceases forever . " Frank was astonished . He had never suspected that in this stiff , reserved soldier there dwelt the spirit which , when their tongues are loosed , makes men eloquent . Atwater had roused up , and spoken with earnestness . But his glow passed , and he said quietly ,  --  " Go on . " " ' A man 's foes shall be they of his own household . ' " There Frank stopped again , this time of his own accord . The words struck him with peculiar force . " That is true too , " said Abram ; " of the nation , for a nation is a household ; and of many , many families . " Frank studied the words a moment , and , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice ,  --  " Did you know , Abe , I 've a brother in the rebel army ? " " I did not know . I have heard you have one somewhere in the south . " " Yes , you have heard Jack twit me about my secesh brother . And I have been obliged to own he was a -- traitor . And since I left home my folks have had a letter from him , in which he wrote that he was on the point of joining the confederate army , and that we would not probably hear from him again . So I suppose he is fighting against us somewhere . " " Not here , I hope , " said Atwater . " As well here as any where , " said Frank . " I always loved my brother . I love him still . But , as you say , wicked as we are , Christ is in our cause , and --  --  " Frank read ,  --  " ' He that loveth father or mother more than me , is not worthy of me ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is not worthy of me . ' " " And I , " said the boy , lifting up his face with a patriotic , even a religious , fervor in it , " I love my country , I love the cause of right and freedom , better than I love my brother ! " " With that true of us , with that love in our hearts , " said Atwater , " we can dare to fight , and whatever the result , I believe it will be well with us . See what the book says . " And Frank read on . " ' He that findeth his life shall lose it ; and he that looseth his life for my sake shall find it . ' " " That is enough , " said Atwater . " I can bind that sentence like an armor around my heart . " " What does it mean ? " " It means , I think , that though wickedness triumphs , it triumphs to its own confusion , for it has no immortal life . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After that the soldier seemed inclined to relapse into revery . Frank thought he did not wish to talk any more ; so he gave him back the book . Abram put it in his pocket , and took the boy 's hand . " Good night , Frank , " he smilingly said . " We shall see each other in the morning . " " Good night , Abe . " Frank left him . And Atwater , stretching himself upon the ground , put his arm beneath his head , and with the fire-light on his placid countenance , dismissed all worldly care from his mind , and slept peacefully . XXVI . OLD SINJIN . At the foot of a pine tree , on a pillow of boughs , lies the old drum-major . The blaze of the bivouac fire covers him with its glow as with a mantle . But his face looks haggard and care-worn , and his grizzled mustache has a cynical curl even in sleep . At a sound he starts , opening wide those watchful gray eyes an instant , then closing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it comes , and passes by his side . Then silence -- broken only by the crackle and roar of the flames . At length one eye of the sleeper opens a little , and peeps ; and as it peeps , it sees , sitting on the pine roots , in the broad fire-light , with his cap before his eyes shading them , and his eyes fixed wistfully on him , Frank , the drummer boy . The eye that opened a little and peeped , closes again . The old fellow begins to snore . " Poor old man ! " says the boy to himself ; " how tired he looks . And to think I have done so much to hurt his feelings ! I wish I could tell him how sorry I am ; but I must not wake him . " Again the ambushed eye opens , and the little corner of the sleeper 's soul that happens to be not asleep , reconnoitres . Frank is sitting there still , faithfully watching . A stream of electric fire tingles in that misanthropic breast , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I may as well lie down and go to sleep too , " says Frank . And , very softly , so as not to awaken Mr. Sinjin , he lays himself down by his side , puts his cheek on the pillow of boughs , and keeps perfectly still . The heart of the veteran burns within him , but he makes no sign . And now -- hark ! Patter , patter , patter . It is beginning to rain . This , then , is what the dark canopy meant , hanging so luridly over the fire-lit forest . Patter , patter ; faster , faster ; dripping through the trees , hissing in the fire , capering like fairies on the ground , comes the midnight rain . Sinjin thinks it about time to wake . But Frank is stirring ; so he concludes to sleep a little longer , and see what he will do . Frank takes some pine boughs , and lays them carefully over the old man , to shelter him from the rain . Hotter and hotter glows the old heart beneath ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frank in a whisper ; " do n't tell him I did it ! " He is going . Old Sinjin can sleep -- or pretend to sleep -- no more . " Hello ! Who 's there ? "  - -  awaking with amazing suddenness.  --  " That you , Frank ? What are you here for at this time of night ? " " O , I 'm a privileged character . They let me go around the camp about as I like , you know . " " How long has it been raining ? And how came all this rubbish heaped over me ? " The pattering becomes a rushing in the tree-tops , a wild sibilation as of serpents in the fire , and a steady rattling and whizzing in the swamps . " Well , well ! this wo n't do , boy ! Come with me ! " They run to the shelter of a huge leaning trunk and crouch beneath it . " You 're not so used to these things as I am , " says the old man , shielding the boy with his arms . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " cries Frank . " No -- sit still ! You have heaped boughs enough on me for one night ! " " Were you -- awake ? " " One eye was a little awake . " " And you saw ! " " I saw all you did , my boy ! " Frank knows not whether to be happy or ashamed . Neither speaks . The storm is roaring in the trees . The water drips and the spray sifts upon them , At length Frank says ,  --  " I wanted to tell you I have the watch again , and I know who gave it to me , and I think he is one of the best old men in the world . And I wanted to say that I am very sorry for every thing I have said and done that was wrong . " The bosom of the lonely old man heaves as he answers , " Do n't , my boy ! do n't say you are sorry -- I ca n't stand that ! " And he hugs the boy close . " But why did n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Because I am such a foolish old fellow , and have forgotten how to treat a friend . For twenty years and more I have not known what it was to have a living soul care for me . " " O , it must be so hard for you to be alone so ! Have you no sisters ? " " Sisters ! I would tell you of one so proud , and rich , and in fashion , that her great house has no room in it for a rusty old brother like me ! " Frank thought of his own sisters -- of Hattie , who was gone , and of Helen , who , though she should wed a prince , would never , he was sure , shut her doors against him ; and he was filled with pity for the poor old man . " But you must have had friends ? " " I had one , who was a fast friend enough when he was poor and I had a little property . But I became responsible for his debts , which he left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he grew rich and hated me ! " " Hated you ? " " Of course ! We may forgive those who wrong us , but not those we have wronged . He never forgave me for having been robbed by him ! " And the old man 's voice grew hard and ironical at the recollection . " Why did n't you ever get married ? " asked Frank . " You have one of the best , biggest hearts in the world , and you ought to have loved somebody with it . Did n't you ever ? " The spirit of the old man shrank sensitively within him for a moment . Then he said to himself , " He will know of it some day , and I may as well tell him . " For the heart that had been frozen for years this youth had had power to thaw . " I never loved -- any woman -- well enough to marry her . But there was once a little girl that I had known from her cradle -- for I was many years older than she . I used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and play to her , until I became more bound up in her than was very wise for one who was not her father or her brother . Well , she got to be of your age , and still ran to kiss me when I came , and never guessed what was growing up in my heart and taking possession of me , for it was stronger than I , and stronger than all the world . I saw her fast becoming a woman , and forgot that I was at the same time fast becoming an old man . And one day I asked her to marry me . I did not mean then , but in a few years . But she did not stop to hear my explanations . She sprang from me with a scream . And that ended it . She could never be to me again the innocent pet she had been , and as for being what I wished -- I saw at once how absurd the proposal was ! I saw that from that time she could regard me only with astonishment and laughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the other I have told you of , proved too much for me . I fled from society . I enlisted as a drummer , and I suppose I shall never be any thing but a drummer now . And this , my boy , is the reason I was never married . " Drearily sounded the old man 's voice as he closed . " It is all so sad ! " said Frank . " But ought a man to do so , because he has been once or twice deceived ? I have heard my mother say that as we are to others , so they will be to us . If we are generous , that excites them to be generous ; and love calls out love . " " Your mother says that ? " replied Mr. Sinjin in a low voice . " Ah , and she says true ! If one is proud and reserved , he will find the world proud and reserved : that I know ! Because two or three failed me , I distrusted every body , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not do so ! Never let your soul be chilled by any disappointment , if you would not become a solitary and neglected old man . Better trust a thousand times , and be deceived as often , better love a thousand times in vain , than shut up your heart in suspicion and scorn . Your mother is right , Frank ,  - -  in that , as in every thing else , she is perfectly right ! " " It is n't too late yet -- is it ? to have friends such as you like . I am sure you can if you will , " said Frank . " You have almost made me think so , " answered the old drummer . " You have brought back to my heart more of its youth and freshness than I had felt for years . I want you to know that , my boy . " Frank did not understand how it could be , and the old man did not inform him . It was now very late . The rain poured dismally . Frank lay nestled in the old man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time he did not speak . Then the veteran bent forward so that he could look in his face . The boy was fast asleep . " How much he looks like his mother ! Her brow , her mouth ! God bless the lad , God bless him ! " And the old man sat and watched whilst the drummer boy slept . XXVII . THE SKIRMISH . The night and the storm passed , and day dawned on Roanoke Island . No reveille roused up the soldiers . Silently from their drenched , cold beds , they arose and prepared for the rough day 's work before them . The morning was chill and wet , the rain still dripping from the trees . Far in the cypress swamps the lone birds piped their matin songs -- the only sounds in those dim solitudes , so soon to be filled with the roar of battle . Ten thousand men had been landed from the fleet ; and now ten thousand hearts were beating high in anticipation of the conflict . The line of advance lay along the road , which run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Across this road the rebels had erected their most formidable battery , with seemingly impenetrable swamps on either side , an ample space cleared for the play of their guns in front , and felled trees all around . General Foster 's brigade took the advance , having with it a battery of twelve-pounders from the fleet , to operate on the enemy 's front . General Reno followed , with orders to penetrate on the left the frightful lagoons and thickets which protected the enemy 's flank . A third column , under General Parke , brought up the rear . General Foster rode forward with his staff into the woods , and made a reconnoissance . The line of pickets opened to let the brigade pass through . Not a drum was beat . Slowly , in silence , occasionally halting , regiment succeeded regiment , in perfect order , with heavy muffled tramp . Along the forest road they passed , the men laughing and joking in high spirits , as if marching to a parade . The still , beautiful light of the innocent morning silvered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glistening stream of steel flowed beneath . Wreaths of vines , beards of moss , trailed their long fringes and graceful drapery from the boughs . The breeze shook down large shining drops , and every bush a soldier touched threw off its dancing shower . " ' And Ardennes waves above them her green leaves , dewy with nature 's tear-drops , as they pass , ' " remarked Seth Tucket . " Come , none o ' your solemncholy poetry to-day , " said Jack Winch . " I never felt so jolly in my life . There 's only one kind of poetry I want to hear , and that 's the pouring of our volleys into the rebels . " " The pouring of their volleys into us ai n't quite so desirable , I suppose , " said Harris . " There would n't be much fun without some danger , " said Jack . " If that 's fun , I guess Winch ' ll have fun enough before we 're through with this job , " remarked Ellis . " What a long road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 'll come to a short turn in it pretty soon , " said Atwater , significantly . " Well , Abe has spoken ! " said Jack . " His mouth has been shut so tight all along , I did n't think ' t would open till the time comes for him to cry quarter . " " Atwater means to let his gun speak for him to-day , " said Harris . " What do we go so slow for ? Why do n't we hurry on ? " said Jack . " I want to get at the rebels some time this week . I do n't believe they --  --  " He was going to say that he did n't believe they would wait to fire a shot . But even as he spoke the confutation of his opinion resounded in the woods . **25;3311;TOOLONG the rebel muskets ; then followed a volley from the troops in advance . " Why did n't you finish your sentence , Jack ? " said Harris , with a smile . " They 're at it ! " whispered Jack , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Atwater , quietly . Crack , crack , again ; and -- sing ! came a bullet over the heads of the men , cutting the leaves as it passed . " Too high , " laughed Gray , coolly . " Halt ! " come the command , which John Winch , for one , obeyed with amazing promptness . " Hallo , Jack ! " said Ellis ; " who taught you to halt before the word is given ? " " Are they going to keep us standing here all day ? " said Jack , presently . " He 's as wide awake now to be on the move as he was to stop , " laughed Harris . " Well , " said Jack , nervously , " who likes to stand still and be shot at ? " " There 's no shooting at us , " replied Harris . " When it comes to that , we 'll see the fun you talk about . " Fun ! Jack 's countenance looked like any thing but fun just then . He gained some confidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the men coolly executing them , as if nothing of importance had happened , or was expected to happen . Captain Edney deployed his company , pressing forward into the swamp . Bushes and fallen logs impeded their progress ; the mud and water were in places leg-deep ; and the men were permitted to pick their way as best they could . Suddenly out of a thicket a bullet came whizzing . Another and another followed . One tore the bark from a tree close by Captain Edney 's head . " Keep cool , boys ! " he said ; " and aim low . " He then gave the order , " Commence firing ! " and the front rank men , halting , poured their volley into the thicket -- their first shot at the enemy . Whilst they were reloading , the second rank advanced and delivered their fire . " Do n't waste a shot , my brave fellows ! " cried the captain . " Fire wherever you see signs of a rebel . Always aim at something . " This last order was a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming for the first time under fire , were inclined to let off their pieces at random in the air ; and the deliberation required to take aim , if only at a bush behind which a rebel might be concealed , had an excellent effect in quieting the nerves . Yet some needed no such instruction . Atwater was observed to load and fire with as steady a hand and as serene a countenance as if he had been practising at a target . Others were equally calm and determined . There were some , however , even of the brave , who , from constitutional excitability , and not from any cowardice of spirit , exhibited symptoms of nervousness . Their cheeks paled and their hands shook . But , the momentary tremor past , these men become perhaps the most resolute and efficient of all . Such a one was Frank ; who , though in the rear of the regiment , with the ambulance corps , felt his heart beat so wildly at the first whiz of a bullet over his head , that he was afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another of the sort ? It was pitiful to see him attempt to load his piece . He never knew how it happened , but , instead of a cartridge , he got hold of the tompion ,  - -  called by the boys the " tompin , "  - -  used to stop the muzzle of the gun and protect it from moisture , and was actually proceeding to ram it down the barrel before he discovered his mistake ! " Take a cartridge , Winch ! " said Captain Edney , who was coolly noting the conduct of his men . So Jack , throwing away the stopper , took a cartridge . But his hand shook around the muzzle of the gun so that it was some time before he could insert the charge . He had already dodged behind a tree , the men being allowed to shelter themselves when they could . " Dry ground is scarce as hen 's teeth ! " remarked Seth Tucket , droll as ever , looking for a good place to stand while he was loading . " Fun , ai n't it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same tree with Winch . He stood at Jack 's left hand , and a little behind him . Jack , too much agitated to respond to the unseasonable jest , threw up the barrel of his piece , in order to prime , when a bullet came , from nobody knew where , aslant , and put an end to jesting for the present . Jack felt a benumbing shock , and dropped his gun , the stock of which had been shivered in his grasp . At the same instant Ellis dropped his gun also , and threw out his hands wildly , exclaiming ,  --  " I am shot ! " And both fell to the ground together . " That 's what ye call two birds with one stun ! " said Tucket , a flash of ferocity kindling his face as he saw his comrades fall . " Pay ' em for that , boys ! Pay ' em for that ! " And hearing the order to charge the thicket , he went forward with a yell , taking strides that would have done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maine . Ellis had by this time got upon his feet again . But Jack lay still , his neck bathed in blood . XXVIII . JACK WINCH 'S CATASTROPHE . Several companies were by this time engaged driving in the rebel skirmishers , and three or four men had been disabled . It was impracticable to take the stretchers , or litters for the wounded , into such a wilderness of bogs and thickets ; and accordingly the most forward and courageous of the carriers leaped into the swamps without them . As soon as Frank heard that some of his company had been wounded , all sense of danger to himself was forgotten , and no remonstrance from his friend the drum-major could prevent his rushing in to assist in bringing them off . Finding that the boy , whose welfare was so precious to him , could not be restrained , Mr. Sinjin plunged in with him , and kept at his side , scrambling through mud and brush and water , and over logs and roots , in the direction of the firing . They had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His right hand hung mangled and ghastly and bleeding at his side . A slug from a rifle musket had ploughed it through , nearly severing the fingers from the wrist . " Ellis ! " cried Frank --  " you hurt ? " Ned swung the disabled and red-dripping member up to view , with a sorry smile . " Not so bad as might be ! " he said , with a rather faint show of gayety . " Jack has got it worse . " " Jack who ? " for there were several Jacks in the company . " Winch , " said Ellis , whilst the old drummer was binding up his hand to stop the blood . " Is he killed ? " asked Frank , with a strange feeling -- almost of remorse , remembering his late bitter and vindictive thoughts towards John . " I do n't know . We were both hit by the same ball , I believe . It must have passed through his neck . It came from one side , and we tumbled both together . What I tumbled for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me long to pick myself up again ! " " And Jack ? " " There he lies , with blood all over his face . " " And nobody caring for him ? " " The boys have something else to think of ! " said Ellis , with a pallid smile . Mr. Sinjin , having tied up the wound , directed him how to find the surgeon . And Ellis , in return , pointed out the best way to get at Jack . The company had advanced , driving the rebel skirmishers before them , and leaving Winch where he had fallen . Frank and his companion soon reached the spot . There lay the hapless youth under the roots of the tree , the left side of his face and neck all covered with gore . " Jack ! " cried Frank , stooping by his side , and lifting his arm . No answer . The arm fell heavily again as he released it . " Dead ! " said the boy , a sudden calmness coming over him . " We may as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Not dead yet , " said the more experienced Sinjin , feeling Jack 's heart , which was beating still . In corroboration of which statement Winch uttered something between a gasp and a groan , and rolled up horrible eyes . Frank was standing , and the old man was trying to find Winch 's wound , in order to prevent his bleeding to death while they were carrying him out , when the report of a rifle sounded , seemingly quite near , and a bullet passed with a swift vehement buzz close by their ears . At the instant Frank felt something like a quick tap or jerk on his arm . He looked , and saw that the strip of red flannel , which betokened the service he was engaged in , and which should have rendered his person sacred from any intentional harm , had been shot away . A hole had been torn in his sleeve also , but his flesh was untouched . The old drummer looked up quickly . " Are you hurt ? " " No , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to discover where the shot came from . " It must have been a spent ball ; for , see ! it fell there in the water ! "  - -  pointing at a pool behind them , the surface of which was still rippling with the plunge of the shot . Winch gave another groan . " The wound must be an internal one , " said Sinjin , " for he is not bleeding much now . " Frank assisted to lift him , and together they bore him back towards the road . It was a difficult task . Frank had neither the stature nor the strength of a man ; but he made up in energy and good will what he lacked in force . Very carefully , very tenderly , through bogs and through thickets , they carried the helpless , heavy weight of the blood-stained volunteer . " Frank ! is it you ? " murmured Winch , faintly . " Yes , Jack ! " panted the boy , out of breath with exertion . " Am I killed ? " articulated Jack . " O @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got a bullet in you somewhere ; but I guess the surgeon will soon have it out , and you 'll be all right again . " " O ! " groaned Jack . Just then there came another rifle-crack , not quite so near as before , and another bullet came with its angry buzz . It cut a twig just over Mr. Sinjin 's head , and grazed a cypress tree farther on , at a point considerably lower , and with a downward slant , as the mark revealed . " Another spent ball , " said Frank . But the old drummer shook his head . " Those are no spent balls . Some murderous rebel is aiming at us . " " How can that be ? " " I do n't know . And our best way is not to stop to inquire , but to get out of this as soon as possible . " " Frank ! " groaned the burden they were bearing . " What , Jack ? " " Forgive me , Frank ! " " For what ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about you . " " They were not all lies , I 'm sorry to say , Jack . But even if they were , I forgive you from my very soul . " Jack groaned , and said no more . Assistants now came to meet them , and Frank , who was almost exhausted with the fatigue of bringing his comrade so far , was relieved of the burden . The road was near , and Jack was soon laid upon a stretcher . " Frank ! " he gasped , rolling his eyes again , " do n't leave me ! For God 's sake , stay by me , Frank ! " So Frank kept by his side , while the men bore him along the road to a tree , where the surgeon had hung up his red flag , and established his hospital . Ellis had just undergone the amputation of his mangled hand , without once flinching under the surgeon 's knife , and he remained on the spot to encourage Winch . " If I die , " began Jack , stirring himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Frank , do you hear me ? " " What is it , Jack ? " asked the sympathizing boy . " If I die , do n't let me be buried on this miserable island ! " " But you are not going to die , " said the surgeon , kindly , cutting away the clothes from his neck . Mr. Sinjin assisted , while Frank anxiously awaited the result of the examination . The surgeon looked puzzled . There was blood , but not any fresh blood -- and no wound ! Not so much as a scratch of the skin . Jack in the mean time was groaning dismally . " What are you making that noise for ? " exclaimed the surgeon , sharply . " There is n't a hurt about you ! " " Ai n't I shot ? " cried Jack , starting up , as much astonished as any body ; for he had really believed he was a dead man . " I was hit , I know ! and I swooned away . " " You swooned from fright , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellow away ! " Jack , however , gratified as he was to learn he was not killed , testily insisted that a bullet had passed through him , adducing the blood on his face as a proof . Thereupon Ellis broke into a laugh . " It takes Jack to make capital out of a little borrowed blood . I know something about that . When my hand was ploughed through , I slapped it against his face ; and down he went , fainting dead away . " And , notwithstanding the ache of his wound and his weakness , and the scenes of horror thickening around , Ned leaned back against the tree , and laughed merrily at what he called Jack 's " awful big scare . " Frank felt immensely relieved , at first , on learning that Jack was not killed ; then immensely amused ; and , lastly , immensely disgusted . He remembered the severe struggle it cost to bring him out of the swamp , the rolled-up eyes , the lugubrious groans , and the faintly murmured dying request to be forgiven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not help saying , " Yes , Jack , I forgive ye ! and if you die , you sha n't be buried on this miserable island . " He was excited when he uttered this taunt , and he was sorry for it afterwards . Seeing the craven slink away , conscious of the scorn of every body , he felt a touch of pity for him . " Jack , " said he , with friendly intent , " why do n't you go back and wipe out this disgrace ? I would . " " Because , " snarled Jack , goaded by his own shame and the general contempt , " I 'm hurt , I tell ye ! internally , I s'pose , " for he had heard Mr. Sinjin use the word , and thought it a good one to suit his case . And he lay down wretchedly by the roadside , and counterfeited anguish , while the fresh troops marched by to the battle . A fiery impulse seized the drummer boy . He glanced at his torn sleeve , from which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something besides accident in what appeared so much like an omen . If it meant any thing , was it not that his place was elsewhere than in the ambulance corps ? He turned to Mr. Sinjin , and asked to be excused from going with the stretcher . And Mr. Sinjin , who prized the boy 's safety too highly to wish to see him go again under fire , was only too glad to excuse him , never once suspecting what wild purpose was in his heart . The battle was now fairly begun . The rebel battery had opened . The continual rattle of musketry and the thunder of heavy cannon shook the island . The regiments in line in front of the cleared space before the battery , returned the fire with energy , and the marine howitzers also responded . Soon a shell from the enemy 's work came flying through the woods with a hum , which increased to a howl , and burst with a startling explosion within a few rods of the hospital . Nobody was hurt ; but the incident had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at once , and moved to the rear with an alacrity surprisingly in contrast with his recent helplessness . XXIX . HOW FRANK GOT NEWS OF HIS BROTHER . Frank was already moving off quite as rapidly , but in the opposite direction . He plunged once more into the swamp , and returned to the spot where Jack had fallen . The battle was raging beyond ; the troops had passed on ; the ground was deserted . But there lay Winch 's gun ; with his cartridge-box beside it . Near by was Ellis 's piece , abandoned where it had fallen . There , too , lay the red badge which had been shot from Frank 's arm . He picked it up , thinking his mother would like to have him preserve it . Then he slipped on the cartridge-box , and took up Winch 's gun ; for this was the resolution which inspired him -- to assume the poltroon 's place in the company , and by his own conduct to atone for the disgrace he had brought upon it . But the gun-stock was , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the satisfaction of revenging himself and his comrades for Winch 's cowardice with Winch 's own gun . So he threw it down , and took up Ellis 's , which he found ready loaded and primed . While he was examining the piece , he remembered the shots which he had taken for spent balls , and bethought him to look around the woods in the direction from which they had come . Raising his eyes above the undergrowth , he beheld a singular phenomenon . At first , he thought it was a wild animal -- a coon , or a wildcat , coming down a tree . Then there were two wildcats , descending together , or preparing to descend . Then the wildcats became two human legs clasped around the trunk , and two human arms appeared enjoying an equally close hug above them . The body to which these visible members appertained was itself invisible , being on the farther side of the trunk . " That 's the chap that was shooting at us ! " was Frank 's instantaneous conviction . And now he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as his movements swung it around a little to one side . It was the sharpshooter 's rifle . Frank was so excited that he felt himself trembling -- not with fear , but with the very ardor of his ambition . " Since he has had two shots at me , why should n't I have as much as one at him ? " To disable and bring in the rebel who had shot the badge from his arm -- what a triumph ! But he was not in a good position for an effective shot , even if he could have made up his mind to fire at a person who , though without doubt an enemy , was not at the moment defending himself . It seemed , after all , too dreadful a thing deliberately to kill a man . Frank 's excitement did not embarrass his faculties in the least , but only rendered them all the more keenly alive and vigilant . It took him but a moment to decide what to do . Through the swamp he ran with a lightness and ability of which in calmer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the occasion inspired him . Such leaps he took over miry places ! so safely and swiftly be ran the length of an old mossy log ! so nimbly he avoided the undergrowth ! and so suddenly he arrived at last at the tree the rebel was descending ! For he was a rebel indeed . Frank knew that by his gray uniform and short jacket . He had been perched in the thick top of a tall pine to pick off our men during the skirmish . It was he who had taken the bark from the tree near Captain Edney 's head . It was he who had basely thought to assassinate those who were carrying away the wounded . And now , the advancing troops having passed him , he was taking advantage of the solitary situation to slip down the trunk and make his escape through the woods . Unfortunately for him , he could not go up and down trees like a squirrel . He proceeded hugging his way so slowly and laboriously that Frank reached the spot when he was still within a dozen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking down over his arm , and seeing Frank , he would have jumped the remainder of the distance . But Frank was prepared for that . " Stop , or I 'll fire ! " Shrill and menacing rang the boy 's determined tones through the soul of the treed rebel . He saw the gun pointed up at him ; so he stopped . " What 's wanting ? " said he , gruffly . " I want you to throw down that rifle as quick as ever you can ! " cried Frank . " What do you want of my rifle ? " " I 've a curiosity to see what sort of a piece you use to shoot at men carrying off the wounded . " And the " grayback " ( as the boys termed the rebels ) could hear the ominous click of the gun lock in Frank 's hands . " Was it you I fired at ? " " Yes , it was ; and I 'm bound to put lead into you now , if you do n't do as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throw my gun down ; I ca n't get it off , " remonstrated the man . " You never will come down from that tree alive , unless you do ! " said Frank . " Well , take the d --  -- d thing then ! " growled the man . And unclasping one arm from the tree , while he held on with the other and his two legs , he slipped the belt over his head , and dropped the gun to the ground . " If it had been good for any thing , I reckon you would n't be here now , bothering me ! " he added , significantly . " No doubt ! " said Frank . " You are brave fellows , to shoot out of trees at men carrying off the wounded . Wait ! I 'm not quite ready for you yet . " And he stood under the tree , with his musket pointed upwards , ready cocked , and with the point of the bayonet in rather ticklish proximity to the most exposed and prominent part of the rebel 's person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all day ? " growled the desperate climber . " You 'll stick there till you throw me down your revolver , " Frank resolutely informed him . " How do you know I 've got a revolver ? " " I saw your hand make a motion at your pocket . You thought you 'd try a shot at me . But you saw at the very next motion you 'd be a dead man ! " " You mean to say you 'd blow my brains out ? " " Yes , if your brains are where my gun is aimed , as I think the brains of rebels must be , or they never would have seceded . " Frank 's gun , by the way , was aimed at the above mentioned very exposed and prominent part . " Grayback " grinned and growled . " Come , my young joker , I ca n't stand this ! " " You 'll have to stand it till you throw down that revolver ! " " I 'm slipping ! " " Then I 'll give you something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had really betrayed himself by making the involuntary movement towards his breast-pocket , which Frank had been too shrewd not to notice . The cocked gun , and bayonet , and resolute young face below , were inexorable . So he yielded . " Do n't throw it towards me ! Drop it the other side ! " cried the wary Frank . The revolver was tossed down . Then Frank stepped back , and let the man descend from his uncomfortable position . " Boy ! " said the man , as soon as his feet were safe on the ground , and he could turn to look at his captor , " I reckon you 're a cute ' un ! A Yankee , ai n't ye ? " " Yes , and proud to own it ! " said Frank . " Keep your distance ! " as the man made a move to come nearer --  " and do n't you stoop to touch that gun ! " " Look here , " said the man , coaxingly , " you 'd better let me go ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any body . I 'll give ye ten dollars if you will . " " In confederate shinplasters ? " The rebel laughed . " No , in Uncle Sam 's gold . " " You do n't place a very high value on yourself , " said Frank . " You are too modest . " " Twenty dollars ! "  - -  jingling the money in his pocket . " Come , I 'm a gentleman at home , and I do n't want to go north . Well , say thirty dollars . " " If you had n't said you were a gentleman , I might trade , " said Frank . " But a gentleman is worth more than you bid . You would n't insult a negro by offering that for him ! " " Fifty dollars , then ! I see you are sharp at a bargain . And you shall keep that revolver . " " I intend to keep this , any way , " said Frank , picking it up . " And the gun that shot at me , too , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his determination , rose in his bids at once to a hundred dollars . " Not for a hundred thousand ! " said Frank , who was now ready to move his prisoner . " You are going the way my bayonet points , and no other . March ! " The rebel marched accordingly . Frank followed at a distance of two or three paces , prepared at any moment to use prompt measures in case his prisoner should attempt to turn upon him or make his escape . " How many of you fellows are hid around in these trees ? " said Frank . " Not many just around here -- lucky for you ! " muttered the disconsolate rebel . " Is that your favorite way of fighting ? " " People fight any way they can when their soil is invaded . " " What are holes cut in the pine trees for ,  - -  foot- holds for climbing ? " " Holes ? them 's turpentine boxes ! " said the man , in some surprise at Frank 's ignorance . " Did n't you ever see turpentine boxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the way you get turpentine ? " " That 's the way we get turpentine . The sap begins to run and fill the boxes along in March , and when they are full we dip it out with ladles made on purpose , and put it into barrels . " " O , you need n't stop to explain ! " cried Frank . " Push ahead ! " And the rebel pushed ahead . It was a moment of unspeakable satisfaction to the drummer boy when he had brought his prisoner through all the difficulties of the way to the road . There he had him safe . He was now in the midst of shocking and terrible scenes , but he heeded them not as much as he would have heeded the smallest accident to a fellow-creature a few hours before . Already he seemed familiar with battles and all their horrors . Men were hurrying by with medical stores . The wounded were passing , on stretchers , or in the arms of their friends , or limping painfully , ghastly , bleeding , but heroic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One poor fellow had had his arm torn off by a cannon ball : the flesh hung in strings . Some lay by the roadside , faint from the loss of blood . And all the time the deadly , deafening tumult of the battle went on . To guard his prisoner securely was Frank 's first thought . But greater , more absorbing even than that , was the wild wish to see the enemies of his country defeated , and to share in the glorious victory . " Frank Manly ! what sort of a beast have you got there ? " cried a soldier , returning from the action with a slight wound . Frank recognized a member of another company in the same regiment to which he belonged . " I 've got a sharpshooter that I 've taken prisoner . " And he briefly related his adventure , every word of which the rebel , who rather admired his youthful captor , voluntarily confirmed . " It 's just as he tells you , " he said , assuming a candid , reckless air . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are equal to your boys , I shall have plenty of company before night . " " You think we shall have you all prisoners ? " inquired Frank , eagerly . " This island , " replied the rebel , " is a perfect trap . I 've known it from the beginning . You outnumber us two to one , and if the fight goes against us , we 've no possible chance of escape . We 've five thousand men on the island , and if we 're whipped you 'll make a pretty respectable bag . But you never can conquer us , "  - -  he hastened to add , fearing lest he was conceding too much . " Ca n't , eh ? " laughed Frank . " Where 's the last ditch ? " " Never mind about that , " said the prisoner , with a peculiar grin . By this time several other stragglers had gathered around them , eager to hear the story of the drummer boy 's exploit . The rebel had looked curiously at his youthful captor ever since he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ :  --  " Have you got a brother in the confederate army ? " Frank changed color . " Why do you ask that ? " " Because we have a Captain Manly , from the north somewhere , who looks enough like you to be a pretty near relation . " Frank trembled with interest as he inquired , " What is his given name ? " " Captain -- Captain George Manly , I 'm pretty sure . " " Yes , sir , "  - -  and sorry tears came into Frank 's eyes as he spoke ,  --  " I suppose I must own he is my brother . " " Well , you 've a smart chance of meeting him , I reckon , if , as I said , your men are equal to your boys . For he 's fighting against you to-day , and he 's one of the pluckiest , and he wo n't run . " XXX . THE BOYS MEET AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE . Frank was anxious to inquire further concerning his apostate brother ; but at this moment one of Foster 's aids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did you find that fellow ? " The story was quickly told . " Well , " said the officer , " you 've taken the first prisoner to-day . " He then turned to question the captive , who seemed inclined to talk freely about the position and force of the confederates . " I 'll take this fellow in charge , " he said , perceiving that it was in his power to give valuable information . " Come , too , if you like . " " I thank you ; I want to join my company , " said Frank . " You 'd rather do that than come and see the general ? " " I can see him any time when he wants me , but we do n't have a fight every day , sir . " " Well , he shall hear of you . Can I do any thing for you ? " " If you please , you may take this gun that I have captured ; one is enough for me . " The officer took it , saying , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy , and as modest as he is brave ! " In the mean time Frank 's comrades in the fight were cutting their way through a thick swampy jungle in the direction of the enemy 's left flank . Relieved of his prisoner , his ardor inflamed rather than quenched by the evil tidings he had heard of his brother , he followed in their track , passing directly across the fire of the battery . The hurricane of destruction swept howling over him . The atmosphere was thick with smoke . Grape-shot whizzed through the bushes . The scream of rifled shot seemed to fill the very air with terror and shuddering . Right before him a shell struck a forest tree , shivering limbs and trunk in an instant , as if a bolt from heaven had fallen upon it . He felt that at any moment his tender body too might be torn in pieces ; but he believed God 's arm was about him , and that he would be preserved . Deep and solemn , happy even , was that conviction . A sense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the boy was aroused . He was not afraid of any thing . He felt ready for any thing , even death , in his country 's service . The mud was deep , and savage the entanglement of bushes on every side . But the troops , breaking through , had made the way comparatively easy to follow , and Frank soon overtook the regiment . Great was Captain Edney 's surprise at sight of him , with a gun in his hand and with the glow of youthful heroism in his face . " What are you here for ? " " To beg permission to take Winch 's place in the ranks . " " Your place is with the ambulance corps . " " I got excused from that , sir . I am not strong enough to carry heavy men through the swamps , " said Frank , with a smile . " But strong enough to take a man 's place in the ranks ! " said Captain Edney . " I would like to have you try me , sir . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he gave so many words and such serious thought at a time of action and peril . Perhaps he had heard of Winch 's pusillanimity , and understood the spirit which prompted Frank to fill his place . Certain it is he saw in the lad 's eye the guarantee that , if permitted , he would give no cowardly account of himself that day . So , reluctantly , dreading lest evil might happen to him , he granted his request ; and with a thrill of joy , Frank sprang to Atwater 's side . " I 'm here , old Abe ! " " I 'm glad -- and sorry ! " said Abe . The company had halted , awaiting the movement of the troops in front . " We are getting into a splendid position ! " said Gray , who had passed through the undergrowth to reconnoitre . " We 're fairly on their flank , and not discovered yet ! " " How far did you go ? " asked Captain Edney . " To the clearing , which is just there where the woods look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blazing away , and rebels in the woods supporting it . They 're too busy to notice us . " " We 're discovered , though ! " said Captain Edney as a bullet came chipping its way among the twigs above them . " The sharpshooters are after us ! " said Gray , gayly . " And now we 're after them ! " The order was given to advance . The men dashed forward through the bushes . They soon made the clearing , and marching along its edge , opened fire by file upon the battery and the rebels in the woods . " You do well , Frank ! " said Atwater , seeing his young companion coolly loading and firing at his side . " It 's a perfect surprise to them ! they did n't think we could do it ! " cried Gray , elated . " Lively , boys ! lively . " The firing , regular at first , running along the line from right to left , soon became a continual rattling , each man loading at will , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There ! I popped you over , you sneaking rebel ! " cried Seth Tucket , watching the effect of his shot . " Take the fellow next to him there , Harris ! behind that stump ! " " Let him put up his head a little higher ! " said Harris , taking aim . He fired . The rebel dropped , not behind the stump , but beside it . " You 've saved him ! " shouted Tucket . " That 'll pay for Ellis and Jack Winch ! " The fire of the enemy in the woods was soon concentrated on Captain Edney 's company , which happened to be most exposed . " Fire and load lying ! " rang the captain 's voice through the din . Frank saw those next him throw themselves down behind a fallen tree . He did the same . The trunk presented an excellent rest for his musket , and he fired across it . But when he came to load , he found difficulty . He had been exercised in the manual of arms , yet the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond his practice . Give him time , and he could do it . But he felt that time was precious , and that every shot told . He glanced at Atwater , resting on his left side as he brought his gun back after discharging it ; taking out his cartridge ; then turning on his back , holding the piece with both hands and placing the butt between his feet ; and in that position , with the barrel over his breast , charging cartridge , drawing rammer , and so forth . All which the tall soldier performed scientifically and quickly . Yet Frank saw that it took even him much longer to load lying than standing . What , then , could he hope to do ? What he did was this . He deliberately got upon his feet , and with the balls singing around him , proceeded unconcernedly with his loading . " Down ! " called Atwater to him ; " down ! You 're making a target of yourself ! " Frank resolutely went on with his loading . " Down , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frank shouted back ,  --  " I ca n't load unless I stand up , sir ! " " Never mind that ! Down ! " repeated his captain , peremptorily . " I 've got my cartridge down , any way , " said Frank , triumphantly , dropping again behind the log . " Why do n't you obey orders ? " cried Gray . " The orders were to load and fire , and I was bound to obey them before any others ! " said Frank , preparing to prime . Just then Atwater , who was again on his back , suddenly dropped his piece , which fell across his left arm , and brought his right hand to his breast . The movement was so abrupt and unusual it attracted Frank 's attention . " Are you hit , Abe ? " And in an instant he saw the answer to his hurried question in a gush of blood which crimsoned the poor , brave fellow 's breast . " It has come ! " said Atwater . " How could it -- and you lying down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know -- never mind me ! " replied Abe , faintly . Then Frank remembered the mysterious shots aimed at him and Sinjin in the woods , and the subsequent solution of the mystery . He looked up -- all around -- overhead . " What 's the trouble , Manly ? " screamed Tucket . " What do you see ? " " There ! " Frank shouted , pointing upwards ; " there ! the man that killed Atwater ! " And in the branches of a tree , which stood but a few paces in front of them , he showed , half hidden by the thick masses , the figure of a rebel . The sharpshooter was loading his piece . Frank saw the movement , and would have hastened to avenge the death of his friend before the assassin could fire again . But he was out of caps , and must borrow . Tucket 's gun was ready . " ' Die thou shalt , gray-headed ruffian ! ' " Seth shouted the words up at the man in the tree , and lying on his back , brought the butt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fired . Scarce had flame shot from the muzzle , when down came the rebel 's gun tumbling to the ground ; pursued out of the tree by something that resembled a huge bird , with spread wings , swooping down terribly , and striking the ground with a jar heard even amid the thunder of battle . It was the rebel himself . " ' Rattling , crashing , thrashing , thunder down ! ' " screamed Seth Tucket , his ruling passion , poetry , strong even in battle . The man , pitching forwards in his fearful somerset , had fallen within a few feet of Frank . The boy recovering from his astonishment at the awful sight , felt a strange curiosity to see if he was dead . He looked over the log . There lay the wretch , a hideous heap , the face of him upturned and recognizable . Where had Frank seen that grim countenance , that short , stiff , iron-gray hair ? Somewhere , surely . He looked again , trying to fix his memory . " I swan to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seth was right . It was the Maryland secessionist whose turkeys the boys had stolen , and who , in consequence , had made haste to avenge his wrongs by joining the confederate army . A strange , sickening sensation came over Frank at the discovery . Thus the evil he had done followed him . But for that wild freak of plundering the poor man 's poultry-yard , he might be plodding now on his Maryland farm , and Atwater would not be lying there so white and still with a bullet in his breast . XXXI . " VICTORY OR DEATH . " Where all this time was the old drum-major ? He too had disappeared from the ambulance corps to assume , like Frank , a position of still more arduous service and greater danger . Shortly after Frank left him , word came that the battery of boat-howitzers , which , from a curve in the road that commanded the rebel works , had been doing splendid execution , was suffering terribly , and getting short of hands . It must soon withdraw unless reinforced . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old man had been familiar with artillery practice . At the thought of the service and the peril his spirit grew proud within him . But his heart yearned for Frank . " Where is Manly ? " he inquired of Ellis . " I believe he has gone into the fight with our company , " said the wounded volunteer . The truth flashed upon the veteran . Yes , the boy he loved had gone before him into danger . He no longer hesitated , or lost any time in getting leave to report himself to the commander of the battery . " What can you do ? " was the hurried question put to him , as he stood in the thick powder-smoke , calmly asking for work . Just then , a gunner was taken off his feet by a cannon-ball . " I can take this fellow 's place , sir , " said the old man , grimly . " Take it ! " replied the officer . The wounded sailor was borne away , and the old drummer , springing to the howitzer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the battery was ordered to withdraw . During the severest part of the action Mr. Sinjin had observed a person in citizen 's dress , with his coat off , briskly handling the cannon-balls . Their work done , he turned to speak with him . " You are a friend of my young drummer boy , I believe , " said the old man . " Yes , and a friend of all his friends ! " cordially answered the white-sleeved civilian . " You can preach well , and fight well , " said the veteran , his eyes gleaming with stern pride . " I prefer to preach , but I believe in fighting too , when duty points that way , " said Mr. Egglestone , for it was he , flushed and begrimed with his toil at the deadly guns . Even as they were speaking , a cannon-ball passed between them . Mr. Egglestone was thrown back by the shock of the wind it carried , but recovered instantly to find himself unhurt . But where was the old drummer ? He was not there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perceived him , several paces distant , lying on his face by the road . * * * * The howitzers silenced , it was determined to storm the enemy 's works . Frank afterwards had the satisfaction of knowing that it was in part the information gained from the prisoner he had taken that decided the commanding general to order a charge . Frank was with his company , where we left him , when suddenly yells rent the air ; and , looking , he saw the Zouaves of Parke 's brigade dashing down the causeway in front of the rebel redoubt . They were met by a murderous fire . They returned it as they charged . As their comrades fell , they passed over them unheedingly , and still kept on -- a sublime sight to look upon , in their wild Arab costumes , shouting , " Zou ! zou ! " bounding like tigers , clearing obstructions , and sweeping straight to the breastwork with their deadly bayonets . " What is it ? " asked Atwater , faintly . " Victory ! " answered Frank ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's enough ! " And the still pallid face of the soldier smiled . Victory ! None but those who have fought a stern foe to the bloody close , and seen his ranks break and fly , and the charging columns pursue , ranks of bristling steel rushing in through clouds of battle smoke , know what pride and exultation are in that word . Victory ! Reno 's column , that had outflanked the rebels on the west side , fighting valiantly , charged simultaneously with the Zouaves . The whole line followed the example , and went in with colors flying , and shouts of joy filling the welkin which had been shaken so lately with the jar of battle . Over fallen trees , over pits and ditches , through brush , and bog , and water , the conquering hosts poured in ; Frank 's regiment with the rest , and himself among the foremost that planted their standard on the breastwork . There were the abandoned cannon , still warm and smoking . There lay a deserted flag , bearing the Latin inscription " Aut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down in the precipitate flight . " They could n't conquer , and they did n't want to die ; so they split the difference , and run , " observed Seth Tucket . There too lay the dead and dying , whom the boastful enemy had forsaken where they fell . One of these who had not run was an officer -- handsome and young . He was not yet dead . A strange light was in his eyes as he looked on the forms of the foemen thronging around him , saw the faces of the victors , and heard the cheering . Success and glory were for them -- for him defeat and death . " Lift me up , " he said , " and let me look at you once . " They raised him to a sitting posture , supported partly by a gun-carriage , and partly by the arms of his conquerors . And they pressed around him , their voices hushed , their triumphant brows saddened with respect for the dying . " Though we have been fighting each other , " he said , solemnly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have done wrong ! I too am a northern man ,  - -  I too --  --  " As he spoke , a figure in the uniform of his foes sprang through the crowd to his feet . " O , my brother ! O , my brother George ! " It was Frank Manly , who knelt , and with passionate grief clasped the hand that had clasped his in fondness and merry sport so often in the happy days of his childhood , when neither ever dreamed of their unnatural separation and this still more unnatural meeting . " Frank ! my little brother ! so grown ! is it you ? " said the wounded captive , with dreamy surprise . " O George ! how could you ? " Frank began , with anguish in his voice . But he checked himself ; he would not reproach his dying brother . " My wife , you know ! " was all the unhappy young man could murmur . He looked at Frank with a faint and ever fainter smile of love , till his eyes grew dim . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now -- but it is too late . Tell mother --  --  " His words became inaudible , and he sank , swooning , in Captain Edney 's arms . " What , George ? what shall I tell mother ? " pleaded Frank , in an agony . " And father too , " said the dying lips , in a moment of reviving recollection . " And my sisters --  --  " But the message was never uttered . " George ! O , George ! I am here ! Do n't you see me ? " The dim eyes opened ; but they saw not . " Carry me up stairs ! Let me die in the old room -- our room , Frank . " It was evident his mind was wandering ; he fancied himself once more at home , and wished to be laid in the little chamber where he used to sleep with Frank , as Frank had slept with Willie in later days . " Kiss me , mother ! " The ashen face smiled ; then the light faded from it ; and the lips , grown cold and numb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " And he slept -- the sleep of eternity . When Frank rose up from the corpse he had mastered himself . Then Captain Edney saw , what none had noticed before , that blood was streaming down his arm -- the same arm that had been grazed before ; this time it had been shot through . " You are wounded ! " " Yes -- but not much . I must go -- let me go and take care of Atwater ! " " But you need taking care of yourself ! " for he was deadly pale . " No , sir -- I -- Abe , there --  --  " Even as the boy was speaking he grew dizzy and fell fainting in his captain 's arms . XXXII . AFTER THE BATTLE . It is over . The battle is ended , the victory won . The sun goes down upon conquerors and conquered , upon the living and the dead . And the evening comes , melancholy . The winds sigh in the pine-tops , the sullen waves dash upon the shore , the gloom of the cypresses lies dismal and dark on Roanoke Island . Buildings suitable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been converted into hospitals , and the wounded are brought in . There is Frank with his bandaged arm , and Ellis with his stump of a hand bound up , and others worse off than they . There is the surgeon of their regiment , active , skilful , kind . There , too , is Mr. Eggleston , the minister , proving his claim to that high title , ministering in the truest sense to all who need him , holding to fevered lips the cup of medicine or soothing drink , and holding to fevered souls the still more precious drink . There is Corporal Gray , assisting to arrange the hospital , and cheering his comrades with an account of the victory . " The rebels ran like herds of deer after we got the battery . We tracked ' em by the traps they threw away . Guns , knapsacks , coats ,  - -  they flung off every thing , and skedaddled for dear life ! We met an old negro woman , who told us where their camp was ; but some of ' em had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the east side of the island . Our boys followed , and found ' em embarking in boats . We fired on ' em , and brought back two of their boats . In one we got Jennings Wise , of the Wise Legion , that we had the bloody fight with flanking the battery . He was wounded and dying . " But our greatest haul was the camp the old negress pointed out The rebels rallied , and as we moved up , fired upon us , doing no damage . We returned the compliment , and dropped eight men . Then more running , of the same chivalrous sort , our boys after them ; when out comes a flag of truce from the camp . " ' What terms will be granted us ? ' says the rebel officer . " ' No terms , but unconditional surrender , ' says General Foster . " ' How long a time will be granted us to consider ? ' " ' Just time enough for you to go to your camp to convey the terms and return . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes . Then we pushed on again . That movement quickened their deliberations ; and out came Colonel Shaw , the commander , and says to General Foster ,  --  " ' I give up my sword , and surrender five thousand men ! ' For he did n't know some two thousand of his force had escaped . What we have got is about three thousand prisoners , and all their forts and quarters , which we call a pretty good bag . " The boys forgot their wounds , they forgot their dead and dying comrades , listening to this recital . But short-lived was the enthusiasm of one , at least . Scarce was Gray gone , when Frank saw four men with a stretcher , bringing upon it a grizzled , pallid old man . " O , Mr. Sinjin ! O , my dear , dear friend ! You too ! " " Is it my boy ? " said the veteran , with a wan smile . " Yes , I too ! They have done for me , I fear . " " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choked his voice . " An impertinent cannon-ball interrupted my conversation with Mr. Egglestone , " said the old man , stifling his agony as the men removed him to a cot . " And took a --  " he groaned in spite of himself --  " a greedy mouthful out of my side -- that 's all . " Frank knew not what to say or what to do , he was so overcome . " There , my boy , " said the old man , to comfort him , " no tears for me ! It is enough to see you again . They told me you were hurt --  " looking at the lad 's disabled arm . " I am glad it is no worse . " And the wan veteran smiled content . Frank , with his one hand , smoothed the pillow under the old gray head , struggling hard to keep back his sobs as he did so . " Who is my neighbor there ? " Mr. Sinjin cheerfully asked . " Atwater , " Frank managed to articulate . " Is it ? I am sorry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through a Bible he carried , then into his breast , beyond the reach of surgery , I am afraid , " Mr. Egglestone answered for Frank . " He lies in a stupor , just alive . " " Poor fellow ! " said Mr. Sinjin , feelingly . " If Death must have one of us , let him for once be considerate , and take me . Atwater is young , just married ,  - -  he needs to live ; but I -- I am not of much account to any body , and can just as well be spared as not . " " O , no , O , no ! " sobbed Frank ; " I ca n't spare you ! I ca n't let you die ! " " My boy , " said the old man , deeply affected , " I would like to tarry a little longer in the world , if only for your sake . You have done so much for me -- so much more than you can ever know ! You have brought back to my old heart more of its youth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thank God for it . I thank you , my dear boy . " With these words still ringing in his ear , Frank was taken away by the thoughtful Mr. Egglestone and compelled to lie down . " You must not agitate the old man , and you need repose yourself , Frank . I fear the effects of all this excitement , together with that wound , on your slender constitution . " " O , my wound is nothing ! " Frank declared . " See that he and Atwater have every thing done for them -- wo n't you , Mr. Egglestone ? " The minister promised , and Frank endeavored to settle his mind to rest . But he could not sleep . Every five minutes he started up to inquire after his friends . Hour after hour passed , and he still remained wakeful as a spirit doomed never to sleep again . His wounded arm pained him ; and he had so many things to think of , his suffering comrades , old Buckley shot out of the tree , his rebel brother , his folks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that dread day . So he thought , and thought ; and prayed silently for the old drummer groaning on his bed of pain ; and pleaded for Atwater lying there , still , with the death-shadow he had foreseen darkening the portal of his body . And Frank longed for his mother , as he grew weary and weak , until at last sleep came in mercy , and dropped her soft , vapory veil over his soul . * * * * The thrilling news of the victory came north by telegraph . Then followed letters from correspondents , giving details of the battle , when , one morning , Helen Manly ran home in a glow of excitement , bringing a damp and crumpled newspaper . " News from Frank ! " she cried , out of breath . In a moment the little family was gathered about her , the parents eager and pale . " Is he living ? Tell me that ! " said Mrs. Manly . " Yes , but he has been wounded , and is in the hospital . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but his wife kept her soul in silence , waiting with compressed white lips to learn more . " In the arm -- not badly . There is a whole half column about him here . For he has made himself famous -- Frank ! our dear , dear Frank ! " And the quick tears flooding the girl 's eyes fell upon the paper . Mrs. Manly snatched the sheet and read , how her boy had distinguished himself ; how he had captured a rebel , and fought gallantly in the ranks , and received a wound without minding it ; and how all who had witnessed his conduct , both officers and men , were praising him ; it was all there -- in the newspaper . " What adds to the romance of this boy 's story , " said the writer in conclusion , " is a circumstance which occurred at the capture of the breastwork . Among the dead and wounded left behind when the enemy took to flight , was a rebel captain , of northern parentage , who came south a few years ago , married a southern belle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in consequence , and lost his life in defence of Roanoke Island . He lived long enough to recognize in the drummer boy his own younger brother , and died in his arms . " Great was the agitation into which the family was thrown by this intelligence . " O that I had the wings of a dove ! " said Mrs. Manly . " For I must go , I must go to my child ! " Pride and joy in his youthful heroism , pain and grief for the other 's tragic end , all was absorbed in the dreadful uncertainty which hung about the welfare of the favorite son ; and she knew that not all the attentions and praises of men could make up to him , there on his sick bed , for the absence of his mother . The family waited , however ,  - -  in what anguish of suspense need not to be told ,  - -  until the next mail brought them letters from Mr. Egglestone and Captain Edney . By these , their worst fears were confirmed . Exposure , fatigue , excitement , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Frank . He was dangerously ill with a fever . " O , dear ! " groaned Mr. Manly , " this wicked , this wicked rebellion ! George is killed , and now Frank ! What can we do ? what can we do , mother ? " he asked , helplessly . While he was groaning , his wife rose up with that energy which so often atoned for the lack of it in him . " I am going to Roanoke Island ! I am going to my child in the hospital ! " That very day she set out . Alone she went , but she was not long without a companion . On the boat to Fortress Monroe she saw a solitary and disconsolate young woman , whose face she was confident of having seen somewhere before . She accosted her , found her going the same journey with herself , and on a similar errand , and learned her history . " My husband , that I was married to at the cars just as his regiment was leaving Boston , has been shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead I do not know . " " Your husband , " said Mrs. Manly ,  --  " my son knows him well . They were close friends ! " And from that moment the mother of Frank and the wife of Atwater were close friends also , supporting and consoling each other on the journey . XXXIII . A FRIEND IN NEED . At Roanoke Island , a certain tall , lank , athletic private had been detailed for fatigue duty at the landing , when the steamer from the inlet arrived . Being at leisure , he was watching with an expression of drollery and inquisitiveness for somebody to tell him the news , when he saw two bewildered , anxious women come ashore , and look about them , as if waiting for assistance . Prompted by his naturally accommodating disposition , and no less by honest curiosity , the soldier stepped up to them . " Ye do n't seem over'n above familiar in these parts , ladies , " he said , with his politest grin . " We are looking for an officer who promised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least in getting news from them , " said the elder of the two ,  - -  a fine-looking , though distressed and careworn woman of forty . " Sho ! wal . I s'pose he 's got other things to look after , like as not ! " And the soldier , in his sympathy , cast his eyes around in search of the officer . " Got friends in the hospital , hev ye ? " Then peering curiously under the bonnet of the young female , " Ai n't you the gal that merried Atwater ? " " O ! do you know him ? Is he -- is he alive ? " By which eager interrogatives he perceived that she was " the gal . " The droll countenance grew solemn . " I ai n't edzac'ly prepared to answer that last question , Miss -- Miss Atwater ! " he said , with some embarrassment . " But the fust I can respond to with right good will . Did I know him ! "  - -  Tears came into his eyes as he added , " Abe Atwater , ma'am , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man do n't at this moment exist ! " " Then you must know my boy , too ! " cried the elder female ,  --  " Frank Manly , drummer . " The soldier brightened at once . " Frank Manly ! ' Whom not to know argues one 's self unknown . ' Your most obedient , ma'am , "  - -  bowing and scraping . " Your son has attracted the attention of the officers , and made himself pop'lar with every body . Mabby ye have n't heerd --  --  " " I 've heard , " interrupted the anxious mother . " But how is he ? Tell me that ! " " Wal , he was a little grain more chirk last night , I was told . He has had a fever , and been delirious , and all that -- perty nigh losing his chance o ' bein ' promoted , he was , one spell ! But now I guess his life 's about as sure 's his commission , which Cap'n Edney says there ai n't no doubt about . " " So young ! " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young , but he 's got what we want in officers -- that is , sperit ; he 's chock full of that . I take some little pride in him myself , " added the private . " We was almost like brothers , me and Frank was ! ' In the desert , in the battle , in the ocean-tempest 's wrath , we stood together , side by side ; one hope was ours , one path ! ' " " This , then , is Seth Tucket ! " exclaimed Mrs. Manly , who knew him by his poetry . " That 's my name , ma'am , at your service ! " And Seth made another tremendous bow . " But I see , " he said , " you 're anxious ; ye want to git to the hospital . I tell ye , Frank 'll be glad to see ye ; he used to rave about you in his delirium ; he would call ' mother ! mother ! ' sometimes half the night . " " Poor child ! poor , dear child ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help me , sir ,  - -  show me the way to him , if nothing more ! " " Hello ! " shouted Seth . " Whose cart is this ? Where 's the driver of this cart ? It 's been standin ' here this hour , and nobody owns it . " He jumped into it . " Who claims this vehicle ? ' Who so base as would not help a woman ? If any , speak ! for him have I offended ! ' Nobody ? Then I take the responsibility -- and the cart too ! Hop in , ladies . Here 's a board for you to set on . I 'll drive ye to the hospital , and bring back the kerridge before Uncle Sam misses it . " The women were only too glad to accept the invitation , and they were soon seated on the board . Seth adjusted his anatomy to the edge of the cart-box , and drove off . But he soon stood up , declaring that a hungry fellow like him could n't stand that board ,  - -  he was too sharp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about Atwater ,  - -  what he had already said of him having gone so heavily to the poor wife 's heart . But she could inquire about the old drum-major , who , she had heard , was wounded . " Old Sinjin ? Wal ! I 'm in jest the same dilemmy consarning him as Atwater . They 've both been sick and at the pint of death ever sence the fight . Now one of ' em 's dead , and t'other 's alive . A chap that was at the hospital told me this morning , ' One of them sickest fellers in your regiment died last night , " says he ; ' I do n't know which of ' em , ' says he . And I have n't had a chance yet to find out . " " O , haste then ! " cried the young wife . " May be my husband is living still ! " " Should n't wonder the least might if he is , " said Seth , willing to encourage her . " For he has hung on to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he could n't bear the idee of dying before he could see you once more . Old Buckley 's bullet has been found , you 'll be pleased to know . " " Old Buckley ? Who is old Buckley ? " " The Maryland secessionist that shot your husband , and that I brought down from the tree to pay for it . He never 'll git into another tree , without his soul goes into a gobble-turkey , as I should think it might , and flies up in one to roost ! " " And the bullet !  - -   - -   " " As I was going to tell ye , it 's been found . It went through the Bible that you gave him ( and that Frank 's preserving for you now , I believe ) , and lodged in his body , the doctor could n't tell where . But one night Mr. Egglestone ,  - -  the fighting minister , you know , that merried you ,  - -  he was bathing Abe 's back , and what did he find but a bunch , that Abe said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' I 've found the bullet ! ' And , sure enough ! the doctor come and cut out the lead . It had gone clean through the poor feller ,  - -  into his breast , and out under his side !  - -  Hello ! " said Seth , " I shall hev to turn out and wait for that company to march by . I swan to man ef ' tai n't my company , or a part o n't , at least ! They 're drumming out a coward , to the tune of the Rogue 's March ! " The women were all impatience to get on ; and Mrs. Manly felt but the faintest gleam of interest in the procession , until , as it drew near , in a wretched figure , wearing , in place of the regimental uniform , a suit of rags that might have been taken from some contraband , with drummers before and fixed bayonets behind , she recognized -- Jack Winch ! " Wal ! " said Seth , " I 'd ruther go into a fight and be shot dead than go out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' COWARD , ' on his back ? But he deserves it , ef ever a chap did ! " And Seth , as he drove on , related the story of Jack 's miserable boasting and poltroonery . Much as she pitied the wretch , Mrs. Manly could not help remembering his treachery towards her son , and feeling that Frank was now amply avenged . XXXIV . THE HOSPITAL . Let us pass on before , and take a peep into the hospital . There we find Ned Ellis , playing dominoes with one hand , and joking to keep up the spirits of his companions . There lies Frank on his cot , with blanched countenance , eyes closed , and pale lips smiling , as if in dreams . Of his two friends , Atwater and the old drummer , only one , as Seth Tucket said , remains . One was carried out last night -- in a coffin his cold form is laid -- life 's fitful fever is over with him . And the other ? Very still , very pale , stretched on his narrow bed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is it we see in that sculptured , placid face ? Is it life , or is it death ? It 's neither life nor death , but sleep , that dim gulf between . Mr. Egglestone , who has been much about the hospital from the first , enters with a radiant look , and steps lightly to Frank 's side . The drummer boy 's eyes unclose , and smile their welcome . " Better , still better , I am glad to see ! " says the minister , cheerily . " Almost well , " answered Frank , although so weak that he can hardly speak . " I shall be out again in a day or two . The fever has quite left me ; and I was having such a beautiful dream . I thought I was a water-lily , floating on a lake ; and the lake , they told me , was sleep ; and I felt all whiteness and peace ! Was n't it pretty ? " " Pretty , and true too ! " said the minister , with a suffusing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy , and thought how much like a white fragrant lily he was . " I have news for you , Frank . The steamer has arrived . " " O ! and letters ? " " Probably , though I have none yet . But something besides letters ! "  - -  Mr . Egglestone whispered confidentially , " Atwater 's wife is here ! " " Is she ? Brave girl !  - -  O , dear ! " said Frank , his features changing suddenly , " why did n't my mother come too ! She might , I think ! It seems as if I could n't wait , as if I could n't live , till I see her ! " " Well , Frank , " then said the minister , having thus prepared him , " your mother did think -- your mother is here ! " At the moment , Mrs. Manly , who could be no longer restrained , flew to the bedside of her son . He started up with a wild cry ; she caught him in her arms ; they clung and kissed and cried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child ! my darling child ! " were the only words that could be heard in that smothering embrace . Mr. Egglestone turned , and took the hand of her companion , who had entered with her , and led her to the cot where lay the still figure and placid , sculptured face . O woman , be strong ! O wife , be calm ! keep back the tears , stifle the anguish , of that heaving breast . She is strong , she is calm , tears and anguish are repressed . She bends over the scarcely breathing form , gazes into the utterly pallid face , and with clasped hands in silence blesses him , prays for him -- her husband . For this is he -- Abe Atwater , the shadow of death he foresaw still darkening the portal of his body , as if hesitating to enter , nor yet willing to pass by . And the face in the coffin outside there is the face of the old drummer , whose soul , let us hope , is at peace . One was taken -- will the other be left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vision of his wife , and gladness , like a river of soft waters , glides into his soul . O , may it be a river of life to him ! As love has held his spirit back from death , so may its power restore him ; for such things have been ; and there is no medicine for the sick body or sinking soul like the breath and magnetic touch of love . Frank meanwhile was lying on his bed , holding his mother 's hands , and drinking in the joy of her presence . And she was feeding his rapture with the tenderest motherly words and looks , and telling him of home . " But how selfish I am ! " said Frank , " How little you could afford to leave , and come here ! I thought I was going to be a help to you , and , the best I can do , I am only a trouble and a hindrance ! " " I could not stop an instant to think of trouble or expense when my darling was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel that God will take care of us ; if we are his children , he will provide for all our wants . Will he not , Mr. Egglestone ? " " When I have read to you this paper , " replied the minister , " then you can be the judge . I was requested to read it to Frank as soon as he was able to hear it -- after his friend 's death . " " Is it something for me ? Poor old Mr. Sinjin ! " exclaimed Frank . " He died last night , mother . But he was so happy , and so willing to go , I ca n't mourn for him . What is the paper ? " " A few nights ago he requested me to come to his side and write as he should dictate . " And the clergyman , seating himself , read :  --  " ' The Last Will and Testament of Servetus St. John , commonly called Old Sinjin . " I , Servetus St. John , Drummer , being of sound mind , but of body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in battle for my country , do give and bequeath of my possessions as follows :  --  " ' Item . My Soul I return to the Maker who gave it , and my Flesh to the dust whence it came . " ' Item . To my Country and the Cause of Freedom , as I have given my last poor services , so I likewise give cheerfully my Life . " ' Item . To Mehitabel Craig , my only surviving sister after the flesh , I give what alone she can claim of me , and what , as a dying sinner , I have no right to withhold , my full pardon for all offences . " ' Item . To my present friend and comforter , Mr. Egglestone , as a memento of my deep obligations to him , I give my watch . " ' Item . To my fellow-sufferer , Abram Atwater , or to his widow , in case of his decease , I bequeath the sum of one hundred dollars . " ' Item . To my fellow-sufferer and dearly beloved pupil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affection , a miniature which will be found after my death . " ' Item . To the same Frank Manly I also give and bequeath the residue of all my worldly possessions , to wit :  --  ' " Then followed an enumeration of certain stocks and deposits , amounting to the sum of three thousand dollars . The will was duly witnessed , and Mr. Egglestone was the appointed executor . Frank was silent ; he was crying , with his hands over his face . " So you see , my young friend , " said Mr. Egglestone , " you have , for your own comfort , and for the benefit of your good parents , a snug little fortune , which you will come into possession of in due time . As for the miniature , I may as well hand it to you now . I found it after the old man 's death . He always wore it on his heart . " He took it from its little soiled buckskin sheath , and gave it to Mrs. Manly . She turned pale as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , and , almost reluctantly , she placed it in his hands . It might almost have passed for a portrait of himself , only it was that of a girl ; and he knew at once that it was his mother , as she had looked at his age . While he was gazing at the singular memento of the old man 's romantic and undying attachment , Mrs. Manly looked away , with the air of one resolutely turning her mind from one painful subject to another . " I wish to ask you , Mr. Egglestone , what disposition has been made of -- I had another son , you know . " He understood her . " I trust , " said he , " that what Captain Edney and myself thought proper to do will meet your approval . After the battle , the wife of Captain Manly sent a request to have his body forwarded to her by a flag of truce . We consulted Frank , who told us to do as we pleased about it . Accordingly , we obtained permission to grant her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her . " There was for a moment a look , as of one who felt bitter wrong , on Mrs. Manly 's face ; but it passed . " You did well , Mr. Egglestone . To her who had got the soul belonged the body also . May peace go with it to her desolated home ! " " Mother ! " whispered Frank , gazing still at the miniature , " tell me ! am I right ? do I know now why it was the dear old man thought so much of me ? " " If you have not guessed , my child . I will tell you . Years ago , when I was the little girl you see there , he was good enough to think I was good enough to marry him . That is all . " Frank said no more , but laid the picture on his heart , for it was his , and the dearest part of the dear old man 's legacy . XXXV . CONCLUSION . After a long delay Captain Edney came ; apologizing for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his old schoolmistress before . His excuse was valid : one of his men , S. Tucket by name , had got into a scrape by running off with one of Uncle Sam 's carts , and he had been to help him out of it . He found a new light shining in the hospital -- the light of woman 's influence ; the light of life to Frank and his friend Atwater , nor to them only , but to all upon whom it shone . Mrs. Manly remained in the hospital until her son was able to travel , when leave of absence was granted him , and all his friends crowded to bid him farewell , as he departed in the boat with his mother for the north -- for home ! Of his journey , of his happy arrival , the greetings from father , sister , little brother , friends -- of all this I would gladly write a chapter or two ; but he is no longer the Drummer Boy now , and so our business with him is over . And so he left the service ? Not he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " he declared to all those who came to shake him by the hand and hear his story from his own lips . His wound was soon healed , and he hastened to return to his regiment ; for he was eager to be learning everything belonging to the profession of a soldier . It was not long , however , before he came north again -- this time on surprising business . Captain Edney , who had won the rank of Colonel at the battle of Newbern , had been sent home to raise a regiment ; and he had been permitted to choose from his own company such persons as he thought best fitted to assist him , and hold commissions under him . He chose Gray , Seth Tucket , and Frank . Another of our friends afterwards joined the regiment , with the rank of First Lieutenant ; having quite recovered from his wound , under the tender nursing of his wife . With his friends Edney , Gray , Tucket , and Atwater , Frank was as happy as ever a young officer in a new service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But here our story must end ; for to relate how he has fought his way up , step by step , to a rank which was never more fairly earned , would require a separate volume ,  - -  materials for which we may possibly find some day in his own letters to his mother , and in those of Colonel Edney to his sister Helen . * * * * Some extracts from a letter just received from the hero of these pages may perhaps interest the reader . " I can not tell you , sir , how much astonished I was on opening the package you sent me . I do n't think the mysterious bundle that contained the watch dear old ' Mr. St. John ' gave me surprised me half as much . I had never seen any proof-sheets before , and hardly knew what to make of them at first . Then you should have heard me scream at Gray and Atwater . ' Boys , ' says I , ' here 's a story founded on our adventures ! ' I sat up all that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to blush a good many times before I got through . I see you have not called any of us by our real names ; but I soon found out who ' Abe , ' and ' Seth , ' and ' Jack Winch , ' and all the other characters are meant for . I have read ever so many pages to ' Seth ' himself , and he has laughed as heartily as any of us over his own oddities . We all wonder how you could have written the story , giving all the circumstances , and even the conversations that took place , so correctly ; but I remember , when I was at your house , you kept me talking , and wrote down nearly every thing I said ; besides which , I find there was a good deal more in my journal and letters than I supposed , when I consented to let you have them and make what use of them you pleased . Little did I think then , that ever such a book as the ' Drummer Boy ' could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point out any important errors I may notice , in order that you may correct them before the book is published . Well , the night the row was in camp , when the ' Blues ' cut down the captain 's tent , the company was ordered out , and the roll called , and three other fellows put under guard , before Abe and I were let off . I might mention two or three similar mistakes , but I consider them too trifling to speak of . There are , besides , two or three omissions , which struck me in reading the wind-up of the story . ' Jack Winch ' went home , and died of a fever within a month . If it is n't too late , I wish you would put that in ; for I think it shows that those who think most of saving their lives are sometimes the first to lose them . " You might add , too , that ' Mr. Egglestone ' is now the chaplain of our regiment . We all love him , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have put the ' Drummer Boy ' into his hands , and I just saw him laughing over it . If every body reads it with the interest we do here in camp , it will be a great success . " There is another thing -- but this you need not put into the book . With the money my dear old friend and master left me , I have bought the house our folks live in , so that , whatever happens to me , they will never be without a home .... " In conclusion , let me say that , while you have told some things of me I would rather every body should forget , you have , on the whole , given me a much better character than I deserve . " We are already beginning to call each other by the names you have given us , and I take great pleasure in subscribing myself , " Yours , truly , " FRANK MANLY.
