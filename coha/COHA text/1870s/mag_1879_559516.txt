IS POLITICAL ECONOMY A SCIENCE ? PROFESSOR PERRY , of Williams College , has recently published a new edition of his " Elements of Political Economy . " It is an important and valuable book that commends itself strongly to all who take an interest in economical studies . The Professor is a man of marked ability . He possesses great natural sagacity , considerable power of analysis , an exce&amp;ingly fresh and racy style , a wide range of observation , and large familiarity with the writings of economists . He leaves upon his readers the impression of great honesty of thought , which lands him at times in ingenuous but uncomfortable explanations , when reflection , as it proceeds , brings on collision with adopted theories . These are qualities of great value in the misty region of Political Economy , and they enable him to teach with large power and success . As might have been expected from such endowments , Professor Perry has made important contributions to the explanation of the matters of which Political Economy treats . He dives down into the reality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and generally stays there . His words and thoughts are , for the most part , those of the daily life of men . He is singularly free from jargon , and , though a strenuous asserter of the scientific character of Political Economy , his analyses and illustrations are felt to flow from the ideas and the talk of the common world . They are followed with ease , and their power of instructing is proportionate . It is not the object of this article to review Professor Perry 's work in detail . It is already widely known in the United States , and is winning steadily increased circulation in England . The following remarks have a much more limited aim . They seek rather to discuss some points , few but of extreme significance , on which criticism , and if need be dissent , may be reasonably expressed . // The very eminence of Professor Perry warrants , indeed calls for , such a proceeding from those who are animated with the same love of truth , and may happen to believe that accuracy of view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself is the real nature of Political Economy . Is it a science ' ? This is no idle intellectual problem fit for dialecticians to debate , but concerning little the great mass of mankind . On the contrary , it is scarcely possible at the present moment to raise an inquiry about Political Economy of more vital , more intensely practical importance . It affects in the most direct manner the worth of Political Economy for the world . The interest of the question does not lie in determining whether it is not , in some form or other , a science , but in ascertaining whether the mode of investigation and teaching adopted by its expounders enforces or injures its value for the happiness of mankind . Political Economy has reached what may be called an epoch in its history . It professes to prescribe lines of conduct which bear directly on the welfare of human beings . Its teachers for now a long series of years have discussed what is the right policy to pursue in the production and distribution of wealth , and have done good service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highest benefits on society . They have fought against the never-ceasing flood of false theory with which the selfishness of private interest and the want of reflection of the multitude deluge economical legislation and practice . At no former period have greater issues agitated trade and public feeling than those which are being wrangled over on every side . The very essence of Political Economy , its inmost and most vital problems - free trade , money , the relations between workingmen and their employers , the social structure which the welfare of the people demands-are subjected to the most passionate controversy . But here a very painful fact reveals itself to the intelligent observer . The battle is not fought with the language of Political Economy . The subjects are hers . The truths they contain have been proclaimed by a long line of able and ardent writers . The line of action they insist upon as true is the very object of the strife . Nevertheless the combatants do not object to Political Economy , to its writers or their books . They do not , as in matters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expositors , and demand submission in the name of demonstrated truth . The sick man calls in his doctor , the steel-maker accepts without reserve the knowledge of the chemist , but who brings down on his oppo // nents the assertions of economical writers ? who in the fierce struggle of capital and labor , amid depressed trade and starving populations , dreams of sending for an economical man of science ? We have not to seek far to discover the cause of this strange fact . It is to be found in the scientific treatment which its cxpounders have given to Political Economy . They speedily abandoned the method of Adam Smith , who treated economical questions as events of every-day life , to be discussed in the language of the common world . The scientific ambition fell upon economic writers : they determined to raise their pursuit to the dignity of a science . They sprang up in profuse abundance . The intellectual distinctions of science-elaborate and precise definitions , though of matters familiarly known in practical life , keen researches of the sharp dialectical distinctions , common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and artificial limbs , critical inquiries into points of no real importance , and the ordinary industrial and commercial life of the community converted into an arena of philosophical discussion . Then followed the necessary consequence of such a mode of treatment , which was the greatest calamity of all . The language of every-day life was cast aside , and that of intellectual casuistry put in its place . Merchants , traders , and artisans found matters which occupied their conversation every hour wrapped up in language new , hard , and unfamiliar , and this , be it carefully observed , on matters which they felt no want of good and expressive words to discuss . Had they been in search of astronomical or geological information , unusual language would have seemed natural ; they would have had the feeling of their own ignorance and of the abstruse nature of the subjects . But to hear buying and selling-whether our iron manufacturers should be allowed to disappear and their laborers thrown out of employment for want of protection-whether pieces of paper could make a nation richeror whether by striking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear all this talked of in hard words and scientific formulas , could only repel them from listening . They called it jargon . Can any one after this be surprised that a scientific economist is the one person whom every one turned away from on questions of supreme economical importance ? Still , it will be said , If Political Economy is in truth a science , it must be handled and developed as a science . Thus the question recurs , Is it a science ? Professor Perry vehemently asserts that it is . The very first sentence of his book opens with a definition of // Political Economy as a science . It is , he says , " the science of exchange " - and , not content with a single definition , he adds a second in the same sentence , " or , what means just the same , the science of value . " These are indeed strange words . They paint Political Economy as a figure with two heads . And the value is pronounced to mean the same thing as exchanges . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not exchange , much less exchanges and , notwithstanding this assertion of their identity , we are at the very beginning introduced to two sciences compounded into one . And this is an avowedly rigorous definition of a thorough science . It is little calculated to impress readers that they are dealing with a true science . Value is included in exchanges : it plays a large part in their action . It is a condition of their very existence , but it is not either the act itself of exchange or the things actually exchanged . Professor Perry defines value as " the relation of mutual purchase " ; but the relation which two things or services bear to each other , in the process of purchasing , in the act of exchanging , is not the exchange or purchase itself . To exchange is to give one thing in return for another : value forms no part of this performance . Value , in its first great meaning as a feeling  --  a feeling of esteem or regard for an object , generating a desire for its acquisition - furnishes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the magnitude and quantity of the things exchanged ; but there it stops . The motive for a scientific act can not be the definition of the act itself . It was open to the Professor to define Political Economy as the science of exchange , or the science of value : why he did not single out one of the terms is plain to an attentive reader of his book . In his heart he believes that value constitutes the true scientific element of Political Economy , but he lacked the courage to call it simply the science of value . There was obviously much in Political Economy which could not be included under value . The expression science of exchange did not satisfy him ; it did not wear a sufficiently scientific look : so he took the unlucky course of bringing in value as a synonym of exchanges . Whatever else Political Economy may be , most assuredly it is not the science of value . Professor Perry justly repudiates wealth as the subject of a science . He expresses " the impossibility of using that word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is useless , even in the hands of a scientific logician " such as Mill , for any scientific use . But , if wealth is a crumbling foundation for a superstructure of science , value is infinitely worse . There // is a solid reality in the things designated by wealth ; they can be handled and exchanged . They present massive substances , endowed with great utilities , of known nature and magnitude . But what is more unstable , more changeable , more capricious , than value ? Political Economy deals with the material realities of human lifeand naturally Professor Perry demands precision as the indispensable quality of a scientific definition  --  but what is less precise , less susceptible of positive definition , than value ? The Professor 's book supplies us with abundant and diverse meanings of this slippery word . First , it means " a relation between two things-that is , a proportion , a mathematical ratio , so that we can say that one thing has a proportionate value of five times to another . Then it is a purchasing power-an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exchange for it . In other words , this is plainly equivalent to a power in a thing to excite a desire for its possession and such a power commands a price , or another article to be bartered for it . Thirdly , it is this other article , be it coin or something else , which it can fetch in exchange : that is , it is market-value or price . Fourthly , it is " a result of two corresponding efforts  --  and so can be made larger or smaller , according as either of the two desires in exchange may be the stronger " ; thus giving value the same sense as belongs to the French " valeur " - namely , value is a valuable thing . Is this science ? Is there a separate science of value for all these meanings ? If not , but for one meaning only , then let it be rigidly adhered to , and all the other significations be treated as irregular and calling for dismissal from the body of the science . But how is this possible if value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " a mathematical proportion , and then it is also admitted that it must be regarded as price , or as a power commanding price ? In truth , value has two distinct meanings recognized by Political Economy , and a third universally retained in popular use . The first two have great importance for explaining Political Economy , but neither of them creates it a science . The first , derived from the verb Ivalue , signifies the feeling felt toward a thing , the regard for it or caring for it ; in a word , esteem . This feeling , called value , kindles a desire to acquire or to retain its object . It is the source from which every exchange springs , the force which sets the whole industrial and commercial worlds in motion . The second meaning of the word is market-value , the quantity of other things which it can procure for its owner by being exchanged ; in other words , it is price . Thus , value in its second sense , of what a // commodity or service can fetch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first sense , of the feeling of esteem . The third meaning retained in popular language is contained in the expression that an object has value , is valuable-that is , is able to command a price in the market . What basis does any one of these meanings supply for the construction of a science ? The first is a personal feeling , peculiar to the individual man who feels it , dependent upon his particular character and position , closely bound up with his fancies and caprices , and subject to no general rule whatever . What science can be built up on the fancies of men for pictures , old china , ancient relics , or old books , and the extravagant prices they will give for them ? Look at fashion and its power over value . Will science be ever able to give a rule whereby it shall be learned what dresses selling in May at enormous prices will be given away for trifles in September , because they have become unfashionable ? Will it give us laws whereby it shall be ascertained what streets and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give oracular warnings of changes of taste in populations in their food or dress ? If , too , there is to be a science of value , it must tell us how to measure value , as astronomy has given the world a measure of gravity and of length ; yet all economists are now agreed that such a thing as a measure of value does not exist . Then no certain account can be given of the quantity and intensity of that value which is alleged to be the subject , the creator of a real science . And what is the cause of this capital defect ? That a stable and steady value , a uniform power of commanding other objects in exchange , exists nowhere , for its nature is to be uncertain and in no small degree capricious . Labor was held for a time to possess a constant value in exchange , and so to be able to compare together and measure the quantities which commodities could command of other articles in exchange ; but the value of labor is found to vary at different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of scientific honor ; but , alas ! gold will change its cost of production at the dictation of the mines , and is daily spoken of as falling in respect of commodities . It may , however , be contended that the part which value plays in exchanges contains complicated and influential forces of extreme importance to Political Economy , and calling for elaborate elucidation . Why should not such explanations be regarded as science ? It is true that value , as feeling , asserts itself powerfully in every // exchange , and that to understand its action is a great economical necessity . In this view Professor Perry has performed excellent work . lie has given an admirable analysis of the effect produced by value in exchanging . He has not , indeed , given us the first step . He has not told us , in categorical terms , that value at its origin is a feeling . He has not dwelt on such universal expressions as , I value this picture or this park greatly , and it would take a very large price to induce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second stage - with that desire which value  --  the feeling of esteem-inspires . Then with him we recall six feelings found in every purchasethree on each side . There are two desires credited by the valuefeeling : the desire to obtain th' thing and the desire to obtain money . Next follow two efforts , made under the impulse of the desires-efforts to submit to the necessary sacrifices in parting with the object to be given away . These , of course , may be very small or very heavy . It is a faint effort to part with sixpence to acquire a pencil , but an overwhelming one to sell one 's home to obtain indispensable money . Lastly , there are two satisfactions : each party to the exchange obtains what he desires . Even the debtor who borrows a loan upon oppressive terms would rather have the money than not ; else he would not give his liability in exchange for the money . Professor Perry lays great stress on this liability as strictly scientific ; but is this really so ' ? He must have often heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that fine jewel , but I really doubt whether I can afford it . " The man pauses awhile , desire gathers strength daily , and at last wins the day .. The jewel is bought ; and , the misgiving about cost notwithstanding , the man breaks out into warm utterances of delight . Here are all the six feelings in full play-with the addition of market-value , the price paid for the jewel ; but there is no science . These three successive emotions are every-day occurrences , known to all in their true character : no one dreamed of calling this science till economists stepped in with their panting for scientific treatment . The process carried on in the purchase is of the most ordinary kind ; but an explanation of it in detail is most useful . It is no more science than the processes which an intelligent gardener adopts in transplanting and pruning trees . The most common description of Political Economy paints it as the science of the production and distribution of wealth . We have already seen that wealth is an expression thoroughly vague @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature of what it embraces . Mr. Mill feels the difficulty , and thinks he extricates himself from it by the remark that " every one has a notion sufficiently correct of what is meant by wealth . " Yet Mill marches in the van of those who hold Political Economy to be a science , and resolutely bestow upon it scientific treatment . And who are most harassed by such a treatment ? The educated men , who believe that they are building on a scientific rock and not on sand ; or the mass of mankind , who are the true pupils of Political Economy , and find themselves lauded in scientific jargon ? No wonder that Mr. Mill utters such a confession as to the nature of his subject , finds himself involved in harassing perplexities , and with a desperate effort to escape them adds the proviso that wealth must be embodied in material objects . Punishment soon overtakes him when he has to face the question , Who are productive laborers in presence of the fact that wealth is constantly given in exchange for mere services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have fallen over the edge of his word , wealth ; so he is compelled to refuse the title of productive to laborers who do not alter and shape matter . The great logician falls into the patent absurdity of declaring that every workman concerned in making an organ for the sole purpose of creating sound is a productive laborer ; but the organist , who actually produces the sound by applying his labor and skill to the organ , is unproductive , because forsooth he creates no result made of wood or iron ! It never occurred to him that , if there were no organist , the labor of all his productive workmen would be absolutely wasted and unproductive . At this point Professor Perry has established a truth of great importance . He recognized that there were many services for which wealth was given which could not come under the designation of wealth . In his dislike of the word wealth , he arrives at the distinction that it is services which are bought , or the purchase of material objects , and not the objects themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the labor , the personal efforts made on our behalf , in producing the commodity , or the gratification bestowed by putting us in possession of what we esteem , which are bought and paid for by what we give in exchange . This truth , I believe , covers every exchange . Nevertheless , it is not possible to substitute throughout Political Economy services for material substances . Mankind can not and do not think about services when they buy a horse or a bale of cotton , though , if questioned , they will own that // what they pay for is cost of production . Both words , wealth and service , are needed and must be retained in economical writings , as they are certainly ineffaceable in the language of common life . But Professor Perry has done good work in insisting that service is ultimately the reality rewarded in every exchange . Mr. Macleod supplies us with another definition of Political Economy as a science . " Economics , " he tells us , " is the subject which treats of the exchanges of property @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not a thing , and all exchanges of rights against rights . " * Political Economy not the science of things , but of rights ! If so , then it belongs to the lawyers , and it must be left to them to discuss it . Let it be composed of legal thoughts , and be expressed in legal language . If " all exchanges are not of products against products , but of rights against rights , " then the question on every purchase must be , not the quantity and quality of the goods , but the validity of the title of their owner . Doubtless the idea of property underlies every purchase ; but what buyer at a shop or warehouse dreams of inquiring whether the seller has a good title to his merchandise , or to what seller does it occur to ask how the purchaser came by his money ? Indeed , Mr. Macleod himself finds it hard to be loyal to his definition . Soon after he uttered it he tells us that " production and consumption together constitute exchange . " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own strawberries in his own garden ? and will there be any exchange in the process ? Then he defines " capital to be any economic quantity used for the purpose of profit . " It is difficult indeed to catch the faintest sound of rights in these definitions . There remains one champion more of the doctrine that Political Economy is a science-Mr . Lowe . He describes rather than defines the science . It is the science which Adam Smith created . It has for its subject " the creation , accumulation , distribution , and consumption of wealth " - and something incomparably greater besides . " Adam Smith had the merit , the unique merit , among all men who ever lived in the world , of having founded a deductive and demonstrative science of human actions and conduct . " The science has for its foundation " the absolute supremacy of the desire of wealth , and the aversion from labor , on which the whole science is based . " Hence it admits of that " prediction which is the test of // true science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or politics , or morals , it is impossible to foretell how mankind will act , and therefore on these subjects it is impossible to reason deductively . But once place a man s ear within the ring of pounds , shillings , and pence , and his conduct can be counted on with the greatest nicety . " Wonderful words indeed ! A science " based on the desire for wealth and aversion from labor " ; on the fighting and battling of two directly antagonistic forces , and the issue of such a struggle capable of being " counted on with the greatest nicety ! " The great demonstrator science predicts the issue of the struggle , how men will act with unerring certainty . The ring of pounds , shillings , and pence , always wins ; aversion from labor always loses . And this we learn directly after being told that in war it is impossible to foretell how mankind will act . What is war but a fierce battle between passion or policy and the ring of pounds , shillings , and pence ? What so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accepts labor , effort , taxation , and death , in preference to wealth ? The contradiction is complete . At the very outset , on its very definition , the grand demonstrative science is crushed and vanishes . It can and it can not foretell human conduct at the same instant . In war the ring of the shillings to be lost is distinctly audible , and yet no man can foretell whether he will go to war or not . But that ring predicts human conduct with the utmost nicety . The grand demonstrative science , it is plain , has never been born , and " the unique merit of Adam Smith " is a dream . Life in the present , as in the past , is full of instances , both in individual men and in nations , of the victory of aversion to labor , of laziness , idleness , moral torpor , love of ease , over the stimulating impulses of the desire of wealth ; and the conclusion comes forth inevitably that a science , which has for basis two hostile forces , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to predict that- " men will always do so and so , " is no science at all . Wealth , by itself alone , yields no science , much less wealth chained to a strong enemy , dislike of labor . None of the preceding definitions of the science of Political Economy seems to me capable of maintaining itself . There remains that of the science of exchange . It was that which Archbishop Whately proposed under the name of catallactics . It is hardly a definition ; it is little more than an assertion that Political Economy speaks of exchanges , and that the explanation of exchanges is a science . This leads up to the inquiry , What in reality is the true nature of Politi // cal Economy ? Does it exhibit any true features of a genuine science ? To answer this question one must know what a science is ; and that knowledge is exceedingly difficult to come by . A full , accurate , and accepted definition of science has not yet been produced , but one has been recently framed by Professor Fowler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solution to the problem , and certainly contains the one thing necessary for the explanation of the nature of Political Economy . He defines science as " the filiation of causes through common observation to things beyond . " It traces out cause upon cause in the field of its inquiry , and coi*rdinates them in a systematic series . The first contains just those matters which common observation , ordinary natural sagacity , is able to explore and to explain fully ; and , secondly , other matters which the special intelligence of the scientific faculty can alone investigate . hence , science discovers new facts and laws which would have been invisible to common observation ; and such discoveries are the test of the existence of science . Thus , in geometry , propositions are reached which are new discoveries of truths not only previously unknown , but also entirely due to the appliance of scientific reasoning . In the same way in chemistry , new substances , never thought of before , become realities fully perceived by the scientific eye . The nature and position of Political Economy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Political Economy stops at common observation . Unlike geometry and chemistry , it has no beyond . It does not reveal a single new truth which , in some form or other , was not previously known and acted upon by men possessed of natural sagacity . It examines and takes to pieces common processes which underlie the economical action of all men . It shows what they are , why intelligent men have practiced them as the obviously true and natural course to adopt . It discerns the rules which have governed their action , and it can speak of laws , but so also can the laborer who knows that a vigorous hoeing will greatly enlarge the crop of turnips . If it dwells on the law of supply and demand , as it is perfectly entitled to do , with great advantage to its hearers , it will have nothing really new to say which , without this grand phrase about law , intelligent farmers and merchants have not understood and felt the power of . The greatest truth which it proclaims , the highest service which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade , is only the expanded application of the rule which human nature by its own good sense las established // in every household , the women to do the needlework , the men to lift the weights : every one to do that work for which he or she has a special aptitude . Thus more work , greater results , are accomplished for the same cost of labor . Political Economy points to the vast power of machinery to multiply the enjoyments of mankind . Have the most ordinary men in any age been ignorant of the usefulness of a good tool or of mechanical contrivances for enlarging the productiveness of labor ? Money is reckoned a dark subject , and Political Economy answers at once the question so puzzling for most mortals , how it comes to pass that a sovereign can buy a hat : yet Aristotle , more than two thousand years ago , gave the explanation as derived from the natural practice of all nations . Such is the true nature of Political Economy . It is not a science , but a body of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race has pursued at all times with greater or less efficiency . That such is the essential character of Political Economy may be easily shown by a proof open to all . If a Newton were to explain the law of gravity with its inverse square of the distance to an unlearned hearer , or a Faraday the mysterious power of electricity , or a Tyndall the movement of molecules in the heart of every substance , he might use simple language and utter intelligible statements , but his hearer would understand nothing of the knowledge nor of the proofs on which the teacher 's explanations were founded . But let an intelligent economist , unspoiled by scientific jargon , make like statements in Political Economy , and reason out the evidence on which they were built-his pupil , if only intelligent , will follow him with ease . He will gather up each fact and regularly connect it with its predecessor ; he will understand the argument and feel the force of the logic ; and in almost every department of Political Economy , except such as are , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pronounce a competent opinion whether the arguments advanced are sound . Let any one try this method of teaching , and he will find it hard to retain a belief that Political Economy is a science . The question then instantly arises , If Political Economy only enforces methods already known and practiced for obtaining objects universally familiar , what motive can men have for busying themselves with it ? For two reasons : in the first place , although the instinctive reasonableness of each method is obvious , they all admit of , indeed call for , wide application in practice . They are summoned to govern a vast variety of cases to which , at first sight , they might // seem not to belong . Political Economy renders a great service to humanity when it points out that huge complications of industry and trade , hard to analyze in minute detail , but involving the hap. piness of whole nations , fall under the plain , obvious rules which are found in every household and every village . But there is a second and still stronger reason . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the invasions of false and arbitrary theory as the economical . Powerful forces are brought to bear against the simple , natural processes which Political Economy proclaims but did not invent . Selfishness and , strange to say , its compauioA , philanthropy , conspire together to preach up contempt for common sense . It is the duty of the state , cry endangered manufacturers and workmen , to prevent the busy industries of the country being ruined by the cruel competition of foreigners . Our rivals fight us on unfair terms ; they have so many advantages given them by nature . The state is bound to redress the wrong by duties which will protect the labor of its people , and put them on a fair level with their opponents . Surely , exclaim the philanthropists , common humanity is shocked at the sight of honest and meritorious fellow citizens , men of the same blood with ourselves , thrown out of employment and reduced to destitution . The invasion of foreign goods must be repelled , and our own people be kept alive . Then conies forward Political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a poor-rate to be imposed on the whole people for your support , a tax which will fall , not on the hated foreigner , but on your fellow countrymen ! What right have you to make such a demand ? If it is conceded , why should there be a poor man throughout the land ? Why may he not claim an addition to such a poor-rate to insure him life and respectability ? To the philanthropist replies Political Economy : A little exercise of your common sense would enable you to perceive the blindness into which you have fallen . It does not occur to you that there can be no buying without selling-that trade is nothing else but an exchange of goods of equal value . If your countrymen buy foreign goods , the foreigner absolutely must , directly or indirectly , purchase your goods in turn , for you have nothing else to buy with but what you make . If he will not take your products , trade must necessarily cease . This obvious truth shows you that the workmen who would have made the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must buy from you in exchange for his own . No one will lack employment , and there will be the enor // mous advantage that on both sides , in your country and in that of the foreigner , and with the same labor there will be more wealth produced all round . In each country , since the products of labor from natural and local advantages will be larger , every laborer will be benefited , and the universal gain will be enormous . Such are the two duties which Political Economy has to perform for the welfare of mankind . Its vocation is to unravel the complications of industry and trade , and to apply the suggestions of common sense and natural sagacity to the processes they employ . Still more is it called upon to do battle against theory ; to resist its neverceasing assaults on good sense ; to rescue human life from the preachings of that greatest and most mischievous of all theoriststhe practical man  --  the man who knows . So much for the doctrine that Political Economy is a science . We turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Professor Perry has taken his stand-with much regret and no small surprise be it said-on the economical theory , constructed by Mr. Macleod on the legal expression , incorporeal property . It is a theory , not of the practical but of the scientific man ; but it offends equally against common sense , introducing confusion and much harm into a very important department of Political Economy , banking and banknotes . Incorporeal property is correctly described as consisting of rights or claims . These rights or claims imply debtors and creditors , and then the Professor makes the remark that " what lies between debtors and creditors may be called indifferently credit or debt . " This being so , it is much to be regretted that he did not use the word debt , and not credit , wherever he was able to do so . Credit is a word of many meanings , and unfortunately they are very abstract and hard to define . Debt has one meaning only , an obligation to give or pay something . It is emphatically the word of common life . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owed to him : he never calls what other people owe him his credits . In a debtor and creditor account , where the word credit is perfectly natural , the item debts due is constantly found on the debtor side : the item credits is rarely , indeed , it may be safely said , entered on the creditor side . Since the Professor admits the words to be synonymous , we shall take the liberty of substituting debts for credits wherever it may be necessary to make the change . The definition that " credits or debts are rights not yet realized " is sound and true . // Professor Perry next defines a bank as " an institution for the creation , management , and extinction of credits , " and a banker is declared to be " a dealer in credits . " In these two descriptions we insert debts in the place of credits , for to deal in debts is plain and intelligible : to deal in credits is much the reverse . So worded , to call a banker a dealer in debts is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that be is a dealer in the transfer of debts but the phrase fails in clearly explaining the nature of the banker 's position and action . The best description of him is to call him an intermediate agent or broker , which is the exact position he occupies between his two principals , namely , his depositor , from whom he has received money or its equivalent , and to whom he then owes money , and his borrower , to whom he has transferred this money or its equivalent , and who consequently owes him money . He brings these two principals together , indirectly , indeed , through his intermediate position , but still very really . The thing which the banker deals in and handles , and which corresponds with the corn of the corn-broker , is the power of buying-purchasing power . His business consists wholly in managing this purchasing power . He gets the means of buying from his depositor  --  to a small amount in money , but chiefly in debts expressed on paper , which he collects on behalf of the depositor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the purchasing power . Banking is a mere machine , the nature of which is simple and intelligible , though it is difficult to work . The purchasing power received from the depositor is derived from the fact that he has sold property , and with the proceeds is enabled to buy . The farmer has sold corn , and can buy ; he is paid perhaps in cash , but far more commonly by a check on some bank . He gives that check to his banker to collect . The banker then procures a borrower , nominally of money , actually of a power , drawing a check or bill on the banker . The borrower buys silk , and pays for it with a check on the banker . There are thus two checks in circulation , one from the farmer , a second from the silk-dealer ; these checks meet at the clearing-house and cancel each other in account , and thus the transaction is completed . The corn sold by the farmer enables silk to be bought by the silk-dealer . Corn has been exchanged for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affair . It is the one thing which banking does , and it is identically the same in essence as the action of a sovereign which is just bought with some commodity , and then in turn is exchanged for a pair of shoes . // There would be no change in the real nature of banking if there were no paper instruments , such as checks and bills , but only coin , used in the business . Banking then would take the form of receiving coin from the farmer , and counting out to the borrowing silkdealer . The operation would be identically the same , only a very heavy , cumbrous , and expensive tool would be employed instead of the cheap , portable , and equally effective transfer-machine-paper on account . On this powerful but simple machine  --  a bank-Professor Perry makes the marvelous remark that " a new capital has been created by it , a new purchasing power-something in the world of value additional to what existed before . " Where is there the faintest trace to be seen , in the transferring process of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a new reality , which did not exist before ? The corn remains the same , and so does the silk ; they have passed into the hands of new owners , and that is the whole of the affair . The farmer might have sold the corn for cash and lent that cash straight to the silk-merchant ; there would have been no banking , no one would have talked of a new capital , yet the transaction would have been identically the same as the banking . No doubt the operation has created two debts , one due by the banker , the other by the silk-merchant . But debts are not capital . But , replies Professor Perry , debts are credits , and credits are claims , and claims are rights , and rights are property , of the kind called incorporeal , and all property may be capital . Incorporeal property , thrust into Political Economy by Mr. Macleod , lands the Professor in the assertion that a mere change of ownership , without a particle of change in the commodities owned , creates a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world of value which did not exist before . If so , then let all the capital in England change owners by borrowing , and in a moment the capital of England is doubled ! If Political Economy is capable of such feats , it provides the shortest and quickest road to riches that the most vivid imagination can conceive . Only , after a while , the Professor lets himself down sadly ; for he sums up capital in the old-fashioned way , as " products saved , " and we are dropped back again into material substances , which unfortunately can not be doubled by a swift change of owners . All these pleasant doctrines rest on the proposition laid down by Mr. Macleod , that incorporeal property-that is , rights-is wealth . It may be permitted me to repeat here a passage quoted from me // by Professor Perry " Lines and names in ledgers , checks at the clearing-house , debts due to depositors , debts due to borrowers upon bills , are neither wealth nor capital . They are words and nothing more . Incorporeal property @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summed up , is not wealth ; it is merely a collection of title-deeds , but from which the reality is absent . The corpus is not in those deeds ; but the right to acquire that property , that corpus , even before its possession is obtained , is itself a property . If a title-deed or a mortgage is declared to be actual wealth by Political Economy , then the sooner it is consigned to the waste-basket the better . " * On this passage Professor Perry makes a comment which fills me with the utmost surprise . He asserts that this passage " concedes the whole matter in dispute- ' the right to acquire that property , even before possession is obtained , is itself a property . ' That is all we claim , that rights are property , and that new rights , new property , a new capital , are created by banking . " It is quite true that rights are property , that they are bought and sold daily , that money is given for them ; but that they are a capital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capital , is what no written or spoken words of mine have ever said or suggested , least of all the passage which is here pronounced to contain this , for me , utterly false proposition . Rights are words-nothing else ; but they are endowed with great power , and that power resides in their ability to persuade a court of law to compel the delivery of the things or services claimed . They can be sold ; but , like goods bought on credit , to be paid for at a deferred period , they do not constitute a new class of articles , but only variations as to the day of payment . Accounts in shopkeepers ' books , mortgages on estates , bills , checks , debts , even debts due by bankrupts , titles to landed property , national debts , reversions , capitalized annuities , claims of all kinds , are property , are owned and possess value , and can be exchanged for money ; but it is the possession of words only which has been acquired , but of words rendered valuable by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect . I would ask leave to correct another misapprehension . On page // refers to page 363 of the " Chapters on Practical Political Economy " ; but I can not discover any sign of such a thought on that page . I should indeed feel that I had written " strangely , " if I had said with Mr. Macleod that " where there is no debt there can be no money . " Would a nation which imperatively commanded readymoney payments exclusively be prevented from carrying out its decree by the impossibility it would thereby create of there being any use for money ?
