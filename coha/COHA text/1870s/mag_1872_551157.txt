A COMEDY OF TERRORS . XXVII . IN SPACE . A S the word was given , the balloon . E1.sh ot up into the air , and ascended to a great height . For this was one necessity at this time and in this place , that in effecting an escape from Paris the balloon should shoot up to as great a height as possible , so as to be out of the reach of Prussian bullets . By day , of course , this would be very difficult ; but by night , even amid moonlight , it did not require any very extraordinary elevation to render a balloon indistinct or even invisible , and the height of a mile was considered sufficient . Grimes was looking over the side of the balloon when he had seen the cab coming , and had called out in answer to Nadar . The first thing that he was conscious of after this was the astonishing movement of the firm-set earth from beneath him . The crowd in the place below fell away from him , leaving him poised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had made to familiarize himself with the practical details of aerostation , there was an inevitable novelty connected with his present position , which fairly made his brain whirl , and his stout frame tingle through every fibre . His sensations were like those which Phaeton may have had when he had traversed the first few furlongs of his aerial way , or like those which some adventurous yet inexperienced driver of a four-in-hand may have when he finds that his team is hounding away from his control . So Grimes folded his arms , knit his brows , set his teeth , drew a long breath , and then looked up . Overhead was a net*vork of rigging , the strands holding the car to that buoyant mass which raised it in the air , while beyond this was a great globe , black and shadowy , whose capacious dimensions seemed enlarged tremendously , shutting out the whole sky . He now lobked into the car , and turned his attention to those duties that immediately demanded his care . Inside this car there were bags of ballast , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balloon that left the besieged city . There was also a lacquered tin box with the name of Grimes painted on it , - a box of no particular weight , but which showed , from the care with which Grimes handled it , that it certainly possessed in his estimation a very particular value . All this time the lady had not moved . Grimes had placed her in a sitting posture at the bottom of the car , with her back against the seat , and had hastily flung over her head one of the shawls which M. Nadar had put in the balloon . The moon was shining , but it was low down in the sky , so that the inside of the car was in shadow , and the lady was but faintly visible . The shawl also that had been thrown over her concealed her face and outline . Grimes , in turning to consider his duties , thought first of all of her , and , stooping over her , he felt her hands and her pulse . She was still senseless , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the recent feeling of awe that had come over him as he first bounded into space gave way to a tender and all-engrossing care for the safety and recovery of the loved one . With gentle hands he drew hack the shawl a little from her face . That face was concealed by the shadow of the side of the car , and by the deeper shadow of the overhanging shawl , so that the loved features were not very distinctly revealed . Grimes held his cheek close to her lips , but no breathing , however faint , was perceptible . He began to feel a stronger and deeper care , and to regret that he had left // 599 Paris without first having her restored to sense . He sighed heavily , and then kissed with infinite tenderness the unconscious being who was so dear to him . Then he dre*v the shawl once more over the face , so as to protect her from the night air , an dbeganto rub and chafe the hands . At this work he continued for what seemed to him a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he was engaged , and as careless about the balloon as though there was an aeronaut with him attending to the navigation of the aerial craft . But his work seemed unavailing , and no response of any kind was made , nor did any favorable signs appear . At length the thoughts of Grimes were turned to his voyage . It must.be almost time to descend . How long he had been at this employment he did not know , but it seemed long , and he must already be outside the beleaguering lines . He rose up and looked out . To his surprise he was just passing over the suburbs of Paris . The vast extent of the city lay in the distance . To his far greater surprise the land beneath him , with its houses and trees and fields , was sweeping past at tremendous speed . He seemed to be at a great height , and he could only account for the rate at which he was goincr on the o*round that some strong wind had arisen since he left the city . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , south , east , or west , he had not the faintest idea ; and he was certainly not sufficiently familiar with the environs to form any correct opinion , even had he been closer to the ground . At that height there was a certain indistinctness in the outlines which would have mizzled even a native of Paris . As Grimes gazed upon the scene , he soon saw that though he might not descend just now , yet his descent could not possibly be delayed for very long . For there beneath him , faster and ever faster , the earth fled away ; the lines of the besieged disappeared , other lines came into view , and arrays of flashing lights arid blazing fires . Suddenly a loud report like a gun-shot sounded almost immediately beneath him , and the sharp quick crack had in it something of awful menace . What if he were being aimed at ? What if another shot should be fired , and a bullet pierce the black orb above him ? The danger was altogether too terrific to be slighted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hostile country , reaching for an unknown distance , and in passing over this he would he liable incessantly to the shots of the enemy . He might be on the thronged track of the Prussian Army ; he might be driving east toward Germany . And now all thoughts of a speedy descent left him . His only thought was to escape from this immediate danger , and remain up as high and as long as possible . Acting upon this idea he grasped two bags of ballast , and threw them out one after another . He then looked down . He saw a perceptible change . Individual objects beneath him grew far fainter and far more hazy , and soon it was difficult to distinguish anything at all . It seemed to him that on throwing out that ballast he had shot upward an immeasurable distance , and he was filled with astonishment at the exquisite sensibility to weight which his balloon had thus manifested . He also was conscious of a slight pride , for this had been the first attempt of which he had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the success which had attended his efforts caused a glow of calm self-satisfaction to pervade his being . The moon was now so low on the horizon that it was beginning to sink behind the hills . From that horizon it shone fiery red , and clouds , or at least haze , seemed to accumulate there . Its red rays penetrated the sky , and threw themselves upon the rigging , and upon the great orb above , making it look like some satellite as it thus gleamed with its borrowed robe of lurid red . But the lurid glow did not long endure . The moon sank farther and farther , until at last it went out of sight . // Now the darkness was deeper , and there came to Grimes a sense of desolation . The departure of the moon was like the loss of a friend . He looked up , and then around , and then shook his head . He felt now that it was intensely cold , and thought that he had gone too high . But he was afraid to descend for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cold as long as he could . Yet the intensity of the cold roused once more his anxiety for his senseless companion , and he stooped down with the intention of throwing over her some additional wraps . It was now so dark inside the car that nothing could be seen , but as Grimes stooped he heard a low moan and a slight movement . At this a thrill of joy passed through him . She had revived at last ; the sudden and sharp cold had , no doubt , restored her to consciousness . He listened again . The figure moved . She raised herself , and the shawl fell back from her face . But in the deep shadow of the car the lineaments of her face were not at all discernible , and Grimes saw nothing but a certain whiteness in the place where the pale face was upturned . And as lie looked he felt a thrill of infinite pity and tende*rness for the loved one , who now seemed so utterly dependent upon him . And this pity was all the deeper , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the fact of their unparalleled position . Because of the silence of the night , and the majesty of the overhanging heavens , and the sublime solitude of the skies , and the farreaching infinitude that bordered upon them , - for these and other reasons she seemed joined to him by the unity of a lofty fate , and by the imminence of a possible danger , which , if it did come , could he nothing less than a calamity of unspeakable horror . Grimes was profoundly moved . He knelt down close beside her . She looked up , and said nothing for some time . " Where am I ? " she asked at last in a voice of terror . " With me , " said Grimes in a low voice ; and as he said this he twined his arms about her , and , drawing her gently toward him , placed her head soothingly and tenderly upon his breast , and laid his hand upon it as a mother lays her hand upon the head of a feverish child . Thus it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sense had come but slo*vly , and when she first moved she felt bewildered ; she lay for some time motionless , trying to collect her thoughts and recall the past . The shawl that was over her head shut out all the scene , and as the car seemed motionless to one within it , she had no other idea than that she was lying inside some house . Then at length her memory brought back the events that had preceded her swoon , and a shudder passed through her as she thought of them all . She pushed back the shawl , sat up , and looked around . It was quite dark , but not dark enough to prevent her from seeing the outline of the balloon . At first she thought that she was on the deck of a ship , for there was the rigging , and the orb of the balloon looked not unlike some distended sail . But as she looked longer other thoughts came , and the scene above her resolved itself slowly into what it really was . Then it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and wondering how it had happened , and still full of anguish about him , she asked her mournful question . And the answer came , in a low voice of love , soft and tender in its intonation , " XVith me . " And then came the tender clasp of arms encircling her , and the gentle touch of a loving hand upon her head , as though that touch would reassure her and drive away every fear . - With me " these words were like magic , they chased away every fear , and her whole being thrilled with joy . She forgot where she was , she thought nothing of the sight that had just disclosed itself above her , she thought only of those murmured words , and of the fond encircling clasp , and of that heart of true and deathless con-6oo November , // stancy * , gainst which her head leaned , whose throbbings she could hear . And he was safe , after all ! He had been arrested , but he had escaped . He had sought her once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flight . Small difference did it now make to her how she was flying , or whither she was flying , so long as she was with him , - now while she felt him upholding her and clinging to her with such fondness , such tenderness . And Grimes thought : After this I m willing to die . Life has nothing more to offer . I ye seen its ups and downs ; have been at the deepest depths , and now am at the highest flight of human bliss . I ye saved her , - I ye saved her ! I ye got nothing more now to hope for in life that can begin to come up to this in the way of pure , unmitigated , and superhuman glory ! And Maud thought : How sweet , how sweet it is ! Is it not worth while to know sorrow , if only to be able to experience the joy that may be felt when that sorrow is removed ? I wonder if there is any danger Danoer* I neither know nor care . I am willing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I know that he is with me . I could die at this moment , if only his arms should be around me . Grimes was not altogether neglectful of practical things , in spite of his superhuman rapture . But these practical thoughts were simply variations upon the one theme . They were anxious desires to secure the comfort of his companion . He busied himself with arranging the wraps about her so as to keep her , as far as possible , from the cold night air . On all these acts Maud made no remark . To her they only afforded fresh proofs of the love of Carrol , and consequently each endearing act only afforded her a fresh delight . In the midst of her great happiness , however , there came One thought that gave her a passing care . It was the thought of Mrs. Lovell . What had become of her ? Was she safe ? This thought created a sudden agitation . She removed the shawl from her face , and asked , in a low and agitated voice , " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she safe ? " Grimes bent low over her and murmured , " Yes , darling , safe . " And drawing her closer to him he kissed fervently and tremulously tIte one whom he so fondly loved , pressing his lips to hers again and again . Maud murmured some unintelligible words , and with a final kiss , long drawn , rapturous , and never to be forgotten , Grimes drew the shawl over her face , and with a sigh of ecstasy restored that dear head to its former place . The time that had elapsed had not been regarded by either . It seemed short , but it may have been hours . Grimes wondered about this , and tried to form an estimate : he could not . He now cast his eyes upward , and the sight that met them startled him . The sight that met his eyes was the sight of utter nothingness . It was dark , but not intense darkness . It seemed rather to be an impenetrable and intensely gloomy mist . For a short distance up the outlines of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . He sat motionless and wondering ; and now , as lie sat and stared up , it seemed to grow darker and dimmer every moment , the shadows growing deeper , the obscurity more profound , the gloom more terrible . Finally nothing at all could be seen , not the outlines of the rigging , not even the hand before his face ; no visible thing remained ; nothing was left but the blackness of darkness . At first there was a vague idea in his mind that he had ascended so high that lie had reached a l ) lace where all light failed and darkness was eternal ; but this passed , and others came equally wild and equally unsatisfactory . Of all this Maud was perfectly ignorant , for the wraps that covered her head shut out all this scene . But as for Grimes , his surprise deepened into anxiety , and his anxiety became gradually more and more intolerable , until at 6oi // length he had to make up his mind to tear himself away from the sweet communion which he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way that would not create any alarm in the mind of his companion . How to do this was very difficult , but it had to be done . So he murmured a few words , speaking in a low voice , for the darkness and the deep drear silence produced an overpowering awe and hushed his voice to solemn tones . He therefore said something about " ropes " and " the balloon , " and then gently untwining his fond encircling grasp he tenderly laid Maud so as to let her lean against the seat in her old position , after which he rose to his feet , and , standing there , looked forth into space . XXVIII . THE SECRET PLACE OF THUNDER . His eyes encountered a wide *vaste , a drear nothingness , an impenetrable gloom , a darkness utter and inconceivable . It was the abomination of desolation . It was the abysm of the uncreate , the chaos of formless matter ; a void , direful , abhorrent , tremendous a void where the ' darkness shut out all the light of hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now , had there been the fury of the storm mingling with that gloom , or had the wrath of the tempest been manifest , then there would have been something to mitigate the effect of that unparalleled outlook ; for then there would have been something which could appeal to some sense , and in the beating of the blast , however pitiless , or in the howling of the tempest , however wrathful , there would have been some indication of the presence of nature and of natire 's law . But here no movement arose amid the deep darkness , no wind swept through the void , no hurricane gave forth its voice . All was emptiness , motionless , still . Yet in the midst of this terrific stillness the awe-struck gazer into space became at length conscious of sounds , and it was with something like relief that he detected that which showed that , though sight was useless , there still remained an occupation for other senses . It was a sound , distant , low , and almost undistinguishable at first , - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once , that it might be the vibrations of the nerve within himself , rather than the actual waves of sound from without . But its persistency and its gradual increase showed at last that it was external ; and as he listened it grew with startling rapidity , until at last it assumed the character of a steady sustained sound , a low , distant droning sound , of so peculiar a nature that it was quite impossible to attribute it to anything with which he was acquainted . This then was the only thing that indicated the existence of any external world , and to this he directed all his attention . Nature , however , was at that time exerting her might , and all the air was in commotion ; but the balloon was almost like the air itself , and was driven before the blast with a speed equal to that of the blast . It was borne upon the wings of the wind , yet for that very reason there was no wind perceptible to him who sought to penetrate the gloom that surrounded him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon an obstacle ; the balloon , however , was no obstacle , but drove along with the wind , with the tempest , and with the clouds . And now the sound , the low , droning sound , drew nearer and nearer , and grew deeper and louder . At length it grew sufficiently definite in its tone to assume a resemblance to things that were familiar , and to Grimes , as he listened , it seemed as though some mighty wave was s'veeping toward him , - some wave like the first of those vast surges that may be seen and heard as they sweep up the empty bed of the tidal rivers of America ; it seemed like a rushing , rolling tide , sweeping toward him with resistless violence . He had no reason now to mourn over the absence of nature and of // nature 's works ; for these sounds were at length unmistakable , and showed that it was no empty void , no chaos , that he was traversing , but the earth itself , his home , with its alternations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand what was really the nature of that sound . Yes , it was the sea , and nothing else . He had been swept off the land and out to sea . Time had fled rapidly indeed , while he had been sitting there , lost to all thoughts of the external world in the flood of tenderness and love ; and thus he had allowed himself to be borne to where escape was perhaps impossible . By the short time that had elapsed since first he had heard the sound , he was able to estimate the speed of his flight , and to see that , instead of being poised motionless in some deep calm , he was in reality in the grasp of a terrible hurricane , that was driving him onward with tremendous swiftness in the path of its own progress ; though where that path might lead his eyes failed to discern , as they struggled vainly to penetrate through the night and the enveloping clouds . The sea ! That was now the one thought that he possessed , the one thought that engrossed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were several seas around France . Over which of these was he now driving ? South was the Mediterranean . Was it indeed l ) Ossible that time enough had elapsed to allow of his being carried over the vast distance that separates Paris from the southern border of France ? He could not believe this . Had he been driving north then , and was this the British Channel ? It might be so . Had he finally been driven west , and was this the Atlantic Ocean ? That , indeed , was a thought of horror , yet the thing was only too possible . It seemed to him now that he must be over either the British Channel or else the ocean itself . Of these alternatives the latter meant utter ruin and despair ; but the former left some room for hope and even consola tion . He rather clung to hope . He chose rather to think that it was the narrower sea , and to hope that beyond the roaring of these waters and the rush of these waves there lay a land like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ b* possible to find an escape at last . Meanwhile Maud had been reclining at the bottom of the car in the position in which Grimes had left her , leaning in as easy a position as possible against the side , and waiting to see what was to be done . The shawl which he had wrapped around her still covered her face , protecting her from the cold and from the damp . To her the balloon seemed motionless . It did not avail to distract her thoughts from other subjects which now occupied her mind . For she was thinking of Carrol , of the misunderstanding that had arisen between them , of the dark alienation that had arisen , of the separation and astonishing meeting on board the steamer , of his apparent aversion , of their lives apart , of their chance meeting and their final explanation and understanding . Above all she thought of this last incident in their mutual history , so wonderful , so unaccountable . She had seen him arrested ; she had fallen to the floor , in her despair , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally awaked to find herself with him , alone with him , out of the world , in the realms of the upper air . She recalled every incident of that awakening . She thought how he had been roused by her movement and had come to her . She recalled his words of tenderness , his acts of devotion , his deep and all-absorbing love . His arms had been round her ; she had reclined upon him ; she had listened to his murmured words of love ; she had felt his kisses upon her lips . What happiness , what bliss had been hers What an ending was this to the sorrow that she had known And now , as she no longer felt his encircling arms , she began to experience a sense of loneliness . Where was he ? Where had he gone ? Why was he so // silent ? What was he doing ? He had gone to arrange something connected with the balloon . What was his task ? He made no sound . What had become of him ? The deep silence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a low deep moan that seemed to rise from beneath her . To this she listened for some time , until at length she could endure it no longer , and began to feel uneasy at the silence . She felt deserted , and a wild fear of danger arose . She started up and groped around with her hands . The car was not large , and in the darkness her hands touched Grimes , who was unable to repress a start and an exclamation of surprise . But the touch of her hand at once aroused him from the gloomy thoughts in which he had been indulging , and reawakened those tenderer emotions which for a short time had been forgotten . He drew her close to him , and , encircling her fondly with one arm , with the other hand he proceeded very anxiously and carefully to arrange the s ha*vl about her head . He said nothing , however , for the solemn sense of peril was still uppermost in his mind , and he felt that if he spoke he would inevitabl*r speak of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far as possible all pain , all knowledge of danger ; and he hoped yet that the danger might be passed , and that she might reach the land so pleasantly that no thought of the terrors of the journey should ever come to her mind . He held his tongue , and contented himself with acts of tender carefulness . Maud , as she stood there , looked forth and saw that darkness and that gloom which had so impressed the stout heart of Grimes . Beneath her she again heard , and this time far more impressively than before , the dronino- cadence of the *vaves ; the sound of many waters , which , penetrating thus through the gloom to her ears , carried a certain dismal warning to her soul . She clung closer to Grimes . Her heart throbbed painfully , and at last even his protecting arms could not altogether repel the advancing terror . " 0 , I m afraid ! " she moaned . " I m so afraid ! " Grimes said nothing . He pressed her closer to his heart . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus ministering to her comfort he might secure her safety . His silence increased her fears . " 0 , I m afraid ! " she murmured , once again . " What will become of us ? " And with a shudder she clung more closely to Grimes . Now Grimes himself had been so overawed by the solemn presence of night and storm and darkness and the shadow of death , and he had experienced such direful emotions at the thought of that angry ocean that lay roaring beneath ready to ingulf them , that he had no words of consolation to offer , and nothing to say that might disarm the fears of another . He did not wish her to share his anxiety ; but since she had gazed with her own eyes upon the terrors of the scene , he had nothing to offer by which those terrors could be disarmed . He could only follow the natural impulse of his heart , and clasp her closer to him , and say to her in low tones , " 0 my darling ! do n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " sighed Maud , " I forgot . I 'll try to be patient . " And with these words she sat down in her former position at the bottom of the car . Once more Grimes turned to confront the peril of his situation , and to plan in his own mind some way of escape . Escape ? How was it possible ? Shall I descend ? thought he . Descend ? But why should he descend ? What was it that lay beneath him ? Was it the ocean or the channel ? This was the question , and how could he find any answer to that question ? Was it the ocean or the channel ? If the one , he was lost , and all his bright hopes shattered , and the blessed future torn forever away from his grasp ; if the other , there was a chance , faint indeed , but still a chance of escape . Was it the // ocean or the channel ? Terrible question Unanswerable problem ! Shall I pull the valve-string and de-scend ? Descend * Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place ? For what purpose ? Descend ? Why , in any case a descent now could only mean a fall into the sea , and that sea just now , just here , even if it should happen to be the channel , could only serve one purpose , and that would be to ingulf them . Descend ? No , the thought could not be entertained . What then ? Should he ascend ? This was a different thing altogether . It was a bolder question . A question , indeed , so bold that he might well pause before he decided upon adopting such a course . To descend was death but to ascend , what was that ? Was it death or safety ? Such were the thoughts that agitated the soul of Grimes . And all the while there came up the deep drone of the rolling billows , the noise of many waters , and never ceased to remind him of the peril of the hour , and of the fate that lay in wait for him  --  and for her . Had the balloon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ descending ? This thought came to him . He put his head over the side of the car and listened . There came to his ears the same drone of the waves , but whether he had descended lower or not he could not tell . Any exact estimate of his distance from the earth was impossible , yet the sound seemed near enough to suggest the propriety of putting a greater distance between him and it ; and so as he arose once more to his former position , and asked himself the question , Shall I ascend ? the waters below gave forth an answer that had an unmistakable meaning . That meaning which he understood was , Ascend ! Avoid us ! Keep away , as far as possible , from our pitiless wrath Meanwhile Maud sat at the bottom of the car , listening and thinking , listening to the roar of the waves , thinking of Carrol . It seemed strange indeed to her , that , after their prolonged sorrow , they should be joined again , stranger still that they should be joined under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time most sad , that , being thus joined , they should still be exposed to that merciless fate which , like a Nemesis , seemed ever to pursue them . For ever amid her meditations there came the sound of the waves of the sea , and that sound now signified to her mind nothing less than renewed disaster , and perhaps complete destruction . The cold of the upper air and the chill of the enveloping clouds affected her , and she felt them through the shawls which were gathered about her ; yet the chill grasp of the hand of Night was robbed of half its power by the hot and feverish influence of the thoughts that passed through her mind . Where were they going ? What were they doing ? Carrol had madly carried her off in the balloon ; but did he understand the balloon , and did he know what was to b* done in the dire emergency in which they now found themselves ? And what was he doing now ? She began to comprehend that he was puzzled and bewildered , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effecting their escape . The thought filled her heart with despair and as she considered his inexperience and ignorance the last hope of escape died out . Shall I ascend or not ? Such was the thought of Grimes . And now with inconceivable ab1*uptness , bursting into the midst of the night , dashing all the dark aside and transforming in one moment all that impenetrable blackness to one universal glow of fiery red , there came a sudden flash , coming from no one direction , but flaming everywhere for a moment , and then dying out utterly . And then , before Grimes could collect his thoughts that had been scattered and dissipated by the shock of that lurid flash , there followed a long , deep thunder-peal , that rolled all around them , and went volleying on through * // all the heavens in long reverberations . Grimes stood motionless until the last peal of the long - reverberating thunder had died away in the distance . Then , at length , he knew what he was to do . In that long , deep , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From that answer there was no appeal . It sent forth to his ears a voice , menacing , gloomy , terrific , and even the stout heart of Grimes shrank back from the terrors of its presence . From this his one thought was now to fly ; and he stooped down hastily and snatched at several of the ballast-bags , and hurled them out one after another . Maud had not seen the red flash , for her head was infolded by the shawl ; but she had heard the terrible thunderpeal . As its first low , rising sound came to her ears , she thought it was the surf beating upon some rocky shore upon which they were driving . Every nerve thrilled with horror ; and she drew herself up with that instinctive movement by which one tries to prepare himself for some inevitable collision . But the collision did not come ; and the sound deepened into grander volume till the thunder-peal made itself manifest to her . Yet this discovery lessened her horror not one whit . As well , she thought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iron-bound shore , as to be up here in this place of terror , among the withering ligl*tning-flashes , in the secret place of thunder . She was aware of Grimes 's exertions , though she did not know what he was doing , and she felt the car oscillate beneath his movements . She removed the shawl and looked up with a shudder of terrible apprehension , with the fear of one who expected to see Death itself . She said not a word . She looked , with all her being in her eyes . There came before her sight the dim outline of her companion , and the ropes of the rigging and the network , and the dark figure of the overhanging orb . All these grew less shadowy and more substantial every moment , until at length something like the actual forms of tangible things could be seen , though as yet the gloom of night kept them indistinct . But beyond this her eyes saw a place where the gloom of night came not ; for , looking over the edge of the car , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there from that remote infinity there shone full before her a clear , tranquil star . In its calm , cold ray her feverish spirit seemed to sink to rest and quiet ; and the light of the star showed her that the horror of great darkness had passed . XXIX . OVER THE CLOUDS AND OVER THE SEA . THUS by throwing out that ballast the balloon had been elevated beyond the region of the storm into one of calm , or at least to one where the clouds did not follow . Grimes once more felt a momentary thrill of selfcomplacency at this second proof of his power to navigate the machine , but the anxieties of his position were too great to allow such a feeling to last . He was still as ignorant as ever of his whereabouts , and merely knew this , that the sea was beneath him , and between him and that sea a thunderstorm was raging . Grimes looked over the side of the car upon the scene beneath . There lay a vast abyss , without form , and void , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abyss he saw the sudden flash of the lightning , now in long forked lines which seemed to pierce the whole misshapen mass with destructive fury , again in one sudden ul ) lifting of universal lioht . After this followed the deafening thunder . To Grimes it seemed as though this scene of destruction was taking place on the earth itself , as though the world were going to ruin , and that the time had come for the consummation of all things ; and though he on the *vings of his balloon rode sublime in the crystalline // sky , yet he would gladly have exchanged his exaltation for any place , however lowly , upon the solid earth . Now the deepest anxiety filled his heart . Every moment some portion of the gas escaped ; the balloon grew less and less buoyant ; and at last a time would come when , after the last fragment of ballast had been thrown out , it could rise no more , but must begin its steady and uninterrupted descent to the earth or to the sea . In vain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sky . If he could but see any sign of land , no matter how bleak and bare it might be , if it was but the peak of some mountain , he would feel relief . But no land appeared ; and out of that flaming abysm below no mountain-crest reared itself to meet his gaze . The night also , the long duration of this darkness , troubled him . Would it never end ? Would morning never come ? Amid this darkness it was impossible to decide upon any course of action , since his plans had to be made up in accordance with his surroundings . He could no longer hear the roar of waves , even though he tried hard in the occasional pauses between the thunderpeals . Perhaps he had traversed a narrow sea and was now over some land ; perhaps he had gone up so far that the sound of the waves could not reach him ; or perhaps his ears were so dulled by the thunder that the lesser sound of waves could not be distinguished . But whatever the cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maud crouched in the bottom of the car , hiding her eyes from the light . ning-flashes and closing her ears to the thunder-peals . The time seemed endless ; and each hour , as it passed , lengthened itself out intolerably , until at length Grimes began to notice that the lightning flashed less frequently , and that the thunder-peals followed each other at longer intervals . The subsidence of the storm aroused his hope . For if this should die out , then the clouds might also be dissipated ; and if he should survive till morning , the earth would not be shut out from his view . With hopes like these he still watched and listened patiently . And the lightning grew rarer and rarer , and the thunder less frequent and less loud , until at length both ceased altogether . But now the scene beneath was no longer lighted up by those vivid flashes which had formerly illumined it , and what lay there was once more a black abysm , a void of nothingness . The hours of the night passed on . Maud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lightning flashed no more , and the thunder-peals no longer sounded in her ears ; but she did not move from her position , nor make a sign . There were two strong feelings in her heart that kept her quiet . One was a feeling of intense terror and apprehension . This journey amid the clouds and darkness , with the dread accompaniment of thunder and lightning , must end in utter ruin . The other feeling was one of deep concern for her dear love , who now had the care of her upon his heart , and was standing there watching and waiting . Perhaps he was bewildered through his ignorance of balloon navigation ; perhaps he was silent through despair ; perhaps he had some plan , and was devoting all the energies of his mind and body toward carrying that plan into accomplishment . And thus Maud , in her terror for herself and in her love for her dear companion , remained motionless , through the conviction that if there was any possibility of safety it must depend upon her companion 's perfect vigilance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storm had resulted in a quiet so profound that no sound was heard . The quiet reassured her , and gradually the haunting terror of her heart grew fainter . Gradually , too , the fatigue and the excitement through which she had passed produced their natural effect . She was worn out by the events of that day and night ; and as the tremendous pressure of excitement and immediate terror was // removed , her mind grew more at rest , and slowly she let herself sink into a light and gentle sleep . But Grimes still watched , and the hours of the night passed slowly on . More than once he had been surprised at the stillness of Maud , and had stooped down , fearing that she might have again fainted . The first time he took her hand , and she returned a gentle pressure without saying a word . The next time she gave no pressure of her hand ; but her hand was warm , and by her gentle and regular breathing he knew that she was asleep . This assurance gave him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fear lest his dear love might be suffering . At length Grimes saw a faint glow of light on the horizon , and hailed with joy the appearance of the dawn . On that quarter lay the east ; but it was impossible to tell , even by that assistance , in what direction he was going ; still day was coming , and soon it would be light , and then all would be revealed . The progress of the dawn seemed painfully slow ; and again and again he impatiently withdrew his eyes , and tried in vain to fix them elsewhere . But there was about the dawn a glory and a charm that Grimes found resistless ; and so , as often as he withdrew his eyes , they wandered back again . Suddenly there came to his ears a faint plashing sound that made him start . It sounded like the dashing of water . He looked over the side of the car . Again the sound came to his ears , and yet again , yet nothing was visible to his eyes . Beneath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which nothing whatever was discernible ; nor was he able to make out whether it was land , or sea , or the dense clouds which hours ago had stretched in flame and uproar beneath . Yet there was no mistake about the sound , and again the thought came that it might be the sea . He had now something else to attract his gaze . The eastern sky lost its ascendency in his thoughts . The mystery beneath now arose to a prominent place . What was it ? He leaned November , over , and strained his eager eyes into the gloom . He began to notice something like motion there . What was this motion ? Was it rolling clou ds , or was it the movement of waves ? As he listened , he once or twice thought that the sounds seemed surprisingly near . At length the moving objects beneath him became more distinctly revealed in the increasing light ; at length he saw the movement all beneath and around him , regula rand recurrent , while the sound that accompanied that movement was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foaming , seething billows . Yes , it was the sea . Suddenly all was revealed . To his utter amazement he saw that this sea was immediately beneath him . He could see it at last distinctly . Not more than thirty feet seemed to intervene between him and it , and the balloon was scudding with the speed of the storm-wind over its surface . A moment before it seemed as though the balloon was motionless in a calm . Now he perceived that it was rushing along at a rate of speed such as the hurricane alone may attain . He understood all now in a moment . The balloon had been losing its buoyancy , and had been gradually descending for hours . He had just noticed this in time . What should he do now ? Should he arrest that flight ? But how ? He had heard of aeronauts throwing out a rope and allowing it to trail in the water . This he thought of , but saw no rope that was adapted for his purpose . There was only one thing left , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ascend . He threw out several bags of ballast , and the balloon arose once more , and passed up so high that the sight and the sound of the sea was left behind . But the day was coming on , and soon the sea would reappear in the gathering light . Steadily that light now increased . Grimes watched the scene beneath , and gradually beheld it assume the form of waves , no longer lying close beneath him and sending A Comcdy of Terrors. // the din of its billows up to his ears , hut far away below , at an immense distance , - so far that , as the waves became defined in the increasing light , they assumed the appearance of wrinkles upon the face of the water . The light grew stronger . D ayadvanced . At last daylight conquered the darkness ; and though the sun was not yet up , still the whole scene beneath was revealed to the gaze of Grimes . There was the sea . All around , the horizon . Upon that horizon no signs of land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ north there was an accumulation of clouds , but what they concealed he could not know . It was the sea , but what sea ? Not the channel , for now he saw that if he had crossed that place he would see land beneath him by this time , and not water . Could it be the Mediterranean ? He thought not , for he had heard the sound of the surf too soon to have had time to reach that sea . What then ? Only one thing remained . It must be the Atlantic . This thought had once before come to him , and he had struggled with it ; but now it came again , . full , clear , manifest , and attested by the evidence of his senses . At this confirmation of his worst fears he stood perfectly overwhelmed , staring at the world - wide ocean . In one place he saw a ship many miles away , but it grew fainter and fainter . There was now only one thought in his mind . The Atlantic- ! There was now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more . What remained ? Nothing but to meet his fate like a man . But since life had thus run out , why should he not enjoy its last brief moments ; or why , since he had so short a time left to live , should he keep himself any longer apart from that dear one over whom his soul yearned with such intense fondness . He stooped down , and , stealing his hand under the shawl that enveloped Maud 's head , he took her little hand in his , and sat looking at her with a VOL . XXX . - NO. x8i. 39 face full of unutterable love and longing , with all the fervent love of his strong nature expressed upon his glowing face . Maud in her light sleep felt that touch , and it thrilled through her . She waked at once , but the touch was so sweet , and reminded her so tenderly of her dear fond lover , that she remained motionless for some little time , just for the sake of prolonging that exquisite sentiment of bliss and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . He was by her side . He was all her own . She did not give one thought to the very extraordinary fact that both of them were in a balloon , and interchanging their feelings in space . Of the balloon and of space she had no thought . It was her sweet , sweet love only , and the fond encircling clasp of that dear hand . And now Grimes longed to feast his eyes with a sight of that dear face whose exquisite lineaments were impressed indelibly upon his memory . So he reached forth his other hand , and began gently , and lovingly , and tenderly , to draw aside the shawl which enveloped that face , and concealed it from him . Maud felt the gesture ; and as the shawl was slowly removed , she remained still , awaiting the moment when his dear hand , having withdrawn the veil , her eyes should gaze upon his adored face . At this prospect a delicious sense of expectation filled her mind ; a sweet confusion gave a zest to her joy ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shawl was drawn away . For an instant Maud sat with a flush mantling her exquisitely lovely face , and her eyes downcast , while a faint smile hovered around her lips . At length , in the full assurance of perfect happiness , she raised her eyes . The blow of this discovery had already fallen upon Grimes . As he drew back the shawl he saw her face for the first time distinctly , and saw that it was Maud Heathcote . The blow was tremendous . He was stunned . He did n't think of anything . He did n't // try to account for anything . He did n't wonder where Mrs. Lovell really was . He did n't have any thought at all . He was simply stunned . And so it was that , when Maud , in the full assurance of perfect happiness , raised her eyes , this is what she saw . She saw the man Grimes staring at her . He was still clutching her hand , and holding up the shawl . He was now rigid in that position as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , but seeing her not ; while on his face there was an expression of dumb , inarticulate amazement ; the expression of a soul in a state of collapse ; of a mind in a state of daze ; the vacuity of thought ; the look of a being who , having gone out of his senses , was approaching the regions of doddering imbecility . As Maucl looked upon this man the flush passed away from her face , and was succeeded by a ghastly pallor and an expression of dull and torpid terror ; her ashen lips parted to utter a cry which vet did not escape them ; with a frightful shudder she tore her hand away from his clasp , and flung herself back in a recoil of deadly abhorrence . Of this Grimes took no notice ; and so he sat , regarding her with his dazed eyes , while Maud sat staring at him in fixed and rigid horror . 7ames DeMille.
