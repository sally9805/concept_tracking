A table between each arch occupied with bronzes , flowers , etc . A pedestal with a vase of flowers , a table and a sofa on the L. PAULINE is discovered as the curtain rises , to merry music , arranging a bouquet in the vase at L. The noise of a whip is heard and she turns and looks off R. through the arches . Pauline Who 's coming now ? Goes to the arches and looks off . Why , if it is n't Mademoiselle Gilberte and that charming M. de Valreas . What on earth can be the matter that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have spared his horse . Mademoiselle always comes in first . Now he 's assisting her to dismount . They are coming here ! She runs to the vase of flowers again . How long they are ! Turns . Mademoiselle must have gone to her room direct . Returns to arch C. That 's certain , for here comes M. de Valreas alone . How gracefully he bears defeat . Enter VALREAS , R. C. looking back . Valreas Beaten again ! Sees PAULINE . You there ! You see , Pauline , your handsome mistress and I have had another race . Pau Pauline Laughing . And my handsome mistress come in ahead . Val Valreas As usual ! Throws hat and whip on sofa . Yes , I acknowledge I 'm beaten , and what 's more , Pauline , I do n't regret it . Pau Pauline Coming down R. C. You do n't ! Why not ? Val Valreas Because it 's infinitely more agreeable to gallop behind than before her . She has such an adorable way of sitting a horse  --  and to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to L. H. Pau Pauline What , Monsieur ? You call her by that familiar name ? Mademoiselle Gilberte would be very angry if she heard you call her Frou Frou . Val Valreas Why , it 's her name . Pau Pauline It 's her name for her father and her sister , but for you  --  Val Valreas For me too ! What name could I give her , indeed , more appropriate than that which seems to have been invented for the delicious little creature who bears it ? What else is she but Frou Frou ? A noisy , bustling , busy little fairy  --  ever rustling , rustling , like the leaves stirred by a gentle wind . Frou Frou , always ; Frou Frou , everywhere ! In the house a door opens and down the stairs comes a rustle of skirts like a whirlwind . Frou Frou , Frou Frou ! Imitating rustle of silk . She bounds into the room with a joyous burst ! She runs here and there  --  rummages about , disarranges everything  --  frowns , laughs , talks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Frou Frou , Frou Frou , always Frou Frou ! And I am sure , that while she sleeps , the angel that watches over her waves its rustling wings with that dear little sound , Frou Frou ! Crosses R. Pau Pauline Oh , indeed ! Looking off L. Well , you 'd better stop and be proper , for her father is just dismounting at the gate . Val Valreas So I will , for I 've something to say to him so prodigiously serious , so prodigiously proper , in fact , Laughing that I do n't know how to begin . Pau Pauline Something to say to Mademoiselle Gilberte 's father ? Val Valreas Yes , to him , and then to her . Pauline , you are a young girl and you know what love is , do n't you ? Pau Pauline Oh , I 've had an ordinary education , sir , and love is one of the primary studies for girls . Val Valreas Of course it is . It 's addition is n't it ? Or is it multiplicaton ? Pau @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Val Valreas Well , then , you can appreciate my feelings when I tell you that I adore her  --  I have adored her ever since  --  Pau Pauline Two days ago , going on three ! Here comes M. Brigard , sir ; you 'd better finish your declaration to him . Crosses to R. Enter BRIGARD with BARONESS , in riding habit , C. from L. Brigard C. Hallo , Valreas , what did you and Gilberte mean by running off and leaving us two alone to follow you ? But then Looking at BARONESS with a look of gallantry . I do n't complain ! B'ness Baroness L. C. Well it would be strange if you did . Sits on sofa and fans herself with paper that is lying there . Val Valreas R. C. Why , it was a wager between Mademoiselle Gilberte and me as to which should get here first , and when we did , she went to her room to dress for dinner while I waited for you . Brig Brigard And amused yourself talking to the maid about her . Pauline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ H. corner . Saying , sir ? VALREAS motions her to stop Brig Brigard Sitting C. Yes , saying . Pau Pauline He called Mademoiselle Gilberte Frou Frou , and asked if she had a heart . Brig Brigard Pretending seriousness . What ? Val Valreas I did n't say anything . Brig Brigard To PAULINE . That 'll do . Go to Gilberte ! Exit PAULINE , R. 1 E. So you 've been trying to find out whether Gilberte has a heart , eh ? Looks at BARONESS and pauses . Well , I 'll talk to you presently ; I must go and dress , and mind , before I come back , do n't make anatomical investigations through any of the other servants . Exits R. 1 E. Val Valreas Following him to the door . Well , it 's no harm , everyone has a heart . I did n't ask about her fortune or anything else that was mean . B'ness Baroness Oh , Valreas ! Valreas ! Val Valreas Assuming air of gallantry . Well , what have I done now ? Crosses to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have known you for four years now , and if I were called upon to say what you are , I should be puzzled for an answer . Val Valreas Making a gesture of surprise . What I am ? B'ness Baroness Yes , what you are . Val Valreas Approaching her . I am only a poor devil who is dying of love for you . B'ness Baroness Yes , I know  --  you 've said that for four years and I see you are alive yet . Val Valreas For four years and no intermission for refreshments . B'ness Baroness Nonsense ! you 've been here two days and , during that time you 've done nothing but make love to little Gilberte . Val Valreas Sitting beside her . Do n't you see that was only a little maneuver of mine ? B'ness Baroness To make me jealous ? Val Valreas Yes . B'ness Baroness But how about that widow ? Val Valreas Widow ? What widow ? B'ness Baroness Who is dying of love for you , who is determined to get a husband and who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't deny it . I know . Val Valreas You know ? BARONESS nods yes . Who told you ? B'ness Baroness Aha ! Rises and crosses R. Val Valreas Aside . It 's that rogue Brigard ! Rising . Ah , I see you wo n't believe in the deep ardor of my affection . You wo n't . B'ness Baroness Meeting him C. No I wo n't . Val Valreas Decidedly ? B'ness Baroness Decidedly ! Val Valreas Then I 'm perfectly right in lavishing the ardor of my affection on Brigard 's little daughter . And you know what the consequences will be ? B'ness Baroness In surprise . The consequences ? Val Valreas Yes !  --  a wedding . B'ness Baroness What ? You marry ? VALREAS nods . You marry ? Val Valreas Certainly ! Wo n't she make a delicious little countess ?  --  and the day we are married , what a gay , delightful , happy , joyous wedding we will have  --  with  --  B'ness Baroness With music by Offenbach ? Val Valreas Well , why not ? And then there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to C. arch . There on the right , is the chteau of our friend Sartorys ; at the left , yonder , mine ; and this one we are in makes a third , which my friend Brigard bought two years ago . Does n't it strike you as odd now , as a sort of destiny , that Brigard , with his two marriageable daughters , should come and settle here , between two bachelors  --  Sartorys and myself ? B'ness Baroness It 's quite delightful to hear you , I declare . Returns to sofa . Val Valreas C. You must acknowledge that Providence never more clearly manifested its intentions . Neither Sartorys nor I will oppose fate . First marriage , Md'lle Louise Brigard and Mon . Henri Sartorys ; music by Haydn , solemn , grand ; a union of wisdom and reason . Second marriage , Md'lle Gilberte and your humble servant ; a union of just the opposite . B'ness Baroness How do you know , sir , that M. Sartorys loves Louise and wishes to marry her ? Val Valreas How do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fortnight down at his chteau , now remained here  --  let me see  --  more than two months ? Why , unless he wishes to marry her , does he come here every day ? B'ness Baroness Rising . Well , that 's something . Val Valreas Crossing L. And then he 's so well suited to her . He 's so quiet and she 's so quiet . B'ness Baroness C. But suppose that  --  Val Valreas Going to her quickly . What ? Enter BARON DE CAMBRI , L. C. , carrying a tin box , such as Botanists collect their herbs in , on his shoulder . Wears a wide , white hat . B'ness Baroness Quietly . Nothing . Baron Here I am , my dear . Val Valreas Ah ! good morning , Baron . What have you brought back from your early botanical excursion ? Baron Well , not much luck to-day . To BARONESS . Here , my love , is something which I selected for you . Offering an insignificant black flower . Ugly , but very rare . I dug it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk of my life . B'ness Baroness Dug it out of a mud-bank for me ? Really , you are too good . I do n't care to rob the mud-bank . Baron But , my dear , you do n't know what this is  --  it is the far-famed Achyrophorous Calendula Borkorsia Alpina . Val Valreas What ? Baron The far-famed Achyrophorous Calendula Borkorsia Alpina . B'ness Baroness I do n't care what it is . What have I told you , sir , repeatedly ? Baron Told me , my angel ? B'ness Baroness Hav n't I forbidden you ever to appear before me with that abominable tin box , and those dirty rocks and rubbish ? Baron Certainly , my love . You have told me in the most positive manner . I will go and put the dirty rocks and rubbish in the next room and return immediately . Exits L. U. E. Val Valreas Watching his exit and then quickly . Come , Baroness , you were about to say , just now  --  B'ness Baroness Crossing L. I ? When ? Val Valreas When I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baroness Oh , yes , I remember . I was about to say that it is evident you are in love with Gilberte , even if he be not with Louise . But I must go dress for dinner . Curtseys elaborately and exits L. 1 . E. laughing . Val Valreas Taking the stage to R. Certanly I am in love . Re-enter BARON without box . Baron You see , my love , that it is only necessary for you to express a desire for to  --  Sees , for the first time , that the BARONESS has departed . Val Valreas She 's gone , Baron . Sits R. beside table . Baron Gone , eh ! well that 's just like her . It 's the Baroness all over . You enter the room  --  " Go out " she says , " and do n't return until you have done this or that for penance . " " You go out , you submit . You come back only to find that she 's gone out herself and there are you , as it were , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Valreas Ah ! indeed ! Baron Do n't sit there and say " ah ! indeed ! " in that way . You know it as well as I do . Val Valreas Who ? I ? Baron Oh , yes ! you , and a good many others . VALREAS leans forward . You are not the only one who has been trying to make love to her . VALREAS draws back . Oh , I 've had my eye on all your maneuvers . Val Valreas Laughs . What an interesting subject of contemplation . Baron Oh , yes ! I 've watched you all and I 've pitied you . VALREAS becomes serious and angry . Oh ! I could tell you some of the drollest things about the other poor devils . Laughs and then suddenly . But it would take too long . Let 's speak of you alone Now , for instance  --  Val Valreas Assuming virtuous air . Me ! Never ! never ! Baron Oh , yes , you ! You have tried three times to make love to my wife . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that on which I introduced you to her . The second  --  two years afterwards at the races . You remember , you rode a yellow horse there , as an amateur jockey , and you thought that by exhibiting yourself in an orange-colored jacket without any tails , and on a yellow horse , you could make an impression , ha ! ha ! Well , the Baroness and I had a good laugh over you that day . The third attempt , you have made here in this house . VALREAS starts . And it was because your third attempt was as unfortunate as the two first that you have commenced to adore little Frou Frou . Val Valreas Pooh ! You 've been dreaming . Baron Oh , you 're right to give up the idea . The Baroness is not the woman to be made love to . Her temper is  --  is  --  so  --  so  --  well , it 's tremendously unpleasant for me , but it reassures me as to every other man . Rising . Val Valreas Rising . I congratulate . Baron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't mind your temper , any more than your love making . Crosses to L. It 's no go , my dear boy , it 's no go ; so do n't waste any more time over it . Saunters off , L. 1 E. Enter BRIGARD , R. 1 E. , dressed for dinner . Brig Brigard Hallo , are you still there ? Val Valreas Yes , I waited , because I wished to speak with you . Brig Brigard Well , it 's about time we had a little serious conversation . Val Valreas I really believe it is . Brig Brigard Gilberte has been telling me that while you were riding with her this morning , you began to talk in a singular manner about hearts , and affections , and other etceteras . Now what have you been saying to her ? Val Valreas Nothing that a young lady could not listen to . Brig Brigard Oh ! you think so do you ? Val Valreas Certainly , since I have made a resolution to turn over a new leaf and make amends for all my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 've made up my mind to marry . Brig Brigard You marry ? Val Valreas Yes , why not ? I was never more serious . Brig Brigard That 's not saying much . Now listen to me , my boy , I like you very much , really , very much . I 've been about town with you for a couple of years ; in fact , I showed you life when you first came to Paris . We 've had jolly times together , and I like no one better than you . But as for giving you my daughter , never , as long as I live , friend of my bosom . Val Valreas Why not ? I would make her perfectly happy . In the first place , she would be a countess . Brig Brigard Crossing to sofa , L. Oh ! that 's nothing . Val Valreas Why not ? Brig Brigard Putting his hands in his pockets and unintentionally jingling money . You know , my dear fellow , if I chose , I could have a duke . Sits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taste to jingle your money in that way at me . Brig Brigard Why , I never dreamed of such a thing , especially to you , who are richer than I. Besides , I take it all back about the duke . Val Valreas C. And you will give me your daughter ? Brig Brigard What ! my little Frou Frou ? My little tempest ? My little darling ? Most certainly VALREAS jumps towards him as BRIGARD rises. not ! Val Valreas Nettled . Why so , since you like me ? Brig Brigard It 's precisely because I do like you , or rather on account of the reasons that I like you . You see ? You are too jolly a companion to be trusted as a son-in-law ? Besides , there 's that widow who is after you . Val Valreas Devil take the widow . For two days I have taken refuge under your roof to avoid her . Does n't that prove there 's nothing serious in that quarter ? Brig Brigard Ah ! you rogue . You ca n't tell me . Widows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encouragement . Val Valreas But I 'm determined to have nothing to do with her , to become a new man . I really believe if I had some friend who would stand by me now I might become worthy of existence and not the cursed nonentity I have been . Brig Brigard Eying him closely . You really wish then  --  Val Valreas Grasping his hand warmly . Will you ? Brig Brigard Bursting out laughing . Oh , anything to oblige a friend . Val Valreas What do you mean ? Brig Brigard Oh ! nothing . I 'm going to drive the widow away . Going C. Val Valreas That 's right , and when you return I will address you formally with my request . Brig Brigard Stops . What request ? Val Valreas Why , my request for your daughter , of course . Brig Brigard What ! you 've got back to that again , have you ? Enter LOUISE , R. 1 . E. Ah ! Louise , you 've just come in time . To VALREAS . Now talk to her about your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Come , out with it . Val Valreas R. C. Oh ! you need n't try to frighten me . Brig Brigard Returning , takes LOUISE 'S hand . It is perfectly well understood in this household , that in this little brain Tapping her forehead. dwells all the wisdom of the Brigard family ; and that all questions of serious import must be referred to Louise . Louise Well ? Seriously . Val Valreas Well , I 've just asked of your father , the hand of Md'lle Gilberte in marriage . Louise The hand of Gilberte ? Surprised and then smiling . Val Valreas Seriously . What do you answer , Mademoiselle ? Louise C. My answer is , that if you do not make haste and dress for dinner , the same thing will happen to-day that occurred yesterday  --  you will be late . Brig Brigard L. C. There , are you satisfied ? Val Valreas Very well , as no one will listen to me seriously  --  Louise Crossing L. Go and dress for dinner . Brig Brigard Aside to VALREAS . You still authorize me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Certainly , sir . Brig Brigard Then I 'm going . Exits C. and L. Louise To VALREAS . Hav n't you gone yet ? I sha n't go until you tell me why you oppose my marrying Gilberte . Louise Well , I suppose I must , or you 'll never be ready . Enter VINCENT , L. C. Vincent Mon. de Sartorys . LOUISE rises and turns towards C. and L. as if with pleasure as SARTORYS enters C. , and VINCENT goes out . Sartorys Mademoiselle . Bows to LOUISE . Louise Did you see my father ? Sar Sartorys I 've just met him . To VALREAS . I hope you are well , Paul ? Val Valreas Mournfully . Very well  --  that is , when I say very well  --  ah ! my dear friend , if you only knew how they treat me in this house . Louise To VALREAS . You 'll never be ready for dinner . Val Valreas To LOUISE , who looks at him , laughing . I 'm going ! I 'm going ! Exits L. 1 E. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are to-day ! Her manner must evince love for him and pleasure in his company . She motions to a chair ; they sit . Sar Sartorys Seriously . I suppose I 'm late , because I left home earlier than usual . LOUISE laughs . I 'll explain . I was in such a hurry to get here that I started from the Chteau at a full gallop ; but , when I got within a hundred paces of the gate , I stopped , turned my horse , and for a whole hour , walked him about the neighborhood . I came back to the gate three times and three times turned away again . The fourth time , however , I did like all cowards when they make up their minds to be brave . I plunged in head foremost and here I am a little later than usual , perhaps , but still , here I am . Louise Who has followed him with interest and laughingly , but now beginning to show her emotion . What was the cause of this hesitation ? Sar Sartorys It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have wished to say for the last month . That is the reason why I trembled all the way here and why I still  --  Louise Confused . If what you have to say is so very serious  --  Sar Sartorys Earnestly . It is . Louise Moved . Perhaps you had better wait  --  Sar Sartorys Oh no , I must positively go through with it to-day . Besides , before I speak I can gain courage by remembering how good you have always been to me . And then , your father authorized me to  --  Louise Oh ! if papa  --  Sar Sartorys He did ! and more than that , he said I must first speak to you . Louise Deep emotion . To me ! Sar Sartorys Taking her hand . Have you not guessed ? I am in love . Louise Scarcely audible . You love ! Sar Sartorys Yes ! I love , madly , devotedly  --  your sister ! Gilberte ! LOUISE as if petrified , at first says nothing , simply raises her eyes to SARTORYS , then  --  Louise Gilberte @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Breathless . No . Sar Sartorys Without looking at her and as if speaking to himself . It seemed to me as if everybody must have noticed it . Louise You love my sister ? Sar Sartorys Yes , and that is why I appeal to that friendship which you have always shown me . Tell me , then , what you think of this avowal which I have just made ? Pause . You do not answer . Louise I understand you perfectly . You love Gilberte and you ask me  --  Sar Sartorys If you approve of this marriage . Louise Crossing before him . I approve  --  I approve of it . Sar Sartorys Rising . You will be on my side then ? Louise Yes , for I know of no man more worthy , no one who could  --  better than you  --  Sar Sartorys Interrupting her and taking her hand , which she withdraws in pain . Thank you , Louise , thank you . Louise Slowly and looking at him with a melancholy smile . At first I was surprised , you understand ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to an idea . And now  --  I am so . This said after a struggle with her own emotions , which she conceals from SARTORYS . You are just the husband I would have chosen for her , for I have often thought of Gilberte 's marriage , and sometimes with fear . Her wilfulness and frivolity have made me tremble for the future . Sits on sofa . Sar Sartorys Ah ! Louise And I have never thought until this moment , that in order to save her from any danger , it was only necessary to give her to a man like you . Sar Sartorys Do not let us blame what you call her frivolity , for I confess to you it is a little on account of that I love her . Still , if you think it best , I will try to teach her  --  but by degrees  --  Louise How much you love her ! Sar Sartorys Yes . Louise But why did you come to me ? Sar Sartorys Because your father told me it was you I must speak to  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have answered you . And now , SARTORYS sits beside her. what more ? Sar Sartorys You  --  you will speak to her , to Gilberte for me ? Louise I ! Sar Sartorys If I tried to speak myself , the same thing would happen that happened a while ago , I should go wandering wildly about , afraid to come boldly up to the gate  --  I mean the point . Or , if I did speak , what I would say might be more disastrous than my silence . She might laugh , and then  --  I prefer that you should speak to her . Tell her all the good you can of me , and even a little more  --  that will do no harm . But , I beg of you , do n't say that my character is serious or severe ; there is the greatest danger . Tell her that , in spite of my appearing quiet , and grave , and awkward , that I love her as madly as any of the young fellows who surround her . Rising . Oh ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who can make love to a dozen women , one after the other . Tell her , above all , not to think me stupid ; for , by an unfortunate fatality , those who can love the most are always the ones who know least how to speak of love . Louise Rising . Yes , yes  --  I promise . Sar Sartorys C. You will speak to her ? When ? Louise L. C. As soon as I see her . In a few minutes . Sar Sartorys Agitated . In a few minutes ? Louise Do you not wish me to ? Sar Sartorys Yes , but not while I am here . Louise Certainly not ! But what will you do while I am pleading your cause ? Sar Sartorys I will go out there  --  in the park  --  and walk up and down . I will not lose sight of this room . Joyously . If the answer be " yes , " you will have but a sign to make ; if it be " no "  --  Sadly . Louise If it be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return home . Louise Holding out her hand . Without a farewell ? Sar Sartorys Ah , Louise ! all my life hangs on yes or no . Listening off R. Music . Hark ! do you not hear her ? Her footsteps on the staircase ? The rustle of her skirts ?  --  Louise Always the same noisy Frou Frou . Sar Sartorys She comes like a little tempest . Gets R. U. S. Enter GILBERTE in dinner toilet , like a whirlwind , R. 1 E. holding a bracelet in her hand . Gil Gilberte C. Louise , fasten me this ? Louise What ? SARTORYS gets down R. gradually . Gil Gilberte This bracelet ! I ca n't ! Holds out her left arm ; LOUISE fastens the bracelet . Good gracious ! how your hand trembles ! What is the matter with you ? Seeing SARTORYS , extends her right hand to him , LOUISE still retaining the left . Your servant , Mon . Sartorys ! Sar Sartorys Taking her hand . Mademoiselle . Bows . Gil Gilberte Why , your hand trembles too ! SARTORYS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand of GILBERTE . What , both of you ? Why , what 's going on here ? Louise To SARTORYS . Well , sir , since it is impossible for you to remain quiet  --  Smilingly . Gil Gilberte Knowingly . Oho ! Laughs . Louise You had better go and walk about a little . Sar Sartorys Yes , Mademoiselle , I am going  --  to walk about a little . Exits C. and L. with last gesture to LOUISE . Gil Gilberte And now , my dear sister , Taking both her hands. let me beg your pardon for coming in so abruptly and spoiling your tte -- tte . But why did he go away ? He should have stayed here and kept quiet , and , as soon as I saw which way the wind blew , I 'd have gone around the room as if I was looking for something , and then  --  fizz ! gone out again and left you two to yourselves . That 's the way to manage it . You see I know . Louise You were perfectly right in coming , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was of you we were talking . Gil Gilberte Of me ? Louise Mon . Sartorys asks for your hand . Gil Gilberte Amazed . What do you say ? Louise I say that Mon . Sartorys has asked for your hand . He has spoken to father already , and he , knowing the affection I have for you , my dear Gilberte , advised him to speak to me . Gil Gilberte My hand ! Sartorys ! Impossible ! You must be mistaken . Louise But I am not mistaken . Gil Gilberte Then he is mistaken . It is you that he is in love with . Louise It is you . Gil Gilberte I ? Louise He told me so , and begged me to repeat it to you , and  --  Gil Gilberte Well ! Louise He waits for your answer . Gil Gilberte My answer ! Now ? Before I 've time to take breath ! And you say he spoke to papa about it ? Louise Yes . Gil Gilberte And papa left it to you ? Louise Father could not give the answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no , no , no ! It 's too serious for me . I have always said , when the question of my marriage came , I would go and find my sister Louise , who is so good and so wise , and I would beg her  --  Louise No , Gilberte , no . Gil Gilberte Yes , yes ! I do as papa does  --  I refer it to you . You must decide for me . I will give whatever answer you advise me . Louise With an effort . In that case , I advise you to answer  --  yes ! Gil Gilberte Louise , have you reflected ?  --  Louise Yes . Sartorys ' merit is universally acknowledged . Gil Gilberte Oh , I know he has merit , a great deal too much , perhaps . Louise How so ? Gil Gilberte Louise , sit here with me . LOUISE on sofa , GILBERTE chair . I am going to speak serious now . Monsieur Sartorys , I acknowledge , is a man to whom it is almost impossible to say no . Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become with his talents ? Louise Oh ! minister somewhere  --  an ambassador . Gil Gilberte Playfully . And I would be an ambassadress ! That would be nice , if it were only in Paris . Seriously . But if I do him justice , I must do myself the same . I am full of faults ; you know it and so do I , and it seems to me that these faults of mine are the very ones Sartorys should wish in a wife if he hoped to be entirely unhappy . She laughs , LOUISE makes a gesture of disaffirmance . Oh , you think he would cure me ? I am sure he could not . I have always been spoilt  --  by papa first , then by you . By you still more than papa . LOUISE makes same gesture . Yes , still more . And , what is still more , I am positively decided to remain hopelessly ill of those faults and never to be cured , for I am perfectly satisfied with myself just as I am . If I married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He loves you , Gilberte . Gil Gilberte Are you very sure ? Louise Did you not see a little while ago ? Gil Gilberte A pause ; she reflects And so it is I he loves . Laughs . What a funny idea . Rises . Louise Animated ; rising . Is it nothing to be loved by such a man ? To see that he trembles before you like a child ? Still more animated . It seems to me if I were asked who is it I love , I should say with pride : " Look for the man who is superior to everyone about him  --  it is he . " Gil Gilberte Going to her and putting her arms around her waist . Do you know one thing , sister Louise ? Louise What is it ? Gil Gilberte I will not marry Mon . Sartorys . Louise Why ? Gil Gilberte Demurely . Because , up to this time , I thought that you loved him ; and now  --  I am sure of it . Louise I ? Gil Gilberte Patting LOUISE 'S @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If I loved him I would not advise you to marry him . Gil Gilberte Moving away Louise , I 'm become afraid of you . I believe you are  --  first , capable of sacrificing yourself for me and then of being proud of the sacrifice . Louise Going to GILBERTE and putting her arm about her waist . Then , this time , little sister , you are wrong . My affection for you is certainly very great , but , however great it might be , if I loved , I would not  --  An imperceptible look of pain passes over her face , not seen by GILBERTE . Gil Gilberte Doubtingly , and looking down . Do you speak truly ? Louise Gaily . Absolutely . And if you have no other objection to this union  --  Gil Gilberte Objections ! Oh , I 've plenty of them ; but I do n't know whether they amount to anything . So I will do as I have always done  --  place myself in your hands . Must I say yes , or no ? LOUISE about to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and before answering , think of everything . Louise I have thought of everything . Gil Gilberte And you believe  --  Louise I believe that Monsieur Sartorys will be too happy with you . for you not to be always happy with him . Gil Gilberte Smiling . So I must answer Yes ? Louise Kissing her . You must answer Yes . Enter BRIGARD , L. U. E. Brig Brigard Well , have you spoken to her ? Louise C. Yes . Brig Brigard And her answer ? Louise She consents . Brig Brigard Kissing GILBERTE . You little angel ! LOUISE goes down R. H. , just pressing handkerchief to her eyes , and recovering immediately . Gil Gilberte So you are satisfied , papa ? Brig Brigard I 'm delighted ! And now I can give that young rascal , Valreas , a categorical answer . Gil Gilberte Answer ! about what ? Brig Brigard Laughing . Why , he asked for your hand , too . Louise Turns , laughing . So he did . Gil Gilberte To BRIG . And that makes you laugh ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is very probable that if he had spoken to me I would have laughed more than either of you . Gravely . Who knows , perhaps that folly would have been the most reasonable . However , it is decided . Brig Brigard But  --  Gil Gilberte Do n't let 's say anything more about it . It is decided . Curtseys and laughs . Consider me an ambassadress . Goes R. to LOUISE . Brig Brigard C. So I can call in poor Sartorys , who is in the park ? Gil Gilberte In the park ? Brig Brigard Goes up C. Yes ; there he is , look at him . Gil Gilberte Laughing . Poor fellow ! Yes , call him in . Brig Brigard Sartorys , here ! Sartorys ! Come here , a moment , my boy ; I 've something to say to you . Enter VALREAS , L. 1 . E. , in full evening dress , with a large camelia in his button-hole . Val Valreas Well , you see I 'm not late for dinner ! Seeing every one silent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BRIG , L. C. Enter SARTORYS , quickly , L. U. E. LOUISE advances to meet him . GILBERTE remains R. C. SARTORYS C. Louise To SARTORYS . You will dine with us , Monsieur . Gilberte begs you to remain . Gil Gilberte Holding out her hand . Yes , I ask you . Sar Sartorys Crossing LOUISE and kissing GILBERTE 'S hand . Oh ! if you only knew how happy  --  LOUISE saunters up C. Gil Gilberte I know . They go up R. C. Val Valreas Aside to BRIGARD , bringing him down . What 's to become of me ? Brig Brigard Aside to VALREAS . Well , now , I hope you 'll let me alone . Val Valreas Same . Then I suppose I 'd better look after the widow ? Brig Brigard Same . She 's gone . Goes up C. to LOUISE . Val Valreas Gone ? Well , that 's consoling . Enter BARON and BARONESS , in full dress for dinner , L. 1 E. Val Valreas Ah , Baroness ! what a delicious toilet . Kisses her hand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VALREAS complacently . Bar Aside to VALREAS . What is going on ? Ah ! M. de Sartorys and Gilberte . I thought so . Val Valreas Exactly . It 's a match .

Picture of FROU FROU on easel above L. table . Chairs R. and L. Walls covered with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hat in hand , sitting on chair L. , with book and roll of music in hand . Pitou The greatest folly of a fashionable woman is to appear on the stage of a theater ; the next to the greatest folly is to wish herself there ; and the folly before that is to take part in private theatricals . Rises . But they all do the last  --  all . Goes to piano and touches it . Good instrument  --  musical taste , evidently . Yawns . I wish some one would come . I 've been waiting five minutes since I sent up my card . Adjusts eye-glass and looks from picture to picture . Not bad  --  not bad . Enter PAULINE , L. 1 . E. Pauline Madame will see you , sir , in a moment . She expected you . Monsieur Pitou , is it not ? Pitou Yes , Mademoiselle . M. Pitou , of the Theater Palais Royal . Pau Pauline Oh , yes ! you have been anxiously expected by Madame ! she wishes to see you about  --  about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know why ? PAULINE shakes her head . You her maid , and not know what she 's doing ? Pau Pauline Oh , I know when she goes out to walk with M. de Valreas . Pitou M. de Valreas is a charming gentleman . He adores Madame Sartorys ! eh ? Pau Pauline He may do what he pleases , but Madame adores only her husband . Pitou And does her husband approve of this little affair ? Pau Pauline What little affair ? Pitou Why , the private theatricals that Madame and the Baroness de Cambri and M. de Valreas are getting up . Pau Pauline Private theatricals ! oh , that Baroness ! she never gives a poor girl a chance to learn anything that she 's up to . So quiet  --  so sly ! Pitou Yes , very quiet now . Once on a time , when I was a little younger , she was the belle of Paris  --  such adventures , too ! Ha ! Pau Pauline And so they are getting up private theatricals ! and is my lady going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I bring her the prompt-book and music to-day for her part . Pau Pauline And what is her part ? Pitou Cleopatra , in the burlesque Vaudeville entitled " Antony and Cleopatra . " Do you know it ? PAULINE shakes her head . Why , Cleopatra is a little grisette who lodges in a garret . Antony is a poor devil of a fellow , who lives in the attic next to hers . They meet at a masked ball  --  they come home together  --  the sheriffs are about to seize him for debt  --  she lets him out of his attic into her garret  --  they elope , and the curtain falls . Pau Pauline And is madame  --  a lady  --  rich  --  distinguished  --  the wife of a Statesman like M. Sartorys  --  going to act the part of such a vulgar grisette ? Pitou Shrugging his shoulders . It 's only private theatricals , you know . Besides , the Baroness de Cambri and M. de Valreas selected the part . And then , you know , rich ladies like to act the parts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imitate the low lives they scorn . Now , you  --  you would like the part of a duchess if you were to act  --  would n't you ? Pau Pauline Would n't I ? I want to be a queen . Pitou Why do n't you go on the stage ? I 'll teach you . You have a good figure , if it 's properly dressed ; and a good face , if it were properly painted . Pau Pauline No , sir ! My face and figure are natural , and I 'm proud of it . Pitou Natural , my dear ! Eying her through glass , and patting her cheek . You must n't be proud of nature if you want to be an actress . No one wants to be natural on the stage , where the daylight is gas-lamps , the moon green calciums , the landscape painted canvasses , the gold dutch metal , and the diamonds tin ! Pau Pauline But I thought actors and actresses were praised because they were natural . Pitou Nature  --  nonsense ! The actor who should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the public would like him as little as they do raw meat on the table , although meat in a state of nature is raw . Human taste wants cookery , that 's all . Natural acting , my dear , is only nature , boiled , baked or roasted . Music . Gilberte Without . Pauline ! Pau Pauline Madame ! Enter GILBERTE C. from L. Gil Gilberte Pauline , send at once for my dress . I will not dine at home to-day , and I must have that dress . I must have it before six o'clock . Pau Pauline Yes , Madame . Exit R. 1 . E. Gil Gilberte To PITOU . You have lost no time , sir . Pitou Not when I knew it was Madame I was to oblige . Bows profoundly . Gil Gilberte You know me , then ? Pitou Oh , yes . I also know the father of Madame  --  M. Brigard  --  a very lively gentleman . He comes very often to our theater ; and sometimes behind the scenes , and sometimes  --  Gil Gilberte That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Giving book . Your rle in the Vaudeville . If Madame only knows the part by the printed book , Madame can have no idea of it . This is the complete part , with all the gags in the margin . Gil Gilberte The gags ! Sits on sofa . Pitou C. Yes , Madame ; the additions which the actors who played in the piece have added to their parts . Gil . Gilberte Very well ; and now we want the music . Pitou I have copied it . Giving roll . Gil Gilberte Reading . Air : " Galop du Tourbillon . " What air is that ? Pitou I will play it for Madame . Goes to piano . Like this . Gil Gilberte Will I be able to sing that ? Pitou Oh , yes , for Madame ca n't have a worse voice than some of our public singers . Will you practice it ? Gil Gilberte Go on , I 'll try . A knock is heard at the door . PITOU stops . It is repeated . Gil Gilberte Turning towardilleg . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sartorys Without . It is only me , dear . Gil Gilberte Oh , only you . Come in . Enter SARTORYS , R. 1 . E. My dear , this is M. Pitou , from the Theater . Go on , sir . Sar Sartorys From the theater ? Gil Gilberte Yes , you know . It 's about the little piece I 'm to play in for the benefit of the poor . Sar Sartorys I had something to say to you  --  but I 'm sorry I interrupted  --  Gil Gilberte Oh , M. Pitou can come again . You can come again , M. Pitou . Pitou Whenever you please , Madame . You have only to send me word at the Theater Palais Royale . Saluting . Monsieur  --  Madame ! Sar Sartorys C. Good morning , Monsieur . Exit PITOU , C. and L. Gil Gilberte Coming down to SARTORYS . You know what it 's all about . It 's for the performance  --  a magnificent performance  --  got up by Madame de Cambri , for the benefit of the poor . Sar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magnificent performance ? Gil Gilberte She do n't play anything  --  she gets it up . Sar Sartorys That 's her way . Gil Gilberte How her way ? Sar Sartorys I mean that while you and the others are running about , acting on the stage , she is sitting very tranquilly in front with the other guests , criticising your performance . Gil Gilberte Sitting on sofa . You do n't like her . Sar Sartorys I do n't like her , and I do n't dislike her . She is merely a woman of the world  --  that is all . Gil Gilberte And I  --  what am I ? Looking at him roguishly . Sar Sartorys Standing beside her . The most adorable little actress in the world . Gil Gilberte Very pretty , indeed . Turning over the leaves of her part . You wished to speak with me ? Sar Sartorys Yes . Gil Gilberte Turning over the leaves of her part and speaking heedlessly . Speak away . Sar Sartorys Looking discontentedly at the book she is studying . It was about something entirely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor . Gil Gilberte Same bus . Something serious ? Sar Sartorys Very serious ! Same bus . Gil Gilberte Same bus . That 's nice . Go on . Sar Sartorys Taking chair by sofa . My darling , I wanted to say  --  Gil Gilberte Interrupting him . What is the costume of a debardeur ? Sar Sartorys Surprised . The costume of a debardeur ? Gil Gilberte Oh , you ca n't make me believe you do n't know what the costume of a debardeur is . Sar Sartorys Why , the costume of a debardeur consists of a loose silk shirt and a  --  a  --  a pair of little pantaloons of velvet or satin . Gil Gilberte And what else ? Sar Sartorys Hum ! Buttons  --  plenty of buttons . Gil Gilberte And then ? Sar Sartorys A little cap . Gil Gilberte And after that ? Sar Sartorys Nothing . Gil Gilberte Nothing ! Oh , I 'll never wear that costume  --  not even for the benefit of the poor . I must find something else . And now , my dear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've seen the Minister of State this morning . Gil Gilberte Putting down book . You told him to come , of course . Sar Sartorys To come where ? Gil Gilberte To our performance . Sar Sartorys Well , no ; but I will tell him ! This morning we spoke of an appointment they have for me . They want me to take an embassy abroad . Gil Gilberte Alarmed . Abroad ? Sar Sartorys You see , there is nothing in Paris they can give me . Gil Gilberte Pettishly . And where do they want you to go ? Sar Sartorys To Carlsruhe ! Ambassador to Carlsruhe . Is n't that splendid ? Gil Gilberte Oh , very splendid . And how far is Carlsruhe from Paris ? Sar Sartorys I do n't know exactly  --  three or four hundred miles ; fifteen hours by rail . Gil Gilberte As far off as Baden ? Sar Sartorys It is very near Baden . Gil Gilberte Rising . Near Baden ! why did n't you say so before . Crosses L. you said it was abroad . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SARTORYS rises . You shall be Ambassador to Carlsruhe  --  that 's settled . SARTORYS takes her hand . I 'll go and pass the summer with you at Baden , and the balance of the year you will come to Paris and see me as often as you can . Sar Sartorys How ! Gil Gilberte Gleefully and rapid'y . And I may  --  but mind , I do n't promise it  --  I may come and surprise you at Carlsruhe . Sar Sartorys In a tone of disappointment . But  --  Gil Gilberte Stopping astonished . Why , you did n't think of taking me to Carlsruhe ? Sar Sartorys Why , yes . Gil Gilberte Alone  --  we two way off there  --  all the year ? Sar Sartorys Why not ? Gil Gilberte But that would be to die  --  of happiness , I know  --  but to die , nevertheless . Smiling and coaxingly . Come , you were not serious ? can you imagine Frou Frou without Paris ? Sar Sartorys Well to tell you the truth , I did ! GILBERTE turns away pettishly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things ; go to Carlsruhe without you , or decline the mission . Gil Gilberte R. H. Well . Sar Sartorys C. I have decided . Gil Gilberte Interested . You will go without me ? Sar Sartorys No ; I will decline . Gil Gilberte Ah , that will be right . Goes to him . Sar Sartorys Do you think so ? I doubt it myself . But one thing I 'm sure of  --  I have n't the heart to leave you . Gil Gilberte Putting her arm about him . You love me , then , a little still , after four years of marriage . Sar Sartorys Yes , Gilberte ! and I am only afraid that I do not know how to love . Gil Gilberte Archly . Oh , yes , you do . You know very well , for the very best way to love a wife is to let her do everything she wishes  --  because then , you know , the wife is bound in honor to do everything her husband wishes . Sar Sartorys Taking her hands in his . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After what you have done for me , can you doubt ? Sar Sartorys Then , suppose I ask you not to play at this performance . Gil Gilberte Withdrawing her hands . Oh , my love . Sar Sartorys Well . Gil Gilberte I thought you were going to ask me something reasonable . It is impossible for me to refuse to play now ; and then , you will see how pretty I will look in a debardeur costume  --  if they insist on it . But in anything I 'm sure to be pretty , and you will be so proud of me . Sar Sartorys What  --  with the pantaloons ? Looking at watch . I must go . Gil Gilberte Where ? Sar Sartorys To the Minister , to give my answer . On my way , I will see our little Georgie in the Park . Gil Gilberte Is n't Georgie here ? Sar Sartorys No ; we took advantage of the beautiful day to carry him out for a walk . He was ill , you know , this morning . Gil Gilberte He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But it was nothing . Gil Gilberte How could I know ? I told them to bring him to my room every morning . Rings bell on table sharply . And now I remember I have not seen him to-day . Enter PAULINE , R. 1 E. Pau Pauline The dress has come , Madame . Gil Gilberte I do n't want the dress  --  why was not Georgie brought to me this morning ? Pau Pauline The nurse brought him to your room , but you were asleep , and yesterday , when we brought him , we woke you , and you were angry . Gil Gilberte How dare you ? Sar Sartorys To GILBERTE . Never mind . To PAULINE . You can go . Exit PAULINE R. 1 E. Gil Gilberte I was angry ! What sort of way is that to speak ? Sar Sartorys You see , I would n't permit you to be spoken to in that way . After all , smiling she was right , though . GILBERTE about to speak . Now , I must go . Gil Gilberte You will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sar Sartorys Kissing her forehead and holding her for a moment . Ah , Gilberte , Gilberte ! Gil Gilberte Do n't be long . You know I dine with Madame de Cambri . Sar Sartorys When  --  to day ? I was not invited , was I ? Gil Gilberte Oh , no ! All our husbands are to be excluded , in order that we may have full liberty to talk about our costumes in the performance  --  you can dine at the club , ca n't you ? Sar Sartorys No ; I have some writing to do this evening . I 'll dine at home . Gil Gilberte What  --  all alone ? Sar Sartorys Alone ? oh , no ! I shall have Georgie . Good-by . Kisses her hand . Good-by . Exit C. and L. Gil Gilberte Snatching away her hand and standing , C. , pouting . With Georgie ! I understand what he means , but nothing is more unjust . Goes to sofa . It looks as if I did n't love my child . Sits . I love him as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their children . I ca n't take him myself to walk in the Park , and carry his hoop . Laughing and clapping her hands . I do n't know but that might be a pretty sight , though . It would be a novelty , anyway . Looking at clock . Bless me , almost three , and at this hour the Baroness was to be here with M. de Valreas to rehearse our scene . Jumping up. and I do n't know a word of my part . Opens the part which PITOU gave her , goes to piano , touches it and recites " I 've a pretty litte waist , Black hair and eyes of blue . " BRIGARD appears at C. Is that you , papa ? Brig Brigard Applauding . Go on , you little rogue , go on ! Gil Gilberte Singing . " I have a heart that burns and A face that must please you . " Brig Brigard Ha , ha , ha ! What are you singing comic opera music for ? Gil Gilberte Going to him , C. I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see you  --  and Louise ? Brig Brigard Very well , indeed . I 've come to say good-by . Gil Gilberte Are you going away ? Brig Brigard Yes  --  to-morrow morning . I 'm off to Bohemia . Gil Gilberte To Bohemia ! Laughs . Have you been appointed Ambassador to look after the theaters in Bohemia ? Brig Brigard Nonsense , my dear . It 's only one of my little freaks . You know how flighty I am . But I wanted to talk to you about Louise . Gil Gilberte You are not going to take her ? Brig Brigard No  --  and that 's the reason that  --  Gil Gilberte I see  --  you want her to come here . Brig Brigard Yes , until I come back . I shall be away three months . Gil Gilberte Well , she shall ; but not for three months , nor for six , but for always . Since she has taken it into her head never to marry , she shall live with me . You know , papa , how much I love Louise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again to induce her to come and live with me . She has always refused before and I do n't know why . Brig Brigard Do n't you ? Why , she was afraid of incommoding you . Gil Gilberte Why , we have four times as much room as we want . Brig Brigard That was n't it . She was afraid of interfering with your happiness . Gil Gilberte Oh , that was all very well during the honeymoon ; but now , after four years  --  Brig Brigard You 'd better not talk to her in that style  --  Gil Gilberte I know how to talk to her to make her stay with me . Brig Brigard Well , she 'll be here to-day ; all you have to do is to prevent her going away again . Gil Gilberte I 'll do that , if I have to lock the door . BARONESS appears at C. B'ness Baroness Can we come in ? Gil Gilberte Certainly . BARONESS comes down , followed by BARON . Brig Brigard R. I am delighted to see you Madame , since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Baron R. C. Going to leave us , Brigard ? Where to , now ? B'ness Baroness C. To Bohemia , I understand . Baron I believe Bohemia is celebrated for its hair-dye , is n't it ? Brig Brigard Well , I 'm not going there to lay in a stock of hair-dye , I assure you . Baron Well , I would n't go , either , if I wore a wig . All laugh . Brig Brigard Crossing up C. He , he , he ! Very funny . Allow me to wish you good day . B'ness Baroness Good-by , Bohemian . Brig Brigard Respect my gray hairs , Madame . B'ness Baroness Looking through eye-glass . I do n't see them . Brig Brigard True ; I forgot . I have n't had time to grow any yet . Baron Bravo ! Repent of your sins , old boy , and turn bald . BRIGARD exits C. and L. , followed by BARON . B'ness Baroness Sitting on sofa . That horrid man , my husband , my dear , met my carriage and would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him a little ; he has a claim on me . He 's my husband . But what is this I hear about your sister Louise coming here ? Gil Gilberte On sofa . Yes , she 's coming while papa 's away ; and after that I hope  --  B'ness Baroness You hope ? Gil Gilberte That she will never leave me . B'ness Baroness Regarding her closely . Ah ! Pause . And you will take her with you to Carlsruhe ? Gil Gilberte I am not going to Carlsruhe ! B'ness Baroness Sartorys is going alone , then ? Gil Gilberte He has declined the mission . B'ness Baroness I congratulate you , my dear . See what it is to be loved . Laughing . After that it 's unnecessary for me to ask if he consents to your taking part in our little theatrical performance . Gil Gilberte Well , he consents , but  --  B'ness Baroness Never mind the " buts , " my dear , so long as he consents . Have you studied your part ? Gil Gilberte All but the last scene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great success . I 'm sure of it . And Valreas , who is to act your lover in the piece  --  Gil Gilberte When he does act it ! He do n't study a word . B'ness Baroness Oh , he 'll play it , and for the best of reasons . Gil Gilberte What is that ? B'ness Baroness He 's dead in love with the person he 's to play with . Gil Gilberte Dead in love with me ! nonsense ! you who know him so well can believe that ? B'ness Baroness It 's just because I do know him so well that I say it . Gil Gilberte Crossing to L. Now you are laughing at me . B'ness Baroness C. I 've known Valreas to be in love when it was a laughing matter , but this time Gil Gilberte L. C. Well , this time ? Enter BARON C. from L. Baron Ladies , Valreas is coming up . B'ness Baroness R. C. Now , my dear , you shall see . Baron C. Hey ? See what ? B'ness Baroness Keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GILBERT L. C. Enter VALREAS , C. from L.

The news was true  --  your friend Sartorys is appointed to Carlsruhe , and Gilberte leaves us in eight days . Val Valreas Starting forward . How ? GILBERTE looking down and motionless B'ness Baroness Immediately after the performance . Val Valreas To GILBERTE , with emotion . You are going to leave Paris ? B'ness Baroness Aside to GILBERTE . What did I tell you ? Gil Gilberte Arousing herself . Come , let us begin the rehearsal . Crossing to R. B'ness Baroness To VALREAS . I was only joking  --  she 's not going to leave Paris  --  how could she ? Gil Gilberte R. C. Come  --  the rehearsal . Baron Rehearsal ! Bless me ! Where am I ? What part am I to take ?

Baron If I do n't see the whole performance , I want my money back . BARONESS crosses to and expostulates with him . Gil Gilberte To VALREAS I 'm sure you do n't know a word of your part . Val Valreas Do n't I ? I staid up all night to study it . Takes part out of his pocket . I 'll repeat it without looking at the book . To BARONESS . But you will be ready to prompt me ? B'ness Baroness Oh , I 'll take care of that . Gil Gilberte What is the scene ? Val Valreas The stage represents two apartments , separated by a wall . I 'll fix it . Places 2 chairs in C. up and down stage . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the door . Places a third chair for door . Cleopatra , that 's you , in one room ; Antony , that 's me , in the other . Gil Gilberte But I thought in the last scene Antony was in Cleopatra 's apartment . L. of chairs . Val Valreas L. of chairs . Oh , we 'll come to that . Now take your place there . Allow me to open the door . Pulls away middle chair , and GILBERTE passes through to R. H. Gil Gilberte Now we 're right . Where will you go , Baroness ? Baron Come , clear the stage . B'ness Baroness I 'll be prompter ; give me the book . Takes book , and sits L. down stage opposite BARON . Now we 're off .

Will you be quiet ? Baron I thought he was starting the applause . Go on . Gil Gilberte " He is gone ! he is gone ! " Baron Stop ! stop ! you said that before . Val Valreas Coming in front of chairs and bowing to BARONESS , then BARON . The management begs me say  --  Baron He 's going to apologize . Some of the actors are sick ; have to change the piece . Val Valreas  --  That unless order is preserved , the performance can not proceed Baron Applauds . To BARONESS . I suppose he means me . B'ness Baroness Sh !

Baron With the air of a connoisseur . Yes , very good ! Really very good . Gil Gilberte Is n't it ? " Pray , sir , no more of your fooling . " To Baron . And you will see at the performance I will do it even better . B'ness Baroness Now you . " Ah ! a light  --  " Val Valreas I know without prompting . " Ah ! a light breaks in upon me .

I hope that I did it then . B'ness Baroness That time it was excellent . Gil Gilberte Repeating . " Before the Mayor ? " Val Valreas " Quick ! quick ! open the door . " Gil Gilberte " No , no ; I dare not . To B'ness . What do I do then ? B'ness Baroness Referring to book . The book says you run to the window and look out . Gil Gilberte Oh , yes ; so I do .

Gil Gilberte Throwing down the middle chair , which represents the door . " So much the worse . Now let 's be off . " Val Valreas Rushing to her with outstretched arms , as if to embrace her . " Now we 'll be off . " Gil Gilberte Eluding him in earnest . Stop . What are you going to do ? VALREAS pauses . B'ness Baroness What 's the matter ? Go on . Val @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . B'ness Baroness Referring to book . He 's right . The book says , " He kisses her as they go off . " Gil Gilberte Does the book say that ? Comes down to BARONESS , who shows her the book . BARON also looks over it eye-glass . Baron Yes ; there it is . " He kisses her as they go off . " With emphasis . I should like to play that part myself . Crosses to his seat again . Gil Gilberte L. C. very promptly . Well , we 'll go off without that . Val Valreas C. As GILBERTE goes up . What ? I agreed to play the part on that account alone . Gil Gilberte Well , perhaps on the night of the performance I may  --  Val Valreas Sitting down . Very well ; I 'll perform it very badly if I do n't rehearse it . Baron Oh , he must rehearse it , you know . Here Going up. let me show you . B'ness Baroness Sit down , sir . BARON subsides . Gil Gilberte Come , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No I wont go on . Gil Gilberte I appeal to the Stage Manager . Turning to BARONESS . Ought he to kiss me at rehearsal ? B'ness Baroness Certainly  --  GILBERTE undecided , and turning away . Besides , my dear , you know it 's for the benefit of the poor . Gil Gilberte With an emotion which she tries to conceal . Well  --  if you say so . Baron Pitying GILBERTE 'S distress . Oh , well ; come , now ; if she do n't want to . BARONESS makes signs for him to be quiet . VALREAS jumps up , approaches GILBERTE , whose back is to him ( her face bowed , and turned up the stage ) and then stops . B'ness Baroness Well , what are you stopping for ? Val Valreas Confused . I  --  Approaching nearer to GILBERTE , with respect . Madame ! Takes a single lock of her hair in his hand , and presses it to his lips . At this moment , and on this picture , LOUISE appears in C. D. BARON and BARONESS rise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C. , looking with astonishment at all , and at the disordered furniture . Val Valreas Turning and picking up chairs . Take care , Mademoiselle , one moment . Replaces chairs . Louise Thank you . Gil Gilberte To LOUISE . We were rehearsing . Louise I 'm sorry if I interrupted you . B'ness Baroness Oh , as for me , I 'm glad you did , for we were almost at the end of the piece , and Looking at her watch . I had almost forgotten that I should be at home now . To BARON . Come along , my dear . Goes up C. as LOUISE crosses down L. , and speaks to GILBERTE , who still remains R. U. S. You intend to keep her with you ? BARON goes over to LOUISE , and tries to speak with her . She is intent on watching GILBERTE and BARONESS . Gil Gilberte Certainly ! B'ness Baroness Do n't forget that you dine with me to-day , and that we have another rehearsal to-morrow . Gil Gilberte I will not forget . B'ness Baroness Come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Somehow or other I do n't believe that young lady likes my wife . B'ness Baroness Up L. C. Valreas , your arm . Val Valreas C. Saluting GILBERTE Until we meet again , Madame . To LOUISE . Mademoiselle . Bows . Louise returns the salute gravely . VALREAS and BARONESS exeunt L. C. BARON goes to GILBERTE R. C. Shakes hands with her ; then crosses to LOUISE , but scared by her demeanor , hurries out L. C. Gil Gilberte Running to LOUISE . My dear , dear Louise . Louise Dear sister ! Kisses her affectionately . What has happened ? Gil Gilberte Archly . Do n't you know ? LOUISE signifies " No . " A great happiness is in store for me . Sit down here with me . Places her arm about LOUISE and leads her to sofa . Louise After they sit . Well ? Gil Gilberte Taking both LOUISE 'S hands . Suppose I have a sister ! Louise A sister ? Gil Gilberte Yes ; a sister whom I love very much ; and suppose , after being separated from her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a sudden , when I can hope to keep her with me forever ! Louise What do you mean , my dear Gilberte ? Gil Gilberte That now you are come , you are to remain with me all my life . I have arranged it with papa . Louise But I have heard nothing of this . Enter SARTORYS , C. from L. Sar Sartorys Taking LOUISE 'S hands . Ah ! they told me I should find you here . Gil Gilberte Have you seen the Minister ? Sar Sartorys Yes . Gil Gilberte And what did you tell him ? Sar Sartorys What I promised . All is finished . Gil Gilberte Ah ! how much I love you for that . And to console you for the mission you have lost at Carlsruhe , I give you a mission to perform here . Sar Sartorys A mission ? Gil Gilberte Yes ; and an important one , too . Papa is to leave to-morrow for three months ; and he and I have arranged that Louise shall remain with us while he is away ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gil Gilberte You must decide the rest . Louise Troubled . Gilberte ! What are you saying ? Gil Gilberte To SARTORYS . She thinks that she will incommode us . You must tell her she is foolish to say such things ; and that instead of being in the way , her presence here will be of the greatest service . You know how to manage her ; and you can persuade her to stay , if you tell her she has a duty to fulfill here . GILBERTE throughout this speech is speaking to SARTORYS , and at LOUISE , to whom her eye now and then wanders significantly . Tell her that there are ever so many important things for her to do here  --  wearisome things , in fact , that bore me , and exhaust me , but will make her happy  --  they always did ; for she loves serious duties . Rises and crosses to L. of him . You tell her everything you can think of to make her stay . I have n't a moment 's time to spare now ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much . Pointing to SAR . Only see how lucky it is you came in as you did , for he was going to dine here  --  all alone . And now you can dine with him . Moving off L. I give him to you . You must take my place . LOUISE rises , as if about to speak . Not a word ; it 's fixed . I 'll run and tell them to serve dinner for two ; there now . Runs out L. 1 E. Sar Sartorys Taking hands of LOUISE . Gilberte is right . You must stay with us . I wo n't hear any denial . It 's settled . Louise But it is not settled . Sar Sartorys Laughing . Not if I get vexed ? Louise Not if you get vexed . Sar Sartorys Not even if I beg you to remain ? Louise Crossing . Not even if you beg me to remain . Sar Sartorys Seriously . Louise ! Taking her hands . You will render Gilberte and myself a great service by staying with us ; for then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he needed no longer . Louise Withdrawing her hand . What is needed here ? Sar Sartorys A wife . Louise What is this you tell me ? Sar Sartorys I say that what is needed in this household is a wife ; and you know it , although you pretend that you do not . Pause . Louise With emotion . What has happened ? Sar Sartorys Nothing has happened . Everything is the same now as always , with us . I love Gilberte more than ever I did . Louise I know it . With a smile . But I do n't see what great misfortune that is . Sar Sartorys You do n't see ? Louise No . Sar Sartorys Then you shall . This morning I was appointed Minister to  --  . You have heard of it ? Louise Yes ; and I was prouder than ever of you . Sar Sartorys I told Gilberte , and she said to me she would never consent to leave Paris . Louise And then you  --  Sar Sartorys I refused the honor they would have conferred upon me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same satisfaction that I would feel in making her a present , no matter how simple . And yet by that refusal I know I have sacrificed that brilliant fortune that had been my life-long dream . I refused it because I love Gilberte , and she permitted me to do so  --  because she loves me not . Louise Sartorys ! Sar Sartorys When you gave Gilberte to me  --  because it was you who gave her to me  --  Louise Turning partly away . Yes ; it was I. Sar Sartorys You said to me , " You are the fittest husband for Gilberte ; and her frivolity will cause me less fear for her , when she is the wife of a man so wise as you . " You did not think then what so wise a man as I could become . Those faults in her which made you fear , and which I might have cured by a little firmness , I refused to perceive then , because I loved her . I love her to-day as I loved her from the first ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Gilberte the same faults , only the faults have become greater . Louise But her child ? Sar Sartorys She adores him . A little while ago Georgie was seriously ill . Gilberte passed eight nights at his side , sleeping but an hour at a time . By day she was never from him . Her love and watchfulness alone snatched him from the grave . He recovered ; then for whole weeks she saw him only five minutes in the morning and five minutes at night . Louise Who took care of him then ? Sar Sartorys His governess ; and I , when I could . Louise What you tell me is dreadful . Sar Sartorys Yes . And if Gilbert and I must remain alone , abandoned to one another , who can tell what will be the end of it all . Taking her hands again . But if some one else  --  Louise Some one else  --  Sar Sartorys Some one who is good , and kind , and wise , would come between us ; would take control of this household , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoids , and which I have not the will to press upon her . Louise But you must ; it is your duty . Sar Sartorys I know it is my duty ; but I have not the strength to perform it against her . You can now see how the danger which now threatens this house , and which I know not how to avert , may become greater every day . Smiling . It is one of those situations of which it is difficult to speak without a smile : a frivolous wife and an indulgent husband . They have been seen before  --  they will be seen again ; and that is all there is the matter here ! The danger is about us . Neither Gilberte nor I can avert it ; but I sincerely believe you can defend us against it . Louise In a low voice . You think so ? Sar Sartorys We must keep you with us . The course pointed out by Gilbert was right ; and now you know you have a duty to perform . Louise Facing him . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an accident more providential than that which sent you to us . Louise It is well . I remain . Sar Sartorys Thanks . Enter VINCENT , with a package of letters and papers , and a shaded lamp , lighted , which he places on table R. Louise Aside . Crossing to R. H. COR . This , then , is their happiness ! Music . Enter GILBERTE R. 1 E. , " en grande toilette , " noisily . GEORGIE , unperceived by her , is holding on to her skirt , and half hidden by it . Gil Gilberte I am late . To VINCENT . Order the carriage immediately . VINCENT still fixing papers at table . Do you hear ? immediately ! To SARTORYS . She will stay , wo n't she ? Exit VINCENT , C. Sar Sartorys Yes . Gil Gilberte C. Then this is a good day 's work . I 'm so glad . Goes towards LOUISE , but perceives that GEORGIE has hold of her skirt . Take care , take care ; you will tear me ! Repulses him brusquely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Come to me , Georgie . Gil Gilberte Yes , go to your aunt . GEORGIE runs to LOUISE and embraces her . Gil Gilberte You see you did well to remain . Your duties begin at once . You will all dine together very nicely . But let me see : before I go , I must install you . To SARTORYS , seating him in chair . Now , here are your letters , and your papers , and your darling politics . She spreads on the table before SARTORYS the letters , &c.,; which VINCENT brought in . And you , Louise , you will sit there in my place . Places arm-chair by chimney , to which LOUISE crosses with GEORGIE . Enter VINCENT . C. from L. Vincent The carriage , Madame . Exits C. Gil Gilberte Going up C. Now , I must be off . Stops in doorway and looks back . How charming you all took , that way . Laughing . A delightful little family group . Kissing her hand to each . For you . To LOUISE . For Georgie . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glee . SARTORYS looking after her . LOUISE bending down embracing GEORGIE . Quick curtain . ACT III . SCENE .  --  Same as Act II . Enter BARON followed by VINCENT . Baron As he enters . You are sure the Baroness has not called here this morning ? Vincent Positive , Monsieur , no one has called to-day ; not even M. de Valreas . Baron Why do you say " not even " M. de Valreas ? Vin Vincent Because he comes here every day . Baron The young jackanapes ! and what does he come for ? Vin Vincent I suppose to see master , although he always sees Madame . Baron Looking at him sharply . Eh ? VINCENT smiles , shrugs his shoulders and goes to mantel . Baron What an imprudent little creature Gilberte is ! The servants begin to talk , and what 's worse , to shrug their shoulders . Hang the rascals . Goes to sofa , picks up a book and turns his back on others . Enter PAULINE , R. Pauline Vincent , has the porter returned with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The answer ? Pau Pauline " The answer "  --  Stupid , yes , the answer  --  do n't I speak plainly ? Vin Vincent Lazily . Let me see , the letter was to M. de Valreas , was n't it ? BARON looks up from his book . Pau . Pauline What are you saying things over and over for ? you know Madame is waiting impatiently . Vin Vincent Yes ? Well the porter has not yet returned with the answer . Pau Pauline Then go along with you , and do n't stop dawdling here . VINCENT curls his moustache and smiles . What are you smiling about ? Vin Vincent Oh , nothing ! But I will go watch for the porter who brings the letter for Madame from M. de Valreas . Sauntering up . Pau Pauline What airs you put on . Let me tell you if you look that way , ' ll inform Madame Sartorys . Vin Vincent Oh , no ! you 'd better inform M. Sartorys . Pau Pauline Well , I will , if you like that better . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at and shrugged at all over the house by you or anybody else . Baron Dropping book . Bravo ! That 's right ! To VINCENT . Now you go and grin somewhere else about the house , will you ? Vin Vincent Certainly , if Monsieur wishes it , with pleasure . Exits C. , with final smile at PAULINE who turns away impatiently , and he goes off shrugging his shoulders . Pau Pauline I beg pardon , Baron . Baron What for ? For defending your mistress ? Do n't , you are right . My wife 's maid does the same thing . I like to hear her . Pau Pauline My mistress does nothing to require defense . Baron That 's right . I like to hear it . Pau Pauline Becoming excited . Madame is everything that 's good  --  but these self-sufficient valets they think they see more than any one else . Baron So they do  --  but they do n't . Pau Pauline More excited . No , indeed  --  for there 's nothing to see . Baron Of course not . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's receiving an answer to letter ; if you write a letter , it 's natural to expect an answer . Baron It is  --  it certainly is  --  do n't get into a passion about it . Pau Pauline I know I came from the country , but I know my place better than to act like this fellow , who is always talking and shrugging his shoulders whenever M. de Valreas comes here . What 's it his business , I 'd like to know . Suppose your servants , Baron , should talk to one another , and smile and shrug their shoulders whenever a young gentleman came to see your wife , and suppose  --  Baron Uneasily . No , do n't  --  do n't suppose it . My servants never smile except when they get their wages , and I have their coats made so tight that they ca n't shrug their shoulders . Pau Pauline Oh , that 's excellent . Baron Yes , a man must get round his servants somehow . But let 's change the subject . I 'm waiting here for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  that is , she says she does . Pau Pauline Oh , yes , Monsieur . Sometimes alone , and sometimes with M. de Valreas ! Baron Crossing L. Oh , hang de Valreas ! Enter GILBERTE , R. C. , salutes BARON who bows . Baron I thought perhaps my wife might be here . She said she was coming . If I 'm not in the way  --  Ail Coming down C. By no means . BARON goes up L. C. Pauline ! Pau Pauline R. C. Yes , Madame . Gil Gilberte Low and with emotion . The messenger has not returned ? Pau Pauline Low and modestly . No , Madame ! Gil Gilberte That will do . Exit PAULINE , R. 1 E. Coming down . Aside . What will be his answer ? To such a letter there can be but one answer ; that he obeys me , and will leave Paris at once . Enter BARONESS , C. from L. , dressed for walking and in a great hurry . B'ness Baroness To GILBERT , without regarding BARON . Ah , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ah , my dear ! Advances towards her with outstretched hands ; she passes him and goes to GILBERTE , who is near L. C. , and who extends her hands quietly and without demonstration . Baron rubs his chin and goes over to R. B'ness Baroness Get your bonnet , my dear , and come out with me , quickly . Gil Gilberte Listlessly . Where ? Sits at table . B'ness Baroness Oh , such a sensation ! you remember the account in the papers about the jealous husbands in the Rue du Petit , who came home suddenly the other morning , and shot the other poor fellow , and then escaped ; you remember the papers were full of it . Well , the house is going to be sold  --  furniture and all  --  and every one is going there to look at it ; not to buy much , only a keepsake or so . You must come with me , we will pick up something . Baron I would n't go there , my dear , if I were you . B'ness Baroness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with bad consciences ought not to . You ai n't afraid I 'll come home suddenly some morning and shoot you or anybody else , in our house , are you ? Baron No , my dear , husbands are not generally shot . B'ness Baroness More 's the pity  --  they deserve it . Baron Oh ! well , my dear , if you do go to this sale , and pick up " anything " as you say  --  B'ness Baroness Well ? Baron Do n't let it be the example of the lady of the house . Exits in a pet , C. and L. B'ness Baroness Rely on that , dear ! By-by ! But come , my dear Gilberte , put on your things . Gil . Gilberte Seriously . You must go without me B'ness . Baroness C. Why ? Gil Gilberte Constrainedly . I can not go . But do n't let that hinder you . You can go alone . Rises . B'ness Baroness Astonished at GILBERTE 'S manner . Of course I can . But come here a little my dear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me look at you . Gil Gilberte Looking at her . Well ! B'ness Baroness Drawing a long breath . Hem ! I do n't know ! Too serious for such a pretty face , much to serious . Gil Gilberte Does that make you uneasy ? B'ness Baroness Seriousness is a bad sign in a house that is not used to it . And what makes me really uneasy , my dear , is I think I can divine the cause . Significantly . Gil Gilber te No , no , you can not , I assure you . Quickly . B'ness Baroness So much the better , if I am deceived  --  and a certain hot-headed young fellow of my acquaintance , named Valreas has nothing to do with it . Gil Gilberte Starting . Valreas ? B'ness Baroness Has n't he now ? Not the least bit ? Gil Gilberte Well , yes , he is concerned  --  B'ness Baroness Interrupting her . I thought so . Gil Gilberte Quickly . But you are deceived very much indeed , if you think there is anything serious . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Enter VINCENT with a letter , C. from L. Is that the answer from M. de Valreas ? Vin Vincent Yes , Madame . Gil Gilberte Ah ! Takes letter from VINCENT and opens it eagerly . VINCENT exits looking back and shrugging his shoulders as he goes off . GILBERTE hands the letter to the BARONESS . There ! Crosses to sofa while BARONESS reads . B'ness Baroness Reads . " You order me to leave Paris . I go to-night . " Gil Gilberte Earnestly and turning . Now you see . Sitting . B'ness Baroness I see that there is more danger than I supposed . For him to send such a letter to you  --  you must have written to him . Sitting beside her . Gil Gilberte Of course . A letter in which I ordered him to leave Paris . B'ness Baroness In which you ordered him to ? Come , my dear , see what a position you are in ! You remember how I laughed at first , when we had our rehearsals , let me see  --  two months ago , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only play  --  an agreeable way of passing the time ; I never dreamed of your taking it seriously , for I thought I had to do with a reasonable woman , a woman like myself , and if any one had suggested seriously that I should fall in love with another man than my husband , it would absolutely look to me as if , after submitting to a sound drubbing for the sake of duty , I had solicited another for the sake of pleasure . Those are my principles ; I thought they were yours too , for who could imagine , that Valreas , a mere boy , a charming boy to be sure , but perfectly laughable as a lover , could inspire a real sentiment , and become  --  well , I wo n't say dangerous . Gil Gilberte You may say dangerous . Smiling . B'ness Baroness No I wo n't . I do n't want to say it . Gil Gilberte Yes , dangerous ! And I 'm glad of it . BARONESS starts . Because the knowledge of this danger that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my head ; Smiling. and when that entered , several others equally serious , slipped in after it . B'ness Baroness Warningly . Take care , my dear ! Gil Gilberte A number of things to which I never paid any attention , now appear to me in their true light . Do you remember what you said to me the day I told you my sister was coming to live with us here ? B'ness Baroness What did I say ? Gil Gilberte You said  --  " Ah ! " B'ness Baroness Well that was n't much . Gil Gilberte Well , after Louise had been installed here , I began to perceive that it was less agreeable to me than I thought at first . When I saw her take so gently , so aptly , my place beside my child , beside my husband , there came to me certain thoughts , and I recalled your " Ah ! " and I began to understand it . B'ness Baroness Perhaps it would have been better if you had not seen so much . Gil Gilberte Resolutely . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but I shall put a stop to all this by taking a decisive step . Rising excitedly . B'ness Baroness Alarmed . A decisive step ? Gil . Gilberte Crossing . Yes . B'ness Baroness Rising . What step ? you frighten me . Gil Gilberte Excitedly  --  returning and stopping C. I am determined to regain the place I have lost ; to commence to live very differently from the manner in which I have lived up to this day . BARONESS smiles incredulous'y . You do n't believe that I can ? B'ness Baroness Oh , yes , I believe it . Gil Gilberte Crossing to sofa . Believe it or not , as you please , I am decided . Sits . B'ness Baroness Going over to her . A word of advice , my dear Gilberte . Drop your grand resolutions . Do n't become a stupid , jealous wife  --  do n't ! Come with me  --  run in debt  --  live faster than ever  --  show yourself at the opera in a dress that will draw every eye upon you  --  or better than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever you like , but make it something in that line ! People will talk about you , you will get a bad name perhaps , and every one will believe you are a gone case , but you will be saved ! At the rate you are driving , you fear you will be run away with and dashed to pieces ; so you are frightened and want to jump out . If you do you will be destroyed . Do n't jump out  --  on the contrary , whip up your horses , drive along faster than ever , and the husband of whom you are now jealous will follow you , will be jealous of you , and you will be saved . That 's wisdom ! That 's my advice . Rising . Will you put on your hat , my dear , and come with me to see the house where the one poor devil shot the other poor devil ? Gil Gilberte Pleasantly . No . B'ness Baroness Going up C Well , you 're wrong . Good-by , dear . Gil Gilberte Good-by ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you wo n't follow my advice , listen to this , at least . If I were in your place , I would stay home for forty eight hours , and during that time , I would think of nothing , do nothing , but try to become calm . Gil Gilberte Excitedly rising , and crossing abruptly to L. I have never been calmer , or more tranquil . B'ness Baroness Oh ! Then good-by , my dear . Exits C. and L. GILBERTE rings bell on table . Enter PAULINE L. 1 E. Pau Pauline Madame . Gil Gilberte Has M. Sartorys gone out yet ? Pau Pauline I believe not . Gil Gilberte Say to him I wish to speak with him . Pau Pauline Yes , Madame . Exits L. 1 E. Gil Gilberte Looking at VALREAS ' letter . Poor fellow ! The Baroness was right ; who would ever believe that he could become seriously in love ? For he does love me ; and he leaves Paris ! It is well . Tears letter up in little pieces and throws it in fireplace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if my dear sister will consent to yield to me the place which is mine . Enter LOUISE , R. 1 E. , dressed for the street , and putting on gloves . Louise Good morning , Gilberte ! Gil Gilberte C. You are going out ? Enter SARTORYS L. H. Sar Sartorys You wish to speak with me , Gilberte ? Gil Gilberte Merely turning her head . Yes ! To LOUISE . Where are you going ? Louise To Madame de Lussy 's ; she recommends the new governess we have engaged for Georgie . Gil Gilberte Aside and bitterly . We have engaged ! Aloud . I will go myself . Sar Sartorys Sitting C. Laughingly . If you go to Madame de Lussy 's I know in advance what will happen . You will both chat for an hour over some new toilet , and never once think of the governess . Let Louise go . Gil Gilberte Turning away to the L. Be it so . Louise Up C. To SARTORYS . Do n't forget that you are to go at three o'clock to see about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gaily . I sha n't forget , my little man of business . Gil Gilberte Aside . That we wish to buy . Louise Is that all ? Yes  --  let me see ! yes , that is all . By-by , Frou Frou ! Kisses GILBERTE , and exits C. and L. Sar Sartorys His manner is paternal  --  a little too paternal , during this scene . Well , my darling ! Brings his chair down C. and makes GILBERTE sit on a stool beside him . Gil Gilberte Holding down her head . I wanted to tell you  --  that is  --  Sar Sartorys Is it something very hard to say , then ? Gil Gilberte Yes , very hard  --  it is something like a confession . Sar Sartorys Earnestly . A confession ? Gil Gilberte I was going to accuse myself  --  Sar Sartorys Ah , I see ; we have been extravagant  --  we have run into debt , Frou Frou ? Patting her head . Gil Gilberte Impatiently . No , it is not that . Sar Sartorys Of what have you to accuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SARTORYS shakes his head . Of having been a little frivolous and giddy  --  even after our marriage , even after the birth of little Georgie  --  in fact , of having always remained Frou Frou , and of not having become  --  Sar Sartorys Is that all ? Why you almost frightened me . I see nothing very dreadful in all that . Gil Gilberte Nothing ? Sar Sartorys Nothing at all ! Gil Gilberte But some time ago you spoke differently . No , Smiling. you did not speak , but in place of words your face , your silence itself seemed to utter the fears that troubled you then , and to show me the danger that threatened . Putting her hand on his shoulder . Sar Sartorys Yes , that was two months ago , but since those two months  --  Gil Gilberte Since then  --  Sar Sartorys Louise has been here . Gil Gilberte Louise ! Sar Sartorys All the danger has disappeared ; and now if it should please Frou Frou to be more Frou Frou than ever , the harm would not be very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gil Gilberte And how if I wished to attend myself to those things which my sister takes such good care of ? Sar Sartorys What an idea , now that everything is working so smoothly and safely . Gil Gilberte You think everything is safe ? Sar Sartorys Look around you , my dear Gilberte , and tell me if you ever saw a house better governed than ours since Louise has taken control . See what care she takes of Georgie , and how well she is bringing up the child ; and even I myself , have you not noticed that since Louise has been here I have acquired a certain air of content ? Gil Gilberte Earnestly . But if I really wished  --  if I were really resolved to become better and wiser , and to govern myself ? Sar Sartorys Your zeal is too praiseworthy not to be encouraged , and I will encourage it by all the means in my power , but  --  Gil Gilberte But what ? Sar Sartorys But if , despite your resolution and my encouragement , this ardor should die @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or say a fortnight , my little Gilberte becomes wearied , do n't consider yourself bound to continue ! Return as fast as you please to your pleasures , your triumphs , and your gaieties ; neither my face nor my silence shall reproach you , and I shall be content to remain the husband of the prettiest darling and most adored little wife in the world . Gil Gilberte Rising and speaking quietly . That appointment which was offered you , and which you refused on my account ? Sar Sartorys No , I can not go there now . Government might have felt hurt at my refusal , but on the contrary , I have been treated with marked kindness , and I have now in Paris a position almost equivalent to the other . All 's well that ends well , and so you see , you really have not as much to reproach yourself with as you thought . Gil Gilberte Looks at him peculiarly for a second and then goes to chair R. of small table . What I really see is , that all my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give you full credit for them . Gil Gilberte Sarcastically . Really . Sar Sartorys Going to her . And I wish to reward you for them . That span of horses you liked so much , and which I thought so expensive . Gil Gilberte I do n't want them now . Sar Sartorys Astonished . You do n't want them ? Enter BRIGARD , C. from L. Brig Brigard Good morning , daughter . Sar Sartorys Ah , M. Brigard ! Brig Brigard Good morning , my dear boy . Sar Sartorys You have come just in time . Gilberte is a little nervous , and you know how to put her in good humor . Brig Brigard To GILBERTE . Nervous ! Now really . Gil Gilberte Good morning , father . Brig Brigard Oh , it wo n't last ! You must do me a particular favor daughter . The other day when you were skating in the Park , you wore a new kind of cap  --  and Madame de Laurens , who saw you in it , wants one just like it . I promised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't refuse me , your father , and so I promised her . GILBERTE rings bell on table . You really will ? Gil Gilberte I will give orders to have it brought to you . Brig Brigard That 's an angel . Enter PAULINE , L. 1 E. GILBERTE whispers to her . BRIGARD takes SARTORYS down R. H. corner . Brig Brigard Aside to SARTORYS . Hum ! my boy , do n't mention Madame de Laurens or the cap , to any one outside . I 'll do as much for you . Pokes him in the side . Sar Sartorys Gravely . As you wish . They go up . PAULINE exits L. 1 E. GILBERTE crosses to sofa R. , and sits . Sar Sartorys To BRIGARD . I 'll leave you with Gilberte , do try and restore her spirits . I do n't know what it is affects her to-day . Brig Brigard All right , my dear boy . Goes to mantel L. , and arranges his hair before glass . Sar Sartorys To GILBERTE . So that span of horses ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I tell you ? Sar Sartorys Smiling gaily . Well , then , you know I am a positive man , and whether you want them or not , you shall have them . Goes to BRIGARD C. , and whispers . Brig Brigard She wo n't have a span ? then give her a four-in-hand . SARTORYS exits C. and L. laughing . Gil Gilberte Aside , feelingly . When I want to come back to him and be really and truly his wife , that is how he treats me . Brig Brigard Crossing to piano . Do you know , my love , your husband is a very nice fellow ? Gil Gilberte After all he is right . Louise is here . I am not needed any more ! He speaks to me as if I were a child . Brig Brigard Touching the piano . Very nice fellow ! Very nice ! GILBERTE bursts into tears . Rising in astonishment and coming round to her . What , tears ? What does this mean , Gilberte ? Gil Gilberte Turning from him . Nothing , father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hope ! And even if it be , am I not here , I , your father ? Gil Gilberte Bitterly . Oh , yes ! Brig Brigard " Oh , yes ! " What do you mean by " Oh , yes ? " I know that now and then I may seem to be a little  --  and then my hair is n't  --  confound it , but that does n't prevnt my being your father after all . Enter PAULINE , L. 1 E. , with cap . And as your father , I  --  Pau Pauline Is this what you wished , Madame ? Gil Gilberte What 's that ? Yes that 's it . Takes it , and hands it to her father , and hand holding handkerchief to her eyes . That is what you asked for ? Brig Brigard Taking the cap , but embarrassed . Being your father as I said  --  yes . Looking at cap . That 's it ! Being your father as I said  --  Gil Gilberte Well , what more do you wish ? Brig Brigard Nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But what ? Brig Brigard Well , that 's not the point now . Giving cap to PAULINE . Have this taken to my carriage . Exit PAULINE , C. and L. Deuce take me , it sha n't be said I have n't done my duty once in my life ! Come now , daughter , tell me why you were crying a while ago . Gil Gilberte For nothing , father . Brig Brigard For nothing ? Gil Gilberte Yes , you know there are times when we feel so . Sits C. Brig Brigard Yes , there are moments ! I feel that way myself sometimes . But tell me ; there is something serious in all this , and the affection I have for you  --  you do n't doubt my affection I hope , and if you have need of a protector , you would n't hesitate to fly to my paternal ; eh ? And those tears  --  your nerves ; eh ? Oh , yes , that 's it , nerves ! I was sure of it ! Just my way ! We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , let 's speak of Louise ; I might as well attend to her case , now that I am started on family topics . Sits beside GILBERTE . Gil Gilberte Quickly . Louise ! Brig Brigard Being uncomfortable in chair C. , goes to R. and sits in arm-chair . Yes , Monsieur de Villaroel comes here pretty often , do n't he ? I may say very often . Gil Gilberte Smiling . Well , yes . Brig Brigard And you never suspected ? Gil Gilberte What could I have suspected ? Brig Brigard Well , I did n't suspect either . I have two daughters , and I should once in a while suppose that once in a while some one might fall in love with one as well as the other . And that 's exactly what has occurred . I have just received a visit from M. de Villaroel , and the reason why he called here so often was  --  Louise . Gil Gilberte For Louise ? He proposed for her ? Rises and goes to BRIGARD . Brig Brigard Yes , he loves her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BRIGARD 'S knee . Oh , you dear , good papa ! you ca n't imagine how happy this news has made me . There can be no reason for refusing such an offer . Have you spoken to Louise yet ? Brig Brigard No , not yet . I would have done so had she been here  --  and most likely she would have answered me as she has always done  --  that she do n't want to marry . Gil Gilberte Rising and firmly . She must not answer that now . Brig Brigard No , certainly not . She must not ! Strange woman your sister  --  eh ? How she dislikes going into society ; and her determination not to marry . Do you know what I think , Gilberte ? Louise must have loved some one once . Gil Gilberte Deeply moved and turning away . You think so ? Brig Brigard She must once have dreamed of a happiness of which we know nothing , and which she has lost . Gil Gilberte Turning suddenly . Father ! Brig Brigard Rising abruptly and looking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your mind and see if it does n't seem probable . Goes to glass , takes his hat up and arranges his hair . Gil Gilberte But , father  --  Follows him to C. Brig Brigard You can easily find out all about it . Between women , especially between sisters , things may be said which  --  there , there you must question her . Say to her , too , that M. de Vallaroel is a charming gentleman , high estate , plenty of money , no vices  --  and she must positively consent to marry him . Gil Gilberte Resolutely . Oh , as for that ! Shaking her head with determination . Brig Brigard You will do all you can to make her consent ? Gil Gilberte Firmly . Yes , everything in the world  --  and she shall consent . Brig Brigard C. Well , that 's fixed . Since you take it in hand there 's no need of my bothering about it . GILBERTE smiles . There , you are smiling again ! It does me good to see that ! But when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  I feel  --  there , there ! you must not be unhappy , Gilberte ! you must not ! Do you know that if you took it into your head to be unhappy I should be an abominable father ? But you wo n't , will you ? One arm around her waist while he arranges his shirt bosom with the other . You love your paternal parent too much ! You will be happy , if not for your own sake , at least for your dear father 's sake . Kissing her . You promise me , do n't you ? Good-by . Do n't forget to talk to your sister as soon as she comes in . About to go . Ah , what did I do with that cap ? Oh , I remember , it 's in my carriage . Tah , tah , Frou Frou ! Exits C. and L. Gil Gilberte Solus C. She will not refuse this time ! She can not refuse ! But if she should ? If she will not leave us  --  if she will still remain between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Who will save me from the wretchedness , the fate , to which they drive me . I have no husband , no father , to whom I can turn ! Ah ! my child , my child is left me . He is there and near him I can be strong Enter VINCENT , C. from L. Gil Gilberte What is it ? Vin Vincent Smiling meaningly . Monsieur de Valreas  --  GILBERTE starts . He desires to know if Madame  --  Gil Gilberte Valreas I will not  --  Sees VINCENT smile and look at her in a manner peculiar inquiry . Show in M. de Valreas , and tell Pauline to dress Georgie immediately and bring him to me ; I will take him out for a walk . Enter VALREAS C. from L. VINCENT exits , C. and L. GILBERTE turns harshly to VALREAS , who comes forward a single step . Do you know why I consent to receive you ? Because that servant stood there and seemed to question why I close my doors against you . Val Valreas All earnestness . I have but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the better , for I have but a few moments to spare . Pauses . Why have you come here after that letter which I wrote you ? Could you not understand that we must meet no more ? Val Valreas In that letter you ordered me to leave Paris . Gil Gilberte Well ? Val Valreas I leave to-night . Did I not tell you so ? Gil Gilberte More harshly . I know very well you told me so , but what proof have I ? Val Valreas You have no right to doubt me . To you I never spoke anything but the truth . Gil Gilberte Softening . Very well  --  you will go . I wish it . You should have gone without trying to see me . Val Valreas I could not . Gil Gilberte Harshly again . You could not ? Val Valreas You must not ask too much ? Think of what I was , and what I am . Who would recognize me ? I would have laughed at any one who would have predicted that I  --  one day , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first I thought I would be strong  --  leave Paris without seeing , without speaking to you . Gil Gilberte That is what you should have done . Val Valreas I did not have the courage . After a few moments this enthusiasm left me  --  I could think of but one thing  --  That I was to be separated from you ; it overcame me ! I thought that if you had the right to ask such a sacrifice of me , I had the right to ask of you a few words at parting ; a few words that would give me strength to obey you . Gil Gilberte Well , I  --  Enter PAULINE , L. 1 E. Pau Pauline Madame  --  Gil Gilberte With a joyful cry . Ah , Georgie ! Bring him to me at once . Pau Pauline But , Madame  --  Gil Gilberte To VALREAS , interrupting PAULINE . I have no time to spare . I am going out ; you understand , I am going out with my son . Pau Pauline Master Georgie is not here , Madame . Gil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Madame . Mademoiselle Louise took him with her when she went out . Gil Gilberte Violently . Louise ! Trying to calm herself . Very well , Pauline  --  since Mademoiselle Louise has taken him out , that will do . Exit PAULINE , L. 1 E. GILBERTE sinks into a chair , L. Not even my child is left . She has taken from me everything . Val Valreas Trembling and coming a step toward her . Gilberte ! Gil Gilberte Turning pleadingly to him . Oh , you will go , will you not ? You must go now , more than ever . Swear to me you will go . You know that I do not love you , that I will never love you . You should know it  --  and love me ; that is why you must fly me ! Understand me well ; if I were frivolous , coquettish , as they have said , and bad at heart , I would keep you near me to laugh at your sufferings ! Many women would do this , but I will not . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  VALREAS turns from her. but not too quickly . Val Valreas Turning and taking her hand . Oh , Gilberte ! Gilberte ! Gil Gilberte Withdrawing her hand . To-night ! You will depart to-night ! Enter SARTORYS , C. from L. VALREAS faces him . GILBERTE turns away . Sar Sartorys You here , my dear Paul ? They did not tell me . Gil Gilberte M. de Valreas comes to make his adieux . He leaves Paris to-night . Sar Sartorys Not for long , I hope . Paris will not be consoled . Offering his hand . Hope to see you back soon . Crosses to arm-chair near L. Val Valreas Thanks . Bowing to GILBERTE Madame ! Gil Gilberte C. Farewell . Exit VALREAS C. and L. I have done my duty , let me see if the others will do theirs . Aside . Sar Sartorys In chair L. Well , my dear Gilberte , did your father succeed in enlivening you a little ? Gil Gilberte Going up and towards R. What my father said to me was not precisely of a nature to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and as he looks up at her , she looks him full in the face , and says . Louise is about to leave us . Sar Sartorys Starting abruptly . What ? Pause . Gil Gilberte Coldly . M. de Villaroel has asked her hand in marriage , and she will become his wife . Sar Sartorys Very quickly . It is impossible . Gil Gilberte Coldly . What do you mean ? A moment ago you made a strange movement , and now you have uttered a still stranger remark . Sar Sartorys Recovering . I acknowledge , that at first I could not avoid a feeling of selfishness ; I was so sure Louise would never leave us . But I was in the wrong and I regret it . Gil Gilberte Then you will speak to her when she comes in ? Sar Sartorys Quickly . Speak to her ? Then nothing is decided yet ? Gil Gilberte No . Louise as yet knows nothing . Sar Sartorys Does it not seem to you that you would be better able to  --  Gil Gilberte C. I ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I understand them , I , Frou Frou ? Now if it were to talk about a new toilette with Madame de Lussy . Throws herself into sofa and doubles herself up like a little girl in a pet . I will not speak to her . You must do it ; and if I have any advice to give you , it is  --  speak to her so that you will decide her to go . Markedly spoken . Sar Sartorys Astonished at her tone . How ! Enter LOUISE , C. from L. GILBERTE during the ensuing scene is immovable , except now and then to look at LOUISE . LOUISE , as she enters , takes chair C. and commences to take off her hat , gloves , &c.; Louise I have seen Madame de Lussy , and I have seen the new governess . She is a very nice person , and will come to us in a few days . To SARTORYS . And you  --  Sar Sartorys Gravely . I have seen about the purchase . But we have something more serious to speak of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sartorys Yes . A marriage ! Louise What  --  again ? Sar Sartorys This time M. de Villaroel . Pause . Ah , you do n't say what , to that , I notice . Louise Well , M. de Villaroel is one of the most distinguished men of the age . I should of course feel a little pride at his asking for my hand , and I do  --  and a great deal of joy , too ! Gil Gilberte Interested . Ah ! Louise Casting off her cloak or mantel . Yes , a great deal of joy ; for when it is known I have refused to marry a man like him , it will be fully understood that I will marry no one , and then I hope they will leave me alone . Sar Sartorys You refuse ? Louise Certainly I refuse . Going near him at table and sitting . Remember , two months ago I would not come here , but you insisted on it . So much the worse for you ; for now that I am here , I mean to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at it in the proper light . Louise Rising and speaking with emotion . Unless you are displeased with me , both of you ; unless those duties which you call wearisome , and which you gave into my charge , have not been well performed  --  Unless you tell me that in staying here I am useless for your comfort or your happiness  --  Sar Sartorys Crossing to her . No , Louise  --  but this has nothing to do with our happiness . It is of yours I speak . Louise Of mine ? Sar Sartorys Of yours . Louise Then let me stay with you two , if you wish to make me happy , because I can not be happy if I am not here . Woman 's character , to be complete , has two sides ; one is all youth , grace and pleasure  --  Indicating GILBERTE. that is hers . The other , which is all gravity and busy employment , is the one which pleases me the most . This side , necessary , but ungracious , which you asked of me as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happiness . Besides , if you should send me away now , I would not go . Sar Sartorys Crossing to GILBERTE . You hear what she says ? Gil Gilberte Yes . Sar Sartorys You know as well as I that when she makes up her mind , it is useless . Laughs . Louise Gaily . Altogether useless . Sar Sartorys To GILBERTE . Still , if you would like to try yourself . Gil Gilberte Shortly , and putting her feet to floor . Yes , I will try . Sar Sartorys C. , to LOUISE , and taking her hand . I do n't change my opinion , my dear Louise , and I think you ought to consent . But you give me so much pleasure by your refusal , that I have not the heart to insist further . Not now , at least . Louise Not now , and never . Sar Sartorys Pressing her hands , and gently . You will repent when the right one comes Louise You know very well that what I say to-day I shall say always . Exit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . LOUISE goes up towards C. to exit , but is intercepted by GILBERTE who has risen and passing behind the piano comes face to face with her . Gil Gilberte Where are you going ? Louise To get a book that Georgie asked me for ; it is in your room . Gil Gilberte Resolutely . Georgie will wait for his book . LOUISE steps back astonished at the tone and look of GILBERTE , leaving her in C. LOUISE L. C. below GILBERTE . You refuse this marriage which is offered you ? Louise Yes , I refuse . Gil Gilberte Smiling sarcastically . And is it that you may continue to watch over our happiness that you do so ? Louise Gilberte ! Shrinking back a step . Gil Gilberte Trying to suppress anger . A worthy reason . Advancing a step . And I ought to thank you for it . But what I have to blame you for is , that you have not equally divided your attentions in this household between my husband and me . And for having bestowed them more cheerfully on one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sister , what do you mean ? Gil Gilberte Bitterly . That you have lavished your care upon my husband , upon my child , but me you have neglected . And there you were wrong , because , had you looked around you , you would have seen that of all the dangers which threaten this home that you wished to preserve so much , the gravest of all might strike it through me . Louise I do not understand . Gil Gilberte Rapidly . Do you not ? Within this hour M. de Valreas was here at my side swearing that he loved me . LOUISE starts in fear . I told him that I loved him not . Louise Breathless . Well ? Gil Gilberte It was false ; I love him . Louise And you confess it ? Gil Gilberte Sarcastically . This , then , my sister , is something which you did not see with all your care , and it is what you should have seen before everything if you had performed well that duty which you accepted at such heroic cost . LOUISE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I suppose that the absorbing attention you bestowed on one side hindered you from watching the other . Louise Coldly . What you wish to tell me is that you love Valreas  --  is that it ? Gil Gilberte Two months ago there was no such thing ; but within those two months many things have passed . That love has had time for birth and growth ! What at first was but a jest has become a danger  --  a danger so great that when I saw you had no thought of me , to saving me , I tried to save myself . My husband , my child , I tried to return to them . But my child was no longer mine ; you had come between us . Louise I will go , Gilberte . Gil Gilberte You have estranged my child , and for my husband  --  Louise Your husband ! Gil Gilberte When I saw you just now beside him , I recalled the past  --  my suspicions of other times and my suspicions to-day . Louise Your suspicions ? Gil Gilberte Do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Louise Say it ! Speak the words which burn on your lips  --  that four years ago I loved your husband  --  is that it ? Gil Gilberte You dare speak of it ? Louise Yes , I did love him , but it was you that he loved , and , believing that your happiness depended upon his love , I took your hand myself , and placed it in his , and that nothing should hinder your consent to that marriage I pretended to be glad , and yet , at that very moment , I sacrificed my heart for you  --  for I loved him ! I loved him ! Gil Gilberte Sarcastically . And , by the next day , I suppose , your love had vanished . Louise Not so . I suffered long , and perhaps my sufferings and sacrifice merited another recompense than this . You have forgotten your repeated efforts to make me come and live with you , and the surprise that my refusal caused you . You have forgotten that I did refuse to come . Gil Gilberte Sternly . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself ; because I was sure I no longer loved him . Gil Gilberte Bitterly . Indeed ! Was it not rather because you thought the moment better chosen ? Louise Gilberte , you shall not speak to me so . Gil Gilberte Commandingly . It is the truth . Louise Gilberte ! Sister ! Was it not you who wished me  --  Gil Gilberte Ah , you knew well how to make me wish what you desired most ; you are wise , my sister , and I was but a child in your hands . You knew well what you were doing after you had married us  --  after you had sacrificed yourself for us  --  since you knew one instant would suffice for you to regain all that you boast you have given me , since now he is yours . Louise Terrified . Gilbert , I will go . I will leave you . Gil Gilberte Another sacrifice still . No ! It is not you this time who will go . Louise What mean you ? Gil Gilberte Heaven is my witness that I was sincere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I am not strong enough for a lifetime of such efforts . Louise Motionless with horror . What are you about to do ? Gil Gilberte Going up C. I acknowledge that I am conquered ! Take my place ! I give it to you . Louise Where are you going ? Gil Gilberte Ask me nothing . Louise Gilberte ! Gil Gilberte In C. doors , turns and faces LOUISE and speaks furiously . Husband , child , everything you have taken from me ! Keep them well ! Closes the doors . Louise Running to door and beating against it . Gilberte ! Gilberte ! ACT DROP . ACT IV . SCENE .  --  The palace of the Barberini , at Venice . An ancient interior .

Madame wants you to run to the lodgings of the Count , and tell him she will expect him at tea . Seeing that he does n't stir . Come , wake up  --  look lively  --  run ! Zanetto Run ? Whoever saw Zanetto run ? It 's not my business to run of errands . Pau Pauline It is n't ? What is your business then ? Zan Zanetto My business is to carry with grace the costume of the native gondolier of sunny Italy ; to sing the national airs , and to eat , drink and be merry , like a true sunny Italian . Nevertheless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Monsieur de Valreas . Pau Pauline I thought you would , since he gives its value in gold for every message you bring him . Zan Zanetto Coming down C. Ah ! we descendants of sunny Italy are very poor , and the Count is very liberal . Not so liberal as your lady , though . See how beautifully she has fitted up this old palace . Pau Pauline Yes ; and she 's only been here six weeks , to do it all . But it cost her a deal of money to make your dirty old palace fit to live in . Zan Zanetto Money ! I believe you . And talking of money Pulls paper out of his pocket. look at this . Pau Pauline What 's that ? One of your Italian love songs , dedicated to me ? Taking paper . Zan Zanetto No ; it 's a little bill , dedicated to your lady . And here 's another . They amount to 2000 francs ; not much for such a princess as your lady , but a fortune for us poor sons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right , my sunny Italian . And now go . Zan Zanetto I 'll fly . Aside . No doubt I 'll meet the Count on the way here . I always do . And of course he 'll give as much for half the distance as the whole . saunters off lazily L. C. Pau Pauline Well , I 've heard of romantic Italy , and romantic Venice ; but when they send in their bills , where 's the romance ? Ah ! Looking at bill. 2,000 there , and 2,000 here , and more thousands , again Taking other bills from pocket. make a pretty tidy sum for somebody to settle . GILBERTE enters from L. 1 E Gil Gilberte You sent my message , Pauline ? Pau Pauline Zanetto has just gone , Madame . PAULINE hides bills behind her . I must speak to her of these things , some time . Gil Gilberte What are you hiding there ? What papers are those ? Pau Pauline Me ! oh ! these  --  Looking at bills. these  --  these are  --  bills , Madame . Gil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worry you , Madame ; but the tradespeople have asked for money . Gil Gilberte Money ? Sure ; I had not thought of that . Give them to me . And so I am in debt . Do n't be afraid , Pauline ; they shall be paid . Goes up to window . Enter ZANETTO L. C. , with newspaper and a letter . Zan Zanetto I just got these from the postman ; and I thought I 'd better bring them in . Gives them to PAULINE . Pau Pauline Aside to ZANETTO . Why did n't you go with your message to Monsieur Valreas ? ZANETTO winks , points to L. 4 E. and shows money in his hand , and then goes off , L. 1 E. PAULINE gives letter to GILBERTE , who opens and reads . Gil Gilberte Ah ! from the doctor . Then leans her head on her hand at table . PAULINE puts paper on table . Pau Pauline Timidly , after a pause . Pardon , Madame !  --  Madame said the letter was from the doctor ? Gil Gilberte @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Ah ! kind Pauline . Pau Pauline Little Georgie  --  Madame ? Gil Gilberte He is better . The news is good ; very good . Pau Pauline I am so glad , Madame , that the news is good . Gil Gilberte Kissing the letter . Yes ; he is better ; and With an effort to conceal feeling. his father , who , for a month past , was thought to be in danger  --  is saved . That , too , is what you wished to know , is it not ? Pau Pauline Yes ; Madame . GILBERTE buries her head in her hands . PAULINE , with a pitying glance , exits quietly , L. 1 E. Gil Gilberte After a pause . One moment of anger , and this is what it has brought me . Rises . Well , it is too late now . Enter VALREAS , L. C. Val Valreas Gilberte ! Puts his hat on chair , and takes her hand , without enthusiasm . Gil Gilberte Eagerly . Valreas ! Enter ZANETTO , L. 1 E. , with tea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Taking off his gloves . I am a little late .

Val Valreas But you ought to know the reason ; for of course there must be a reason . Gil Gilberte Pauses as she pours out tea . A reason ? Val Valreas Yes ; my mother has been here these three days . Gil Gilberte Sadly . Laying down tea-pot . Ah , yes ! I knew . Val Valreas Sitting at table . You knew ? Gil Gilberte For three days you have come late , like to-day . It was the first time , and you seemed strange . I could not tell why ; and so , when you left me yesterday  --  Val Valreas Yesterday ? Gil Gilberte Trying to smile . Why , a vailed lady in a gondola followed a young gentleman who stepped into another gondola  --  nothing more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is how I discovered Her voice trembling that your mother was here . Turning from him  --  face to front . Val Valreas Leaning over table . And you did not speak to me about her ? Gil Gilberte Huskily . I did not dare . I was afraid . Val Valreas Smiling . Afraid ? Gil Gilberte Going to him . Yes ; but I do n't feel afraid now , for you smile , and that reassures me . Val Valreas But why should you fear ? Gil Gilberte Sinking on stool beside him . She hates me , does she not ? Val Valreas My mother loves me too much to hate any one  --  Stops . Gil Gilb erte Looking into his face , and taking his hands in hers . Any one who loves you . Why do you not say it ? Val Valreas Kindly . Any one who loves me . There . Gil Gilberte Breathlessly . But she would separate us ? Val Valreas She is going to pass part of the winter at Rome . She wanted me to accompany her ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Val Valreas Could you doubt me ? My mother leaves to-morrow ; and she goes alone . Gil Gilberte Alone ? Do not the Baron and Baroness de Cambri go with her ? Val Valreas Ah ! you know that they  --  Gil Gilberte Yes ; I know they are here . Sadly . Why should I conceal it ? I had hoped the Baroness would have come to see me . Hangs her head . Val Valreas Tenderly . Gilberte ! Gil Gilberte With warm emotion , but not loudly . What matters it ? What matters if they all turn from me , so that you remain ? All my life is in your hands , now . I ought to remember that ; and  --  and  --  Tears . I will be happy so long as you do not forget me . Val Valreas Fretfully . Why do you speak so ? You know that I will never forget  --  Gil Gilberte Brushing away her tears . Yes ; I know  --  I know . Leaves his side and returns to table as ZANETTO enters with dish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Valreas Zanetto , give me the newspapers .

Gil Gilberte Rising and leaning over his shoulder . And what was the news , three days ago ? Val Valreas Let me see ; Isthmus of Suez  --  visit of the Empress  --  the rain has played the deuce with the crops . That 's not interesting . Gil Gilberte Not very . And what else ?

Gil Gilberte You are not sorry for all this ? Val Valreas Gilberte ! Gil Gilberte Say you are not sorry .

Thanks ! thanks ! And  --  Louise ? B'ness Baroness She has gone back to her father 's . She went back after it was certain that M.

And when Sartorys ' lawyer told all Paris how you had sent to him the deeds conveying your entire dowry  --  two millions , I believe  --  to little Georgie  --  well , after that , nothing was heard against you . The severest among our sex began to plead your cause . Ah ! such courage is a fine thing , my dear , and precious rare , too . Gil Gilberte In half tones . Then I am not overwhelmed with reproaches ?

GILBERTE motions PAULINE to retire , who goes off door L. GILBERTE stands C. , leaning against table ; her face up stage , towards SARTORYS , who enters L. C. , very pale , and frightfully changed .

Sar Sartorys Yes , about  --  He braces himself against back of chair . GILBERTE goes towards him ; he recovers himself with emotion . ' T is nothing . I beg your pardon . I am still very  --  very  --  my throat is on fire  --  water  --  I can hardly speak  --  Gil Gilberte Water ? Goes to table , pours water in one of the glasses , and brings to SARTORYS , who , noticing the double set on the table , points to them and refuses to take the glass . GILBERTE , in despair , staggers back to table and sets down the glass . Heaven help me ! Sar Sartorys It was about your dowry . Gil Gilberte My dowry ? Turning towards him again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Paris . You must take it back again . I will not leave you exposed to  --  Gil Gilberte I have already said  --  I do not need it !

GILBERTE looks at him with frightened countenance . I do not wish my son ever to touch one cent of that money . I will not have it , you understand ? Gil Gilberte Sinks into chair . Yes . Sar Sartorys And so that no one else should be compelled to tell you , I have come myself ; and I leave you this .

Think of it  --  Frou Frou means frivolity , trifles , dresses . What fearful fate , is it , then , which throws me amongst things so terrible as bloodshed and death . He starts toward door ; she stops him by running before and throwing herself at his knees , clasping her hands before him . You shall not fight ! What ! a man like you to risk a precious life , and for a woman like me ? Tearfully . There must be some other way to satisfy your honor . Sar Sartorys Bitterly . My honor ! Gil Gilberte The world , no matter what you may do , can never doubt your courage ! Sar Sartorys You are mistaken if you believe it is of my honor I think now , or that I have troubled myself one instant with what the world has thought of your fault or what it may think of my vengeance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lover of his wife ! I loved you  --  you have betrayed me because you love another  --  and I shall try to kill that other  --  that is all . Goes toward door . Gil Gilberte No , no , I alone am guilty . Crush me , but me alone . Takes his hand  --  he tries to release himself . Sar Sartorys Leave me . Gil Gilberte What vengeance do you want ? I dare not speak of death for myself  --  I would not have the courage to die  --  but there are convents  --  close by there is one  --  take me there  --  I will go gladly  --  let its gates close upon me and never again shall you hear of the woman who has offended you . Sar Sartorys Still struggling to get away . I told you  --  Gil Gilberte Is that not enough ?  --  Think of some other punishment  --  anything  --  but do not condemn me to live with the horrible thought that a man has died through me ! Sar Sartorys Trying to unclasp GILBERTE 'S fingers . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No ! Gil Gilberte Henri ! Sar Sartorys Call me not ! Gil Gilberte Do not go  --  I will be your slave  --  I will love you ! Sar Sartorys Wretch ! Repulses her ; she faints , still holding his hand ; he drags her a few steps , still trying to open her fingers ; when he does , she falls across a chair at back ; SARTORYS starts to go out ; at back he stops , comes back , looks at GILBERTE a few minutes as if demented and BARONESS enters ; SARTORYS , without saying a word , points to GILBERTE and exits .

This obstacle would have arrested his course , since all the art and all the strength of the world could not open a door which enchantment kept fast closed , had it not been for the ring which the Prince wore on his finger and which the fairy had given him to protect him from the evil power of the magician Merlin . By accident , he placed that hand on the bars of the gate . As soon as the talisman touched it it opened and the Prince continued his journey in search of the Princess . After having sought for her for two years , all the world over , he at length had the happiness of find her and conduct her home . " Georgie And why did the Prince seek for the Princess ?

Pau Pauline We were only passing through ; to-morrow we go to the South  --  the doctors say it is absolutely necessary . Sar Sartorys The doctors ? Pau Pauline Yes , Monsieur , we stopped here to consult them , and I thought that if Madame could have news of her child , it would do her more good than all that the doctors could say to her , so I came without telling anybody what I was about . Sar Sartorys Pauline  --  is she in danger ? Pau Pauline Yes , Monsieur . Sar Sartorys Not in danger of death , however , not in danger of death ? Pau Pauline I think not , Monsieur .

At the end of those three days , Mademoiselle Louise arrived . Madame did not recognize her at first , but at last she knew her . Mademoiselle Louise took her in her arms and Madame cried ; Mademoiselle Louise kept her clasped in her arms , and both cried without saying a word . From that moment , my lady began to improve ; after a while she was able to travel and we all returned to Charmarettes  --  Sar Sartorys And there she continued to improve , did she not ? Pau Pauline Yes , during the first two months ; we hoped , yet she was very pale , and her smile was very sad .
