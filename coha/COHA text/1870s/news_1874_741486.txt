txt Like everything else , the management of theatres is now a much more expensive business than it used to be . Although good actors or singers are not by any means more plentiful than in former times , it costs a great deal more money to secure their services . The expenses , for instance , which Mr. STRAKOSCH must have to provide for every week would startle the operatic manager of thirty years ago . It is much to the credit of Mr. STRAKOSCH that , notwithstanding the risks he must necessarily run , he not only never breaks faith with the public , but is always rather better than his word . He promised to produce " Aida , " but no one expected that he would produce it with scenery , decorations , and . a cast such as have never been seen in this country before . Last season he placed " Lohengrin " before the public in the same lavish style . This year his troupe is more complete even than last year , and already he has introduced a new tenor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in Europe . In these days the discovery of a new tenor is an event likely to be memorable in an operatic season . In this case the credit will belong entirely to Mr. STRAKOSCH . He has , in two nights , produced two new prime donne of exceptional attractions , and his greatest " card ' (  - -  Mlle . ALBANI  --  has still to be seen . She ought to make a greater success than ' Dime . NI:Last:oat , for after all she is a more attractive singer . Nor has the general excellence of the company been sacrificed for the sake of securing half a dozen stars . On the contrary , the orchestra and chorus have never been so good at the Academy of Music as they are now . It is to be hoped that enterprise so unsparing and commendable as that which Mr. STRAKOSCH displays will be suitably rewarded by the public , for it is only by liberal encouragement that good opera can ever be made to pay . If people want such entertainments , they ought to support them freely . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be increased by the opening of Mr. WALLACK 'S theatre for the regular season . This is always an occasion of unusual interest , and this year Mr. WALLACK has done his best to render it even more attractive than ever . Such a force as that which he has collected together it would be impossible to match in any English theatre . He seems to have a complete double company under his direction , and the names of well-known performers which he prints number over twentysix , to say nothing of less widely-known players . Mr. WALLACK himself , and that admirable artist , Mr. JOHN GILBERT , are , of course , to reappear , for without them the theatre would not be like itself . There is also a comedian new to this country  --  Mr. H. J. MoarmauE  --  an excellent representative on the stage of the languid and effeminate " swell " of the period . His acting might not have satisfied the old school , but it has been a decided success with the new . Then Mr. BOUCICAULT is to act in a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more successful than " A Man of Honor " or " Belle Lamar . " It is to be a companion picture to the " Colleen Bawn , " and will be looked for with no little curiosity . Two new comedies , written expressly for Mr. WaLLecx , will be produced , and the old comedies will not be neglected . A season embracing so many changes of entertainment , and requiring so long a list of performers and such an enormous outlay of money , would doubtless have astonished Mr. WALLACK 'S father , or any other manager of what we suppose we must now call the last generation . The efforts which Mr. WALLACK has made for so many years to provide for the public amusement ought to be more and more appreciated by the public . He has now numerous competitors  --  some of them , like Mr. DALY , very active and enterprising  --  but Mr. WALLACK still monopolizes the credit of making his a strictly family theatre . The filthy productions of the " dirty " school of French writers find no admission within those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Wallack 's at any time with the full assurance that abominable immorality will not form the subject of the evening 's amusement . It is not of every theatre that this can be said . There is a play now being performed , not a hundred miles from Wallack 's , which no young girl and no decent woman ought to go and see . Pitch will leave its trace onahe fingers which touch it . We hardly know whether Mr. WALLACH 'S rigid rules in reference to this subject add to the popularity of his theatre , but they ought to do so . There must be a demand for the " adulterous drama , " and women patronize it extensively  --  the more 's the pity . Yet there must also be thousands of persons in the community who prefer amusements which are not avowedly based on obscenity . Even the actresses who perform in some of the French plays now produced disgrace their sex . Against all such reproaches as these Mr. WALLACK is secure . It may happen at times that indecency on the stage seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be unsafe for a manager to conduct his business on the theory that the public will soon get tired of such disgraceful spectacles . Already Mr. WALLACK has had nearly all the seats in his theatre taken for a week , and . a great hole made in his book for the second week ; so that the signs all go to show that he is about to enter upon an unusually prosperous season .
