txt The debate on the Electoral Count bill , which was concluded in the Senate at daylight this morning , after a session which lasted all through the night , was in many respects the moss noteworthy public discussion that has ever taken place in Washington . It was re . markable because of the grave questions , the great interests , involved because of the determination , the desperation almost , with which it was advocated and opposed , and be . cause of the peculiar positions occupied by the men who led the contending forces . Both were prominent candidates for the Presinency , and one of them at least has not yet given up all hope of ultimate success . They are both Republicans , and they each profess to desire the inauguration of the Presidential nominee of that party , yet upon the great question of how the Electoral votes should be counted , and by what means Mr. Hayes should enter the office to which he is entitled under the Constitution and the laws of the nation , they were as far apart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senator Oliver P. Morton , whose fidelity to the principles of the Republican Party has never been doubted , whose very religion is to be a liepublican , contended from first to last , and against overwhelming odds , that the President of the Senate was vested with full power to count the votes and declare the result , and that the compromise plan proposed by the bill was unconstitutional and illegal . Senator Roscoe Conkling , on the other hand , a gentleman whose extraordinary legal ability , power of mind , and quickness of wit are admitted by men of all parties , was the leading advocate of the plan to submit the Presidential question to the decision of a joint commission of members of Congress and Justices of the Supreme Court . In this advocacy he made a speech of seven hours ' duration , thus breaking a silence which , with a single exception , has lasted since the Cincinnati Convention . He is evidently restored to his ' usual robust health , and rust night and to-day he was warmly congratulated by the many leading Democrats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compromise . Regarding the matter of his argument there are many conflicting opinions . One distinguished critic says , " It is one of the speeches that will go down to posterity as a portion of the history of our country , ? and another gentleman , who occupies a large place in the public eye , declares that " It was a false argument , based upon a misstatement of facts . " Regarding the manner in which the address was deiivered columns could be written , for the Senator 's acting and " business , " to use a stage expression , were worthy the notice of even those who are most eminent in that peculiar branch of literature known as dramatic criticism . Mr. Conkling 's audience was a remarkable one . The diplomatic gallery was well filled , Sir Edward Thornton . the English Minister , sitting pale , dignified , and thoughtful , in the front row . On the floor were seated all the Senators , nearly every prominent member of the lower house , the General of the Army , silent and attentive to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and politicians from all parts of the Union . The galleries were filled with the most prominent men and women in Washington society . They all came to hear and see Mr. Conkling , and , like a true artist , Mr. Conkling appreciated the situation and let the stage wait . A recess was taken for 10 minutes , but still he did not make his appearance , and the business of the day was commenced without rim . CONKLING THE FLOOR . Shortly afterward the Sergeant at Arms threw open the doors of the main entrance , and the Senator from New-York entered the chainDer amid a loud buzz of excitement and expectation . He walked slowly to his seat , looking neither to the right nor lett as he went , until , arriving in front of Senator Morton , who sits opposite to him , he bowed low and with mock deference in response to the quick , short nod of recognition which he received from that gentleman . Then he sat down . and the business of the Senate went on . Au hour afterward he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He did so deliberately , with a full realization of the fact that 2,000 people were waiting for his appearance . Every detail of his entree , so to speak , was carefully considered , " the properties " were all in their place , and they were of the most striking and effective character . A copy of the Constitution , from which the groat actor quoted , was gilt-edged and bound in dainty form . His notes were written upon cream-tinted paper ; everything was in order , everything in its place . Mr. Conkling was faultlessly attired . His coat and vest opening down to the waist displayed his chest and shoulders to the best advantage . His hands , white as any maiden 's , were frilled with spotless linen , and his hair , the golden splendor of which dazzled many a beholder in the days that are gone , was thrown back from the broad , massive brow with a studied carlessness which was the very perfection of art . As be took the floor he ? carefully pushed two obstructing chairs out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calm and self-possessed , six feet and two inches of manhood , filled to overflowing with conscious greatness . He was about to speak  --  indeed , he had just opened his mouth ? when a page . " with frantic haste to gain the proud man 's approbation , " rushed to his side with a glass of water . For an instant he looked at the child as if he would have crushed him , and then , remembering the audience , he gently waved him aside , and commenced his speech . Why he rejected the water which the poor little page offered him was soon apparent , for be had hardly commenced to speak when his own body-servant entered , bearing a silver salver , upon which was a gold-edged cur , filled with fragrant tea . Having partaken of this , the Senator went on with his speech . It was a wonderful effort  --  there can be no doubt about that ; wonderful because of its real sophistry and false logic , and because of its apparent candor , frankness , good nature , courtesy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was it remarkable because of the wonderful power of memory which the Senator displayed in its delivery . He had carefully studied , committed to heart , and rehearsed every word in the oration. and at the same time ho so played his part as to lead many of those who listened to him into the error of believing that it was extemporaneous . With well-studied affectation , he paused from time to time , as if to collect his thoughts , gently pressing his temples the while , seemingly to quiet his overworked and troubled brain . Then , with increased energy , be uttered the well-rounded sentences which for days nad been fixed in his mind . Everything considered , his speech was the greatest specimen of " the art which conceals art " that has ever been displayed in this country . During its delivery there was but one moment when 31r . Conkling forgot himself . This was when , to give greater emphasis to what ho evidently considered " a very gem of thought , " he pushed his heavy arm-chair like a battering-ram toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the towering form and mock heroic frown of his great antagonist . Seeing this , Mr. Conkling exclaimed in his most dramatic tone , " I see that the S ' nator retreats before what 1 say . " " Yes , " replied Morton in his blunt , outspoken way , " I will always retreat as far as I ca. from such false doctrine as that taught by the gentleman front New-York . " For a moment , but only for a moment . Cankling was put out , and his frown was not affected . lie recovered Ins self-possession in a second , however , and but few persons noticed that he had been disconcerted . His wonderful self-control and ability to act a part he did not feel made it seem as ifhe cared nothing for the sharp answer referred to , ' out from the moment it was given until the end he was careful to make no further allusion to Mr. Morton .

At half-past 7 the night session commenced , and continued until daylight . Up to 12 o'clock the galleries continued to be filled to overflowing , and the floor was even more densely thronged than it was during the day . At midnight , however , the audience , worn out with waiting in vain for the appearance of " Indiana 's great war Governor , " began to leave the chamber , and half an hour later there wore only a few persons in the galleries . On the floor most of the Senators were still seated , Conkling , wrapped in a flannel jacket , listlessly , but with an air of polite condescension , listened to the addresses which were hieing made . Dorsey , of Arkansas , pretended to be awake , but was not ; Patterson , of South Carolina , defied the night and was open-eyed and watchful , as usual . Gen. Burnside , crowned with a gray skull cap which he wears to protect his hairless head , sat in the cloak-room dozing ; Ferry was still in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Bogy , after fighting manfully against nature for an hour or more , slept peacefully upon his desk , dreaming no doubt of that happy day when what he delights to call " cold-blooded partisans " will no longer denounce as inhuman and atrocious the outrages committed by the White League of the South . This was the condition of things when the floor was at last vacant , and it became possible for Mr. Morton to speak . He was evidently in great pain . His face was white . pinched , and drawn , and in sheer pity fm his suffering , Senator Sherman appealed to the generosity of Edmunds , who had charge of the bill , and asked him to let it go over until the next day . But this reasonable request was refused , and with great drops of sweat pouring from his forehead , trembling in every limb , the Senator from Indiana was cruelly compelled to make his speech in opposition to the compromise . Again , as upon previous occasions , however , his desire to do what he nelieved to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body . and for upward of an hour he continued to hurl argument after argument against the bill . His manner of speaking was in marked contrast to the air of his principal opponent . Mr. Conkling . No man could doubt that he was in earnest ; no man could doubt that he believed what he said , and that he spoke front eep conviction . The knowledge that he did so was felt by all his hearers , and made his plain , homespun , matter of fact expressions more truly eloquent than all the finely spun sentences and carefully polished periods of the great Senator front New-York . At the end of his address ex-Speaker Blaine , who was sworn in the day before , created a marked sensation by taking the floor and making his maiden speech in the Senate . Ile spoke in his usual dashing style , and , greatly to the surprise of most of his audience , opposed the bill .

The cold gray dawn of the Winter morning was stealing dimly into the Capitol when these prosy addresses were finished , and it was broad day-light before the great compromise bill was passed .
