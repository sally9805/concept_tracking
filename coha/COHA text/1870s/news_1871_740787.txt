This is something which the partisan Police Commissioners will be helpless to prevent , and we warn the Police not to look to them for protection in such cases . On the other hand , we appeal to all the officers ? of whom there are hundreds to whom the traditions of the service are dear , who know what their duty ' is and have a pride in doing it well , to vindicate their reputation as they did in July last , by manly , courageous , and impartial discharge of their obligations at every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
