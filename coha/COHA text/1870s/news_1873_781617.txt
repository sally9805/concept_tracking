txt That lovely type of womanhood exemlitied in the Mrs. Fairs and Miss Picketts. f the Pacific coast is commonly thought to be the peculiar product of our peculiar Western civilization . Boastful Americans , indeed , are apt to rank it with the gigantic gooseberries and the illimitable pumpkins of that favored land , or to challenge competition with it as they might for the big trees or the Yosemite Valley . But this confidence , as we shall proceed to show , is altogether misplaced . The effete monarchies every now and . then give us something in the way of feminine progress that may stand comparison with California 's best . A supreme effort of this nature resulted in the production of a certain Miss NASH , to the contemplation of whose loveliness the following details will be found useful . Miss CAROLINE NASH has long been the pride and ornament of a pleasant little village in Huts , England , known as Harmer Green . Here until recently , she resided , enjoying the admiration , mingled with a great deal of respect , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rural life with a thousand joyous and innocent caprices . Her favorite diversion seems to have been assault and battery , though she was not averse to petty larceny , and occasionally indulged in a little poaching . For this latter amusement she possessed . uncommon qualifications , being an extraordinary shot , and having a full assortment of implements of the chase . In the narrow-minded provincial community where Miss NASH had the misfortune to live , these arch ebullitions of girlish gayety were not altogether understood or appreciated , and the merry maiden could point to a record of no less than eleven criminal convictions when , about a fortnight since , she was arraigned for the captivating . and crowning whim of attempting to kill a constable . This artless village beauty  --  torMiss NASH is described as only twenty-three , and unusually good looking ? resided with her mother in one of three cottages , the property of a woman named DARNELL . To this property . Miss NASH , one day , took it into her merry little bead , without the slightest ground therefor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. DARNELL had no right in the premises whatever . When , therefore , Mrs. DARNELL , came in state , attended by a constable , and a numerous following , to take Possession of one of the cottages , which had for some time been vacant . Miss NASH conceived it to be the most reasonable thing in the world that she should draw , in Western parlance , a " bead " upon them , at once . Hastily explaining to her mother that she would " do for " the visitors . she ran into the house for her gun , when the old lady , who seems quite unworthy of her heroic daughter , shut the door and locked her in . But this futile interference only served to bring into stronger light Miss Nam 's fertility of resource and promptness of execution . She , on her part , fastened the door on the inside , and hastily knocking out a few bricks in the wall , converted her cottage into a little fortress . from the embrasure of which she opened a vigorous fire upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pursued by the taunts and the bird-shot of the fair Amazon . The constable being within range was considerably riddled as to his clothes and skin , but by judiciously falling down escaped further injury . It was not till the Police Superintentendent himself came up that the garrison consented to surrender and march out of the fortress , ribbons flying and tongue going , with all the honors of war . California readers will be surprised to learn that this engaging young person , instead of being triumphantly acquitted preparatory to receiving a popular ovation , was , on the contrary , found guilty , and sentenced to penal servitude for five years . Such is the boasted liberty guaranteed by the British Constitution : so ruthlessly are the most cherished privileges of womanhood trampled under foot in that benighted land . We trust that when Miss NASH emerges from her enforced seclusion she will at once emigrate to a more genial clime . She will still be young , and let us hope beautiful , and with these advantages added to her talented use of the shot-gun  --  an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she will find in California free scope for her natural sportiveness of disposition .
