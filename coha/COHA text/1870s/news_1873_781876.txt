txt The later Napoleons have a genius for absurdly contradictory aphorisms . The late ex-Emperor was wont to assert that " The Empire was Peace , " when , in fact , the Empire only existed by continually making war abroad , and preparing the materials for the most terrible civil commotion of the century . When the same gentleman presented his sword to Kaiser WILHELM , he did so with the words , " Unable to ate at the bead of my army , " when it was an obvious fact that during the then just closed storm of mitrailleuse and needle-gun balls , nothing would have been easier for the Emperor than to have died in that particular position , if he had chosen to assume it . His son inherits his father 's talent for words , at least , and has announced his motto to be " Strength , but not Impatience . " As a matter of fact , who can doubt that the youngster 's impatience . however moderate , is much greater than his strength I The son of the Khedive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the event was celebrated by a grand entertainment , to which the foreign Consuls were invited . Sub-sequently each Consul was presented with a cashmere shawl and a dromedary . The shawl , of course , to a valuable present , and oan be readily turned to amount in the Consul 's domestic circle , but whit can he possibly de with his dromedary I Of course , he can neither sell it nor give it away , without being guilty ot die  - -  courtesy to the giver . The American Consul could have no possible use for such a creature . unless he proposed to reside permanently In Egypt , or to accept a roving diplomatao mission among the Bedouins . Neither could he bring it back to Ameriort with him , with the slightest expectation of finding a market here . Doubtless , he wilt be compelled to incur the expense of feeding the wretohed beast until lie eon swum , some depraved Egyptian either to shoot or steal it . When Mr. VANDERBILT begins his great undertaking of laying four tracks from Albany to Buffalo , let us hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our railways have hitherto been built . For example , will he not utterly discard the miserable makeShift of wooden trestle-work , which is now so universally used to span valleys and marshes 4 Will he not also substitute stone or iron for the wooden bridges which are se frequently a cause of railway accidents t Iron and stone are far cheaper in the end for building materials than is wood . for the former do not burn , neither are they so ready to give way under the weight of passing trains . But before Mr. VA NURnuxur enters upon the building of bra new tracks , there is one reform which be ought Instantly to introduce , and that Is the KIWI ? tution of steam-pipes for the miserable stoves which now render the cars of the Harlem and Hudson River Railroads so wretchedly uncom fortable , and so exceedingly deugerous . The clown of a traveling circus is , no doubt . often a hard-working . honest man , but he nag rarely been suspected of a desire to combine the dukes of a clergyman with those of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a clown who recently astonishes an audience assembled in a North Carolina circus ten- , with a forcible sermon upon their duty in contributing to the support of the GospeL Tho sermon was apparently well received , for on the following day he preached in public , anti apart from the circus , upon the subject of Christian missions , and sue ( seeded in collecting a considerable sum for the benefit of the heathen . There is no reason to suppose that this curious clown is playing a joke upon his audiences , and we must , therefore . recognize him as an entirely new species of clown . Perhaps it would be well if he would decide for which profession he is the better suited , and would then adopt it exclusively . and cease to combine the seriousness of the pulpit with the humor of the ring . If report speaks truly , the agent of a woolen mill at Fouth Royalston , Mass. , has ro cently been playing a very mean trick upon the female operatives in the weaving department . Some time ago , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the girl who would weave moat cloth within a period of three months . The do sire to obtain the prize , and be declared champion weaver , became so strong tha work was commenced by many of the operatives at 3 o'clock in the morning . and continued until 7 in the evening . At the end of the period agreed Upon , it was found that a girl named Ruoa had done the most work , having woven 2,605 yards . the remuneration for which , independent of the five dollars , was $123 ? probably the largest anlount ever earned by a woman during the same space of time . Notwithstanding the cleverness of the feat , it is said that the agent refused to keep his promise , on the flimsy pretext that the girl was not deserving . This excuse may satisfy the agent himself , but , leaving gallantry out of the question altogether , we think he will find it difficult to convince the people outside of his mill that be has done right . It is impossible not to feel regret at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Atlantio Steam-ship Compauy , two of whose vessels are now in the hands of the United States Marshal , while the third will be seized on arrival . The Company has been in favor with the public , and it is generally believed that its troubles have arisen from unavoidable misfortunes . Some interesting particulars will . be found elsewhere of the combination to control the production and transportation of anthracite coal . These are contained in the statements of several of the active and experienced dealers in chili City . who think that the Combination been long in course of preparation , and that it threatens results of great importance . They believe the Philadelphia and Reading Company have the coal trade by the throat . Three more communists have been shot on the bloody plain of Satory. two of them crying , " Dawn with Tutees " and " Long live the Commune and the army !
