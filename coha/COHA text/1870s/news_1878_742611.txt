txt The troubles of the NewEngland savings heals , the suspension of one after another , has caused a general feeling of uneasiness among depositors , and the expression of the slightest suspicion against a bank is the signal for a run of more or less magnitude . To-day there has been a run on the Five Cents Savings Bank , on Schoolstreet , one of the strongest , best known , and most conservative in the city ; another on the Franklin Savings Bank , while at the Provident Savings Institution and the Suffolk Savings Bank there has been a heavy call for money , though not in either case what might be termed a run . All of these banks are felt to be as strong as any in these times . Their investments have been cautious and careful , and their conduct conservative and businesslike . According to a late report of the Five Cents Bank , its available funds amounted to $3,938,987 50 . The market value of the amount invested was $206,275 90 . About $400,000 of these securities have been turned into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now about $7,000,000 invested in mortgages on real estate , the Assessors ' valuation of which was about $13,000,000 . The real estate appeared ample to secure the bank from any loss . Bank Commissioner Curry says that the loans on bank stock and public funds are all safe , and also to some extent available , and of the $856 , - 995 loaned on personal security the whole is amply secured though in one case it is possible but not probable that there may be a slight shrinkage . Making allowance , however , for all possible contingencies and discounting what was never likely to occur , Mr. Curry thinks that the bank could show a clear surplus of about $375,000 , which he thinks ample to secure to depositors principal interest on all their investments . This of course , ' does not take into account the April dividend of some $200,000 . All the withdrawals at this time UD to a certain point will be for the benefit of the bank and its remaining depositors , as the interest that would have been paid to those withdrawing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and will finally go to the depositors , who will share in the division of the same . The crowd before the Five Cents Bank was cleared by the Police at the hour for closing , 2 orelock . At a meeting of the Trustees , the committee which has been engaged for the past two weeks in an examination of the securities submitted a report , from which it appears that after deducting all the depreciation which the quick assets , embracing bank stock , Government bonds , 6:e. , have suffered since the last statement of the bank was made , and allowing $167,000 with which to pay the interest falling due on the 1st of April . the bank will still have a surplus of upward of $429,000 . At the Franklin Savings Bank the lunonnt paid to depositors on demand has been limited to $25 , and 60 days ' notice is required for all sums over that amount . This reduces the number of banks iu Boston which are paying in full on demand to three . The growing uneasiness of depositors and the disposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Legislature to the prompt passage of a new Savings Bank bill which has been pending for some time . It was today , passed through the Senate under a suspension of the rules , and the Governor will at once attach his signature to the bill , and it will without delay become a law . It gives the Bank Comniissioners power to regulate the percentage of deposits to ho paid out by any bank whenever in their judgment such regulation is necessary .
