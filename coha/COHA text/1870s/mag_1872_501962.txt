THOUGH there are estimated to be between sixty and a hundred thousand Jews on Manhattan Island , and every city of the Union has also its large share of them , yet the people generally know almost as little of the sentiments , customs , and interior movements of this great Hebrew community as they do of those of the Brahmins of India . It is curious to see how much ignorance most of the writers who attempt to describe and discuss them exhibit . To a large share of Americans the Jew of Chathain street is the typical Jew , and so the whole race suffers by being judged by its worst part . In Europe , in Germany , for instance , the long residence of the Jews has made them easily distinguishable by the Christian inhabitants . The people have become so accustomed to their peculiar facial expression that they can detect it wherever they meet it , however much it may be subdued by education and association . Even where the usual characteristic external appearance and the unmistakable accent are wanting , they instantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus enabled to judge the race correctly . Natives of the United States , on the contrary , can not easily distinguish an educated German Jew from an educated Gernian Christian . Manners , appearance , and language may all be strange , but they are simply foreign , and reveal nothing . An ignorant , unenlightened Jew , however , is known to all . No resident of New York can mistake a clothier from Chatham street , a peddler from Division street , or a glazier from East Broadway . So it happens , as I have said , that the whole race has here been judged by its worst part ; just as if one were to estimate the people of New York city by the inhabitants of the Sixth Ward . I shall , therefore , perhaps do a service in describing the Jews of the United States as they really are . Moreover , the time is exceedingly appropriate , for there is just now beginning a " new departure , " which promises to lead , and I verily believe will lead , the American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have hitherto shut him out from the sympathy of his fellow-men and made him one of a " peculiar people . " It is the first step in that progressive movement favored by our free institutions , which is to eventually obliterate the barriers that now separate Jew and Gentile . American Jews are known as Reformed and Orthodox , but the distinction between the two is not settled and definite . The reform movement dates from the time when the lot of the race began to grow lighter . It consists in purifying their belief of the usages and ceremonies which the sacred writings of the Jews command , and which separate that people from the mass of humanity . Those who are at the head of this movement are the most advanced , and those who have made least progress with it are the most orthodox . I shall call the first the Radicals and the others the Orthodox ; and between the two are what I shall term the Conservatives . The it is hardly necessary to say , are education of a general kind , the spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men . For this reason the great majority of Jews who have settled in the United States do not remain stationary in their religious belief and practice . They may be ultra-orthodox at their arrival , but within a decade are sure to have // measurably modified their faith  --  to have ceased obeying many laws and observing many customs which in their younger days they held absolutely sacred . The number of those who remain unchanged all their lives is e*xceedingly small . They must have immigrated at an advanced age , and have been reared in a country in which their treatment was of the harshest , and the people about them extremely bigoted . Having made the above distinction , we know the only important one that exists , although there areaho lines produced by a difference of language and by national predilections . To the United States the Jews have flocked from all parts of the world . We find that the great majority of those born abroad are Germans and Poles , but there are also Bohemians , Dutch , French , and Eng. * lish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here before the Revolution . Theirs was the deserted synagogue in Newport , Rhode Island . Strange to say , the influence of American thought and American institutions has not made that impression upon them which it makes upon the later immigrants . It has left them thoroughly orthodox . In the great agitations of the race they take no part , and even when the most vital questions are raised , their voice is nowhere heard . It is only the Portuguese of the rising generation who show that they entertain no reverence for the antiquated usages of their people . The English , French , and Dutch Jews are too few and too uninfluential to merit separate remark . The Polish Jews are emigrants from Russian and Austrian as well as Prussian Poland . They resemble those who have come from the south of Russia so closely that it will do to group them all together . What their lot has been , history tells us . In Prussian Poland their treatment has been comparatively the most humane , and those who have been reared there are consequently superior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this difference of degree , however , all are ignorant and bigo'ted . They have all the vicious traits that men treated as they have been are likely to have . In the United States they have found an asylum to which they emigrate by thousands yearly . A large proportion of them settle in New York city , attracted by those who have taken up their home there before them . It is they who become clothiers in Chatham street , dealers in second-hand garments , peddlers of cheap jewelry , glaziers , and pawnbrokers . Wherever you find a Jew in one of these vocations , you may be pretty sure that he is a Pole . The Polish Jew is the English " old do ' man , " and so in fact is every third Jew who calls himself a native of Great Britain . After residing in England long enough to learn the language , he changes his name , and from Moses he makes Moss , Morse , or Morris , and out of Jacobsohn a Johnson is created . But he is to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken to be a representative of the whole race . In the United States it is the roles who are the most orthodox in their religious belief . Even among them there are of course shades of orthodoxy , but with the strictest there is not a law , Rabbinical or Biblical , which is not followed to the letter by the women as well as the men . They have their schools for the study of the Talmud , which are known as Batei Midrashim , and in which rabbis of acknowledged learning and piety preside ; and these not only expound the doctrines of the ancient sages , but they also hold themselves in readiness to listen to the housewives who come to them with abstruse questions about the eating of certain articles of food , or the use of dishes which have been defiled by the contact of milk and meat , or about any of their household // afildrs or their domestic relations ; and they sometimes act the part of judges in difficulties which otherwise would find their way into the courts of law . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their native country nor that of the land in which they have settled . It is a jargon composed of broken German and Hebrew , which is the only medium of conversation permitted in their homes in Russia , but which in the United States they speak , no longer from motives of piety , but because they find it easier than any other-are more at home with it . Such printed circulars and cards as in their peculiar s6cial condition may prove necessary-invitations to weddings , society notices , and the like-are ex*5ressed either in Hebrew or in their own jargon ; and in the latter a newspaper was founded recently by one of their countrymen , a remarkable man , who desired thereby to enlighten and elevate them . It is a curious and interesting fact that a similar characteristic to this was observed in the whole race nearly 2,500 years ago . It was during the Babylonian captivity . Maimonides says of it : " When the Israelites were exiled in the days of the ungodly Nebuchadnezzar , they became scattered among Persians , Greeks , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the various countries Apoke a dialect composed of different languages , and were unable to express themselves perfectly in any recognized tongue . " lIe goes on to quote the twenty-fourth verse in the thirteenth chapter of the book of Nehemiah : " And their children spake half in the speech of Ashdod , and could not speak in the Jews ' language , but according to the language of each people . " The religious services of the Polish Jews are well worth observing . They are characterized , as one would expect them to be , by a- noisy devotion which is intolerant of criticism , which is exaggerated like the devotion of a barbarous people , which substitutes physical demonstrations for that repose which they can not comprehend , and which renders hideous and senseless the most beautiful and significant ceremonies . That there are none among them who have risen above their general condition , can not be said If there were not , it would be an almost unique fact in the history of oppression . The German Jews are the most active as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part , and the *nservatives and Radicals almost wholly . It is among the Germans that the great agitations of the last half century found their beginning . The influence of their thought has ever since been exerted powerfully upon the rest of the race , and to them belongs the honor of all that has thus far been achieved in the direction of progress . From them have arisen all the great reformers and progressive rabbis of the day . Slightly separated from them , hut of like sentiments and subjected to the same influences , are the Bohemian Jews , to whom it would be unnecessary to refer , were it not that there is a shade of difference based upon their nationality between them and the Germans . Wherever they exist in sufficient numbers , they form separate congregations , attend separato synagogues , and to a great extent associate in *private life exclusively with each other , in the same way as do the English ' Jews , and the Portuguese , and the Poles . Between the last and the rest there is indeed a far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' contempt for their ignorance , their bigotry , and their y*cious traits , but there is even a degree of dislike that borders on hatred shown them , for the reason , as I have explained , that the whole race is judged by them , and has to bear the imputation of resembling them // At the same time , it must be said that , notwithstanding the reserve which is maintained between the Jews of different nationalities , yet if a single member of the race comes to his fellow , from no matter what qutirter of the globe , and claims his hospitality or charity , or if not in need looks to him nevertheless for friendly treatment , he is welcomed without hesitation as a brother . His necessity , if he is destitute , is at once relieved ; and if sick , he is well cared for . The more orthodox the hosts may be , the heartier the welcome ; and there are many who retain the European custom of inviting such applicants to their houses after service in the synagogue on Friday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theiiC Sabbath evening meal of fish , and their Sabbath dinner . But as they grow less orthodox this peculiar hospitality becomes less general , and among the Radicals it has disappeared . Indeed , the further they advance the weaker grows their connection with the Jewish race , and the stronger that with the human . Thea such a stranger is hardly regarded as akin , or as having any peculiar claim , unless he has been oppressed and has suffered , and then he is treated as any human being would be under similar circumstances , of whatever nation , creed , or race . Of the traditionary customs of the Jews there are hardly any which the Radicals of to-day observe . About minor usages , such as wearing hats and the thalith in the synagogues , and the white robe , the symbol of contrition , on the day of atonement , or the keeping of the Sabbath with that repulsive strictness which forbids the tearing of paper or the breaking of a twig , the lighting of a match or riding in a street car , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brushed away forever ; and in the case of the great majority , the venerated dietary laws have shared the sain* fate . Milk and meat are eaten together with a relish , and from the flesh of the squirrel and the hare few turn in disgust . A wild duck that is shot on . the wing is enjoyed as well as a tame one that has been properly slaughtered by a shochet , provided its flavor is equal ; nor are they a small number who have leavened bread on their tables side by side with the mctzoth during the passover festival . All fasting , except that on the day , of atonement , has been allowed to drop into oblivion ; and were the festivals not very agreeable interruptions of daily toil , some of them would undoubtedly have taken the same route . It is only the ultra-Orthodox who to-day believe in all the miracles related in the Old Testament . As for the R*fdicals , they are not content with disbelieving some portions of the Bible ; they boldly announce that they have no faith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so far as that is taken to mean the writing of it by the direction of the Supreme Being , or by his express dictation . The Jews may be said , in fact , to he travelling on a highway whose terminus is pure Deism , with the extreme Radicals at the very goal , while back from the point at which they have arrived to the beginning of the road the rest of the race is scattered . But tho travellers are all in motion , there is constant progress , and with every step that is taken some relic of the past , some tradition or some habit , is thrown aside , and lightened by so much of their burdens they continue their journey the easier . When I say it is simple Deism at which they arrive in the end , I think I speak within the facts . What is it that the Radicals believe ? That there is a Supreme Being , intelligent and beneficent , and the logical sequence of such a faith ; but hardly anything further . They may still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their authority upon the religious system which is known as the Judaism of the Bible ; but that they do so proves nothing further than their inconsistency . They continue to observe many of the festivals // 61 THE JEWS : WHAT THEY ARE COMING TO . in a kind of liberal way , not because they believe an obligation to do so rests upon them , but partly because it does no harm , affords them some pleasure , and recalls pleasant reminiscences , and partly because some think the practice ought to be maintained to commemorate those extraordinary passages in the history of the race which in the festivals are recalled to mind . The most prominent Radical synagogues are : in New York , the Temple Emanu-El , and that presided over by Dr. Einhorn ; and in Philadelphia , that of Dr. Hirsch . Besides these , there are none which can strictly be regarded as coming within the meaning which I have assigned to the term Radicals ; but it should not be supposed that these thre ? congregations embrace all who have reached their extreme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever , and belong to no synagogues from choice ; while in every city of the United States others may be found who would gladly join a Radical congregation were it possible , but , finding ( as is usually the case ) that there are not enough Israelites in their town to form more than one , must be content to become members of an Orthodox or Conservative congregation , or of none at all . Their most influential rabbis are those just named , and Dr. Adler , of th' Temple Emanu-El . Although the doctrines taught by these divines differ in some respects , they resemble each other closely in being all of the most cosmopolitan and liberal character . Their theory is that the Judaism of the Bible had only one essential feature , and that this stands forth prominently all through the sacred writings : it is the doctrine of a single , indivisible God . Everything else in the system was unessential detail , adapted to the spirit of an elder age , and in stripping the religion of it to-day no harm is done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted in the nineteenth century . The simple monotheistic idea remains , and that is the foundation and the whole foundation of modern Judaism . Of Conservative synagogues the number is greater , in due proportion to the body itself , which is also naturally far more numerous . The time will probably come when all will stand on the same ground on which the Radicals do to-day ; but at the present moment that position is extreme , and the great mass prefer , as they always do under such circumstances , to let themselves be borne to it by the main current rather than strike out for it of their own accord . There is also another reason for the large number of Conservativc synagogues , and this applies likewise to the Orthodox . With them everybody attends public services regularly , and is a member of some congregation . Without that he lacks a certain dignity and consideration . He is not a Ba*il Habaith  --  a householder . Thus it happens that we find Conservative houses of worship in every town , while in each of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prayers ( except among the Portuguese , who have one of their own , but one that resembles the other in all essential features ) is that which has been used by the ultra-Orthodox in Germany and Poland for centuries ; but while the Orthodox consider everything in it as sacred and necessary to be read , the Conservatives omit such parts as imply their belief in doctrines which they repudiate . Even with the omissions , however , there is such a vast amount to be recited , so very much ground to be gone over , not alone on the Sabbath and the holidays , but even in the daily private devotions , that in the latter case to have done within an hour , and in the former within three or four , it is absolutely necessary to read as rapidly as human capacity will admit of . As a general thing , the words are slurred over , some skipped entirely , and altogether such indecorous haste exhibited that to a stranger it is astonishing how men of intelligence // can be content to see a religious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , one must remember that there was a time when a much greater portion of the day was devoted to prayer and the study of the Scriptures than ordinary Israelites of the present century have found it possible to spare . Instead of curtailing the prayers , they have endeavored to finish them in less time , and the result has been what I have just stated . Forced to make the entire round whenever the proper occasion arrived , each generation acquired this style from their parents* and clung to it from sheer force of habit . Of course , in going over the body of the prayers no chance is given of understanding or appreciating them ( they are written in Hebrew ) ; and as far as genuine devotion is concerned , it is an utter impossibility . To be sure , there is a consciousness of being in a place of worship , and there is a certain elevation of feeling , like that of the pious Jew who lived a long time ago and was so ignorant that he could not even read the prayer-book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back and forth a number of times over a small hillock as a sign of his reverence for his Maker . There are many short prayers also , and numerous psalms , which have been repeated so often that they are known by heart . These are , of course , exceptions . The whole system , however , has so many objectionable features about it that Dr. Wise of Cincinnati some years ago prepared a new and more appropriate prayer-book . It was received with favor at first , but it has since , to say the least , not increased in popularity ; and , as I have said , in the great majority of the Conservative synagogues the regular orthodox editioa , with all its passages from the Pentateuch in relation to the sacrificial oflbring* , is still in use . The many reforms which these congregations have made plainly show their progressive tendency ; but the bigoted stubbornness with Which they cling to some petty and almost unmeaning customs is , on the other hand , exceedingly curious . Of the Conservative rabbis there are some whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those of the Radical rabbis whom I have named . The reason of it is that the latter , unfortunately , have not an adequate command of the English language ; they neither write nor speak English . Dr. Wise of Cincinnati is probably the best known Conservative . In this class I think I may place him , although he is at times sufficiently extreme . l ) r . Lilienthal , of the same city , has also frequently figured in public ; he is influential and esteemed . Dr. Huebsch , of the Bohemian synagogue in New York , is another , and so is Dr. Mielziener , of the Norfolk street synagogue . In fact , every prominent city in the United States has its distinguished Conservative divine . The Radical clergy have few changes to propose at the present time . They have gone about as far as they dare for the moment ; and for the little which is yet to be done , they are content to wait . The Conservatives , on the other hand , are in constant activity , agitating new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away , they assail another . As a general thing , the sentiments of their congregations are in harmony with their own , and they only require some leading mind to shape their course and impel them on ; but often the case is the reverse . Even then there are a few , probably , who assist the rabbi in his efforts ; but as for the rest , they raise a storm of indignation at every new change that he advocates , and every step which they take forward costs a score of sermons . This is especially true of the congregations in the smaller towns , where , the Israelites being usually too few to support more than one synagogue , we find // gathered into a single fold partisans of ultra orthodoxy and of extreme reform . The majority is generally Conservative , but is swayed from one side to the other by the arguments and exertions of the opposing parties . The rabbi is usually more inclined to the Radicals than to the other side , and in addition to using his influence from the pulpit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the debates which arise during the meetings of his congregation . The chances are that some of the agitators are hot-tempered and lose control of themselves , and a perfect tempest at once sweeps over the deliberating assembly . They have been known to come to blows . On such occasions it is usually the rabbi who fares worst . The rage of the majority centres on him ; he is upbraided on every side , is threatened with removal from his position , sometimes is removed , and more than once has been actually beaten . There is neither respect nor consideration for is person or his office . But the latter , it must be remembered , is of comparatively recent origin , and has not the claim of antiquity to anybody 's reverence . Its duties were formerly discharged by the official reader , and consisted chiefly in expounding the sayings of the sages and the text of the Scriptures on a Saturday afternoon . In taking to themselves a modein preacher at all , the Jews simply follow the fashion of the present day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is little commotion about stagnant water . Of their rabbis nothing is expected further than that they should be excellent Talmudical scholars and very pious : Other good qualities will recommend them the more ; but even without these they are looked up to . There are many large synagogues which may be termed Orthodox ; but the ultra-Orthodox are small and little known . In the great cities they are scattered about in out-of-the-way places , and are stumbled on unexpectedly . In New York , for instance , they are situate in the lower wards , in the most densely-populated streets , and the places of worship are bare , wretched rooms , i.u equally wretched houses . There is seldom any indication of their existence to passers in the street ; they are known only to the initiated . It is the newlyimmigrated Poles who attend them , as well as some whose poverty is too great to allow them to pay the dues in a more stylish house of worship . After a while , the new immigrants grow discontented with the style of service , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some other that is orthodox , but in which the manner of worship is more agreeable to the eye and the ear . Their places in the congregations which they have forsaken remain vacant for only a short time ; they are soon refilled by newer immigrants . There have been numerous rabbinical conferences . Their motive and their influence have both been misunderstood by the general public , for whose perusal the proceedings were reported in the daily newspapers . The highest value was affixed to each . There was a vague impression that the gentlemen who attended had been delegated from their congregations , that they had been clothed with certain powers of assent and dissent in the case of particular questions which were to be raised , and that the decision of the majority would be binding on the congregations represented . An impression wider of the mark there could not well have been . - Whatever the conferences might have decided on , it would have been utterly immaterial . Every congregation in the United States is a perfect autonomy . It acknowledges no superior . Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him , and for priestcraft generally it entertains no admiration . Whatever it may think of one particular 4 // divine , for divines distinctively , as such , it feels aversion rather than respect . The influence of the rabbinical conferences may therefore be imagined . Whoever attended them did so of his own desire , and represented only himself . The only value the deliberations ever had was that a kind of programme was drawn up for coming work , by which all were enabled to coöperate in agitating the same reforms at the same time ; and , secondly , That certain changes , about advocating which there was some fear , as being too premature , were presented in a form which was calculated to set the Jews of the country thinking , without alarming them or setting the Orthodox frantic with indignation . That there were no ultra-Orthodox represented in the conferences , it is hardly necessary to say . Those who attended were desirous of progress . From what I have already said of the Radicals , the feeling with which they regard their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ educated , philanthropic , of liberal views , cosmopolitan , and progressive in every sense of the word ; in short , they are to be ranked with the best class of American citizens . How would such men be apt to regard their neighbors , of no matter what religious belief ? They would judge them , I. should say , entirely upon their individual merits ; and that is what they do . There can be no better illustration of this than the relations which they bear to the Unitarians . In Cincinnati Jewish divines have exchanged pulpits with Unitarian clergymen . Although it is true that the report of this action was not received with much favor elsewhere , it was because it looked too much like quackery and sensational display , and not because such fraternization was displeasing . The Conservatives certainly esteem a good man none the less for his being a Christian ; in fact , that he is the latter is a thing which they never consider , which never enters their thoughts , unless he announces it purposely , and calls their attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They are exceedingly sensitive to reflections on their belief or their extraction . This point they have not yet passed , and if there is anything which is calculated to inspire them with dislike for Christians , it is this , since daily they must listen to taunts that fill them with irresistible bitterness . Were they to find the rabble only guilty of it , no doubt they would take it with something like indifference ; hut it is often people of what is known as the better class who show themselves most prejudiced . Such persons they regard as their ancestors did the priests who incited the mob at them with the cry " Hep , hep ! " They have a Hebrew term for such a foe of Israel , and it has been used so universally that it has acquired a special meaning . It is rashct , which , originally signifies the wicked one , the sinner . The Orthodox do as their ancestors did when speaking of Christians . They never call a Christian girl a girl , or a lad a lad . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the word goi , gentile , and for a woman its feminine form . They retain this custom , however , simply because it is a custom , and because , even if they had any reason for desiring it , they would find it difficult to wean themselves from it . It is in no way expressive of feeling . The sentiment which they harbor toward Christians is one I should say of apprehension , and dates from their native lands ; but in the United States there is no fuel to keep it alive . A New York clergyman recently asserted that the Jews never cheat each other , but think it nothing wrong to swindle a Christian . About this statement there are two things to be said . Ordinarily it would be absurd ; from such a source it is shameful . The Radicals , after my description of them ( I have endeavored to make it fair ) , it is certainly not necessary to defend against the // accusation . The Conservatives , though not so far advanced in their religious belief , nor as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that not dishonorable . Their average morality is of the very same standard as that of ordinary average men in any community , and it is neither more nor less . The habitual knaves and sharpers are . to be found among the Polish Jews , and it is there one should look for them , as one would look among the most illiterate in any state or city to find the lesser criminals who are lodged there . But if a Polish Jew is a swindler , he is not fastidious about whom he cheats . Gentile and Jew are alike welcome to him ; and if the former falls oftener into his net , it is because the lattei* knows him and his ways too well . There is certainly nothing in the religion which justifies the defrauding of either , any more than there is in any religion . The scarcity of the more dangerous kind of criminals among the Jews , and the fact that so few of them are to be met with in any State prison , have often been remarked . The only reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the Jews led until very recently , and which the Polish Jews still lead to a certain extent within their native boundaries , was hardly calculated to make them think of assailing others . All their energies , their vigilance , and their dexterity were required to defend themselves against murder and pillage ; and I am inclined to think that this has left an impress upon their character . Although they showed themselves excellent soldiers in the two great wars of the last decade , they have always displayed marked aversion to occupations which might make it necessary to participate in street fights , or in unlawful and violent encounters of any nature . A Jewish police officer , for instance , is exceedingly rare . In short , it seems to me that the reason why so few Polish Jews turn burglars or highwayman , is their characteristic lack of the first requisite , brutal courage . Of Christ the Jews have no uniform opinion . The Radicals regard him very much as a good many Deists and Atheists have done before them-that is , they believe him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enthusiast ; and the New Testament they suppose to have been written long after his death , and to have been made up in part of material taken from the Old Testament , the maxim " Love thy neighbor as thyself " being considered an illustration of this . In fact , whatever opinions they may have on this subject , they have formed by thinking for themselves over the writings of the great skeptics , just as many others have done who are not Jews ; and this is the case as well with the most advanced of the Conservatives , as no doubt also with many of the least advanced and of the Orthodox . Of the last , however , a very considerable majority have expended no thought whatever on the matter . Their notions about Christ are of the vaguest , and to some lie is even veiled in mystery . What they know most clearly is his fate , and the persecution of themselves and their ancestors on account of it . They have a very peculiar name for him . It is not often that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they do they call him to-lui  --  the hanged one . He is rarely the subject of conversation among them ; it would be a distasteful topic , and they would have no motive for bringing it up . There is , as I have said , no uniform sentiment entertained in regard to him ; but one thing may nevertheless be safely asserted of the whole race : All expectation that they will ever come to regard him as anything but a man and a son of man is based on desire only . As for the New Testament , the average Orthodox would no more think of looking over its pages than they would of swallowing deadly poison . It has // 56 THE JEWS : WIXAT THEY ARE COMING TO . been translated into Hebrew for their benefit by one who hoped to convert them by its agency ; but the labor was utterly thrown away . That they offer so little opposition to the reading of the book in the public schools may seem surprising . There are two reasons for it , however . Before they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question the policy of their governments or to assail anything that had been established by them ; and in the land in which they are now settled they are equally timid , whether it is the decision of the majority that is to be opposed or the action of the chosen legislators . The second reason is their confidence in their children , of whose yielding to the influence of what is read to them from the New Testament they have no fear . They entertain no dread of the book ; they rather regard it as wicked and blasphemous . The Radicals , on the other hand , and the more intelligent of the Conservatives , think the reading of it in the schools a matter of small moment , and , in case the majority of the community desire it , not worth debating ; but when the Roman Catholics begin to agitate the question , as they have done more than once , and the country is in commotion about it , they are apt to join the opposition to it , and to explain their previous contentment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lilienthal of Cincinnati did in the excitement of last year . " Before the present moment , " he said in substance , " it was not worth one 's while to speak about it , but now that the question is xuised , Is the reading , ete. , right and just ? the subject assumes a different form and becomes important as a possible precedent . " The futility of all attempts to convert the race or any portion of it to Christianity has been demonstrated repeatedly in the utter failure of the a*so*iations founded with that aim . Occasionally , it is true , a convert was gained in whom the motive was purely honest conviction , but it is venturesome to say that he is even one in a thousand . When an educated Jew becomes dissatisfied with his own faith , when the progress of the Radicals even is too slow for him , when all compromise or temporary expediency is distasteful to him , he will not bend his convictions in the slightest degree ; he severs all connection with the religion of his race @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or perhaps he goes further and allies himself to the extreme Unitarians-many , for instance , admiring Dr. Frothingham ; and occasionally one embraces Atheism , Pantheism , or some other form of utter unbelief in an intelligent Ruler of the universe . But he has no thought of joining a denomination which holds the doctrine of the Trinity . On the other hand , to convert an average Orthodox is a hopeless task . To argument he is literally deaf . If he can not turn his back , he can at any rate refuse to hear ; and that he does . lie is nearly as difficult to deal with by the reformers in his own faith . It is the progressive influence of the age , and the spirit of the people with whom he dwells , which must be relied on to elevate him . Arguments , unless they are drawn from the Talmud , have no weight with him ; and in the Talmud he is a poor scholar who can not find authorities to support him , whether he is on the side of orthodoxy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Messiah is utterly repudiated by the Radicals and by a large portion of the Conservatives ; and with that , of course , the belief in the reunion of the nation and the return to Jerusalem is also thrown overboard . The Biblical prophecies on these points are taken in a figurative sense , and so explained . The Orthodox , on the contrary , hold tenaciously to the doctrines . In the thirteen articles of belief drawn up by Maimonides , and professed by them , the twelfth reads thus : " I believe firmly and honestly in // the advent of an anointed Redeemer , and notwithstanding his remaining away so long , I nevertheless yearn daily for his coming . " They are taught this article with the remaining twelve , and they utter no lie in repeating it . The seven hundred years which have passed since it first was framed have apparently robbed it of none of its vitality . Many speculate about the circumstances under which the Messiah will probably appear , and the preponderance of opinion seems to be that he will first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Simultaneously the blowing of a great trumpet will resound through the world , and from all the quarters of the globe are to be gathered together the scattered children of Israel , to be conducted once more to the Holy Land , and to be installed there in their pristine glory , with their Redeemer on the throne of the ancient Jewish kings . The following extracts are taken from the prayer-book used by the Orthodox and very nearly all Conservatives ; but , as I have Said , passages like these are omitted in their services by many of the latter : Let the great trumpet sound for our liberation , raise the standard for the reunion of the scattered , and gather us together from the four ends of the earth . Praised be thou , 0 Eternal ! who reunitest the persecuted of thy people Israel . Oh , return with mercy to Jerusalem , thy city , and reign therein as thou hast promised to do ; rebuild it soon , during our existence , to remain imperishable , and speedily re-establish in it the throne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who buildest up Jerusalem . Let the stock of David , thy servant , soon bloom again ; exalt its splendor through thy support . O Eternal , our God , show thyself favorable unto thy people Israel and its prayers ; introduce again the holy service into the sanctuary of thy temple ! Fill us with rejoicing , 0 Eternal , through Elijah the prophet , thy servant , and through the royal house of David , thy anointed ; may he soon come and gladden our heart . Upon his throne let no stranger sit , no others take unto themselves his glory ; for by thy hol*r name hast thou sworn unto him that his light shall neve* be extinguished in all eternity ! Prai*ed be thou , 0 Eternal , the shield of David ! And still , notwithstanding these prayers , of which all but one are daily , no Orthodox Jew hesitates about securing naturalization papers in the United States , nor about investing his money in real estate , or even in chattels which will not fetch half their value if it becoine* necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that this belief never enters into their practical business calculations , nor does it ever give them serious trouble ; in fact , the entreaties copied above are understood by2 comparatively few of those who give - them utterance . The thirteen articles of faith just referred to profess in substance the conviction that God is the Creator and Ruler of the universe ; is single and alone , with none like him ; is ineorporet*l and incomprehensible to those senses by which a corporeal being may be comprehended ; is the first being and will be the last ; that to him only are the prayers of men to be directed ; that all the words of the prophets are true ; that the pvophecies of Moses are fine , and that he was the greatest of all prophets ; that the Pentateuch ( the Holy Law ) as it has been handed down is the same which was given to Moses ; that it will never be changed , and no other will ever be given to man by the Creator ; that the Creator knows all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he rewards those who keep his commandments and punishes all Who transgress them ; that ( the twelfth article ) a Messiah will some day make his appearance ; and finally , that there will be a resurrection of the dead . What , now , have I shown ? The most advanced of the Jews stand practically on the same ground in point of belief with the extreme Unitarians , and // would perhaps combine with them at once , were there not danger that such a movement would alienate the rest of the race , were it not too early as yet to expect them to do away at once with all their forms and customs , and finally , did not lifelong habit invariably exercise powerful influence upon those subjected to it , With every year , however , the obstacles grow less , and although of the present generation nothing can be expected except the steady progress which they are making , the rising generation may take much bolder strides . Exclude those who were reared in Europe and were brought to the United States by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on American soil ( they form three-fourths of the whole number ) , and you have a generation the like of which there has not been since the dispersal . Of a common nationality , and speaking English as their common mother tongue , there can be no differences between them except religious and educational . By the latter , a large proportion of those born of the Polish Jews will be separated from the rest ; for although many of them attend the free public schools , yet a considerable number attend none , and do not even study the Talmud as their fathers did . These can hardly turn out men of elevated aims and characters . But take the whole body , and it has one marked characteristic . The influence of religious habits is not felt by them as by their parents ; nor do they believe whatever is taught by cunning or fanatical rabbis , as many of the present generation do ; nor , if their parents are Orthodox , will they do what is done in every religion the world over-accept without question the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far too much which is ridiculous and repugnant to reason such as it is in the United States , in the nineteenth century ; while if their parents are Conservative or Radical , they have the example set before them of thinking for themselves , and eagerly follow it . The consequence of this state of affairs is , that such a thing as faith in religion is utterly unknown to them ; that for the traditionary customs of their race they have lost all reverence ; and that if any of them attend services in any synagogue , or , by the observance of Jewish usages or Jewish fasts or festivals , still show adherence to the religion in its old form , it is simply to satisfy the prejudices of Orthodox parents . A very large proportion of the generation have been educated side by side with Christians in the public schools , and by that have been still further drawn from Jewish orthodoxy into closer fellowship with their Christian neighbors , and iearer to a religion of pure reason , and , in many instances , to utter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the following traits : a sincere affection for their country and its republican institutions ; a simple monotheistic belief ; humanitarian ideas which do not admit of distinguishing between Christian and Jew or Jew and Christian ; and finally , though this may be only a temporary characteristic , by sympathies more cosmopolitan and liberal without doubt than those of their Christians neighbors , from the very nature of the movement in which they were born to participate , and the charactor of the reading to which by circumstances they are directed . In fact , this trait is frequently immoderate in them . They are thoroughly illiberal to an illiberal person , and in their judgment of him extravagantly severe . Such is the rising generation of Jews in the United States to-day . What under ordinary circumstances is to prevent their being merged with their Christian neighbors , and becoming utterly undistinguishable from them ? Only two agencies can be mentioned in reply : they are the law which forbids intermarriage with Gentiles , and the ordinance which commands circumcision . The former would alene be effective ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself might prove a considerable bar . And notwithstanding their liberal sentiments , the rising generation will obey both laws . But it is not from conviction ; it is on account of their parents , on account of the conservative ideas , combined with the unreasoning prejudices , of the majority of the present generation . Of circumcision they have a pretty uniform opinion : they regard it as a purely sanitary regulation , intended to guard against the natural consequences of excesses in a climate like that of Palestine , but of doubtful benefit in the United States . They ask the natural question : Can man improve upon the form in which he is born ? Statements have often been made that on an average Jews live to a greater age than Christians ; but they rest upon doubtful autho*4ty , and bave never been satisfactorily substantiated . As far as these youth can judge of the Christians who live about them , there is not under the same general conditions a whit of difference between their average physical condition and their own . The only reason , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practice so far as it concerns the children that may be born to them is the desire of their parents ; but that is sufficient , for it is so intense , so unreasoning , that filial duty would make a refusal impossible as long as no principle , no sense of right or justice , was to be violated . There are many , no doubt , among the most advanced who will readily consent to their children doing as they think proper in this or any similar matter ; but take a representative of the main body , and it may be said of him that , although he can listen placidly to arguments which prove the needlessness or even the absurdity of the usage , and can calmly hear that the rabbinical conference in Philadelphia and the recent synod in Augsburg held that a child born of a Jewish woman but not circuincised is nevertheless a Jew in all respects , yet when the proposal to disregard the ordinance is brought home to him , is to be carried out hy anybody who is dear to him and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply wild . He does not argue , he can not argue , but he has the strongest apprehensions of awful disasters that may befall those who are guilty of the transgression ; and were the refusal to yield to him persisted in , he would certainly suffer the profoundest grief , and might even do what has been done repeatedly-part with those who have disobeyed him , with his curses resting upon their heads . Of the women it need only be said that they are what women in religion , be the reason what it may , have always been : they are even more bigoted than the men . The opposition to intermarriage is of very much the same nature ; but it is strengthened by two circumstances . One is the uhhappy result of nearly all such unions hitherto , by reason of the prejudices entertained by the connections of each of the parties ; and the other is that even the rising generation have a certain sensitiveness on the score of their faith and their extraction , and meeting in society with Christian maidens , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a repugnance which may be ever so slight , but which they can not for an instant endure . These circumstances , however , are of the same general nature , and daily lose more of their force , since the prejudice against the Jews is rapidly vanishing . Although the rising generation may still be affected by it , their children , it may be assumed , will not encounter much of it ; and it is with them that the commencement of a general intermarrying and of the utter neglect of the practice of circumcising their male offspring is to be dated . Many illustrations of this theory might be adduced ; but there are two // which are so especially striking that they are well worth relating . The son of a Conservative Connecticut rabbi , who was a surgeon in the Union army during the war of the Rebellion , is at present one of the most prominent physicians in the city in which he resides , and at the same time holds a high public office , moves in what is known as the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the State-in short , has had an exceptionally fortunate career-offered his hand to a Christian lady of one of the oldest families in Connecticut , and was accepted by her . Unable to resist the unusually happy features of the proposed union , the gentleman 's father yielded ; but the mother , on the other hand , was so frantically opposed to it that , to avoid embittering the remainder of her days , the gentleman severed the engagement . Suppose , now , that he marries a Jewish girl , and that children are born to him , is it probable that he will oppose their marrying whomsoever their hearts are drawn to ? Or will he demand that the practice of circumcision be main *ained with his grandchildren ? In the second case there figures the eldest son of the most prominent rabbi in Frankfort-on-the-Main . The fame of this rabbi has reached the ear of every Jew , in whatever part of the world he may be . His eldest son left bis native city and settled in the United States . After a year or two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information could be gathered concerning him . It was supposed that he was dead , and the family mourned for him . A few months ago one of hi* brothers , while on a visit to Philadelphia , met him in one of the hotels . It was then ascertained that soon after coming to the United States he had married a Christian maiden , and that he was afraid of receiving the curses of his aged father if the fact became known to him . lie had therefore conveyed the impression that he was dead . The end of this romantic story is that the younger brother instantly communicated his discovery to his father , and that the latter , whatever his prejudices may have been , at once gave evidence of his happiness at the recovery of his first-born , tied to a Christian though he was . Need it be said that the grandchildren of this renowned rabbi had not been circumcised ? That these are exceptional cases is true enough ; but they are exceptional only in immaterial features . The sentiments of the rising generation on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be mistaken ; and although they may not act in accordance with them , they will for a certainty offer no opposition to their children doing so . It is by the second generation born on American soil that obedience to these two ancient ordinances will first be refused ( though , to be sure , they will interman*y only with Christians who are as unprejudiced and as free in belief as themselves ) . Within fifty years , then , we may expect to see the beginning of this movement ; and of all who participate in it , the grandchildren , at the latest , will be undistinguishable from the mass of humanity which surrounds them . The peculiar facial expression of the Jew will not rest upon their faces ; any ordinary observation in the case of such intermarriages as have already occurred will prove this true . And the movement once begun , can it take long to break down the barriers that surround the rest of the race ? for it must be remembered that meantime their progress will he uninterrupted in every land which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ai*cient people only the history of their perils and their sufferings will remain , and the story of the change that came over them in an enlightened ago .
