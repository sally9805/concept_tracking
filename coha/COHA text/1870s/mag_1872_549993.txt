THE POET AT THE BREAKFAST-TABLE . VI . I FIND I have so many things in common with the Old Master of Arts , that I do not always know whether a thought was originally his or mine . That is what always happens where two persons of a similar cast of mind talk much together . And both of them gain by the interchange . Many ideas grow better when transplanted into another mind than in the one where they sprang up . That which was a weed in one intelligence becomes a flower in the other , and a flower , again , dwindles down to a mere weed by the same change . Healthy growths may become poisonous by falling upon the wrong mental soil , and what seemed a nightshade in one mind unfold as a morning-glory in the other . -I thank God ,  --  the Master said ,  - -  that a great many people believe a great deal more than I do . I think , when it comes to serious matters , I like those who believe more than I do better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said I , - you have got hold of one of my own working axioms . I should like to hear you develop it . The Member of the Haouse said he should be glad to listen to the debate . The gentleman had the floor . The Scarabee rose from his chair and departed ; - I thought his joints creaked as he straightened himself . The Young Girl nxade a slight movement ; it was a purely accidental coincidence , no doubt , but I saw That Boy put his hand in his pocket and pull out his popgun , and begin loading it . It can not be that Our Scheherazade , who looks so quiet and proper at the table , can make use of That Boy and his catapult to control the course of conversation and change it to suit herself ! She certainly looks innocent enough ; but what does a blush prove , and what does its absence prove , on one of these innocent faces ? There is nothing in all this world that can lie and cheat like the face and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little touch of hysteria ,  --  I do n't mean enough of it to make her friends call the doctor in , but a slight hint of it in the nervous system ,  --  and " Machiavel the waiting maid " might take lessons of her . But I can not think our Scheherazade is one of that kind , and I am ashamed of myself for noting such a trifling coincidence as that which excited my suspicion . - I say , - the Master continued , - that I had rather be in the company of those who believe more than I do , in spiritual matters at least , than of those who doubt what I accept as a patt of my belief . - To tell the truth , - said I , - I find that difficulty sometimes in talking with you . You have not quite so many hesitations as I have in following out your logical conclusions . I suppose you would . bring some things out into daylight questioning that I had rather leave in the twilight of half-belief peopled with shadows - if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many realities . There is nothing I do not question , - said the Master ; - I not only begin with the precept of Descartes , but I hold all my opinions involving any chain of reasoning always open to revision . - I confess that I smiled internally to hear him say that . The Old Master thinks he is open to conviction on all subjects ; but if you meddle with some of his notions and do n't get tossed on his horns as if a bull had hold of you , I should call you lucky . - You do n't mean you doubt everything ? -I said . - What do you think I question every1*hing for , - the Master replied , - if I never get any answers ? You ye seen a blind man with a stick , feeling his way along ? Well , I am a blind man with a stick , and I find the 1872. 73 ' // world pretty full of men just as blind as I am , but without any stick . I try the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I rest my weight on it ; but after it has borne my weight , that question at least is answered . It very certainly was strong enough once ; the presumption is that it is strong enough now . Still the soil may have been undermined , or I may have grown heavier . Make as much of that as you will . I say I question everything but if I find Bunker Hill Monument standing as straight as when I leaned against it a year or ten years ago , I am not very much afraid that Bunker Hill will cave in if I trust myself again on the soil of it . I glanced off , as one often does in talk . The Monument is an awful place to visit , - I said . - The waves of time are like the waves of the ocean ; the only thing they beat against without destroying it is a rock ; and they destroy that at last . But it takes a good while . There is a stone now standing in very good order that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Queen Anne 's day is now when Joseph went down into Egypt . Think of the shaft on Bunker Hill standing in the sunshine on the morning of January 1st in the year 5872 ! It wo n't be standing , - the Master said . - We are poor bunglers compared to those old Egyptians . There are no joints in one of their obelisks . They are our masters in more ways than we know of ; and in more ways than some of us are willing to know . That old Lawgiver was n't learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians for nothing . It scared people well a couple of hundred years ago when Sir John Marsham and Dr. John Spencer ventured to tell their stories about the sacred ceremonies of the Egyptian priesthood . People are beginning to find out now that you ca n't study any religion by itself to any good purpose . You must have comparative theology as you have comparative anatomy . What would you make of a cat 's foolish little good-for.nothing collgr-bone , if you did not know how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , - in yourself , for instance , as you 11 find out if you break it ? You ca n't know too much of your race and its beliefs , if you want to know anything about your Maker . I never found but one sect large enough to hold the whole of me. - And may I ask what that was ? - I said . - The Human sect , - the Master answered . - That has ab6ut room enough for me , - at present , I mean to say . - Including cannibals and all ? - said I. - 0 , as to that , the eating of one 's kind is a matter of taste , but the roasting of them has been rather more a specialty of our own particular belief than of any other I am acquainted with . If you broil a saint , I do n't see why , if you have a mind , you should n't serve him up at yourPop ! went the little piece of artillery . Do n't tell me it was accident . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute that a boy like that one would time his interruptions so clever ly . Now it so happened that at that particular moment Dr. B. Franklin was not at the table . You may draw your own conclusions . I say nothing , but I think a good deal . - I came back to the Bunker Hill Monument . - I often think - I said - of the dynasty which is to reign in its shadow for some thousands of years , it may be . The " Man of Letters , " so called , asked me , in a tone I did not exactly like , whether I expected to live long enough to see a monarchy take the place of a republic in this country . - No ,  --  said 1 ,  --  I was thinking of something very different . I was indulging a fancy of mine about the Man who is to sit at the foot of the monument for one or it may be two or three thousand years . As long as the monument stands and there is a city near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take the names of visitors and extract some small tribute from their pockets , I suppose . I sometimes get thinking of the long , unbroken succession of these men , until they come to look like one Man ; continuous in being , unchanging as the stone he watches , looking upon the successive generations of human beings as they come and go , and outliving all the dynasties of the world in all probability . It has come to such a pass that I never speak to the Man of the Moni*ment without wanting to take my hat off and feeling as if I were looking down a vista of twenty or thirty centuries . The " Man of Letters , " so called , said , in a rather contemptuous way , I thought , that he had n't got so far as that . He was n't quite up to moral reflections on toll-men and tickettakers . Sentiment was n't his tap . He looked round triumphantly for a response : but the Capitalist was a little hard of hearing just then ; the Register of Deeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a quadruped , and paid no attention ; the Salesman had bolted his breakfast , and whisked himself away with that peculiar alacrity which belongs to the retail-dealer 's assistant ; and the Member of the Haouse , who had sometimes seemed to be impressed with his " tahlented mahn 's " air of superiority to the rest of us , looked as if he thought the speaker was not exactly parliamentary . So he fa , iled to make his point , and reddened a little , and was not in the best humor , I thought , when he left the table . I hope he will not let off any of his irritation on our poor little Scheherazade ; but the truth is , the first person one of this sort of man ( if he is what I think him ) meets , when he is out of humor , has to be made a victim of , and I only hope our Young Girl will not have to play Jephthah 's daughter* And that leads me to say , I can not help thinking that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been subjected from some person or other , who is willing to be smart at her expense , 733 is hurtful and not wholesome . The question is a delicate one . So many foolish persofis are rushing into print , that it requires a kind of literary police to hold them back and keep them in order . Where there are mice there must be cats , and where there are rats we may think it worth our while to keep a terrier , who will give them a shake and let them drop , with all the mischief taken out of them . But the process is a rude . and cruel one at best , and it too often breeds a love of destructiveness for its own sake in those who get their living by it . A poor poem or essay does not do much harm , after all ; nobody reads it who is like to be seriously hurt by it . But a sharp criticism with a drop of witty venom in it stings a young author almost to death , and makes an old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business to sit in judgment on my neighbors , I would try to be courteous at least to those who had done any good service , but , above all , I would handle tenderly those young authors who are coming before the public in the flutter of their first or early appearance , and are in the trembling delirium of stage-fright already . Before you write that brilliant notice of some alliterative Angelina 's book of verses , I wish you would try this experiment . Take half a sheet of paper and copy upon it any of Angelina 's stanzas , - the ones you were going to make fun of , if you will . Now go to your window if it is a still day , open it , and let the half-sheet of paper drop on the outside . How gently it falls through the soft air , always tending downwards , but sliding softly , from side to side , wavering , hesitating , balancing , until it settles as noiselessly as a snow-flake upon the all-receiving bosom of the earth ! Just such would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if you had left it to itself . It would have slanted downward into oblivion so sweetly and softly that she would have never known when it reached that harmless consummation . The Poet at the Breakfast- Table . // Our ej5izoic literature is becoming so extensive that nobody is safe from its ad i ; * , dniturn progeny . A man writes a book of criticisms . A Quarterly Review criticises the critic . A Monthly Magazine takes up the critic 's critic . A Weekly Journal criticises the critic of the critic 's critic , and a Daily Paper favors us with some critical remarks 011 the performance of the writer in the Weekly , who has criticised the critical notice in the Monthly of the critical essay in the Quarterly on the critical work we started with . And thus we see that as each flea " has smaller fleas that on him prey , " even the critic himself can not escape the common lot of being bitten . Whether all this is a blessing or a curse , like that one which made Pharaoh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a question about which opinions might differ . The physiologists of the time of Moses - if there were vivisectors other than priests in those days - would probably have considered that other plague , of the frogs , as a fortunate opportunity for science , as this poor little beast has been the soz*ffre-douZeur of experimenters and school-boys from time immemorial . But there is a form of criticism to which none will object . It is impossible to come before a public so alive with sensibilities as this we live in , with the smallest evidence of a sympathetic disposition , without making friends in a very unexpected way . Everywhere there are minds tossing on the unquiet waves of doubt . If you confess to the same perplexities and uncertainties that torture them , they are grateful for your companionship . If you have groped your way out of the wilderness in which you were once wandering with them , they will follow your footsteps , it may be , and bless you as their deliverer . So , all at once , a writer finds he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true , beyond the reach of any summons but that of a trumpet like the archangel 's , to whom his slight discourse may be of more value than the exhortations they hear from the pulpit , if these last do not happen to June , suit their special needs . Young men with more ambition and intelligence than force of character , who have missed their first steps in life and are stumbling irresolute amidst vague aims and changing purposes , hold out their hands , imploring to be led into , or at least pointed towards , some path where they can find a firm foothold . Young women born into a chilling atmosphere of circumstance which keeps all the buds of their nature unopened and always striving to get toaray of sunshine , if one finds its way to their neighborhood , tell their stories , sometimes simply and touchingly , sometimes in a more or less affected and rhetorical way , but still stories of defeated and disappointed instincts which ought to make any moderately impressible person feel very tenderly toward them . In speaking privately to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one should be very considerate of their human feelings . But addressing them collectively a few plain truths will not give any one of them much pain . Indeed , almost every individual among them will feel sure that he or she is an exception to those generalities which apply so well to the rest . If I were a literary Pope sending out an Encyclical , I would tell these inexperienced persons that nothing is so frequent as to mistake an ordinary human gift for a special and extraordinary endowment . The mechanism of breathing and that of swallowing are very wonderful , and if one had seen and studied them in his own person only , he might well think himself a prodigy . Everybody knows these and other bodily faculties are common gifts ; but nobody except editors and schoolteachers and here and there a literary man knows how common is the capacity of rhyming and prattling in readable prose , especially among young women of a certain degree of education . In my character of Pontiff , I should tell these young persons that most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to believe it ; one feels so full The Poet at the Breakfast-Table. // of intelligence and so decidedly superior to one 's dull relations and schoolmates ; one writes so easily and the lines sound so prettily to one 's self ; there are such felicities of expression , just like those we . hear quoted from the great poets ; and besides one has been told by so many friends that all one had to do was to print and be famous ! Delusion , my poor dear , delusion at least nineteen times out of twenty , yes , ninety-nine times in a hundred . But as private father confessor , I always allow as much as I can for the one chance in the hundred . I try not to take away all hope , unless the case is clearly desperate , and then to do it by . directing the activities into some other channel . Using kind language , I can talk pretty freely . I have counselled more than one aspirant after literary fame to go back to his tailor 's board or his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends praised their verses or their stories , to give up all their deceptive dreams of making a name by their genius , and go to work in the study of a profession which asked only for the diligent use of average , ordinary talents . It is a very grave responsibility which these unknown correspondents throw upon their chosen counsellors . One whom you have never seen , who lives in a community of which you know nothing , sends you specimens more or less painfully voluminous of his writings , which he asks you to read over , think over , and pray over , and send back an answer informing him whether fame and fortune are awaiting him as the possessor of the wonderful gifts his writings manifest , and whether you advise him to leave all , - the shop he sweeps out every morning , the ledger he posts , the mortar in which he pounds , the bench at which he urges the reluctant plane , - and follow his genius whithersoever it may lead him . The next correspondent wants you to mark out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means of judgment he gives you are about as adequate as the brick which the simpleton 73$ of old carried round as an advertisement of the house he had to sell . My advice to all the young men that write to me depends somewhat on the handwriting and spelling . If these are of a certain character , and they have reached a mature age , I recommend some honest manual calling , such as they have very probably been bred to , and which will , at least , give them a chance of becoming President of the United States by and by , if that is any object to them . What would you have done with the young person who called on me a good many years ago , - so many that he has pr2bably forgotten his literary effort , - and read as specimens of his literary workmanship lines like those which I will favor you with presently ? He was an able-bodied , grown-up young person , whose ingenuousness interested me ; and I am sure if I thought he would ever be pained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deny myself the pleasure of submitting it to the reader . The following is an exact transcript of the lines he showed me , and which I took down on the spot : - " Are you in the vein for cider ? Are you in the tune for pork ? Hist for Betty a cleared the larder And turned the pork to soap . " Do not judge too hastily this sincere effort of a maiden muse . Here was a sense of rhythm , and an effort in the direction of rhyme ; here was an honest transcript of an occurrence of daily life , told with a certain idealizing expression , recognizing the existence of impulses , mysterious instincts impelling us even in the selection of our bodily sustenance . But I had to tell him that it wanted dignity of incident and grace of narrative , that there was no atmosphere to it , nothing of the light that never was and so forth . I did not say this in these very words , but I gave him to understand , without being too hard upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toil in pursuit of the poet 's bays . This , it must be confessed , was a rather discouraging case . A young person like The Poet at the Breakfast-Table. // this may A/erce , as the Frenchmen say , by and by , but the chances are all the other way . I advise aimless young men to choose some profession without needless delay , and so get into a good strong current of human affairs , and find themselves bound up in interests with a compact body of their fellow-men . I advise young women who write to me for counsel , - perhaps I do not advise them at all , only sympathize a little with them , and listen to what they have to say ( eight closely written pages on the average , which I always read from beginning to end , thinking of the widow 's cruse and myself in the character of Elijah ) and - and - come now , I do n't believe Methuselah would tell you what he said in his letters to young ladies , written when he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dear me ! how much work all this private criticism involves ! An editor has only to say " respectfully declined , " and there is the end of it . But the confidential adviser is expected to give the reasons of his likes and dislikes in detail , and sometimes to enter into an argument for their support . That is more than any martyr can stand , but what trials he must go through , as it is ! Great bundles of manuscripts , verse or prose , which the recipient is expected to read , perhaps to recommend to a publisher , at any rate to express a well-digested and agreeably flavored opinion about ; which opinion , nine times out of ten , disguise it as we may , has to be a bitter draught ; every form of egotism , conceit , false sentiment , hunger for notoriety , and eagerness for display of anserine plumage before the admiring public ; - all these come in by mail or express , covered with postage-stamps of so much more cost than the value of the waste words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and change color at the very sight of a package , and to dread the postman 's knock as if it were that of the other visitor whose naked knuckles rap at every door . Still there are experiences which go far towards repaying all these inflictions . My last young man 's case looked desperate enough ; some of his sails had blown from the rigging , some were backing in the wind , and some were flapping and shivering , but I told him which way to head , and to my surprise he promised to do just as I directed , and I do not doubt is under full sail at this moment . What if I should tell my last , my very recent experience with the other sex ? I received a paper containing the inner history of a young woman 's life , the evolution of her consciousness from its earliest record of itself , written so thoughtfully , so sincerely , with so much firmness and yet so much delicacy , with such truth of detail and such grace in the manner of telling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting , with a pleasure rarely , almost never experienced in voluminous communications which one has to spell out of handwriting . This was from a correspondent who made my acquaintance by letter when she was little more than a child , some years ago . How easy at that early period to have silenced her by indifference , to have wounded her by a careless epithet , perhaps even to have crushed her as one puts his heel on a weed ! A very little encouragement kept her from despondency , and brought back one of those overflows of gratitude which make one more ashamed of himself for being so overpaid , than he would be for having committed any of the lesser sins . But what pleased me most in the paper lately received was to see how far the writer had outgrown the need of any encouragement of mine ; that she had strengthened out of her tremulous questionings into a self-reliance and self-poise which I had hardly dared to anticipate for her . Some of my readers who are also writers have very probably had more numerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; self-revelations from unknown and sometimes nameless friends , who write from strange corners where the winds have wafted some stray 736 June , // words of theirs which have lighted in the minds and reached the hearts of those to whom they were as the angel that stirred the pool of Bethesda . Perhaps this is the best reward authorship brings ; it may not imply much talent or literary excellence , but it means that your way of thinking and feeling is just what some one of your fellow-creatures needed . - I have been putting into shape , according to his request , some further passages from the young Astronomer 's manuscript , some of which the reader will have a chance to read if he is so disposed . The conflict in the young man 's mind between the desire for fame and the sense of its emptiness as compared with nobler aims has set me thinking about the subject from a somewhat humbler point of view . As I am in the habit of telling you , Beloved , many of my thoughts , as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you may read what follows as if it were addressed to you in the course of an ordinary conversation , where I claimed rather more than my share , as I am afraid I am a little in the habit of doing . I suppose we all , those of us who write in verse or prose , have the habitual feeling that we should like to be remembered . It is to be awake when all of those who were round us have been long wrapped in slumber . It is a pleasant thought enough that the name by which we have been called shall be familiar on the lips of those who come after us , and the thoughts that wrought themselves out in our intelligence , the emotions that trembled through our frames , shall live themselves over again in the minds and hearts of others . But is there not something of rest , of calm , in the thought of gently and gradually fading away out of human remembrance ? What line have we written that was on a level with our conceptions ? What page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fain have left unrecorded ? To become a classic and share the life of a language is to be ever open to criticisms , to comparisons , to the caprices of successive genera*tions , to be called into court and stand a trial before a new jury , once or more than once in every century . To be forgotten is to sleep in peace with the undisturbed myriads , no longer subject to the chills and heats , the blasts , the sleet , the dust , which assail in endless succession that shadow of a man which we call his reputation . The line which dying we would wish to blot has been blotted out for us by a hand so tender , so patient , so used to its kindly task , that the page looks as fair as if it had never borne the record of our infirmity or our transgression . And then so few would be wholly content with their legacy of fame . You remember poor Monsieur Jacques 's complaint of the favoritism shown to Monsieur Berthier , - it is in that exquisite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you seen his room ? Have you seen how large it is ? Twice as large as mine ! He has two jugs , a large one and a little one . I have only one small one . And a tea-service and a gilt Cupid on the top of his looking-glass . " The famous survivor of himself has had his features preserved in a medallion , and the slice of his countenance seems clouded with the thought that it does not belong to a bust ; the bust ought to look happy in its niche , but the statue opposite makes it feel as if it had been cheated out of half its personality , and the statue looks uneasy because another stands on a loftier pedestal . But " Ignotus " and " Miserrimus " are of the gre at majority in that vast assembly , that House of Commons whose members are all peers , where to be forgotten is the standing rule . The dignity of a silent memory is not to be undervalued . Fame is after all a kind of rude handling , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ borrow something not to be desired , as the paper money that passes from hand to hand gains somewhat which is a loss thereby . 0 sweet , tyanquil refuge 1872. 737 // of oblivion , so far as earth is concerned , for us poor blundering , stammering , misbehaving creatures who can not turn over a leaf of our life 's diary without feeling thankful that its failure can no longer stare us in the face ! Not unwelcome shall be the baptism of dust which hides forever the name that was given in the baptism of water ! We shall have good company whose names are left unspoken by posterity . " Who knows whether the best of men be known , or whether there be not more remarkable persons forgot than any that stand remembered in the known account of time ?

There are times when the thought of becoming utterly nothing to the world we knew so well and loved so much is painful and oppressive ; we gasp as if in a vacuum , missing the atmosphere of life we have so long been in the habit of breathing . Not the less are there moments when the aching need of repose comes over us and the requiescat in race , heathen benediction as it is , sounds more sweetly in our ears than all the promises that Fame can hold out to us . I wonder whether it ever occurred to you to reflect upon another horror there must be in leaving a name behind you .

Make out your own list ; I will set down a few that come up to me as I write . - What is the prevalent religious creed of civilization ? - Has the planet met with any accident of importance ? - How general is the republican form of government ? - Do men fly yet ? - Has the universal language come into use ? - Is there a new fuel since the English coal-mines have given out ? - Is the euthanasia a recognized branch of medical science ? - Is the oldest inhabitant still liv-ing ? - Is the Daily Advertiser still pub-lished ? - And the Evening Transcript ' ? - Is there much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Old Style ) by - the - name - of-ofMy tongue cleaves to the roof of my mouth . I can not imagine the putting of that question without feeling the tremors which shake a wooer as he falters out the words that make him happy or wretched . Whose works was I going to question him about , do you ask me ? 0 , the writings of a friend of mine , much esteemed by his relatives and others . But it s of no consequence , after all ; I think he says he does not care much for posthumous reputation . I find something of the same interest in thinking about one of the boarders at our table that I find in my waking dreams concerning the Man of the Monument . This personage is the Register of Deeds . He is an unemotional character , living in his business almost as exclusively as the Scarabee , but without any of that eagerness and enthusiasm which belongs to our scien tific specialist . His work is largely , principally , I may say , mechanical . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the antiquities of his department , and once in a while brings out some curious result of his investigations into ancient documents . He too belongs to a dynasty which will last as long as there is such a thing as property in land and dwellings . When that is done away with , and we return to the state of villanage , holding our tenement-houses , all to be of the same pattern , of the State , - that is to say , of the Tammany Ring which is to take the place of the feudal lord , - the office of Register of Deeds will , I presume , become useless , and the dynasty will be deposed . As we grow older we think more and more of old persons and of old things and places . As to old persons , it seenied as if we never knew how much they had to tell until we are old ourselves and they have been gone twenty or thirty yeavs . Once in a while we come upon some survivor of his or her generation that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the lost books of Livy or fished up the golden candlestick from the ooze of the Tiber . So it was the other day after my reminiscences of the old gambrel-roofed house and its visitors . They found an echo in the recollections of one of the brightest and liveliest of my suburban friends , whose memory is exact about everything except her own age , which , there can be no doubt , she makes out a score or two of years more than it really is . Still she was old enough to touch some lights - and a shadow or two - into the portraits I had drawn , which made me wish that she and not I had been the artist who sketched the pictures . Among the lesser regrets that mingle with graver sorrows for the friends of an earlier generation we have lost , are our omissions to ask them so many questions they could have answered so easily , and would have been so pleased to be asked . There ! I say to myself sometimes , in an absent mood , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of whom I am now thinking has long been beyond the reach of any earthly questioning , and I sigh to think how easily I could have learned some fact which I should have been happy to have transmitted with pious care to those who are to come after me . How many times I have heard her quote the line about blessings brightening as they take their flight , and how true it proves in many little ways that one never thinks of until it is too late ! The Register of Deeds is not himself advanced in years . But he borrows an air of antiquity from the ancient records which are stored in his sepulchral archives . I love to go to his ossuary of dead transactions , as I would visit the catacombs of Rome or Paris . it is like wandering up the Nile to stray among the shelves of his monumental folios . Here stands a series of volumes , extending over a considerable number of years , all which volumes are in his handwriting . But as you go backward there is a break @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who was getting old apparently , for it is beginning to be a little shaky , and then you know that you have gone back as far as the last days of his predecessor . Thirty or forty years more carry you to the time when this incumbent began the duties of his office ; his hand was steady then ; and the next volume beyond it in date betrays the work of a still different writer . All this interests me , but I do not see how it is going to interest my reader . I do not feel very happy about the Register of Deeds . What can I do with him ? Of what use is he going to be in my record of what I have seen and heard at the breakfast-table ? The fact of his being one of the boarders was not so important that I was obliged to speak of him , and I might just as well have drawn on my imagination and not allowed this dummy to take up the room which another guest might have profitably filled at our breakfast-table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have got him on my hands , and VOL XXIX. - NO. 176. 47 74 ' I mean that he shall be as little in the way as possible . One always comes across people in actual life who have no particular business to be where we find them , and whose right to be at all is somewhat questionable . I am not going to get rid of the Register of Deeds by putting him out of the way ; but I confess I do not see what service he is going to be of to me in my record . I have often found , however , that the Disposer of men and things understands much better than we do how to place his pawns and other pieces on the chess-board of life . A fish more or less in the ocean does not seem to amount to much . It is not extravagant to say that any one fish may be considered a supernumerary . But when Captain Coram 's ship sprung a leak and the carpenter could not stop it , and the passengers had made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all at once , without any apparent reason , the pumps began gaining on the leak , and the sinking ship to lift herself out of the abyss which was swallowing her up . And what do you think it was that saved the ship , and Captain Coram , and so in due time gave to London that Foundling Hospital which he endowed , and under the floor of which he lies buried ? Why , it was that very supernumerary fish , which we held of so little account , but which had wedged itself into the rent of the yawning planks , and , served to keep out the water until the leak was finally stopped . I am very sure it was Captain Coram , but I almost hope it was somebody else , in order to give some poor fellow who is lying in wait for the periodicals a chance to correct me . That will make him happy for a month , and besides , he will not want to pick a quarrel about anything else if he has that splendid triumph . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the extracts I spoke of from the manuscript placed in my hands for revision and emendation. t can understand these alternations of The Poet at the Breakfast- Table . // feeling in a young person who has been long absorbed in a single pursuit , and in whom the human instincts which have been long silent are now beginning to find expression . I know well what he wants ; a great deal better , I think , than he knows himself . WIND-CLOUDS AND STARDRIFTS . II . Briefglimpses of the bright celestial spheres , False lights , false shadows , vague , uncertain gleams , Pale vaporous mists , wan streaks of lurid flame , The climbing of the upward-sailing cloud , The sinking of the downward-falling star , - All these are pictures of the changing moods Borne through the midnight stillness of my soul . Here am I , bound upon this pillared rock , Prey to the vulture of a vast desire That feeds upon my life . I burst my bands And steal a moment 's freedom from the beak , The clinging talons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with her song : " Thou wouldst not lay thy forehead in the dust Like the base herd that feeds and breeds and dies ! Lo , the fair garlands that I weave for thee , Unchanging as the belt Orion wears , Bright as the je*vels of the seven-starred Crown , The spangled stream of Berenice 's hair ! " And so she twines the fetters with the flow-ers Around my yielding limbs , , and the fierce bird Stoops to his quarry , - then to feed his rage Of ravening hunger I must drain my blood And let the dew-drenched , poison-breeding night Steal all the freshness from my fading cheek , And leave its shadows round my caverned eyes . All for a line in some unheeded scroll ; All for a stone that tells to gaping clowns , " Here lies a restless wretch beneath a clod Where squats the jealous nightmare men call Fame ! " I*marvel not at him who scorns his kind And thinks not sadly of the time foretold When the old hulk we tread shall be a wreck , A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crew of fools ! We live too long And even so are not content to die , But load the mould that covers up our bones With stones that stand like beggars by the road And show death 's grievous wound and ask for tears Write our great books to teach men who we are , Sing our fine songs that tell in artful phrase The secrets of our lives , and plead and pray For alms of memory with the after time , Those few swift seasons while the earth shall wear Its leafy summers , ere its core grows cold And the moist life of all that breathes shall die ; Or as the new-born seer , perchance more wise , Would have us deem , before its growing mass , Pelted with star-dust , stoned with meteor-balls , Heats like a hammered anvil , till at last Man and his works and all that stirred itself Of its own motion , in the fiery glow Turns to a flaming vapor , and our orb Shi4es a new sun for earths that shall be born . I am as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squared the pyramids By the same stars I watch . I read the page Where every letter is a glittering world , With them who looked from Shinar 's clay . built towers , Ere yet the wanderer of the Midland sea Had missed the fallen sister of the seven . I dwell in spaces vague , remote , unknown , Save to the silent few , who , leaving earth , Quit all communion with their living time . I lose myself in that ethereal void , Till I have tired my wings and long to fill My breast with denser air , to stand , to walk With eyes not raised above my fellow-men . Sick of my unwalled , solitary realm , I ask to change the myriad lifeless worlds I visit as mine . own for one poor* patch Of this dull spheroid and a little breath To shape in word or deed to serve my kind . Was ever giant 's dungeon dug so deep , Was ever tyrant 's fetter forged so strong , Was e'er such deadly poison in the draught The false wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victim is himself , Digs , forges , mingles , for his captive soul ?
