THE night was almost gone . Not a star appeared , for the sky was black with clouds steeped in the gloom of night . A cold wind pierced me like a knife as I looked up and down the deserted wharves . Scarcely a sound-scarcely a human tread where the busiest throngs of all the great city surge in their daily ebb and flood . A deep groan shook the air ; and a great wraith of steam arose from the river , floated over the low sheds along the docks , and came over the street . As the specter looked down on the glare of gas it flushed faintly , then disappeared in the sky . Beyond the brilliant sheds of Washington Market the river was a black expanse peopled with black ships ; neither ships nor river could be seen but their presence was felt through their gloom . The opposite shore of Jersey City showed a long belt of lights , like a zone of stars scattered along the horizon . I turned again to the street and the strange life about me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York . I started here , at Washington Market , because the day of the city first begins here , at night , and its scale of social life begins here at the lowest degree . Higher types are not wanting . For this water-front is the beach of a great sea of humanity . Toilers and idlers , drift and treasure , blooming youth and cold cadavers , all are found in this surging surf of human life . I penetrated still farther into the market , where it was thronged with butchers and grocers buying Sunday dinners for two millions of mouths . Wagons filled the narrow alleys half covered by low , projecting roofs and awnings . Some of the A DAY ON THE DOCKS . open stalls were hung full of crimson and yellow meat ; others were piled up with green vegetables ; and some were decked with turkeys , ducks and other game . The wagons , too , were heaped with these contrasted colors . The market-men were strong , ruddy figures , plump and comfortable in their long frocks . They rushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one hugging a carcass of mutton , another struggling under a quarter of beeg and others plying hammer and adz while boxes and barrels were trucked about . Geese and men screamed and shouted , horses began to strike fire from their feet , the wagons moved , the alleys became a stream of meats and fruits , and the Sunday dinners started on their cheerful errands . And the whole scene of turmoil glowed like a magic world , dim in form yet intensely vivid , just under the blackness of night . Then some of the market-men began to depart , and I fancied they had a nipping and an eager air . So I followed them , and soon entered a large and elegant restaurant near by . The shining marble and mirrors , the glare of gas-lights , the warm air and the savory smells were certainly very welcome . The chairs were well filled with visible appetites in gray frocks and slouch hats . Broad , smooth , ruddy faces appeared through the columns of steam from plates . They were indeed a stag party-heavy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the sentiment of feed . When I returned to the street , day-break had come . The heavens wore a gray veil // 33 through which the day struggled and at last looked down on the city . The irregular front of roofs , and the still more irregular sheds over the piers , appeared dimly far up and down West street . The gas-lights paled ; the colors faded ; and the city put on its common dress of dirty gray . The plan of my walk was to begin at West Thirty-fourth street , pass down the west side of the city to the Battery , and then up the east side to the Dry Docks . This route includes all the chief objects of interest on fhe wharves , and presents them in the . order of their succession , as a visitor will naturally find them . Having done , then , with the ei*rliest scene on the docks ,  --  the opening of Washington Market ,  --  J jumped on a car to ride up town to begin the regular tour of the water-front . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a general way from the front platform of the car , it seemed disgusting to every sense . We sailed through a canal of filth , fetlock deep with black mud . Moreover , there was scarcely an attractive object in the whole view . The air throbbed with loud cries , here and there a hoarse curse , and the general bedlam of low life . New York is bordered with rat-holes and rotten cribs , gin-mills and junk-shops . As you survey these superficial features you wonder that anything good should exist within such vile borders . A sensible savage would suggest that the water-front of a sea-port should be occupied by warehouses , large docks , industries connected with ship-building and other conveniences for maritime trade . But New York is neither savage nor sensible ; and the miserable houses on our waterAMONG THE FIGURE-HEADS. // front are given up to every kind of trumpery retail trade . The structures on the docks are no better . Most of the piers are uncovered , an unfOrtunate circumstance in this inclement climate . Only here and there a shed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or an ocean steamer . The piers themselves are disgraceful . A few piles are driven in the mud , timbers are laid over them , and planks are spiked over these . When they have rotted sufficiently , these piers are offered by the city to the commerce of the world at exorbitant rents . They are too narrow even for the circulation of a junk-cart . The wonder is that a respectable ship will submit to be delivered in such a berth . Nevertheless , this unsightly , dangerous , and inconvenient water-front of New York offers very interesting studies . It is full of striking industries , that show by some astonishing feats , what strength , skill , and endurance men develop under the high pressure of commerce . It offers some of the most curious scenes of a great city 's life , for it is the daily path of every kind of people , and it is crowded with the products of all nations . In short , the docks are a great panorama o ( human life , filled with its toils , pleasures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aspects of human nature . The industrial features of the water-front are quite as interesting as the more picturesque scenes ; and they began at once to impress me with the remarkable amount of labor man performs here with the aid of his inventions , with the enormous proportions of every commodity and every industry , and with the extraordinary skill and endurance developed in individuals . I came at once to examples in point at the foot of Thirtyfourth street , the beginning of our walk . The great , useless Manhattan Market was the single exception to general activity . It was empty , quiet as a cathedral , and even more spacious . The market-scene contained two Sisters of Charity , pacing silently over the pavement to a solitary butcher 's stall . The roof resounfded with the twittering of sparrows flying among the net-work of iron braces . The pier , however , was a busy scene , with five brigs from Prince Edward 's Island unloading that day 4o , ooo bushels of potatoes , and with lines of men tossing cabbages from canal-boats in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grain elevator and mill , a humming hive of industry , a great cavern , dimly lighted , and obscured by mists of flour . Three men were at a weighing machine under a grain spout ; one was weighing , one was bagging , and another was tying up fifteen sacks of oats per minute and delivering them to a wagon below . Further up among the shadows , the mists , and the whirling shafts , I saw a solitary man with his hands on another apparatus , by which he screened , weighed , and put in a bin , 5,000 bushels of grain per hour . Then I climbed down among the shafts and great timbers to the street , and resumed my way southward . I soon came to a coal-yard , where two bulky fellows in the hold of a canal-boat were shoveling coal into the elevating buckets . They wore only boots , trowsers , and an undershirt without sleeves . Their great arms , strong necks , and manly , though heavy , faces , were all black and grimy with coal-dust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per day . Farther on was a man working in a lumber-yard containing $300,000 worth of choice lumber . He could pile 30,000 feet of green lumber in a day . Beyond this were some ice-wagons loading from barges at the dock ; in summer they will cart away 20,000 tons per week , and distribute it all over the city and the suburbs , in quantities from ten pounds to joo tons per day in a place . There are the iron-works , a great , shadowy cavern , with here and there a fire in its gloom , steamgiants groaning and striking blows that shake the earth , and men coming from dark corners to the forges and glowing at their toil like fiery demons . There is the cotton-press , a monster whose jaws close on a bale with a pressure of i , ooo tons , compress it to the thinness of one foot , and thus prepare 70 bales per . hour for shipping to Europe . There is the wood-yard , where a saw and a knife cut and split four cords of wood per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many to be described . But another aspect , also , of city life is presented in this part of the Wharves . A mile or more of the shore below Thirtyfourth street is occupied chiefly by lumberyards . The region is known among a certain class as Timber Town Hotel . This extensive establishment is a summer resort for the vagabonds of the city . It is what the French would call an H6tel meuble ' , since it offers only beds . And yet it is full of lodgers every night from April till November . All the human experiences , from birth to marriage and death , literally transpire under its spacious roof . Sunday toilets are performed at the hydrant , with such odd bits of mirror , combs , and ribbons as the gutter may have // 35 A COTTON PRESS . qwq $50 for the recovery of several tierces of lard stolen from a neighboring warehouse . Some years ago this front was infested with gangs of thieves and smugglers . But they have moved away , some to municipal offices of trust and emolument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Thirteenth avenue is now a quiet lumber region . The walk has brought us down to West Eleventh street , where you leave the quieter docks devoted to the bulky commodities of grain , lumber , iron , and ice , and enter the bustle of the great sea-port . Here begins the beach of humanity , and it extends for miles , all around the lower half of the city . Long lines of men and teams surge up and down , farther than the eye can see or the ear can hear their busy march . And along the piers lie fleets of ships from every quarter of the globe . Thescene , as a whole , is grand ; too large , too full of intense activity , too vivid with all the colors of human life , for any one to grasp or portray . The first object met here is the oyster market . It is a long block of two-storied sheds built on boats . Little verandas and arched windows under the projecting roofs give them a tasty look . Broad gang-planks , leading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sidewalk . In and their oyster-beds . Other men , with their bands in their pockets , lean against the buildings and chew their quids , while keeping a weather eye on the crowded street . Here and there a wharf loafer overhauls a pile of refuse shells and cullings , to find a few rejected oysters . Inside the boat is a row of twenty busy men , seated along one side . Each sits on a low stool , and spreads his knees wide apart , on each side of a pile of oysters and an upright iron bar . A pail of water for washing , a pail for the oysters , and a basket for sbells , stand before him . He catches up an oyster , lays its edge on the iron bar , and knocks off a chip of the shells with his short , heavy knife ; then be pries open the shells , and in a twinkling takes the slippery tenant between his thumb and the blade and tosses it into the pail . The men are grimy , silent , deft , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attentive to open 6 , ooo oysters each in a day . 30,000 barrels a year are sold in this house , and about 2,500,000 barrels in the entire city . The slip in the rear of the market is filled with pretty sloops . The place is a net-work of masts and rigging , with here and there a basket hoisted by a tackle , and a sail hanging in shaded folds . Men are going from boat to boat , and some are coming over gang-planks to the market , with baskets on their shoulders . A peddler of bright mittens and socks is trading with a black cook in a cabin gangway ; and on another boat the head and shoulders of a woman and a child appear above deck . The sun shines on them all , and here and there flashes up from the bits of water between the sloops . Ocean steamers occupy several consecutive piers below Tenth street and give their locality a distinctive character . I went on hoard one of the shipsand looked down her hold , four stories deep . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lumber . The donkey engines were rattling , tackles were running , officers were whistling , gesticulating , and hallooing up and down the hold . A gang of men were laboring below to get a great log of mahogany out with the tackle .

The place smells of the salt sea , and the characters idling about are from the sea-shore . Skippers in blue pea-jackets discuss the merits of their crafts // of grain . An elevator alongside raised the sons , from occupying any permanent abode . grain from a canal-boat , and then sent it down They are the wandering owls , hawks , and a spout pouring two six-inch streams of foxes of the population ; they prey by day wheat .

This under it ; four sewed up the bags as fast as region of the ocean steamers is their chief they were filled at the rate of about eight per minute . Sometimes a ship arrives so late that only three days are allowed for the work . 3,000 tons of freight are to be taken out , and as much put in , besides her coal . 200 men are set to work in her ; she swarms and buzzes night and day like a hive . Every hatchway and port-hole is giving or taking some kind of package , from a steam-engine to a log of wood . But the men work methodically , under the direction of skillful stevedores , and steam does the hoisting ; so at the appointed time she is ready again for sea . The population of the wharves is wonderfully varied . In fact , if all who use them be included in the estimate it will embrace parts of the whole human family . Drift from every nation comes to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field of life come and go in this restless tide of humanity . Some classes , of course , have a connection with the wharves more permanent than that of a passenger ; such are the various artisans connected with shipping , the merchants whose wares come chiefly by water , and other men established in the houses along West and South streets . But one of the most interesting classes refrain , for obvious rea lurking-place . My interest in these thieves , wharf-rats , smugglers and their kind , led me to engage one of the steamboat squad of police to row me about for a view of the life and scenery under the wharves . We embarked at Charlton street in a small boat , suitable for entering narrow passages , and commenced our explorations at low tide . We picked a passage among canal-boats and lighters filling the slip , and finally reached the open water to pull up the river a few blocks . Fortunately , the day was bright , though cool , so we had a good light for our subterranean voyage . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sir , there are two kinds of watermen , as there are of landmen ,  --  honest and dishonest ones . And besides these , there is a third kind , the negotiator between the thief and the honest man . There is one , now , rowing around that pier . He is a licensed junkman ; he holds a license for running a boat and buying and selling old refuse articles of any kind  --  a kind of waterragman . Well , these fellows sell a great deal more than they buy ; and what they buy was ofren neither bought nor earned , but stolen by the wharf thieves . But they have a license and that shields them . " A SECTIONAL DOCK . // As the man rowed by us in his dirty brown boat , with a large pile of old ropes in the stern sheets , the officer hailed him . " Well , Jerry , you 've made quite a haul . It cost something , I suppose ? " queried the officer , significantly . Yes , sir , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he rested on his oars . " It cost enough . " " But it was your own price , I 'll bet . Anything new going on ? " " Well , no ; not much . Only the Doctor was caught nappin ' by a flat last night , and his plant was dug up . I guess he 'll garden somewhere else now . " When we had parted the officer resumed : " Perhaps you do n't understand his lingo . He meant that one of the wharf-rats , called the Doctor , had been arrested last night by a policeman and that his plant , or his plunder , planted or hidden away , had been found . He thinks the Doctor will have to cultivate a patch at Sing Sing . " The view of the piers from the water is singularly out of keeping with the grandeur of the city , or with the commercial activity at their inner end along West street . If it were not for the dignity of the great harbor and the vast collection of fine ships , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tattered , dirty fringe to the city . They are of all widths that are too narrow , of all lengths too short ; a few are covered with sheds , but the most are bare piers on open cribs of spiles and braces . Scarcely any life is seen on the pier-heads ; they seem deserted country docks , waiting to receive some inland steamboat . The activity is on the streets , and inside of the piers , or on the water , covered with steam-tugs and ferry-boats . But I forgot the piers in the presence of the great ocean steamers , whose grandeur and beauty are very impressive when seen from a little boat . We soon turned under the pier of the Christopher street ferry and left the sunshine for shadows , among long rows of piles sprinkled with barnacles , and under a low , level roof of heavy stringers , braces , and planks . At last we came to a large square structure , like a flat-boat , floating on the water and supporting one end of the ferry bridge . Between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is a large space . " This , " said the officer , " is one of the best hiding-places they have-on top of this float . Sometimes they cut a hole in the planks and then use the inside of the float for a store-room . It is protected from rain by the ferry-house , and it is safe from the tide , because the float always floats above the waves . The tramping of the passengers overhead drowns any noise these men make in operating down here , and they can live in safety here till discovered by some boating expedition . The passengers overhead do n't imagine that they walk over a robber 's cave , hut some strange things are done under ground as well as over it . We lately found $3,700 worth of velvets and silks on such a ferry-float in Jersey City . They get such goods from the European steamers , where the people often aid them in smuggling . Men on the ships drop overboard packages of cigars or other valuables , and they generally fall in one of these boats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accepts an invitation to the neighborin.g saloon , and leaves the pier long enough for the purposes intended . Sometimes the thief saws part of a plank out from under a pile of goods and then fills his boat ; or he bores an auger-hole up till he taps a barrel of liquor , and runs it into his own cask . They have a thousand tricks of the kind . One of us lately heard a man working at a pile of fruit . He soon filled his boat under a hole in the planking and then started away ; but just as he came out from under the pier , the officer above dropped a slip-noose over his head and hauled him up to the dock , and that thief was about as much surprised as any man you ever saw. ** We resumed our voyage , passing under pier after pier , picking our way through the . intervening slips filled with various craft , or prowling under West street , where it is built over the water on piles . This under side of the city is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structure , as well as its seclusion , makes it as good as a forest for hiding . The piles stand in rows running across the pier , a stringer or heavy timber lies on top of each row , joists lie across the stringers , and planks cover the whole . Thus between the top of each stringer and the planks there is quite a space , where boxes and bundles can be hidden . The under side of a pier can hold a good sloopload of packages , and a box on a stringer is invisible to any one passing under the pier , unless he passes very close to it . There are many miles of piers about the city , and each pier has a great quantity of stringers . So here is a vast region of secrecy right under the busiest part of New York . Many of the piers are supported on such a dense // forest of spiles that only the smallest skiff can pass through the narrow , tortuous openings . Formerly the thieves had a channel of this kind from one end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could travel nearly the whole distance without showing themselves . " You see , sir , here are plenty of chances to hide . These cribs of beams and spiles , mouths of sewers , odd holes here and there along the rocky shores , and all of it covered over from daylight , and some of it almost inaccessible ,  --  all that you would think is enough for any set of thieves . But it is not ; for we follow them up and clean out their holes . They find new places now and then . Once we discovered a lot of hardware and tools hidden under the guards and in the paddle-box of a steamboat that was laid up for the winter . Many things they hide under water , such as spelter and other metals . It is almost impossible to discover these plants ' ; but sometimes we hit on them by chance . Once , a man who had been loafing about the deck of one of the Troy steamboats threw overboard a valuable hawser , and then plunged overboard himself before anybody could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full of people . Both the hawser and the man fell into a skiff alongside the steamboat and disappeared under the pier . He had the start , and of course escaped before any of us could get a boat and follow him . But we heard of him afterward under a certain pier , and we went there to look for the rope . We dredged between the piles for three days , and by good luck hooked up the hawser . These men sometimes get their deserts without any of our help . One of them who had stolen a boat-load of pig-iron , ran under Pier 49 to hide . That pier had a shaft and gearing under it for hoisting ice . He hitched his boat , and then climbed up near the shaft ; the gearing caught his clothes , and we found him in pieces scattered over his boat . Wharf-thieves used to be more successful than they are now ; they were organized in regular gangs . But we have broken them up , scattered them , and driven the most of them away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recorded of this under side of the docks . The actors appear first in the city 's brighter haunts of pleasure , or in its miserable dens of want and crime . Then they wander in the streets alone ; and gradually but surely stray to the water . Night is around them , in them . The city behind them sparkles with life . But it can not penetrate their night , nor light their dark passage under these waves to the morgue . We came at last to the slip of the oyster market , picked our way among sloops and lighters , and passed under the crooked pier at the foot of West Tenth street . Here we followed a long , narrow passage between the back of the new sea-wall on the right and rows of spiles on the left . The faint light shone through the forest of spiles and lighted a dismal , slimy cavern , bounded by the green ledges of the wall , the rocky shore full of dens and holes , and the heavy timbers close overhead . Large rats stared at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water and the air were unendurably loathsome . This is known as " Hell 's kitchen . " It may seem incredible that any free man should choose such a place for his abode ; yet where could a criminal find more congenial gloom ? We found a home in Hell 's kitchen , but the host was not visible . A few boards lay across three stringers , and a bed on these was made of a heap of rags and papers from the gutter . A few vials of medicine completed the picture of utter misery with suggestions of sickness and death . When at last I disembarked , I was glad to walk again in the sunshine and feel the presence of honest life and industry on the docks . The docks are a dangerous region for the unwary stranger . Here the most expert of all thieves  --  the confidence-man-meets him as he lands , and commences one of those games so plausible while they are played , so absurd when they are over . Even well-read school-teachers and prominent business men of this very smart city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catch the goose ; and doubtless this is better than for all of us to be either foxes or geese . Besides this cunning class , the docks have many ordinary thieves who depend more on their heels and hands . The wharves are the general market of the city , where every kind of produce is landed and kept until bought and stored in shops or houses . Of course , it is impracticable to guard thoroughly such a long line of merchandise ; and the irregular , nook-and-corner structures along the docks offer abundant shelter for prowlers . There is a man for every place in this world ; so the docks are full of irregular , nook-andcorner men , preying on every kind of produce landed on the wharves . There are little children picking up pieces of coal in their caps and aprons ; women with baskets , loi // tering about the market sheds to pick up potatoes or onions that may roll from a barrel ; men overhauling heaps of rubbish for a stray bit of food ; and a great many loafing about , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the world . Some of these are organized in gangs and accomplish quite important results . The cotton thieves , for example , 7/ operate with much daring and success . A squad of boys , with sheath-knives in their sleeves , steal up to the side of a truck-load of cotton , cut open the bales , pull out armfuls of cotton and escape to their nooks and corners . If they are noticed and molested , a squad of men join , ostensibly , in the charge or pursuit , but to really defeat the capture of the rascals . As I walked along southward I was jostled by a continuous stream of men , of wonderful diversity , of every shade of cleanliness , honesty , industry , and intelligence . In fact , every species seemed to be represented ; some labeled by their ragged coats , and others mislabeled in the same way . At last I came on a crowd of peculiar aspect at the corner of Spring street . It was a hundred or more longshoremen , standing in two parallel lines , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " hopskip-and-jump . " They were ragged and dirty ; they were heavy , lifeless , and even monotonous in various shades of ignorance . They waited for the jumping ; yet when the contestants bounded between them they scarcely moved with interest . But presently a dark man with an important air walked up the pier , and stopped in front of me in the street . His movements were closely watched by the longshoremen ; and when he came to a halt there , they all hurried over to my corner , and forming a line on the curbstone , bent all their attention on this man from the pier . He was a stevedore seeking a few more hands to help unload one of the steamers . He looked gravely and slowly up and down the line , and finally nodded to one of the men , who then left the ranks and walked toward the ship . The rest stood motionless , and kept their eyes fixed on those of the stevedore , while they silently chewed their quids with the vigor of expectation . They seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been selected , the stevedore turned to follow them Iv * SHIP-CHANDLERY. // to the ship . The rest of the crowd broke up into groups of loungers leaning against the wall , and relapsed into their habitual stolidity and inertia . The day was cool , so they kept up a perpetual yet aimless movement of big feet ; still they had not the wit to button their coats . They stood about aimlessly , hopelessly , uncomfortably ; they smoked and kept their hands in their pockets . One after another broke out in a new key of brogue with inane inflections , and then relapsed into empty silence . Altogether they are a very singular class ,  --  apparently without wickedness proportioned to their physical brutality ; without thrift or intelligence ; without purpose , and without any apparent knowledge or hope of better things . A livelier scene was in action on the pier opposite , where the Southern steamers land their cargoes of cotton . Hundreds of hales covered the quay , and men were loading them upon trucks that drove up every few minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I saw two negroes put fourteen of them , or 7,000 pounds , from the ground upon a wagon in nine minutes . It was a treat to watch their sinewy arms and strong backs as they tossed the bales about with apparent ease . West street contracts to its original meanness below Canal street . The general view here is of a narrow street crowded with qwq // A GARBAGE DUMP . trucks and horse-cars moving slowly . The docks for river craft in this vicinity and farther south are a busy place , even at night , in the early summer ; for then large quantities of fruit , and other perishable articles , arrive every day . They must be delivered to the commission merchants and market men before daylight , to be ready for sale in the early morning . Wagons begin to arrive about midnight ; the piers are soon crowded with vehicles , and with men working at the top of their speed in unloading boats and loading wagons . It is a bedlam of boxes , baskets , and barrels , lighted with lanterns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by grocers ; they are at once carted up town , and exposed for sale before breakfast . The railroad freight depots on the docks are also busy centers for man and beast . The front of the low shed is covered with the names of distant cities and states . The approach to it is filled with teams from all parts of the city with all kinds of merchandise in cases and barrels . Within the wide opening are seen piles of boxes ; also little cabins , near the front , with a platform scale on each side , and men signing receipts , marking cases , and calling out weights and addresses . Behind these are lines of men going and coming with truck-loads of freight . They pass to the rear and over a gangplank on to a barge carrying ten freight cars . When the cars are loaded the barge is towed across the river , where they are run on to the railroad and sent to the distant cities and states named on the front of this freight depot . This is one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and receives 20,000 cars a year ; it employs sixty men to handle the freight , and twentyeight clerks for the systematic booking of every package in its r*o , ooo tons of merchandise . In the midst of all this commercial wealth , we meet another side of life at the garbagedump . The pier is built quite high , that the carts may rise above the heap of refuse on the deck of the lighter even at high tide . The space just under the floor of the pier , between the rows of piles , is inclosed with old planks , and divided into several rooms , one for storing bones , one for tin-cans and old metal , one for old boots and shoes , and one for rags . At one dump a room is fitted up for living . The planks are lined with refuse pieces of oil-cloth , then a layer of carpet is spread all around ; more oil-cloth is tacked on , and finally the walls are papered and the floors carpeted with more refuse pieces . The room is warm and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foot above spring tide . But the whole scene is extremely repulsive , although the business is quite profitable . The city hires a trimmer to trim or pile the loads on the lighter . He lets out this work to two or three Italians for one-half of the pickings , and now and then visits his dump , dressed in broadcloth , kids , and diamonds . The Italians sell the bones , metal , rags , and boots to peddlers , and thus make from $12 to $20 per week . The watchman on the pier told me that they live chiefly on the garhage , that they save enough money in a few years to go home as a count and spree it a while , and then return from sunny Italy to claw over the garbage of New York . // A SIDEWALK RESTAURANT . Now and then they allow their wives and sweethearts to come from Baxter street and help pick . Then the garbage pile is covered with a picturesque company of grimy and ragged figures eagerly snatching refuse in a cloud of offal dust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have their social distinctions , too , for the cartmen who collect the refuse consider themselves immeasurably superior to the pickers . And certainly they have , at least , the advantage of an honest and hard-working horse . But I was loitering too long on the many details of this west side of the city , so I pushed on south ward again to Washington Market . It is a q*iaint little village of low sheds , very narrow alleys , and very small blocks ,  --  all on the pier-side of the street . But as I had seen it in its more picturesque aspect of night , I did not enter it now . One of its queerest nooks , however , a sidewalk restaurant on a street corner , attracted me , and I walked , or rather , in one stride stepped , into the midst of it and called for a cup of coffee . The place is five feet wide and twelve long on the ground , though of no exact di-ii mensions on the ceiling . For it is the space under an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boards . It rents at $540 per year . A shelf on each side of the entrance serves as a table where two men can sit on stools . Mine host is a plump , pompous German with the taciturn and important air of a public functionary . Such is the run of custom , and such are the customers , that he keeps his place open night and day . After drinking my coffee , I continued my walk , past more freight depots , more ferries , more shipping , to the end of this western side of the city at the Battery . The Battery is the only oasis of the docks . This little park on the southern point of the island is very welcome after miles of dirty // bustling wharves . The granite sea-wall and is one of the oldest parts of the docks . The the clean walks are such a contrast to the view up the wedge-shape street is quite rickety and disgraceful piers ! One is almost picturesque , with the converging rows of ready to despise the prudence and economy old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work to the Battery-front , window above the pinched and faded fronts . and to one stone pier . I rested a moment in The elevated railroad is a surprise in this this delightful retreat , while the distant roar picture of the past . What amazement it of the city came from behind me through would have caused if it had been dropped the trees , and mingled with the softer splash into the place a hundred years ago ! One of waves . The bay stretches away in front , can imagine the wigs and night-caps thrust SAILORS CHAPEL qwq Carting is one of the most important divisions of wharf life , for horses throng along all the docks to move every day thousands of tons of freight and thousands of people . A characteristic scene is a long line of loaded trucks , waiting at the pier of some one of the Southern stean*-ers . One of these lines began at South street , ran up Maiden Lane to Broadway , and down Fulton to South street again . Part of the line had two trucks abreast , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the total length would have been four-fifths of a mile . Some of the trucks stood in the line twentyfour hours , and some came three times without reaching the ship . Every truck was overloaded by taking the loads of those who could not wait for their turn . The loads of New York teams are amazing . Two horses usually haul fourteen bales of cotton , four hogsheads of tobacco , or twenty-five barrels of flour or sugar . But the market-men take the heaviest loads . One horse commonly draws twenty to twentyfive barrels of apples , but sometimes he takes as many as forty barrels , and often over three tons of oranges or lemons . None of these loads are hauled up steep hills , but the pavements are often defective with holes or hollows , the car-tracks are troublesome , and the footing is slippery ; moreover , the route is never clear , so that frequent stops and starts also make the labor very heavy . Even with the best of feed and care the average service of a horse in this over-work is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I left the cartmen to their day or night of waiting and hurried forward on my walk . In the rear of the Fulton Fish Market I saw a smack unloading with a scoop-net live cod-fish from the well in her hold to a crate or car alongside . This car is a large covered box floating in the water like a raft ; it is about twelve feet square and five deep ; its sides and bottom have cracks for the flow of water in and out , and it will keep alive about 4,000 pounds of black-fish . The slip , half filled with long rows of these cars , can hold 100,000 pounds of live fish . Near by are the vessels from the tropics , unloading oranges , bananas and lemons . And on the dock were eager figures diving into the barrels of damaged fruit for now and then a half-sound orange . There are more busy freight depots along South street , and steamers from the Mediterranean , and others from Maine . There are also canal-boats stowed away here and there - in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family live in the cabin and enjoy a season of metropolitan life . There is also a welcome sign of civilization among all this roughness of the docks  --  the Bethel ship with its cross and its church bell . One hopes that some social pleasures may await the sailor landing - from boisterous seas ; but these miserable boarding-houses and hotels for seamen scarcely encourage the hope . South street has strong naval characteristics . Not only do you find a large fleet of ocean clippers along the dock , but . you meet the sailors themselves. , congregating within sight of their vessels . You very seldom see the typical jolly tar in his sailor 's shirt . They are generally a lot of A SPAR YARD . dull-looking men , unshaven , dressed in patched coats and caps , and devoted to their black pipes . They sometimes pace up and down the sidewalk as if still on their watch ; but oftener loaf about in small // groups and lean against the wall . They wear an uneasy expression in the city , as if out of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sea . North of Market street the surroundings are entirely maritime . The houses are full of ship-chandlery ,  --  great cables , blocks , anchors and wheels ; the signs of sail-lofts flap from upper stories ; boats run their bows out-of-doors ; spar-yards are full of men hewing great timbers ; and shipsmith shops glow with forges and echo with blows on the anvil . Here and there a window is full of quadrants , compasses , chronometers and other navigating instruments . On the waterside are the dry-docks where some large ocean steamers were being repaired by gangs of men . The great hulls looked imposing with their high masses contrasted with such mites as men . I found also a figure-head carver making a woman for a new vessel . I had always been interested in the wooden sex . This man is their creator . He marks a center line on each side of the square block from which the figure is to be made ; then he sketches the profile outline on two sides of the block and hews down to those lines . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cuts the block down . Afterward the corners are reduced to that plump roundness so characteristic of the figure-head . From four to six days suffice for making the average specimen . Just r*ow the Indian is the prevailing fashion in this race . The last great rush of life along the docks is the afternoon crowd at the ferries . So I returned to the more populous part of the docks to see the close of the day . Not to be too alliterative , I call Fulton Ferry a funnel for folks . They converge at the wicket from all directions , and slip in out of sight as if engulfed in oblivion . The squalor of South street is thus crossed by sparkling streams of wealth and fashion , flowing down from the heights of the city . As the people come in close columns , you see a panorama of hats and chins ; as they pass , hats and noses , and as they crowd about the ferry entrance , hats and back hair . They are a crowd devoted to bundles , for every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman carries a great bundle of tailorwork ; and an elderly man , rather excited by his own hurry and the bustle of the street , comes on a run , while a turkey 's long neck hangs out of his basket and whips about his legs . There go two youths with guns on their shoulders and glowing anticipations on their faces . In fact , the air seems loaded with sighs , and songs , and flitting visions of human lives . But the street is as crowded as the sidewalk . From curb to curb , and as far as you can see , it is full of wagons as closely packed as the pieces of a puzzle . It is a long line of piles of merchandise ; a driver is perched on every pile , and a team is before it . There are loads of oranges , boxes of tea , four-bushel bags of pea-nuts , cases of silk and Indian shawls , a steam-boiler , and coops of geese that stick up their heads and look concerned . Indeed , parts of every quarter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ docks . The wagons are emblazoned with the modern heraldry of commerce-signs and trade-marks . There is the great four-horse truck strong and plain . There is the jaunty butcher 's cart with the sleek , saucy butcher ; there is the brewer 's wagon with its fat horses ; and there is the elegant carriage moving with a low , * soft murmur like the rustle of silk . It is the great army of commerce moving slowly along with the roar of wheels and the sharp click of hoofs . But now they halt by their own crowding . Not a figure moves where just now all were in ceaseless , eager activity . The street becomes as quiet as a country road . But here and there a driver hails his fellow in gruff tones , jeering the stupid teamster who blocked the lines of march . So they all stand still in a hopeless blockade . But presently one wagon moves a few feet ; the next drives up behind , and then the next , and the short motion runs along the whole line like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all stop again and the puzzle is a new one through fresh entanglements . Meantime a policeman walks here and there among the wagons and teams , and tries to keep all in moving order . But here is the key-wagon of the jam . It is loaded with over seven thousand pounds of lemons ; and the horse is stalled with his enormous load . The right fore-wheel is in a slight hollow in the pavement . The horse turns to the left to twist it out of the hollow ; he leans to the task , strains every cord in his strong limbs , and almost gets the load in motion . But he finally slips on the treacherous pavement , the fire flies from his shoes , and after a courageous struggle the poor animal falls . Then the policeman and the driver loosen the harness that holds him like a net ; they lift his head , speak to him ; he kicks and scrapes on the smooth stones , and finally regains his feet . When all is ready // again two or three men put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the nervous energy of a fine nature , and at last the key-wagon is drawn out of the blockade . At the first movement every horse awakes and waits . The drivers gather up the reins , and steady their teams . The horses arch their necks , cautiously plant their feet as if on ice , and crouch to the hard , steady pull . The army moves again all along the line ; and the roar breaks out afresh . In the general uproar you distinguish the separate noises near by ,  --  the chuckle of heavy wheels on the axle , the sharp click of horses ' feet , the rattle of light carts , the tinkle of streetcar bells . Humanity also roars ; and you hear , besides the low tramp of feet on the pavement , the constant babble of voices ,  - -  the scream of the newsboy , the whistle , the whining speech of peddlers or beggars , the loud gruff shout , and the more melodious fragments of passing conversation . The scene is crammed with eager struggling men and horses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toil . But under this combat are also the softer strains of human joy and sorrow . Twilight lent the docks the poetry of mystery and color . The sun , setting in a crimson sky , touched the bay , the shipping and the brick house-tops with a ruddy light . The scene was almost Oriental in richness . Then as the shadows of night fell the lights of the city made another view . The piers were still more obscure , the shippingwas more gloomy with massive black hulls and overhanging rigging , and the water shone with the blackness of night . The houses were lighted here and there , but scarcely offered any cheer . A few straggling teams passed with their last loads . After that the occasional rumble of cars , and the tinkling of bells were the only sounds along the street . Here and there a ferry-boat whistled , and then the splashing of her wheels sounded from the slip , but soon died away over the waves . Now and then a suspicious figure skulked along the docks ; a watchman yawned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a groggery , and fainter echoes from the heart of the town floated down a street . But out on the piers the silence of night reigned above the eddying tide and enveloped the city for a short repose . @
