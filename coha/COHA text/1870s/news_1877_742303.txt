txt The flurry into which the " street " was thrown several days ago by the suspension of ROBINSON &; CO. is so curious an illustration of speculative methods that it is worthy of comment . The firm had been pushing through the day the usual business of directing a bank to " pay to the order of ' , " when at about 3 o'clock the bank became nervous , and declined further certification . Then followed certain incidents in the nature of comedy ; a raging crowd of checkholders rushed first to the bank , which kept open twenty minutes to allow a deposit to be Made , but could not toll the state of the account without going through several pages , although a balance of at least $20,000 on the books was admitted ; thence the crowd rushed to the firm 's office , only to find the senior partner absent and the junior ignorant of the total of the checks drawn , the assets on hand , or the liabilities outstanding , and in a state of disgust , but willing to let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gentlemen commenced , counted up the stubs in the check-book , found in the safe ** of securities that nobody know were there , pocketed them by the person of a volunteer chairman , and concluded that the balance was on the right side after all , and the only trouble lay in the bewilderment of the book-keeper , who had lost his head in the " rushing business " done during the day . Thereupon everybody drew a sigh of relief and felt better . A similar , but more serious case recurs to mind , which still moro sharply illustrates the methods of the street . At noon on Saturday , Sept. 20 , 1873 , only three days after the panic began , a certain broker Was informed by a number of his customers that the bank on which he had that morning drawn checks was reported in trouble , that its President was flying about in the attempt to borrow $200,000 , and that they wished to return the checks they had received and had got certified an hour or two before . The broker was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return the stocks for which ho had drawn the checks , and ' the holders departed , notifying him that if the bank failed to effect its clearances on Monday morning , they should hold him responsible , and the startled broker , being informed by his counsel that they could do so , felt himself in trouble . The case between him and his bank ? the latter , by the way , then having a special reputation as a " broker 's bank " ? was this : Beginning the day with a balance of $ ( 30,000 , he deposited early $121,000 , drew $356,000 of checks during the forenoon , all of them promptly presented and certified ; the overdraft of $172,000 thus produced he was , of course , expected by the bank to make good in some way before 3 o'clock , and was bound in honor to do so . Fearful , however , that the bank would go under in any case , he deposited the amount of the overdraft , not with the bank , but with the Chairman of a clearing-house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instructed , in case the bank pulled through on Monday to hand over the money , and in case the bank went under , the money was to be paid out to satisfy the holders of the $356,000 of certified checks , as far as it would go . The bank did pull through , and the affair was arranged . It is plain that the broker 's action imposed on the bank the hardship of providing for a loan of . $172,000 which it neitherexpected nor agreed to practically make , and it would seem that the dealer took the risk of the bank 's solvency , and after having procured an overdraft , upon an explicit understanding , was bound to make that good , regardless of consequences ; on the other hand , he had his creditors to care for , and might claim that the prospect of the batik 's failure released him from obligation to knowingly take the risk of losing the ability to protect his chocks . His action was approvedbv the Stock Exchange , and the question of casuistry it is unnecessary to discuss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is conventionally supposed to take no risks , to require two names for its discounts , to receive the collateral before making loans , and to allow overdrafts sparingly and iu exceptional cases . Yet the " broker 's business " did  --  perhaps still does  --  largely consist of drawing immediately against deposits , and . of certifying checks through the day , upon the understanding that other certified checks shall be deposited to make good the account before 3 o'clock ; in this way , brokers whose capital was not large , and whose average balance perhaps did not exceed $20,000 , were enabled , by having the credit of a bank extended to them , in a manner which a merchant would not consider possible for himself , to do a business of $100,000 or more a day . Such an abuse of certification is expressly forbidden to national banks by the law . How much profit is in it the banks which practice it best know ; but , although the instances of failure ou the part of the banks to Coma up to their obligations are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kiting " is great . How far the practice continues wo can not say . The recent occurrence , if correctly reported , indicates , ou the part of the bank , nothing more blameworthy than au uncertainty about the account , although some persons charged favoritism in the certification ; but that very confusion is a natural result of a headlong method . of doing business . And is not certification , when practiced to such an habitual extent , itself evidence that there is more " kiting " than substantiality in the business in which it arises I The firm of ROBrNSON &; Co. was a driving Quo , often doing , it is said , r , third of the entire business of the Stock Exchange . and the immediate copsequenco of the contretemps was a further rush to cover contracts , and a " booming " of the speculative list thereunder . A little puff of cold wind  --  a little accident of somebody losing his head  --  and the illusion was suddenly dispelled , so that everybody sa . upon how narrow a margin of fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prove useful as showing in its slenderness the bear movement which has been attacking one stock after another , and frightening timid holders who are not speculative into throwing their property at the heads of the crowd ; it might prove particularly and . permanently useful , if the public would only take to heart and memory the lesson read by this glimpse behind the curtain of painted solidity and respectability which veils the Stock Exchange . Nobody is foolish enough to imagine that the momentary fluctuations of eighths and quarters in what is known as the speculative list represent any change in the " value " of the properties , and why should one who has bought a security outright and paid for it , because he thought it worth buying at the price , disturb his own security because the quoted price bobs np and down like a float on the water ? To him who has sold what he does not own , or has bought what ho has not paid for and can not pay for , the case is different ; but to one who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shuffle of cards are matters of indifference . It would be well if it wore possible to have a public market for determining a standard of financial values , separated really and evidently from speculative gambling ; but as this does not exist in fact , the permanent moral is that the outside public should stay outside , except when they go into the street for the purpose of actually buying or selling out and out . But probably the public will not hoed it , and the moth will continuo to seek the candle .
