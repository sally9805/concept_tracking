txt The crop of ridiculous rumors and misrepresentations which has followed the recent action of the Board of Apportionment , and the somewhat serious complications which promise to attend that action , render necessary a plain statement of the facts of the case . The amount of the tax levy , as fixed by the estimates of last Fall , was $37,138,945 , being equal to a rate of about 3.40 per cent . on the valuations of 1873 . Certain acts were passed by the last Legislature , chiefly at the solicitation of the Controller , under which the Board of Apportionment were authorized to make considerable reductions on the estimates already agreed to , and were enabled to use their discretion in diminishing the appropriations of the several departments for the last half of the year . After the board had wasted a good deal of time in purposeless wrangling , the Controller submitted a detailed budget amounting to $32 , - 136,150 . On the valuations of 1873 this would have been equivalent to a rate of about 2.93 per cent. ; on those of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than 2.77 per cent . The reduction thus proposed amounted to $5,002,795 on the estimates of November . As amended by Messrs . VANCE and WIIEELER , and finally accepted under protest by the two other members of the board , this budget was made to show a further reduction et $179,000 , and to fix the rate of taxation for the year at 2.76 per cent . on the valuations of 1874 . This reduction of about three-fourths of a cent per $100 on the year 's taxes was effected as follows : The Controller 's budget provided , with the consent of the heads of the department , for a reduction of $115,098 in the estimates for charities and correction ; in addition to this Messrs . VANCE and WHEELER insisted on a further reduction of $102,242 . Of the latter amount , $3,327 were deducted from salaries and $98,915 were deducted from the item for repairs , supplies , and the support of the out-door poor . The amended budget made a reduction on the estimates of the Department of Parks of $60,000 ; it disallowed the Controllers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in November by the Department of Public Works , and it added $75,000 to the amount allotted by the Controller 's budget to that department . The amended budget made a further reduction of $30,000 from the item of salaries in the Finance Department ; it added $2,500 to the already exorbitant estimate for salaries . of the employes of the City Record ; it increased the allowance to the clerical staff of the Board of Aldermen by $5,500 , and it disallowed the provision inserted for meeting the expenses of annexation . The difference between the two budgets , though exceedingly small in the aggregate , seems to be sufficient to create great confusion and to cause serious embarrassment in the departments singled out for attack . This is specially so in the Park Department , where the wholly capricious reduction has been accompanied by a provision which , unless repealed , will lead to expensive litigation . This is to the effect that the entire salaries of President , clerks , and other employes of the board , other than foremen of laborers , shall be paid wholly out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is raised by tax . This is equivalent to making a law setting aside the legislative provision directing that these officers and employes should be paid partly out of the proceeds of bonds issued to pay for the public improvements which they are engaged in making . The reduction made in this department is equivalent to a reduction on the year 's estimates of $120,000 ; and accompanied as it is by a rule shifting a large portion of expenses on current revenues , it is equivalent to a still greater decrease of the wages fund of the department . The immediate consequence will be a large reduction in the necessary working force of the parks , and its ultimate effect , according to the testimony of Mr. STEBBINS , will be " confusion and embarrassment , equally unfavorable to economy and . efficiency ' The Commissioners of Charities have announced that , in consequence of the fresh reduction made on their estimates , they will be obliged to close some of the hospitals or institutions under their care . On behalf of the Department of Finance it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practiced by the present Controller , and under the statutes which have been passed of late years in regard to this department , its work has increased at least threefold . Serious detriment to the efficiency of the department will , it is said , result from the large decrease of working force which the reductions of the amended budget render necessary . The striking out of the appropriation for annexation expenses can hardly fail to result in a series of vexatious suits against the City , and the sacrifice of property for the saving of which an earnest appeal has already been made by the Board of Education . The proposal of the authors of the amended budget to insert , in spite of the Consolidation act , an appropriation of $30,000 for salaries to the Aldermen when acting as Supervisors , was fortunately defeated , as also the addition to the appropriation for that fertile source of corruption and extravagance , the rents and repairs of armories . Altogether , the economies of the amended budget smack strongly of those made by the Ring Board . of Apportionment in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retrenchment , and ended in the creation of a large ' deficit which had to be provided for by the issue of bonds .
