441 A MODERN FINANCIAL UTOPIA : HOW IT GREW UP , AND WHAT BECAME OF IT . THERE is one great , plain , practical fact in respect to irredeemable paper money , which in itself is a sufficient answer to all the arguments that may be advanced in its favor . And that is , that there can not be one single instance referred to in the history of any state , nation , or people , in which its adoption and use has not been wholly disastrous . The more conspicuous examples and illustrations which prove this assertion - namely , the John Law scheme of 1 716-1720 , the currency of the American colonies before the revolution , the Continental money , the French assignats ; and later and in this century , the paper money experience of Austria , Russia , Italy , Spain , Turkey , and the South American states - are all more or less familiar ; but there is another example , little known , and rarely if ever referred to , which , occurring within a comparatively recent period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion of many render the United States an exception to all the rest of the world , is no less interesting , and instructive . We refer to the fiscal experience of the Republic of Texas , which , during the brief period of its existence as an independent nation , committed on a small scale nearly all the financial blunders , and tried nearly all the financial experiments , which the greater nations of Europe have before and since committed and tried on a large scale , and , as might naturally have been expected , with an almost exact parallelism of results . The details of this curious history were first collected by the late William M. Gouge of Philadelphia , - an American writer on finance whose reputation was never commensurate with his worth and abilities , - who visited Texas after its annexation for the purpose of specially studying up this subject ; and whose work , published near a quarter of a century ago , and now a rare volume , constitutes the source from which has been derived the following information . Previous to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Republic of Mexico ; and its currency consisted of gold and silver , and , to a very limited extent , of the notes of the banks of the United States . As the civilized population was small , no large ' amount of currency of any kind was required , but as compared with other newly settled countries , money was reported " to have been plenty . " A great part of the Texan currency consisted of what were termed " hammered dollars , " or old Spanish dollars from which the royal effigy had been effaced by the Mexicans as a testimony of disrespect for their former rulers . Time contracts were however made in new Mexican dollars , which were termed " eagle money , " and circulated at one hundred cents to the dollar ; while the " hammered dollar , " though containin0 fully as much pure silver , circulated at only ninety cents ; the probable reason for the current de-* preciation of the latter being , that the destruction of their certificate of value effected by defacing the stamp , also prevented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expprtation . After the commencement of the revolution , and the inauguration of a provisional government , in November , 1835 , hammered money gradually disappeared from circulation , and bank-notes from the States came in more freely and constituted the chief currency . In 1837 , however , the banks of the United States suspended specie payments , and while all of the circulating medium of Texas became greatly depreciated , a very considerable portion derived from the banks of the State of Mississippi became altogether worthless . " Thereby , " says the // historian above referred to , " many of the people of Texas suffered severely , but their aggregate losses did not equal their aggregate gains , as many of these notes had been obtained in loans and many of these loans were not repaid . " From the very first the Texans do not appear to have ever allowed themselves to be embarrassed by the idea of OldWorld bankers , political economists , and doctrinaires that the circulating medium of a country should be based upon the precious metals . They were wiser than all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valuable than gold and *ilver , - the element and souece of all wealth , - namely , an almost unlimited quantity of cheap , fertile land . This was the true thing , in their opinion , to bank on , and bank on it they did . The first bank chartered , nearly six months before the commencement of hostilities , was the " Commercial and Agricultural Bank " of the department of Brazos . Its capital was not to exceed one million of dollars , divided into shares of one hundred dollars each . It was authorized to establish branches anywhere and everywhere ; receive eight per cent . per annum on loans not exceeding six months , and ten per cent . on loans exceeding that time ; and only the capital of the bank was to be responsible for the notes it issued . But the subscribers were required " to adequately secure the value of their shares with real estate in the republic . " In short it was a most liberal charter , and the only thing any way illiberal about it was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars , at least , have entered the vaults of the bank , it may commence operations . " " Dollars , " however , at that time , in Texas , says our historian , " meant just whatever the people meant to make it mean . " William M. Strong , of Pennsylvania , Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States , had not then taken his seat on the bench ; but the Texans in 1835 knew as well as Judge Strong did , when he gave the legal tender decision in 1871 , that " value was an ideal thing ; " that " it is hardly correct to speak of a standard of value ; " 1 that " the gold and silver thing we call a dollar is , in no sense , a standard of a dollar ; " 1 in fact , that anything is a dollar which the law-making powers may imagine it to be , and that it is not at all necessary that their " imagining " for one year should be the same as their " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the Bank of Agriculture and Commerce appears to have commenced operations , and as there is no evidence that the one hundred thousand dollars was ever paid in , we are warranted in supposing that the " ideal " took in every respect the place of the real . That the Congress of Texas had also faith to a large extent in the ideal standard of value is made evident by the fact that , by an act passcd in December , 1836 , the secretary of the treasury was authorized and empowered " to negotiate a loan from any bank or banks that may be established in this republic , of sufficient amount for the payment of all just claims " held by certain creditors against the government ; and lest the Bank of Agriculture and Commerce , with its capital of one million of " ideal " dollars , and the value of its shares made good by the pledge of real estate , should not be able to afford sufficient banking facilities to a population not exceeding fifty thousand , including the " State , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1836 incorporated in addition . The capital of this company was fixed at five millions , to be increased if desired to ten millions , with the right of connecting the waters of the Rio Grande and the Sabine by means of internal navigation , and the privilege of making branch canals and branch roads in every direction ; and this too at a time when the Republic of Texas had not the means of supporting a navy sufficient to protect its coasts from the attacks of one small sloop of war belonging to the Mexicans . The five millions of stock were immediately subscribed by eight 1 Decisions Supreme Court of the United States , 1871. // individuals and firms ; but the operations of the banking company were exceedingly limited , and are thus reported : None of the subscribers paid in anything . One sold his interest , however , to a firm in New York , and took his pay in store-goods . A second sold his for ten thousand dollars ; while a third swapped his for three leagues of land , which he subsequently sold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The rest of the subscribers retain their original stock to this day . " Other projects of a like character were brought forward ; namely : " A Joint Stock Company for the erection of a Hotel and Bath House at Velasco , with Banking Privileges ; " " The Texas Internal Improvement and Banking Company ; " " The Red River and Aransaso Bay , Navigation , Railroad , and Banking Company ; " and finally , for establishing a bank on the faith of the government . All these projects were favorably received ; but before the necessary laws could be passed , to put them in operation , news was received of the general failure of the banks of the United States ( 1837 ) , and the republic was deprived of its prospective capital , enterprise , and consequent development . To supply the necessities of a circulatimr medium occasioned by the discredit of bank-notes issued in the United States , individuals and municipalities commenced in 1837 to issue " shinplasters , " or notes for the fractional parts of a dollar , and continued to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them by the bankruptcy of the issuers . It is now desirable to turn back and consider more directly the means by which Texas provided funds to carry on the war . At the outset the new republic had , apart from the pledge or sale of its lands , but few financial resources . A financial report made to the provisional government or council in November , 1835 , brought out the fact , that although an army was in the field , engaged in active operations , yet " our finances , arising from the receipt of dues for lands , as will appear on file in Mr. Gail Borden 's report , which were in his hands , are fifty-eight dollars and thirty cents . This money has been exhausted , and also an advance by the president of the council of thirty-six dollars . There were also several hundred dollars in the hands of the alcalde of Austin . Upon this money several advances have been made ; as such you may consider that at the present moment the council is out of funds . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things . The men who had undertaken to make of Texas a free and independent republic were , in respect to audacity , enterprise , and self-reliance , typical emigrants from the great American nation , and having put their hands to the plow had no intention of stopping half-way in the furrow . But to succeed in their undertaking " ways and means " were indispensable ; " and findin0 , " says Mr. Gouge , " that other nations in their periods of exigency had resorted to taxing , borrowing , begging , selling , robbing , and cheating , they determined to try all six , " and he might have added , they in all six succeeded . The first feasible and ready way of collecting a revenue through taxation , that suggested itself , was by duties on imports , and the Texan legislators accordingly took to the tariff after the most approved American fashion ; enacting a given rate of duties on the 12th of December , revising the same on the 1 sth , and making a new tariff on the 27th . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it had no less than seven distinct tariffs . Export duties on cotton were also recommended . The chief reliance of the government was , however , upon loans , and commissioners were early appointed toborrow one million of dollars at a rate not exceeding ten per cent. , on bonds running for not less than five or more than ten years ; the commissioners being authorizmi to pledge the public faith , the public lands , the public revenues , and in short everything that Texas possessed in the way of security , for their repayment . The idea that " a national debt was a national blessing " was one for which it has been generally supposed an agent 1874. 443 // of Jay Cooke &amp; Co. , employed to writeup the 5-20 bonds , in 1863 , was entitled to a patent for originality ; but the records of the Qon*ress of Texas show that the unexpatriated Yankee was after all but a poor though probably unconscious imitator , and that his conceptions of the felicity of owing some body nationally never began to rise to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who , as chairman of the national committee on finance , submitted to the first Congress on the 16th of December , 1835 , a report , of which the following is an extract : - " At present our indebtedness is small , and our liabilities almost entirely to private individuals , whose claims , your committee are of opinion , may properly be merged and canceled by the creation of substantial loans . An outstanding national debt may in many respects be looked upon as beneficial , by a community isolated and dependent as Texas , if the creditors , as such , can afford us substantial patronage . And until we can stand immutable among the nations of the earth , your committee would advise that the pecuniary interests of our creditors will excite for us the sympathy and protection of mankind . " In one sense Mr. Chenoweth 's " advice** proved correct , though not altogether in the manner he anticipated ; for the various debt certificates of Texas being largely disposed of in the United States , an earnest sympathy for the republic was thereby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was most powerful in securing the annexation of Texas to the United States , and subsequently an appropriation from Congress of the sum of $10,000,000 , with the understanding that the same should be used in the payment of the debts of the republic . Under the head of * selling , ' ' as an expedient for providing ways and means , the public lands were offered by the government of Texas at low prices and in any quantity ; but as the cash value of the article was small , - the price fixed by the Mexican government before the war being less than four cents per acre , - and as , furthermore , until after independence was fully established it was a question whether the vendor could pass an adequate and sufficient title , the receipts from this source were inconsiderable . Under the head of " begging , " the foreign agents of the republic were authorized to receive money or donations of any kind that might be given by citizens of any country they might visit ; and that the hat thus passed round did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 30th of November , 1835 , formal resolutions of thanks were passed by the council to John Hutchins of Natchez , Mississippi , for his liberal donation of one hundred dollars " for the use of Texas in her strug0le for liberty . " Under the head of " robbing , " the council , on the 17th of January , 1836 , enacted , that whereas it was impossible for the troops at Bexar " to drive beeves and procure provisions for their use without horses ; Therefore be it resolved , that the commandant be authorized to employ as many Mexicans , or other citizens , for the purpose of driving up beeves , and procuring provisions , as may be required for that purpose . " Letters of marque and reprisal were also early authorized and issued : but in this department of robbery the Texans could plead the precedents of the bestestablished and most Christian governments . Under the head of " cheating , " Mr. Gouge groups the several acts and proceedin0s of the republic in respect to the manufacture and issue of paper money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the election of a treasurer could establish it , in November , 1835 . Previous to this there had been a fiscal committee , and this had made a report , which , as the first official financial document of a defacto government , destined in the course of the following year to come into possession and control of a territory larger than France , deserves to be handed down to posterity . The report related to a matter of extortion and swindling on the 444 April , // part of certain contractors , and alleged , that one Thomas Bray , for furnishing " Cole 's company of wagoners with one hundred and seven pounds of bread , had charged twenty-five cents per pound , or twenty-six dollars and seventy-five cents , whereas he should have charged but fourteen cents per pound ; and that one Madison M. Stevens had charged an extortionate sum for * carrying one express to Nacogdoches . " It was accordingly recommended that Bray be allowed but fifteen dollars and seventyeight cents , and Stevens but ten dollars and fifty cents in full of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the table . A month afterwards , by some skill of manipulation not unwor*thy in these later days of a Chorpenning and his counsel , Hon. John Cessna , the committee made anotber report , in which it was recommended that Messrs . Bray and Stevens be paid in full , - and paid in full they probably were . How good a field there would have been for Chorpenning and Cessna to have operated in is illustrated by the following extract from a message which the first governor , Henry Smith , about this same time sent in to the " Honorable President and Members of the General Council . " He says : - " Instead of acting as becomes the counselors and guardians of a free people , you resolve yourselves into low , intriguing , caucusing parties ; pass resolutions without a quorum , predicated on false premises ; and if you could only deceive me enough , you would join with it a piratical codperation . You have acted in bad faith , and seem determined by your acts to destroy the very constitution you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placed on the political watch-tower , and I hope I will be able to prove a faithful sentinel . You have also been posted as sentinels ; but you have permitted the enemy to cross the lines , and you are ready to sacrifice your country at the shrine of plunder . Mr. President , I speak collectively , as you all form one whole , though at the same time I do not mean all . I know you have honest men there ; but you A ililiodern Financial Utopia. 445 have Judas in the camp , - men who , if possible , would deceive their God . " Notwithstanding their deep-laid plans and intrigues , I have not been asleep . They will find themselves circumvented in every tack . I am now tired of watching scoundrels abroad and scoundrels at home , and as such I am now prepared to drop the curtain . " Look around upon your flock ; your discernment will easily detect the scoundrels ; the complaint , contraction of the eyes ; the gape of the mouth ; the vacant stare ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sneaking , sycophantic look ; a natural meanness of countenance ; an unguarded shrug of the shoulders ; a sympathetic tickling and contraction of the muscles of the neck , anticipating a rope ; a restless uneasiness to adjourn , dreading to face the storm themselves have raised . Let the honest and indignant part of your council drive the wolves out of the fold . Some of them have been thrown out of folds equally sacred , and should be denied the society of civilized men . " But , thanks be to my God , there is balm in Texas , and a physician near. ** And the governor then , in the capacity of a physician , proceeded to administer the balm by ordering the council to be forthwith prorogued , " unless your body will make the necessary acknowledgment of your error , and forthwith " ( before twelve o'clock to-morrow ) " proceed " ( by issuing a circular and furnishing expresses ) , " to give it circulation and publicity , in a manner calculated to counteract its baleful effects . " But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the balm . They referred the governor 's message to a committee , who forthwith reported , " That they are unable to express any other views than indignation at language so repulsive to every moral feeling of an honorable man , and astonishment that this community should have been so miserably deceived in selecting , for the high office of governor , a man whose language and conduct proves his early habits of association to have been vulgar and depraved . " The report coneluded // with resolutions that they would sustain the dignity of the government , and that Henry Smith be ordered forthwith to cease the functions of his office . The next day they issued an address to the people , in which they repelled the charges brought against them in " that impudential document , " and brought counter-charges against his excellency himself . A single paragraph is given by Mr. Gou0e to show the character of this address " All these acts of stubbornness and perverseness were not sufficient to gratify his thirst for sole dominion . His dignity was insulted at the idea of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his acts and cheek his usurpation . He became more and more restless , until , enraged at the presumption of the council , in the exercise of a constitutional right , he i*nites ; his fury , in a blaze , consumes his prudence ( what he had ) ; he orders the council to disperse , shuts the door of communication between the two departments , and proclaims himself the government . " At this rejoinder and counter-attack Governor Smith seems to have been considerably astonished ; and sought to reconcile matters with the council by sending the next day a message , in which , after confessing that he had used " much asperity of language , " he concludes as follows : - " Believing the rules of Christian charity require us to bear and forbear , and as far as possible overlook the errors and foibles of each other , in this case I may not have exercised towards your body that degree of forbearance which was probably your due . If so , I have been laboring under error , and as such , hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the two branches again harmonize to the promotion of the true interests of the country . " But it was of no use ; Governor Smith 's " Christian charity " was exercised too late . The council deposed him so far as they could , and for the remainder of the session , LieutenantGovernor Robinson " reigned in his stead . " The formal establishment of a national treasury was one thing ; the filling it with money was quite another and different thing , . And as sufficient funds for defraying the expenses of the government and the army did not come from any of the expedients of taxation , loans , the establishment of companies with banking privileges , the sale of lands , begging , or seizing private property by land and sea , the republic next undertook to pay its way by drawino* drafts on itself . To give these drafts credit and circulation an act was passed , December , 1836 , " That it shall be the duty of the several collectors ( of custoins ) to receive the orders of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ importers in payment of duties at the time of importation ; " and in June following , it was enacted , " That properly audited drafts on the treasury of the republic shall be received in payment of taxes imposed , except on billiard tables , retailers of liquors , and nine-pin alleys , or games of that kind . " By these two acts , Texas gave her audited drafts a greater value than they would otherwise have possessed , and caused them to pass into hands that otherwise would not have received them . From first to last , the issue of these audited drafts amounted to about eight millions of dollars ( $7,834,207 ) . They do not appear to have ever to any extent answered the purpose of currency ; and the circumstance that they were issued for odd numbers of dollars and cents , and when passed from hand to hand required a calculation , doubtless contributed to prevent such a result . They gradually depreciated in value , and in December , 1837 , one year after the passa0e of the act authorizing their reception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state would no longer receive such drafts in payment of debts due to itself . The greatest and best stroke of financial policy on the part of the new republic was , however , reserved to the last ; and in November , 1837 , when borrowing , begging , selling land scrip , and issuing audited drafts had been // exhausted as expedients for raising money , the government commenced the issue of treasury notes . These notes were in the form of bank-notes , and by law were required to be printed " in neat form . " They were also for round or even sums , and mainly for small amounts , and specified on their face " that they will be received in payment for lands and other public dues , or be redeemed with any moneys in the treasury not otherwise appropriated . " And here commences by far the most valuable of all the lessons deducible from the study of the fiscal experience of the Republic of Texas , - a lesson , moreover , exceptionally interesting , from the circumstance that we find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect of a system of irredeemable paper money is one and the same , whether the field of its influence be a rich , densely populated old country like Austria or Great Britain , or a disturbed , thinly populated community , with little accumulated capital , and occupying , as it were , the very border line between barbarism and civilization . The first noticeable and most interesting fact connected with the history of these Texan treasury notes is , that although the credit of Texas at the time of their issue was so bad that a foreign loan could not be negotiated , and the audited drafts on the treasury had so far depreciated as to have but a nominal value , and that of less thanfifteen cents on the dollar , yet the notes themselves , though practically unredeemable , were when first issued at par , or nearly par , with specie , and furthermore were kept so for months , or until their issue exceeded in amount half a million of dollars . The explanation of this curious phenomenon is , that the people of Texas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notes , had practically no circulating medium for effecting exchanges , or none that was really worthy of the name ; and although a community can get along in its business without a currency , as it can without horses and carts , ships and steam-engines , - all 447 alike instrumentalities for effecting the interchange of commodities , - there is no community that will dispense with any of these agencies if it can help it . With the outbreak of the revolution the hammered money and the eagle money , as already stated , soon disappeared . With the failure of the banks of the United States in 1837 , the notes of the banking institutions of the southwestern States , which had come in like a flood and had supplied to Texas the void occasioned by the disappearance of its specie circulation , became worthless while the issue of shin-plasters or fractional notes of persons and firms , although continued , was by law forbidden . The want of some medium that should have one value , and would retulate prices and facilitate exchanges , was therefore much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best medium they could , threw around it all the guarantees that it was in their power to supply , and issued no more of the " medium " than was necessary to meet a specific want , the people in turn accorded to the medium a value proportional to the work it performed , or the necessity it supplied . The first issue of notes , in addition to a pledge of government faith to receive them in payment of all public dues and to redeem them as soon as there was anything to redeem them with , carried also a promise of ten per cent . interest ; a rate easily calculated , and which offered an inducement for hoarding the notes , to such Texans as could afford it and had also faith in their ultimate payment . The whole revenue from customs was also devoted to sustaining the credit of these treasury notes , and about this time the laws for raising a revenue from imports began to be effective ; the gross revenue accruing from the customs for the quarter ending September 30 , 1837 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , moreover , exceedingly wise in their day and generation in another matter . The original treasury notes , although intended to serve as currency , were nevertheless , from the fact that they carried ten per cent . inA Modern Financial Utopia. // terest , in reality a species of national bond ; " and being issued in round sums of small amounts , as low even as one dollar , they were taken up as investments , or speculated in by persons of very small means , who never regarded themselves in any sense as capitalists . Very considerable sums thus found their way into the United States and were permanently held there , and even the negroes of New Orleans were enabled to enjoy the luxury of speculating in foreign securities . It is also curious to recall that at the time of the formation of the syndicate in 1870-1871 , for the purpose of funding the national debt of the United States at a lower rate of interest than six per cent. , this very same plan that worked so suecessfislly in Texas in 1837 was brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ingenuity and ability , by the then head of the European banking firm of Bowles Brothers , as a condition precedent and essential to placing permanently a large amount of Federal securities among the masses in Europe , at a very low rate of interest . According to Mr. Gouge , Texas treasury notes continued to be at par , or nearly at par , with specie , until their amount exceeded half a million of dollars . If we take the population of Texas at that time as about forty thousand , and suppose that one fifth of the entire issue of half a million was hoarded , or floated off into the United States , then the result affords a very striking and curious confirmation of the theory held by many of the best informed bankers and economists , that an average of about ten dollars per capita is the utmost limit of paper money that a community can permanently float , and at th&amp;same time keep on a level or par with specie . ' It is also a fact in regard to the Continental money , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thirty millions , or at the rate of about ten dollars per capita , or up to January , 1778 , its maximum depreciation 1 The theory is that if the notes are redeemable in specie on demand and more than ten dollars per capita is issued , the excess will he presented for redemption and he thus voluntarily retired . if the was not in excess of five per cent. , as compared with specie . But all history shows that when a nation has once embarked in a scheme of irredeemable paper money , it is extremely difficult , if not wholly impossible , to resist the current and drift of its influence ; and the experience of Texas constitutes no exception to this general rule . The five hundred thousand paper treasury dollars had done good service ; they had doubtless been printed in a " neat form** as the law provided ; had proved attractive to the masses , and had relieved the most urgent financial necessities of the republic . Why should not the people of Texas have more of so good a thing ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determined to have more ; and in the spring of 1838 , a bill , bearing the familiar title of " An Act to define and limit the issue of promissory notes , " was reported in the House of Representatives , which authorized an additional issue of one hundred and fifty thousand dollars . The Senate , however , increased the existing amount to one million , and as thus amended , the bill passed both houses by large majorities . Sturdy and honest Sam Houston was then President , and when the bill came up for his signature , he promptly vetoed it , and gave his reasons therefor in a message , so full of common-sense and sound principles that there is nothing which the people of the United States could to-day read with greater profit and instruction . Indeed , it would almost seem as if he had before him , at the time of writing , the present condition of the United States , rather than that of his own people . He says , " When the ( treasury note ) currency was projected , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Na-. tional existence and freedom had been achieved , but the struggle had left us destitute and naked . There were no banks ! There was no money ! Our notes are not redeemable on presentation , the moment the line of excess is passed , that same moment indicates the commencement of permanent depreciation . // lands could not be sold , and the public credit was of doubtful character ! To avoid the absolute dissolution of the government , it became necessary to resort to some expedient that might furnish temporary relief . This could only be effected by creating a currency that should command some degree of credit abroad . " It was hoped and believed , that if a small issue of government paper was made , with specific means of redemption pointed out , which appeared to be ample and well guaranteed , and the government should evince a prudent and discreet judgment in its mana* ement , it would command such articles in the market of the United States as were indispensable to the country . " The result has justified the expectation . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of truth now as then , " The government will never be able by all the issues it can make , to satisfq the demands of private speculation and interest . The vast issues of all the banks in the United States ( reference being here made to the condition of things in 1836-1837 ) , in their most extended condition , failed to attain this object . There has not probably been in circulation at any time , more than half a million of dollars . The present bill requires the secretary of the treasury to increase the issue to a million . No time or discretion is allowed to that officer . The circulation of the country is to be doubled in as little time as is required to issue the paper. ** The objections of the executive for the moment prevailed ; but another bill was passed a week after , which allowed the president to increase the amount of treasury notes to one million , if in his judgment the interests of the country required it ; and at the same time , it specifically appropriated four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount nearly equal to the whole existing issue , to the payment of army , navy , and civil indebtedness . The barriers against unlimited inflation were thus indirectly rem&amp;ved , and from this time there does not appear to have been any effort to restrain further action in this direction . The first issues of these notes , as already stated , carried interest . The new issues were without interest , and on account of a red impression on their back , were everywhere known as " red-backs ; " thus affording another example in illustration of the trite proverb , that " history repeats itself . " As might have been expected , with the authorization of the new issues the notes be*an to depreciate ; and the depreciation increased with each additional emission . In all , paper money in the form of treasury notes to the nominal amount of $4,717,939 was issued . In January , 1839 , these notes were worth no more than forty cents on the dollar ; in the spring of 1839 they were worth thirty-seven and a half cents ; in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1842 they fell to ten cents , to five cents , to four , to three , to two , and finally became utterly worthless . In the characteristic language of the times , it required , before the close of President Lamar 's administration , " fifteen dollars in treasury notes to buy three glasses of brandy and water , without suar . " To the treasury notes succeeded what were termed " exchequer bills ; " but they were comparatively few in number , and never passed to any extent into circulation . . By this time , " says Mr. Gouge , " there was little circulating medium of any kind in Texas ; but this was no great calamity , as the people had but little left to circulate . The evils this system did were immense , and such as for which , even were it so disposed , the government could afford no compensation to the sufferers . They no doubt , however , like othcrs in similar circumstances , attributed to the want of circulating medium the evils tbey suffered from want of circulating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the amount of " promissory notes , " " audited drafts , " " exchequer bills , " bonds , etc. , issued by the Texan treasury , and serving to a greater or less extent as " circulatino ' medium , " amounted to $13,318,145 ; or reckoning the population at fifty thousand , more than two hundred and sixty1874. 449 // six dollars per capita . If paper issues could , therefore , have made a people rich , the Texans ought to have been the richest people in the universe . One other thing in connection with this subject ought specially to be mentioned in all honor to the Texans . In the midst of their poverty , and crushed almost to the earth with their burden of financial necessities , t*hey never made their government paper a legal tender in the payment of private debts ; but every man was left at liberty to refuse or receive treasury notes at his option . The result was , that when " red-backs " were almost the exclusive circulating medium , specie was the standard of ultimate reference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he gave a note promising to pay dollars in silver , or so many treasury notes , as should , when the note fell due , be worth an equivalent of the amount owed in silver . But another and no less curious part of this history yet remains to be told . The experiment of paper issues , not redeemable in specie on demand , to supply the office and function of money , or circulating medium , had been fully and fairly tried in Texas , and the people , one and all , were so entirely satisfied with their experiences , that they wanted no more for all time , like it . They accordingly did not content themselves with mere ordinary legislation ; but when the convention came together , immediately after the consummation of the act of annexation to the United States , to form a State constitution , the delegates , by one of their earliest acts , inserted in the constitution the following sections , which were afterwards ratified by the people : " In no case shall the legislature have power to issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any description intended to circulate as money . " 1 The movement against the continued use of paper money , in fact commenced in Texas at a date considerably earlier than that above indicated ; the last president of Texas , Anson Jonca , in December , 1844 , using in his inaugural the following language : " The fallacy and danger of a factitious paper currency having been demonstrated by every civilized nation upon the earth , and Texas having once participated in this demonstration , should now , when she is able to do so , abandon the experiment and resort in time to what the experience of the past " No corporate body shall hereafter be created , renewed , or extended , with banking or discountin* privileges . " The legislature shall prohibit by law individuals from issuing bills , che cks , or promissory notes , or other paper , to circulate as money . " " It is never , " says Mr. Gouge , in noticing the peculiarities of this constitution of Texas , " without deep experience of the evils of paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And the first legislature tilat convened after the adoption of the constitution , or in the succeeding year , made the following further enactment : - " No person or persons within this State shall issue any bill , promissory note , check , or other paper , to circulate as money . " " Every person who may violate this act shall be subject to indictment therefor , by a grand jury , as for a misdemeanor , at any tntse within twelve months after so offending ; and shall be subject to a fine of not less than ten dollars , nor more than fifty dollars , for each and every bill , promissory note , check , or other paper , issued by them in violation of the first section of this act . " These measures practically put an end to the paper-money systesn of Texas . Various subterfuges were afterwards resorted to , and by means of them papermoney , to a very limited extent , found its way into circulation in Texas after its annexation to the United States . But as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any other currency than specie . The result of such a policy on the development and business of the State was thus reported by Mr. Gouge in 1852 ,  --  seven years after its adoption : " The result of this hard-money policy is , that business in has conclusively shown to be the only safe expedient for governments - a hard-money currency as a circulating medium . " In accordance with this recommendation , the congress of Texas , in almost one of its last acts , forbade the further issue by the government * any deecription of paper representing money intended for circulation , or to be received in payment of any clacs of revenue ; " and required the secretary to cause to be destroyed all the exchequer bills received at the treasury department . // Texas rests on a more stable foundation than it does in many other parts of the Union . That it is absolutely free from vicissitudes is what we do not assert . But , unboistered by bank-credits , and governed by that best of all regulators , gold and silver , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demands of the planters at home , measuring that demand by the surplus erops the planters have to dispose of . Exchanges are regular . The maximum rates never exceed the cost of transporting specie , and often fall below it . A gentleman at Austin told us that he had in the course of years negotiated bills on New York , to the amount of two hundred thousand dollars , and had seldom given either premium or discount . At Galveston , exchanges on New York have not for years been at any time more than one and a half premium . " Prices , Mr. Gouge observes , were not low , but quite as high as they are ( other things considered ) in the most paper-loving portions of the Union ; thus showing that hard money and high prices are not incompatible . " The rate of interest is high , because the profits of trade are great . Money is scarce , as money ought to be , for without scarcity it would lose its value . But eold and silver is in Texas quite as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper money is in New York or Massachusetts . " Mr. Gouge also , in his record , brings out two other series of facts in connection with the history of the paper money of Texas , which from their parallelism with results obtained on a larger scale , but under similar circumstances , in the United States and other countries , are especially worthy of notice . The first relates to the incentive given by paper money to national extravagance and increase of expenditures ; and in this respect the experience of Texas was as follows . The revolution broke out in 1835 . From that time until the close of 1838 , the period covering the main military operations and the practical achievement of independence , the Republic ' of Texas incurred a debt of less 451 than two millions of dollars . This small amount was not due to the circumstance that the governnment had any objection to running in debt ; " but because few would trust , except such as could not well avoid so doing . " In 1838 , Mirabeau B. Lamar was elected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until December , 1841 . The period of his administration was one of comparative peace , but it was also the era of paper money and profusion . Lamar in his three years ' term increased the national debt from less than two millions to upwards of seven millions . The average annual expenses of his government were also $1,618,405 . In 1841 General 1-Touston took office as president for a second term . The paper money bubble had exploded , but Mexican hostilities , which in General Lamar 's administration only threatened , now actually broke out . Yet in General Houston 's last admiflistration not only was the national debt not increased , except by increments of interest and by the bringing in of back accounts ; but the average annual expenses of the republic were reduced from $1,618,405 to $170,361 . Mr. Gouge claims that this experience of the republic under President Houston , from 1842 to 1844 inclusive , shows " that if it had been possible for the Texans to be hard-money and prompt-payment men , they mi , , ht have achieved their independence and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost of two hundred thousand a year . But the Texans never became economical until constrained by necessity . " So long as they could borrow , or induce any one to take their paper money , they were extravagant ; but when they could borrow no longer , and their paper money refused to circulate , theim they became saving . The second series of facts relates to the influence which an excess of paper currency in Texas exerted in encouraging imports and discoura0ing exports . Thus during the administration of Lamar , - 183 9-1840 , - when treasury notes were the circulating medium , and money was , as it is termed . " abundant , " the A A ( odern Financial Utopia. // imports were nearly six times as great as the exports ; or an average of $1,442 ,  - -  733 of imports per annum as compared with an avera* , e of $247,459 of exports . On the contrary , in two years of Houston 's second term , 1843-1844 , when such notes were no longer current , the exports nearly equaled the imports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an average annual export of $506,444 . Whether the memory of the events and experiences thus recorded has been kept alive in Texas , we know not ; but one thing is certain , that from the annexation of Texas to the present day , her people have evinced no love for paper money . During the rebellion , Confederate money found little , favor in Texas , and circulated only under the pressure of military law and necessity ; along the lines of the several railroads , fares and freights have been latterly paid in currency ; and since the opening of the Missouri , Kansas , and Texas Railroad , currency has gradually entered to a greater or less extent into the transactions of merchants ; but in the interior , cattle and cotton can be purchased only for specie , and with the average Texan , who travels with an oxteam or on mule-back , the greenback obtains no recognition .
