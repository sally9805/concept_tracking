txt Dennis Donnelly , the Mollie Maguire convicted of planning the murder of Thomas Sanger at Raven Run , on Sept. 1 ; 1875 , was hanged here this morning . A sketch of his crime and of his career appeared in THE TIDIES about three weeks ago . . His death warrant fixed April 18 as the.day for the execution , but he was respited until to-day to give him more time to prepare for death . Donnelly has shown remarkable nerve since his Bentome , and while awaiting execution . Naturally reckless and light-hearted , he seemed to give little attentton to the fate hanging over him until his last appeal to the Board of Pardons met with a refusal , and he became convinced that there was no help for him . Since then he has shown more seriousness and has spent a great deal of time in ieligious services , but still maintained a firm demeanor , asserted that he was quite prepared to die , and said he had no doubt as to his future ; nor did this confidence forsake him even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wife , his attendant clergymen , and some of the prison officials , he went to bed and slept soundly until about 6 o'clock this morning , when be ate a hearty breakfast , and spent most'of the time until 7 in devotion . About that hour Fathers Gallagher and Brennan , accompanied by Donnelly 's wife and niece and several Sisters of Charity , visited his cell , where high mass was celebrated . Donnelly 's parting with his wife was very affecting , both seeming to be completely unnerved , A little before 10 his counsel came to say good-bye . They expressed a hope of meeting him hereafter , when the condemned man said : " Gentlemen , I thank you for what you have done for me , and if I can do anything for you in the future I will . " At 10:20 Sheriff Matz summoned the doomed man , and the little procession , headed by the Sherif ! , filed through the long corridor of the prison to the scaffold , a section of that used last June , when six murderers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the utmost decorum was observed , both by those inside and by the crowd of 300 or 400 which assembled in front of the prison to stare at the walls . It was expected that Donnelly would make a confession on the gallows , but he showed no disposition to do so . He walked with a firm step to the platform , holding before him a crucifix , to which was attached a small rosary . A slight trembling was the only indication he gave of nervousness , and he stood praying earnestly until the Sheriff asked : " Have you anything to say why your sentence should not be carried out I " " I have nothing to say . " replied the prisoner . The Sheriff and Prison Wardens then shook hands with him , bade him good bye , and proceeded to bind his hands and feet . A tight band was also strapped around his chest to cheek his dying convulsions  --  a necessary precaution , as it proved . At 10:26 the bolt was pulled , and the doomed man dropped about four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The victim 's neck was not broken by the fall , nor , through some error in the adjustment of the noose , was strangulation complete . For three minutes his chest heaved and his shoulders rose and fell as he breathed , with convulsive energy , in long , gasping respirations , the breath escaping from his lungs with a horrible , hissing sound which told that he was slowly choking to death . He strive ' . glad spasmodically , drawing his body together as he tried by muscular force to loosen the noose , while his pulse beat more and more rapidly . After hangIng for seven minutes , his pulse beat 142 strokes  --  per minute . The eighth minute it rose to 160 ; at nine and one  --  quarter it was still beating faintly , but in 10 minutes the physicians pronounced him dead . After hanging 15 minutes the body was taken down , the Sheriff 's officer slowly and bunglingly untying the knot , instead of cutting the rope . The body was at once handed over to Donnelly 's wife and brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , near his old home at Raven Run , where he was buried at 4 o'clock this afternoon , a large procession following the remains to the grave . The execution was very quietly conducted . There was no excitement in town , and the assemblage in front of the prison was composed only of idlers . John Kehoo was sentenced to die with Donnelly , having been convicted of the murder of Langdon , at Audenried , in 1861 . Strong afridavits tending to establish his innocence were laid before the Board of Pardons , but though that body refused to interfere in his behalf Gov . Hartranft withdrew his death warrant . The Governor is reported to have said that he would never reissue the warrant , as be believed Ket'oo to be innocent of the murder . If this is true the Mollie leader will not be hanged this year at least , but there are other charges equally grave hanging over him , and Gov . Hartranft 's successor will doubtless order him to be banged .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
