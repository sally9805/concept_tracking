txt A traveler in this , country must never make an appointment , that is to say if he intends keeping it . I ought to , have been at Rustchuk , but am no further on my way than Rase ad , and through no fault of mine . On Monday , true to my promise , having previously telegraphed to Rasgrad for a wagonette to take me forward , I packed up my valise and was ready for a start . My servant , who had been Very long in bringing me the cab I had sent for , at last returned with the unwelcome news that all conveyances were requisitioned by the military for the transport of wounded . This was a very bad lookout , for without my baggage I could not possibly start . I went , therefore , to the quarantine , intending there to engage a porter , and with him to go on foot to the railway station . On my way I was hailed by a cabby , who offered to take me down , and very glad to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home for the valise , and made a fair start , as I flattered myself . Cabby , instead of taking the usual road , chose all the back streets , and then the suspicion flashed across my mind the man was cheating the authorities . That , however , ( lid not concern me much so long as we got to the station , and we rolled right merrily along across the stones until we got to the outer fortification gate , where we were roughly pulled up by a soldier , who told me I must get out , as all the carriages were requisitioned . I pointed piteously to my bag , which was a very heavy one , and asked him what I was to do with it . His answer was to take it out and turn the horses heads round . I begged him to allow me to return home with the hag , but only to receive a surly negative . Cabby was bundled off back , and I was left in the middle of the road sitting on my bag , contemplating the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grief . " I eyed the soldier as he stood gravely at his post , to find out if there was a weak point about him . I offered him a baksheesh , which the rascal accepted , as a matter of course , hut to all my appeals for a man to assist me with the bag he remained inexorable , and to extricate myself from my very undignified position I took the bag on my shoulder and tramped down to the station , arriving there just in time to see the train leave without me . I learned afterward from the cab-drivers that their unwillingness to work for the wounded was owing to the many difficulties they encountered in cashing their certificates . Their case is a good one , and has been represented to the powers that be , but no redress ' has been given . If a train of wounded is announced to arrive at midnight and a telegram is transmitted to the authorities at 4 in the afternoon , from that moment Cabby is requisitioned and can not ply for hire , so that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight hours . That is grievance number one , and a very substantial one it is . Grievance number two is the cash . For every journey between the station and the hospital 6 piastres ( about 12 cents ) are allowed , that is just 4 cents more than is paid by the ordinary public , and on paper it looks all fair and just ; but then comes the tug of war . One of my informants , whose case reflects the rest , on one occasion made six journeys , equivalent to 36 piastres , and then went home . In the morning , as per custom , he presented himself at the barracks to get a certificate from the commandant . The latter was not there ; a see ond visit and the commandant was occupied on urgent business . After several days Cabby succeeded in getting an interview and the necessary certificate , but it was given for four journeys only , because , observed the commandant , " if you say you have made six journeys you can not possibly have made more than four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ask . " Of course , there is no appeal against this military sharp practice , and poor Jehu is obliged to go away grumbling . In full possession of this paper he has still only accom ' plished one stage ; he must then present him . self at the civil municipal chest , when he is told to.cOnle again as there is iao money : ... ? . In .. fact , " said one of them to me , " the sum and substance of it is I am still unpaid for work done 15 days ago , and , into the bargain , my cab is all stained with the blood of the wounded . " My second start was as successful as the first . There was to be no train ; the Commander-inChief had ordered the railway authorities to reopen the line , an order that was obeyed with the greatest alacrity . Everything ready , we started the next morning on our way . We stay the night here , and to-morrow morning shall take the first train through . The passengers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all who wish to go forward are refused ; they must wait patiently until the material train has reconnoitred and put into repair whatever damages have been caused by the Russians , who have been in supposed possession of the railway for over a month . Pickets are posted at intervals along the way , and not a single precaution neglected . The journey from Rasgrad to Vetova occupied nearly three hours . As six rails were torn up and must be replaced before the train enters the station , all got out to find the building itself , which is of stone , undamaged . The windows and windowframes were hacked and smashed up with yataghans , and the panels of the doors forced , but nothing more serious . The telegraph was torn down and a few of the poles leveled to the ground . Two old Turks who had never left the neighborhood told us the station and telegraph were wantonly damaged by Bashi Bazouks and Cireassians , but that the rails were injured by Cossacks . They described the reports of the dynamite capsules placed on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were one day hiding in the wood as usual , when a loud report startled them ; it was repeated four times , and then ceased . They thought a battle was raging near , but could not understand the absence of musketry fire . Toward evening , perceiving that all was quiet , the old men ventured to the railway station , and , seeing the torn rails , twisted into all kinds of fantastic shapes , at once divined the cause of the morning 's commotion . It is impossible to describe the radiant faces of these old men at our appearance . The Bulgarians , too , were unaffectedly pleased at the return of the railway officials . Villagers , both Bulgarians and Turks , who ? had taken refuge near to Rasgrad , at once began to return to their villages , and the whole country bore an animated appearance . Throughout the whole of the journey the progress of the train , which naturally was a very slow one , was lustily cheered , and the shaking of hands lasted throughout its entire length . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the principal officials of the road , and it inspired them with confidence . A few kilometres from Vetova more rails were found destroyed by dynamite , but they were replaced , and Tshernavoda was reached without difficulty . Two panes of glass only were found broken there , and I mar state that all the damages done to the line by the Russians will be amply covered by an expenditure of less than $1,000 . One sad feature I have to record , and that is , between Vetova and Tshernavoda the whole of the wheat is uncut , and is bent to the ground and bleached in the sun . The straw is a dirty white instead of being its usual rich golden color , and to this fact I found my belief that the Russians never had possession of this part of the country or they would never have allowed native riches to waste in that manner . It is quite logical to suppose the Turks abandoned the neighborhood , thinking the Russians were there , and the Russians did not take possession , being unaware of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left to fall out of the ear . For the same reason one can conclude , without difficulty , that the railroad was not entirely destroyed by the Russians , as the few Cossacks who did attempt to destroy it passed very hurriedly always and disappeared . They were not at an sure the Turks were not there . Sending the train back on its return journey , the exploring party proceeded to Rustchuk on a trolley . The latter being small , we were obliged to divide our party . The engineer , the manager 's son , the English Consul , and a staff officer who is the nephew of the Grand Vizier , with his wife , a French lady , took the trolley . The manager 's secretary offered me a seat in a wagonette , and we decided to go through the camp , a journey of two hours to Rustchuk . Wo entered the town during a fierce bombardment , but I must say both sides played the game of war fairly . Port replied to fort . and scarcely a shell fell into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over our heads from the Russian side and the loud reports of those fired front the cannon of the line of ports through which we were passing being unpleasantly near , an officer requested us to step behind the ramparts until all was over . He was still making the communication to us when the horses took fright . They were four abreast and wildly careered down a hill . My friend jumped out and bruised himself , besides spraining his allele , but I elected to stay . The driver kept his seat , and we went on madly until a mud wall effectually stopped progress without further damage to occupants or carriage . I returned and picked up my companion , whom I found less hurt than I expected , and conducted him to the railroad hotel , where I learned that the party we had left on the trolley had had also an accident and were confined to the Red Cross Hospital . I immediately looked them up and found they had had a very narrow escape indeed . On reaching the fifth kilometer from Rustchuk sleepers were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop the trolley , which was spinning away at the rate of 40 miles an hour . The lady was thrown to the ground . her husband and the Consul falling on her , but none were injured . The engineer and manager 's son , however , fared worse . They were sitting on the front . The former had his great toe broken , and was contused all over , and the latter was thrown 10 meters from the trolley , on his shoulder , breaking the shoulder-blade , the wheels passing afterward over his feet without breaking them . Their kind reception at the hospital is beyond all praise , and in 10 days they will be on their feet again . I have a deal to say of Rustchuk , but can not get it off this mail .
