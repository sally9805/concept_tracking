txt The reduction of the fare for foot passengers during certain hours in the day , which was begun by the Union Ferry Company on the first of last month , was a step in the right direction , and will , doubtless , lead to results beneficial to Brooklyn . Cheap ferriage is as necessary to that city as rapid communication with the suburbs is to this , for without these conveniences neither city can be developed and extended to the proportions demanded by its ever-increasing population . It must be several years before the East River Bridge can be completed , even under the most favorable circumstances ; but in the meantime it will be wise policy on the part of the ferry companies to extend every possible facility to passengers and vehicles . In this way , by making their boats a popular means of transportation , they may induce more persons to reside on the other side of the river , and thereby so much increase the already extensive travel as not to be materially injured by the opening of a new avenue of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Union Company are about to erect a new and commodious house on the Brooklyn side of the Fulton Ferry , in place of the old structure which has so long stood there . This new building is to have a frontage of 173 feet , with a roof 35 feet high . It is promised that the new house shall be an ornament to the street on which it is situated , and that it shall afford ample accommodation for the travel which crosses at that point . As the boats at this ferry are run with commendable regularity and rapidity , the Fulton will be , when this new house is completed , one of the best ordered ferries leading from this City . During the erection of this new house , only one slip is available on the Brooklyn side , and , to accommodate foot-passengers , no teams are allowed to cross the Fulton Ferry from 7 to 10 o'Clock in the morning , additional boats being run for them on the other ferries .. This arrangement is a practical solution of the difficulty which ladies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obtain seats in the cabins devoted exclusively to them . The gentlemen now have some place to go other than the so-called gentlemen 's cabin , which is generally filthy - with tobacco juice . If the Ferry Company would arrange a cabin on the upper deck , and throw it open to alLrgassengore , it would thereby remove many of the inconveniences now attendant upon crossing the river . The reduction of the rate of ferriage is a decided acknowledgment of the rights of passengers , and now that the ice has been broken , other needed reforms may be expected to follow , especially as the bridge approaches completion . These concessions to Brooklyn have stirred up the inhabitants of Williamsburg to take active measures for a reduction of their ferry tolls . It now costs three cents to go to Greenpoint over most of the ferries , and four cents over the one which runs from Tenth and Twenty-third streets to that locality . The Williamsburgers naturally complain of these rates as exorbitant , and . have been endeavoring to bring Mr ..

Finally , however , capitalists took the matter in hand , and set about raising funds for the establishment of a company pledged to reduce the ferriage between New-York and . the " Burg " to two cents for a single passage  --  fourteen tickets for twenty-five cents  --  with a pronortionate reduction for teams . These gentlemen mean business , and their prompt action has at last induced the ferry magnates to pay some attention to the demands of the people . According to latest reports , an interview has been held with the directors , and they have promised to lay the matter before the shareholders at an early day , commending the subject  --  to their favorable attention . The present indications are that , by one means or another , ferriage to Williamsburg will soon be reduced to two cents . With reduced ferriage and lower taxes , Brooklyn and Williamsburg property will soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drug it now is.
