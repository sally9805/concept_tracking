JEFFERSON A REFORMER OF OLD VIRGINIA . TEMPTATION crossed JefferA son 's path while the Declaration of Independence was still a fresh topic in Christendom . It was a temptation which was , and is , of all others the most alluring to an American who is young , educated , and fond of art ; and it came to him in such a guise of public duty , that , if he had yielded to it , only one person in the world would have blamed him . But the censure of that one would have properly outweighed a world 's applause : for it was himself . This temptation presented itself on the 8th of October , 1776 . He had resigned his seat in Congress , and , after spending a few days at home , had proceeded to Williamsburg , where he had taken his seat in the Legislature , and was about to engage in the hard and long task of bringing up old Virginia to the level of the age . His heart was set on this work . He wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and introduce some of the institutions and usages which had given to New England so conspicuous a superiority over the Southern Colonies . A Virginian , dining one day with John Adams , lamented the inferiority of his State to New England . " I can give you , " said Mr. Adams , " a receipt for making a New England in Virginia : Town meetings , training - days , town schools , and ministers ; the meetinghouse , school-house , and training-field are the scenes where New England men were formed . " Probably Mr. Jefferson had heard his friend Adams say something of the kind . He was now intent upon purging the Virginia statute-books of unsuitable laws , and founding institutions in accord with the new order of things . Young as he was , he had had some training now in practical statesmanship . That sharp experience in Congress , while his draft of the Declaration of Independence was edited of its crudities , redundancies , and imprudences , was salutary to him . It completed the preliminary part of his education as a public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do , not with what is ideally best , but with the best attainable ; not to give eloquent expression to his own ideas , but effective expression to the will of his constituents . He wrote little that needed severe pruning after July 4 , 1776 , though he was still to propose many things that were unattainable . A truly wise , bold , safe , competent public man is one of the slowest formations in nature ; but when formed , there is only one man more precious , the philosopher who is the common teacher of legislators and constituents . If there had been such a philosopher in Virginia just then , he would have smiled , perhaps , at the noble enthusiasm of these young Virginians , who were about to try to make a New England out of a State in which the laboring majority were only t:o likely to remain slaves . But it belongs to the generous audacity of youth to attempt the impossible . Here , at Williamsburg , in this October , 1776 , were gathered once more the circle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactions of the king . Patrick Henry was governor now , living in " the palace , " and enjoying the old viceregal salary of a thousand pounds a year . George Wythe , from service in Congress , had acquired experience and distinction . It was he who began the constitution-making in which Virginia had been engaged during much of this year . In January , while spending an evening with Mr. John Adams at Philadelphia , and hearing him discourse , in his robust and ancient-Briton manner , of the constitution proper for a free state , George Wythe asked him to put the substance of his ideas upon paper . // Mr. Adams gave him , in consequence , his " Thoughts upon Government " ; which were the best thoughts on that subject of Locke , Milton , Algernon Sidney , James Otis , and John Adams . How congenial to Mr. Adams such a piece of work " The best lawgivers of antiquity , " said he , " would rejoice to live at a period like this , when , for the first time in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were deliberately choosing their government and institutions . " Patrick Henry was well pleased with the " Thoughts . " " It shall be my incessant study , " he wrote to Mr. Adams , " so to form our portrait of government that a kindred with New England may be discerned in it . " So thought all the band of radically liberal men in Virginia , who were beginning to regard Thomas Jefferson as their chief . And now , on the second day of the session , came a fair excuse for him to leave the " laboring oar , " and throw the difficult task of re-creating Virginia upon his colleagues . A messenger from the Honorable Congress reached Williamsburg , October 8th , bearing a despatch for Mr. Jefferson , informing him that he had been elected joint commissioner with Dr. Franklin and Silas Deane to represent the United States at Paris . The temptation was all but irresistible . He relished extremely the delicious society of Dr. Franklin , and was getting into the Franklinian way of dealing with cantankerous man . Paris , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abode of the blest , where Jefferson could see , at last , after living in the world thirty - three years , harmoniously proportioned edifices , and listen to music such as the Williamsburg " Apollo " had only heard in dreams . The public duty , also , was supposed to be of the first importance . Perhaps it was ; but , also , perhaps it was not . Considering the whole case , the young giant might have done better if he had , from the first , made up his mind to fight unassisted . It was a costly business , that French alliance ; the heav iest item being the habit of leaning upon France , and looking for help , at every pinch , to the French treasury . But this could not have been foreseen in 1776 ; and happy , indeed , would it have been for Franklin , for the country , for the future , if he could have been seconded by a person so formed to co-operate with him as Jefferson . Franklin would have got Canada at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help , instead of a Jay and an Adams to hinder . Torn with contending desires , Jefferson kept the messenger waiting day after day ; so hard was it to say No to Congress , and to give up an appointment promising so much honor and delight . But his duty was plain . There was a lady upon Monticello who had a claim upon his services with which no other claim could compete . To leave her in the condition in which she was , had been infidelity ; and to take her with him might have been fatal to her . Virginia had many sons , but Mrs. Jefferson had but one husband . So , on the ith of October , the messenger mounted and rode away , bearing the proper answer to the President of Congress - " It would argue great insensibility in me , could I receive with indifference so confidential an appointment from your body . My thanks are a poor return for the partiality they have been pleased to entertain for me . No cares for my own person , nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment 's hesitation to accept the charge . But circumstances very peculiar in the situation of my family , such as neither permit me to leave nor to carry it , compel me to ask leave to decline a service so honorable , and , at the same time , so important to the American cause . The necessity under which I labor , and the conflict I have undergone for three days , during which I could not determine to dismiss your messenger , will , I hope , plead my pardon with Congress ; and I am sure there are too many of that body to whom they may with better hopes confide this charge , to leave them under 33 // a moment 's difficulty in making a new choice . " As soon as he had reached a decision on this important matter , his colleagues in the Assembly , who had been waiting for it , placed him on a great number of committees ; and he began forthwith , on the very day of the messenger 's departure , to introduce the measures of reform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Virginia as a reformer 's paradise ; for , owing to the colonial necessity of submitting every desired change to the king , which involved time , trouble , expense , and probable rejection , the Province was far behind even Great Britain in that adaptation of laws and institutions to altered times , which ought to be always in progress in every community . There was such an accumulation , in Virginia , of the outgrown and the unsuitable , that Jefferson and his friends hoped to accomplish in a few months an amount of radical change that would have been a fair allowance for a century and a half . The law-books were full of old absurdity and old cruelty. * Of the four hundred thousand people who were supposed to inhabit Virginia , one half were African slaves ; and it was a fixed idea in the Jefferson circle , that whites and blacks could not live in equal freedom in the same community . Besides the intense prejudice entertained by the master race against the servile , and the hatred which had been gathering ( as Jefferson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generations of outrage , he believed that Nature herself had made it impossible for the two races to live happily together on equal * Like this , for example : " Whereas , oftentimes many brabling women often slander and scandalize their neighbors for which their poore husbands are often brought into chargeable and vexatious suites , and caste in greate damages : Bee it therefore enacted by the authority aforesaid , that in actions of slander , occasioned by the wife as aforesaid , after judgment passed for the damages , the woman shall be punislsed by ducking : and if the slander be soe enormous as to be adjudged at a greater damage than five hundred pounds of tobacco , then the woman to suffer a ducking for each five hundred pounds of tobacco adjudged against the husband , if he refuse to pay the tobacco . " terms . He evidently had a low opinion of the mental capacity of his colored brethren . The Indian , with no opportunities of mental culture beyond those of the negro , had acquired the art of oratory , could carve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of truth and spirit , and draw upon a piece of bark a figure resembling an animal , a plant , a tract of country . But never had he observed in a negro , or a negro 's work , one gleam of superior intelligence , aptitude , or taste . No negro standing behind his master 's chair had caught from the conversation of educated persons an elevated mode of thinking . " Never , " says Mr. Jefferson , " could I find that a black had uttered a thought above the level of plain narration ; never saw even an elementary trait of painting or sculpture . " In music they were more gifted , but no negro had yet imagined anything beyond " a small catch . " Love , which inspires the melodious madness of poets , kindles only the senses of a black man , not his mind , and has never , in all the tide of time , wrung from him a word which other lovers love to repeat . Mere misery , to other races , has been inspiration . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their woes in poetry . For these and other reasons , Mr. Jefferson was disposed to regard the negro race as naturally inferior ; though he expresses himself on the point with the hesitation natural to a scientific mind provided with a scant supply of facts . On the political question , he was clear : the two races could not live together in peace as equals . The attempt to do so , he thought , would " divide Virginians into parties , and produce convulsions which would probably never end but in the extermination of the one or theother race . " Here was a problem for a knot of young legislators , without a precedent to guide them in all the known.history of man ! The gross ignorance of the white inhabitants , except one small class , was another too obvious fact . They were almost as ignorant as Europeans , with 34 // fewer restraints than Europeans . Almost every glimpse we get of the poorer Virginians of that day is a revelation of rude and reckless ignorance . We have in the Memoirs of Elkanah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ election scene at Hanover CourtHouse* which must have been a startling contrast to the elections he had witnessed in his native Massachusetts , where an election was a solemnity opened with prayer . The " whole county , " he records , was assembled . " The moment I alighted , a wretched , pugnosed fellow assailed me to swap watches . I had hardly shaken him off when I was attacked by a wild Irishman , who insisted on my swapping horses with him , and in a twinkling ran up the pedigree of his horse to the grand dam . Treating his importunity with little respect , I became near being involved in a boxing-match , the Irishman swearing I did not trate him like a jintleman . ' I had hardly escaped this dilemma when my attention was attracted by a fight between two very unwieldy fat men , foaming and puffing like two furies , until one succee*d in twisting a forefinger in a side-lock of the other 's hair , and in the act of thrusting by this purchase his thumb into the latter 's eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in technical language to Enough . " There was in Virginia an unusually large proportion of this savage ignorance , easily convertible into fanatical ignorance . The handling of tobacco , it appears , gave employment to a great number of rough fellows , - tobaccorollers , among others , who drove a pin into each end of a hogshead of tobacco , and thus attaching to it a pair of shafts , harnessed a horse to it , and rolled it to the landing . Professor Tucker of Virginia speaks of this class as " hardy , reckless , proverbially rude , and often indulging in coarse humor at the expense of the traveller who chanced to be well dressed or riding in a carriage . " But ignorance was almost universal in Virginia , as it must be in every community , unless there is a universal system of education . And this was another problem for the young gentlemen at Williamsburg who desired to Yankeefy Virginia . Mr. Jefferson , for one , felt the absolute necessity of the voting class being able to vole . He saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evils arising from ill-distributed wealth . It is the nature of wealth to get into heaps ; because it is the nature of the weak to squander their money , and of the strong to husband it ; and this being its nature , laws need not aggravate the tendency . But in Virginia , as in all the old-fashioned countries , there was a whole system of laws and usages expressly designed to keep property from being distributed . Fathers could prevent a profligate son from sinking to his natural level in the community , by entailing upon hun and upon the first-born of his male descendants , not his landed estates only , but the negroes who gave them value ; and this entail could only be broken by a special act of the Legislature . The law of primogeniture prevented the natural division of estates among all the family of a deceased proprietor , excluding all the daughters , and all the sons but one . The consequence was , that the best portions of Virginia were held by a few families , who suffered the ills and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is possible to aristocrats who accept the public duties of their position . They monopolized the honors of the Colony ; but , as a class , they appear to have been as destitute of public spirit as the grandees of Spain or Poland . There is only one test of a genuine superiority , and that test was as familiar to their ears as it was foreign to their hearts " Let him that will be chief among you , be your servant , " a perfect definition of a proper aristocracy . Jefferson , Henry , Madison , and their circle , who had been contending with the aristocracy of Virginia during the whole of their public life , had to consider a remedy for this evil also . The Established Church , during the 35 // ten years preceding the Revolution , had been pressing heavily upon the people of Virginia . Virginians used sometimes to ridicule New- Englanders whom they chanced to meet , for the persecution of the Quakers in Massachusetts , and the witchcraft delusion of Salem and Boston . It is the privilege @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country 's history ; and Virginians , availing themselves of this privilege , are not generally aware that at the time when Yankee magistrates were hanging witches and whipping Quakers , Virginia justices of the peace were putting Quakers in the pillory for keeping their hats on in church , and appointing juries of matrons to fumble over the bodies of old women for " witch-marks , " which , of course , they found . John Burk , historian of Virginia , intimates that a woman was burned to death in Princess Anne County for witchcraft , and adds that , " in all probability , the case was not solitary . " And as Massachusetts expelled Roger Williams and others for opinions ' sake , so did Virginia , in the same generation , refuse a residence to some Puritan clergymen who went from Massachusetts to Virginia upon the urgent invitation of persons of their own faith . But there is this to be said in favor of the Yankees : They recovered from the mania of uniformity sooner than the Virginians. 1f in 1650 , they regarded the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not permit the Church of England service to be performed , nor the rite of baptism to be administered by immersion , nor a company of men to pray with their hats on , yet , in 1750 , all these things were permitted , except , perhaps , the celebration of the mass . But , in Virginia , the Established Church had become more intolerant , as the Colony increased in l ) OPulation . It seemed so hostile to liberty , that James Madison , after coming home from Princeton College in New Jersey , where he was educated , expressed the opinion that if the Church of England had been established and endowed in all the Colonies as it was in Virginia , the king would have had his way , and gradually reduced all America to subjection . It was not merely that obsolete ( though unrepealed ) law still made Jefferson and several of his most virtuous friends liable to be burned to death for heresy ; nor that a denial of the doctrine of the Trinity was legally punishable by three years ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the custody of their own children , and those children assigned to drunken and dissolute Trinitarians ; nor even that Baptists , Presbyterians , and Quakers had to pay for supporting a church they did not attend ; - these were not the grievances which made Virginians restive under the establishment . In 1774 , when Madison was twentythree , we find him writing , to a Northern friend : " I want again to breathe your free air That diabolical , hell-conceived principle of persecution rages among some ; and , to their eternal infamy , the clergy can furnish their quot*of imps for such purposes . There are at this time , in the adjacent county , not less than five or six well-meaning men in close jail for publishing their religious sentiments , which , in the main , are very orthodox . " These prisoners were Baptists , the most numerous and enterprising of the dissenting sects . The historian of the Virginia Baptists , Semple , throws light on Mr. Madison 's brief indignant record . The Baptist ministers , from 1768 to 1775 , were frequently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was awkward to define their exact oftence , they were usually arraigned as " disturbers of the peace . " He gives a ludicrous account of the first arrest , which occurred in 1768 , near the seat of the Madisons . Young Madison , then a lad of seventeen , may have witnessed the ridiculous scene . Three Baptist preachers were seized by the sheriff on the same Sunday morning , and brought to the yard of the parish church , where three magistrates , who were in waiting for them , // bound them in a thousand pounds to appear in court two days after . When they were arraigned , the prosecutor assailed them with the utmost vehemence . " May it please your Honors , " he cried , " these men are great disturbers of the peace . They can not meet a man upon the road but they must ram a text of Scripture down his throat . " It so chanced that one of the prisoners was a very good lawyer , in an unprofessional way , and made a defence that was embarrassing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong . The court offered , at length , to release them , if they would give their word not to preach for a year . Refusing this , they were ordered into close confinement , and went to Spottsylvania Jail , singing , " Broad is the road that leads to death , " amid the jeers of the mob . After remaining in jail ( a straw-strewn pen , with grated holes for windows ) for forty-three days , preaching daily through the grated apertures to a hooting crowd , they were released . Worthy John Blair , governor*5ro tern. , to whom accusers and accused hastened to refer the matter , being a man of liberal opinions , sided , as a matter of course , with the Baptists . He told the bigoted squires that the persecution of dissenters only increased their numbers , and that the Baptists had really brought some reprobates to repentance . Nay , said he , if a man of theirs is idle and neglects to provide for his family , he incurs the censure of his brethren , which has had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try the same system . But there was an ignorant multitude in Virginia , as bigoted as the county magnates . Hence this persecution continued , and the case of these very men was tried again at Spottsylvania Court-House , and Patrick Henry rode fifty miles to defend them . But for the account ( missed by Wirt ) which has been preserved of Patrick Henry 's performance on this occasion , we should not have understood the secret of his power over an assembly . 37 The resistless magic of his oratory was greatly due to artifice , management , extreme and sudden changes in tone , . adroit repetition of telling phrases . He entered the court-house while the prosecuting attorney was reading the indictment . He was a stranger to most of the spectators , and , being dressed in the country manner , his entrance excited no remark . When the prosecutor had finished his brief opening , the new-coiner took the indictment , and glancing at it with an expression of puzzled incredulity , began to speak in the tone of a man who has just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ May it please your worships , I think I heard read by the prosecutor , as I entered the house , the paper I now hold in my hand . If I have rightly understood , the king 's attorney has framed an indictment for the purpose of arraigning and punishing by imprisonment these three inoffensive persons before the bar of this court for a crime of great magnitude , - as disturbers of the peace . May it please : the court , what did I hear read ? Did I hear it distinctly , or was it a mistake of my own ? Did I hear an expression as of a crime , that these men , whom your worships are about to try for misdemeanor , are charged w ith-witli - with WHAT ? " Having delivered these words in a halting , broken manner , as if his mind was staggering under the weight of a monstrous idea , he lowered his voice to its deepest bass ; and assuming the profoundest solemnity of manner , answered his own question : " Preaching the gos*e/ of the Son of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now riveted upon him , and every mind intent ; for all this was executed as a Kean or a Siddons would have performed it on the stage , - eye , voice , attitude , gesture , all in accord to produce the utmost possibility of effect . Amid a silence that could be felt , he waved the indictment three times round his head , as though still amazed , still unable to comprehend the charge* // Then he raised his hands and eyes to heaven , and , in a tone of pathetic energy wholly indescribable , exclaimed , " Great God ! " At this point , such was the power of his delivery , the audience relieved their feelings by a burst of sighs and tears . The orator continued : - " May it please your worships , in a day like this , when truth is about to burst her fetters , when mankind are about to be aroused to claim their natural and inalienable rights , when the yoke of oppression that has reached the wilderness of America , and the unnatural alliance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , - at suck a period , when liberty , liberty of conscience , is about to wake from her slumberings , and inquire into the reason of such charges as I find exhibited here to-day in this indictment " Here occurred another of his appalling pauses , during which he cast piercing looks at the judges and at the three clergymen arraigned . Then resuming , he thrilled every hearer by his favorite device of repetition : " If I am not deceived , - according to the contents of the paper I now hold in my hand , - these men are accused of preaching the gospel of the Son of God ! " He waved the document three times round his head , as though still lost in wonder ; and then , with the same electric attitude of appeal to Heaven , he gasped , " Great God ! " This was followed by another burst of feeling from the spectators ; and again this master of effect plunged into the tide of his discourse : - " May it please your worships , there are periods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so long debased the human character , that man sinks under the weight of the oppressor 's hand , - becomes his servile , his abject slave . He licks the hand that smites him . He bows in passive obedience to the mandates of the despot ; and , in this state of servility , he receives his fetters of perpetual bondage . But , may it please your worships , such a day has passed . From July , that period when our fathers left the land of their nativity for these American wilds , - from the moment they placed their feet upon the American continent , - from that moment despotism was crushed , the fetters of darkness were broken , and Heaven decreed that man should be free , - free to worship God according to the Bible . In vain were all their sufferings and bloodshed to subjugate this New World , if we their offspring must still be oppressed and persecuted . But , may it please your worships , permit me to inquire once more , for what are these men about to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Saviour to Ada ; n 's fallen race ! " Again he paused . For the third time , he slowly waved the indictment round his head ; and then , turning to the judges , looking them full in the face , exclaimed with the most impressive effect , " What laws have they violated ? " The whole assembly were now painfully moved and excited . The presiding judge ended the scene by saying , " Sheriff , discharge these men . " It was a triumph of the dramatic art . The men were discharged ; but not the less , in other counties , did zealous bigots pursue and persecute the ministers of other denominations than their own . It was not till the Revolutionary War absorbed all minds , that Baptists ceased to be imprisoned ; nor then were they released from paying tithes to support a church which they neither attended nor approved . Such was this old Virginia which Thomas Jefferson and his friends were about to try to reform . A slovenly , slatternly old England in the woods , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the flower of her young gentlemen now desired to change her into an orderly , industrious , thoughtful , and instructed New England . And what a time to begin , in this gloomy autumn of 1776 , after New York was lost , and while Washington was on the retreat , fighting as he went , not for victory , but for escape ! Perhaps the time was not so Yefferson a Reformer of Old Virginia . // unpropitious . The minds of men , at periods of public danger , are sometimes in a state of exaltation that renders it possible for them to receive new truth , and gives to persons of understanding an ascendency that is generally awarded only to rank , talent , or executive force . There were two parties in the Assembly , of course . But posterity cares only for the party that triumphs , - the radical party , the party in the right . In his own day , the conservative usually is , and usually ought to be , uppermost ; he represents the human family , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radical usually is one of a small minority , - half a dozen pioneers with broadaxes and leathern aprons , who march some paces in advance of the regiment , and get little besides scratches and hard knocks . But the radical has his revenge . He alone can have any enduring success . If the politics of the United States , from 1787 to i86i , are remembered at all in the general history of the world , the only names likely to be preserved will be those of a few troublesome Abolitionists , Demc*rats , law - reformers , and free-traders . The triumphant and respectable multitude with whom and for whom these contended , sweet Oblivion will claim them , and have its claim allowed . To Thomas Jefferson , it is evident , the radicals of Virginia looked as their chief in the work of reform . First among those upon whom he depended for co-operation was that noblehearted abolitionist , that humane and high-principled radical , that gentleman without pride and without reproach , George Mason of Gunston Hall on the Potomac , - he who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Day of 1774 : " Please to tell my dear little family that I charge them to pay a strict attention to it , and that I desire my three eldest sons and my two eldest daughters may attend church in mourning , if they have it , as I believe they have . " It was he who in the Constitutional Convention of 1787 set his face 2/efferson a Reformer of Old Virginia . 39 against all compromise with slavery , and avowed the opinion that the Southern States ought not to be admitted to the Union unless they would give it up . It was he who drew that Virginia Bill of Rights with which Mr. Bancroft enriches and ennobles the eighth volume ( p. 381 ) of his " History of the United States , " - a statement of principles so advanced that mankind can never outgrow them . Broken-hearted by the death of his wife , he would not , he could not , leave his family to serve Virginia in Congress , though the appointment was pressed upon him with tears . But he wasin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1776 , ready to lend the aid of his humane mind and gifted tongue to every enlightened measure . Nature had done everything for him . A superb man he was , of noblest presence and most engaging dignit*r ; the ablest man in some kinds of debate whom Virginia possessed ; healthy-minded , too , as fond of out-of-door sport almost as Washington himself . George Wythe , the abolitionist who emancipated his own slaves when he found he could not emancipate Virginia , was sure to be on the right side of leading questions , though he was not efficient in carrying measures , -a man of the closet rather than the forum . Governor Patrick Henry 's influence , at that period , was given without reserve w to liberal measures . These were the great names on the liberal side . But there was a new member in the House this year , a young man of twentyfive , small of stature , wasted by too much study , not in the least imposing in appearance , and too modest as yet to utter one word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most efficient ally during all his career . This was James Madison , to whom we all owe so much more than we know , whose services are so little remarked because they were so great . He never shone resplendent in debate , he never wrote or spoke anything that was striking or brilliant ; but few countries have ever possessed so useful a citizen as he . // From 1776 to 1817 , look where you will in the public affairs of the United States , you find this little man doing , or helping to do , or trying to get a chance to do , the thing that most wanted doing . He was the willing horse who is allowed to draw the load . His heart was in the business of serving his country . He was simply intent on having the right thing done , not to shine in doing it . Among his virtues was his joyous love of a jest , which made him one of the most agreeable of comrades , and preserved his health and spirits to his eighty-fifth year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a pleasure to me to walk in Madison Square because it bears his name . Of all Jefferson 's triumphs , none seems so exceptional as his being able to give to a man so little brilliant and so very useful the conspicuous place he held in the public life of the 1Y'nited States . They met for the first time at this session of the Legislature , and remained friends and political allies for fifty years . A leader on the conservative side was R. C. Nicholas , for many years the head of the bar in Virginia , a stanch Churchman and gentleman-of-the-old school . But Jefferson feared most the singular , tireless persistence of Edmund Pendleton : a cool , *vary , accomplished speaker , he says ; " full of resource , never vanquished ; for if he lost the main battle , he returned upon you , and regained so much of it as to make it a drawn one , by dexterous manoeuvres , skirmishes in detail , and the recovery of small advantages which , little singly , were important all together . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Differ as they might , the leaders of the two parties in this House remained excellent friends ; the reason being that they were most scrupulously observant of all the forms of courtesy . It was often remarked of Patrick Henry that never , in his most impetuous oratory , was he guilty of personal disrespect to a member of the House . On the contrary , he was profuse in those expressions of regret for being obliged to dif July , fer , and of respect for the character of an opponent , which assist so much to make public debate a genuine interchange of thought , and keep it above the contemptible pettiness of personal contention . All the men trained in that old House of Burgesses appear to have caught this spirit . What Jefferson said of Madison 's manners in debate describes all of them who are remembered " Soothing always the feelings of his adversaries by civilities and softness of expression . " As to Jefferson himself , not once in his whole public career did he lose or weaken a point by needlessly wounding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Virginia , Jefferson struck first at the system of entail . After a three weeks ' struggle , that incubus was lifted . Every acre and every negro in Virginia , by the 1st of November , 1776 , was held in fee simple , could be sold for debt , was free to fall into hands that were able to use them . It was the easiest and quickest of his triumphs , though he did not live long enough to outlive the enmity his victory engendered . Some of the old Tories found it in their herts to exult that he who had disappointed so many fathers , lost his only son before it was a month old ; and John Randolph , fiftyfive years after , could still attribute all the evils of Virginia to this triumph of " Jefferson and his levelling system . " He found it easier to set free the estates of his countrymen than their minds . Petitions for the repeal of statutes oppressive of the conscience of dissenters came pouring in upon the Assembly from the first day of the session . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led to the severest and longest struggle of the session . " Desperate contests , " as Jefferson records , " continued almost daily from the iith of October to the 5th of December . " He desired to sweep away the whole system of restraint and monopoly , and establish perfect liberty of conscience and opinion by a simple enactment of half a dozen lines : - 2/emerson a Reformer of Old Virginia . // " No man shall be compelled to freqtient or support any religious worship , ministry , or place whatsoever ; nor shall be enforced , restrained , molested , or burdened in his body or goods ; nor shall otherwise suffer on account of his religious opinions or belief ; but all men shall be free to profess , and by argument to maintain , their opinions in matters of religion ; and the same shall in no wise diminish , enlarge , or affect their civil capacities . " It required more than nine years of effort on the part of Jefferson , Madison , and their liberal friends to bring Virginia to accept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and completeness . All that they could accomplish at this session , after their twenty-five days ' debate , was the repeal of the statutes imposing penalties for going to the wrong church , and conipelling dissenters to pay tithes . At every subsequent session , for many years , the subject was called up , and , usually , some concession was made to the demands of the liberal party . In 1779 , for example , all forced contributions for the support of religion were surrendered . The principle , however , was retained , and , indeed , reasserted , that it was part of the duty of government to regulate religious belief ; and the laws remained in force which made it penal to deny the Trinity , and deprived a parent of the custody of his children if he could not subscribe to the leading articles of the Episcopal creed . We have come now to regard liberty of belief very much as we do liberty of breathing , - as a right too natural , too obvious , to be called in question , - forgetting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost to rescue the human mind from the domination of its natural foes . These nine years of Virginia debates have perished ; but something of their heat and strenuous vigor survive in a passage which Jefferson inserted in his " Notes on Virginia , " written toward the end of the Revolutionary War , and circulated in Virginia a year before the final triumph of religious freedom . The passage is out of place in the work , and it was probably left in , or lugged in , to give aid to Madison in his last contest with the opponents of Jefferson 's act . Doubtless it had its influence , coming as it did from a distant land and a name bright with the undimmed lustre of revolutionary successes . Indeed , this vigorous utterance of Thomas Jefferson was the arsenal from which the opponents of the forced support of religion drew their weapons , during the whole period of about fifty years that elapsed between its publication and the repeal of the last State law which taxed a community for the support of the clergy ; nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as any man , in any land , is distrusted , or undervalued , or abridged of his natural rights , on account of any opinion whatever . It is a curiously intense and compact passage , all alive with short , sharp sentences , as if he had struggled to get the whole of the controversy into a few pages . Opinion , he says , is something with which government has nothing to do . " It does me no injury for my neighbor to say there are twenty gods or no God . It neither picks my pocket nor breaks my leg . " Constraint makes hypocrites , not converts . A government is no more competent to prescribe beliefs than diet or medicine . " It is error alone which needs the support of government . Truth can stand by itself . Subject opinion to coercion , and whom will you make your inquisitors ?

Let us reflect that it is inhabited by a thousand millions of people ; that these profess probably a thousand different systems of religion ; that ours is but one of that thousand ; that if there be but one right , and ours that one , we should wish to see the nine hundred and ninety-nine wandering sects gathered into the fold of truth . But against such a majority we can not effect this by force . Reason and persuasion are the only practicable instruments .

Religion was well supported , and no more malefactors were hanged than in Virginia . Religious dissension was unknown , for the people had made the happy discovery that the way to silence religious disputes was to take no notice of them ; and to extinguish religious absurdity , to laugh at it . He urged his countrymen to have the rights of conscience fixed in law before the war ended , while rulers were honest and people united ; for , when peace recalled the people to their usual pursuits , he feared it would be difficult to concentrate attention upon a matter of abstract right .

The preamble of the act is a forcible statement of the whole argument for freedom of opinion ; and , not content with thus fortifying the law , he adds to the act itself a paragraph which , I believe , is unique : July , " And though we well know that this Assembly , elected by the people for the ordinary purposes of legislation only , have no power to restrain the acts of succeeding Assemblies , constituted with the power equal to our own , and that , therefore , to declare this act irrevocable would be of no effect in law , yet we are free to declare , and do declare , that the rights hereby asserted are of the natural rights of mankind ; and that if any act shall be hereafter passed to repeal the present or to narrow its operation , such act will be an infringement of natural right . " Never , perhaps , since the earliest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a country 's laws and institutions as Jefferson 's with those of new-born Virginia . In this first month of October , 1776 , besides actually accomplishing much , he cut out work enough to keep the best heads of Virginia busy for ten years . It was he who drew the bill for establishing courts of law in the State , and for defining the powers , jurisdiction , and methods of each of them . It was he who caused the removal of the capital from Williamsburg to Richmond , thus originating the plan , since followed by nearly every State , of fixing the capital near the geographical centre , but remote from the centre of trade , capital , and fashion . It may have been best for Virginia , it was best for Virginia ; but it is not yet certain that a policy is sound which caused the city of Washington to come into being , and which has given a fictitious importance to twenty Harrisburgs and Albanys , besides affording to official misconduct the convenient cloak of distance . Little , however , could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the teeth of the old Tory families planted in the ancient capital , he carried the day for the village of Richmond , and served on the committee that laid out its public square , and placed its unfortunate public buildings . Another bill introduced by him in this most fruitful month has produced consequences far-reaching and momen Y*'fferson a Reformer of Old Virginia . // tous . It was a bill fixing the terms upon which foreigners should be admitted to citizenship in Virginia : Two years ' residence ; a declaration of intention to live in the State , and a promise of . fidelity to it ; minor children of naturalized parents , and minors without parents in the State , to become citizens on coming of age , without any legal formality . The principle of this bill and most of its details have been adopted by the national government . In the light of the experience of eightyfive years , and writing on Manhattan Island , we can still say , that the principle of admitting foreigners to citizenship on easy terms , and after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country 's growth ; and that Jefferson 's bill lacked but one brief clause to make it as safe as it has been powerful : Provided , That the foreigner aforesaid proves , to the satisfaction of the court , that he can read English well enough to be independent of all other men in acquiring the political information requisite for intelligent votinct " Alas ! he did not foresee the Manhattan Island of 1871 ; nor had a mind yet been created capable of conceiving the idea of admitting to the suffrage hordes of ignorant negroes without the least preliminary preparation . The laws of Virginia were a chaos of obsolete and antiquated enactments , good for lawyers , bad for clients . Jefferson brought in a bill , in October , 1776 , proposing that the House name a committee of five , who should get together the whole mass , revise them , and present for the consideration of the House a Body of Law suited to the altered times and circumstances of the State . The bill being passed , the five revisers were elected by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; his colleagues being Edmund Pendleton , George Wythe , George Mason , and T. L. Lee . The two last named , not being lawyers , soon withdrew from the commission , leaving the three others to do the work ; Jefferson 's portion of which occupied the leisure of two years . It was , indeed , 43 one of the most arduous and difficult labors of his life ; for to him was assig&amp;ed the revision of ancient British law , from the remotest period to the meeting of the first House of Burgesses of Virginia , of which his great-grandfather had been a member , in 1619 . Many a long journey it cost these three public-souled gentlemen to get together , in order to discuss principles and compare work ; until , in 1779 , the revisers were able to present their labors to the Legislature in the convenient form of one hundred and twenty-six bills , to be separately acted upon . These bills were taken up one at a time , as occasion favored or demanded , during the next six or seven years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most persistent and persuasive advocate in James Madison . Jefferson 's part in this revision was most important . The bill for religious freedom , already described , was now completed in the form in which it was finally acted upon in 1786 . Against the opposition of Pendleton he carried the extirpation of the principle of primogeniture from the legal system of Virginia . True to his character , Pendleton strove , when the main battle was lost , to save something from the wreck ; proposing that the eldest son should , at least , have a double portion . No , said Jefferson ; " if the eldest son could eat twice as much , or do double work , it might be a natural evidence of his right to a double portion ; but , being on a par in his powers and wants with his brothers and sisters , he should be on a par also in the partition of his patrimony . " Against Pendleton , too , Mr. Jefferson prevailed to preserve as much of the letter of ancient law as possible , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by judicial decisions . A new code , Mr. Jefferson thought , owing to the imp affection of human language , would " involve us in ages of litigation , " until the precise meaning of every word had been settled by decisions and .7efferson a Reformer of Old Virginia . // commentaries . But this did not apply to modern Virginia statutes , which , he thought , should be reduced to the utmost simplicity and directness . It is pleasing to notice how cordially the revisers labored together , and how entirely they confided in one another , though differing in opinion . Observe this evidence of it in one of Jefferson 's later letters : " We found " ( on the final revision ) " that Mr. Pendleton had not exactly seized the intentions of the committee , which were to reform the language of the Virginia laws and reduce the matter , to a simple style and form . He had copied . the acts verbatim , only omitting what was disapproved ; and some family occurrence calling him indispensably home , he desired Mr. Wythe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be , and authorized us to report him as concurring in the work . " The bill assigning pains and penalties cost Jefferson much research and thought . The committee swept away at once most of the obsolete cruelties of the ancient code , but some of the revisers were disposed to retain portions of the old system of retaliation : an eye for an eye , a tooth for a tooth , a poisoner to die by poison , and a maimer to be maimed . Jefferson objected . The infliction of such penalties , he thought , would " exhibit spectacles " the moral effect of which would not be salutary ; particularly ( he might have added ) in a State where every free fight was expected to end in gouging . This part of the scheme was , at his suggestion , reconsidered ; so that no sheriff in Virginia has ever been called upon to pry out an eye or bite off a nose . One of Jefferson 's substitutions of new sense for ancient folly in the penalties bill was admirable . Instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " All attempts to delude the people , or to abuse their understanding by exercise of the pretended arts of witchcraft , conjuration , enchantment , or sorcery , or by pretended prophecies , shall be punished by ducking and whipping , at the discretion of a jury , not exceeding fifteen stripes . " He dropped also the barbarous Jewish penalties for unnatural crimes , on this ground : " Bestiality will ever be properly and severely punished by universal derision . " In his preamble to the bill assigning penalties , he asserted doctrines many years in advance of the least monstrous code then existing . At a time when France condemned to death a female servant who stole a spoon , and London saw cartloads of lads drawn to Tyburn for theft , Jefferson began this act by declaring that " cruel and sanguinary laws defeat their own purpose by engaging the benevolence of mankind to withhold prosecution , " and that " capital punishments , which exterminate instead of reforming , should be the last melancholy resource against those whose existence has become inconsistent with the safety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crimes were capital but murder and treason ; and only an overt act was to be accounted treason . Of the bills drawn by Jefferson , those upon which he most set his heart failed utterly . Only a commonwealth of Jeffersons , Masons , Madisons , and Wythes could have carried into successful operation that magnificent scheme of universal education , embodied in three of the acts drawn by him . He loved knowledge . He loved literature . Writing to Dr. Priestly , in the midst of one of the political frenzies of a later day , he said : " I thank on my knees Him who directed my early education for having put into my possession this rich source of delight , " the ability to read Homer in the original ; and , during a similar paroxysm of political fury , he wrote to a neighbor , that if anything could induce him to sleep another night away from homes it would be his solicitude for the education of youth . He felt that a community needs the whole of the superior intelligence produced in it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good purposes by right culture . His // plan , therefore , embraced the whole intellect of the State . He proposed to place a common school within reach of every child ; to make a high school accessible to every superior youth ; to convert William and Mary College into a university ; and to found at Richmond a State library to be maintained at a cost of two thousand pounds a year . The whole scheme , which was worked out in great detail , was received , he says , with enthusiasm ; but when after the war the expense had to be faced , there was not public spirit enough in the counties to set even the common schools in operation . The scheme failed because there was no middle class in Virginia . In his bill for establishing common schools , a clause was slyly inserted leaving each county free to tax itself for the purpose or not , as the tax-payers should decide . But the tax-payers were planters , served by slaves , not accustomed to regard white trash as fellow*citizens whose welfare was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the education of the children of tobacco-rollers , and the plan remained inoperative during Jefferson 's whole life . A remarkable feature of the laws drawn by him during this revision are the preambles - compact , loaded with meaning - with which he prefaced many of them . I think he must have derived the idea from Plato . In preparing himself for work so important , he could not have overlooked the fact that Plato 's longest work is entitled LAWS ; nor would he have failed to seek light and suggestion from so promising a source . " And is our legislator , " asks the chief person of this Dialogue , " to have no preface to his laws , but to say at once , Do this , avoid that ; and then , holding the penalty in lerrorem , to go on to another law ; offering never a word of advice or exhortation to those for whom he is legislating , after the manner of some doctors ? " Not so , he thinks . Music has overtures , and discourse its introduction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Virginia . 45 tones and higher strain of law , no one has ever yet uttered any prelude . " And Plato recurs to the topic , as though it were a favorite idea. * I please myself with thinking that it was such passages of the kindred Greek that induced Jefferson to compose those noble preambles - noble , even when preluding laws too difficult for the time and scene - which illuminate Virginia law-books here and there . The preamble to the Act for establishing Religious Freedom is the weightiest and finest . It touches every point ; it all but exhausts the subject . The slave laws remained to be considered . The revisers , first of all , made a digest of existing laws concerning slaves and slavery , silently dropping such as they deemed inadmissible , and arranging the rest , as was their custom , in the form of a bill . This bill , since it contained nothing novel , nor excluded anything vital , could be expected to pass without opposition . The whole difficulty of the subject they resolved to keep by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill , designing to present this when the times should admit of the discussion of fundamental changes . The shade of noble , unpractical Plato must have hovered over the place where this amendment was penned . The community has never existed capable of executing such a scheme . These three benevolent revisers demanded of Virginia a degree of self-control , far-seeing wisdom , and executive genius which a community composed of the elect of the whole human race could not have furnished . All slaves born after the passage of the act were to be free , but they were to remain with their parents during childhood ; then educated at the public expense , " in tillage , arts , or sciences , according to their geniuses , " until maturity ; when they were to be colonized in some convenient place , furnished with arms , implements , and seeds , declared independent , and protected till they were strong enough to * Jowett 's Plato , Vol .

" Such ludicrous impossibilities may the wisest of mortals conceive who legislate in the snug retreat of a library , for out-of-door , every-day men , face to face with the universal task ! No enthusiast ever ventured to introduce this amendment into the Legislature . " It was found , " wrote Mr. Jefferson in 1821 , " that the public mind would not bear the proposition , nor will it bear it even at this day . " One thing Jefferson did accomplish . In 1778 he brouc*ht in a bill forbidding the further importation of slaves , which was passed without opposition . This was the only important change which was made in the slave system of Virginia during the Revolutionary period . During the two years employed in the work of revising the laws , there were four or five sessions of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry was immense . We find him on numberless committees , and reporting every kind of bill ; even such as related to the discipline of the militia , the rank of marine officers , and the subsistence of members of Congress . There was no great merit then in punctuality of attendance , for punctuality was compelled . At the calling of the roll on the opening of one session , fifty members were absent . Every man of them was ordered under arrest ; nor was one excused until he had risen in his place and stated the reason of his absence . If the reason was accounted sufficient , he was excused without paying the costs of his arrest ; if not , he had to pay them . Many and swift journeys fell to Jefferson 's lot during this absorbing time , - to Fredericksburg to meet his brother revisers , a rough ride of a hundred and twenty miles ; to Williamsburg , for the semiannual session ; back suddenly to Monticello , more than once , to attend his sick wife . His only son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seventeen days , though causing his parents many a month of anguish and solicitude . But . at home , while the lives of mother and child seemed to hang upon the father 's care , in the intervals of watching , he worked at his part of the revision . He told Dr. Franklin , in August , 1777 , that the people of Virginia had laid aside the monarchical , and taken up the republican government " with as much ease as would have attended their throwing off an old and putting on a new suit of clothes . " It was easy to the people of Virginia , because , at this critical time , they were so happy as to possess a few able , experienced , learned , liberal-minded citizens , who thought no labor severe , no self-denial excessive , if exercised in the service of their country . So passed the first years of the war . It was an anxious time , of course , to all patriotic hearts , but , to the people of Virginia , not so unhappy a period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Early rid of the nuisance of Dunmore 's hateful presence , they had not , since the burning of Norfolk , witnessed much of the desolations of the war ; and if their spirits were depressed sometimes by the mishaps of the armies in the North , good news came occasionally , and came magnified by the distance it had travelled . The rapturous tidings of Burgoyne 's surrender was enough of itself to light up half a year , and it was followed by news supposed to be even more important : that of the alliance with France . Virginia was to have her turn , but the , time had not yet come . Jefferson , too , was to experience a most ample share of the bitterness of the war . But , during these first three years of it , absorbed in congenial and elevated labors , happy in the confiding love of the people he served , blest at home in wife and children , he lived very much in his accustomed way still finding time to record the weather , watch the barometer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force of the wind , study the growth of plants , and caress the violin . He began now to look forward fondly , as so many fond parents have , to the time when his eldest daughter would play the harpsichord , to his accompaniment . His old teacher of the violin , Alberti , was in Paris in 1778 . Jefferson wrote him a gay letter , after Burgoyne 's surrender , telling him that Americans had lost all apprehensions touching the issue of the war , and he expected to trouble him , within the next two and three years , to send him over a professor competent to teach singing and the harpsichord . Nay , more ; he had indulged dreams of a domestic band of music He told Alberti that , in his retinue of ' domestic servants , he kept a weaver , a gardener , a cabinet-maker , and a stone-cutter , to whom he meant to add a vine-dresser . Why could not Alberti send him Europeans of these trades , who could also play on instruments ? If he could , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going " beyond the bounds of an American fortune ! " Music , he said , was " the favorite passion of his soul , " and yet fortune had cast his lot in a country where it was in a state of " deplorable barbarism . " In the same joyous and triumphant summer of 1778 , failing to get much good from the eagerly expected and closely observed eclipse of the sun , from want of an accurate clock , he ordered from Rittenhouse the most perfect clock his art could produce , so as to be ready for the next . As to that theodolite of which he had spoken to him in Philadelphia , Mr. Rittenhouse need not trouble himself about it further , for he had since bought one which was just the thing . A British army captured , and the French alliance avowed , who could expect a much longer continuance of the war ? Not Jefferson , most sanguine of men . The surrender of Burgoyne brought unexpected animation to the neighborhood of Monticello , and filled the house upon its summit with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Old Virgiuia. 47 the wheat-field of America , yet too remote from the Northern Army to contribute to its supply , Congress deemed it best , in the winter of 1778-79 , to march thither the prisoners of war , English and German , four thousand in number , and establish them near Charlottesville . It was a dreary and weary march , in an inclement season , from Boston to Albemarle , a distance of seven hundred miles ; and when the troops reached the plateau selected for them , within sight of Monticello , the barracks were unfinished , no store of food had been gathered , the roads were almost impassable , and " the spell of weather , " as Jefferson records , " was the worst ever known within the memory of man . " The gentlemen of the county did their utmost to mitigate the situation ; and who so prompt with needful aid as the inhabitants of Monticello ? Mrs. Jefferson lent her help to the wife of the Hessian General Riedesel in getting her started in housekeeping , at the house of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home to Tuscany on a public errand . Jefferson himself was lavish of attention to officers and men of both nationalities ; and , when they were all settled in quarters , threw open his house , his library , his grounds , his garden , to such of them as could enjoy refined pleasures . There could be no lack of officers , among so many , who could play and sing . Many a delightful concert was improvised at Monticello , when some amateur would play violin duets with Jefferson , and the whole company surround Mrs. Jefferson 's harpsichord , and join her in singing . A tradition of these pleasant musical evenings lives to this day . General Dix of New York , as Mr. Randall reports , heard them described by a Captain Bibby , who settled in New York after the war . This captain , himself a good violinist , played many a duet with Jefferson , and considered him the best amateur he had ever heard . A German officer of scientific tastes was much in the library of Monticello , a congenial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commander of the English troops , whom Jefferson describes as the proudest man of the proudest nation on earth , was not proof against his resolute civilities . " The great cause that divides our countries , " Jefferson wrote to the General , " is not to be decided by individual animosities . The harmony of private societies can not weaken national efforts . To contribute by neighborly intercourse and attention to make others happy , is the shortest and surest way of being happy ourselves . " General Phillips , proud as he may have been , seems to have assented to this opinion , for we find him writing to Mr. Jefferson in August , 1779 : " The British officers intend to perform a play next Saturday at the barracks . I shall be extremely happy to have the honor to attend you and Mrs. Jefferson in my box at the theatre , should you or that lady be inclined to go . " * In winding up this polite epistle , the haughty son of Albion was careful to say that he was , " with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ servant . He was the gentleman who , at a later day , addressed Mr. Jefferson as " Thomas Jefferson , Esquire , American Governor of Virginia , " and the Governor retorted by addressing him as , " William Phillips , Esquire , commanding the British troops in Virginia . " As the spring advanced , the barracks began to exhibit a truly inviting scene , particularly the quarter occupied by the Germans . The officers , who had hired every available house in the neighborhood , bought cows , sheep , and chickens , cultivated fields , and laid out gardens . If some of the decorous Virginia ladies were a little scandalized at the Amazonian habits of Madame Riedesel , who rode astride with the boldness of a fox-hunter , every one commended the liberality of the general toward his men . He distributed among them two hundred pounds ' worth of seeds ; and soon the whole region round the barracks was smiling with pretty gardens , * Lossing 's American Historical Record , Vol . I. p.33 . July , and alive with cheerful laborers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the idea of a company of farmers , rather than a camp of soldiers . " Some of the officers went to great expense in preparing their houses , even to several thousands of ' dollars . The health of these troops , thus agreeably situated and pleasantly employed , improved in the most remarkable manner . According to the ordinary rate of mortality , there should have been one death a day ; but in three months there were but four deaths among them , an dtwo of those were of infants . Jefferson wrote in reference to this enchanting scene : " It is for the benefit of mankind to mitigate the horrors of war as much as possible . The practice , therefore , of modern nations , of treating captive enemies with politeness and generosity , is not only delightful in contemplation , but really interesting to all the world , friends , foes , and neutrals . " It is pleasing to reflect that the United States , from the first hour of its existence to the present time , in every instance , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wars , has treated captives with " politeness and generosity . " The prisoners might well be grateful to Jefferson , for he rendered them a greater service than neighborly attention . A panic fear arose that these four thousand foreign mouths would eat Virginia out of house and home . A famine was dreaded , and Governor Henry was inundated with remonstrances against their longer stay . By the time the barracks were in order , the gardens laid out , and General Riedesel 's two hundred pounds ' worth of garden seeds all nicely " come up , " a terrible rumor ran through the camp , that the governor had yielded to pressure , and was about to order them away . It was Jefferson who interposed in their behalf . He wrote a most vigorous and elaborate statement of the case to Governor Henry , showing the utter groundlessness of the panic , describing the happy situation Yefferson a Reformer of Old Virginia . // 49 of the troops after their winter march of seven hundred miles , and exhibiting the cruel breach of faith it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . T he prisoners ' camp was not disturbed , and the Virginians discovered that , if the prisoners ate a good deal of wheat and beef , they circulated a great many gold and silver coins . What strikes me as peculiar in Jefferson 's letter is its extreme politeness . Thomas Jefferson and Patrick Henry had been friends , comrades , fello*vlodgers , partisans , everything that was intimate and confidential , for nineteen years ; but in this letter he keeps in mind that he is a Member for Albemarle writing to his Excellency the Governor of Virginia , and he both begins and ends his epistle with expressions of deference and apology , lie " takes the liberty of troubling " the governor with some observations on the subject . The reputation and interest of the country being involved , " it could hardly be deemed an indecent liberty in the most private citizen to offer his thoughts to the consideration of the executive " ; and there were particular reasons which justified him in so doing , such as his residence near the barracks , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his being sure , from his personal acquaintance with the governor and Council , that they would be " glad of information from any quarter on a subject interesting to the public . " Then , at the end of his letter , after an argument apparently complete and unanswerable , he was " sensible that the same subject might appear to different persons in very different lights . " But he hoped that the reasons he had urged , even though to sounder minds they should seem fallacious , would , at least . be plausible enough to excuse his interposition . There was a reason for this extr'eme delicacy . The letter was written in March , 1779 . The third year of Patrick Henry 's governorship would expire in June , and , by the new Constitution , a governor was ineligible after the third term . Jefferson was to succeed him ; and it is always a delicate thing for an heir to say or do anything that savors of interference with the management of the estate .
