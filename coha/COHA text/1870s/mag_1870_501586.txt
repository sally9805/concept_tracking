A WERE my readers to interpret the leading heading to this article strictly in the present tense , concluding that there do exist at this moment institutions worthy of this appellation , they would be led astray . My object is to set them right both as to the present and future , for reasons which will appear as we proceed . As yet , America has put forward no claim , in a national sense , to museums , or even a school of art . Nevertheless , from time to time some aesthetic seeds have been sown by the wayside , which have sprung up into scattered plants that will repay systematic culture . Artists must precede schools of art ; taste and knowledge , museums and galleries , on the principle of demand and supply ; although subsequently the supply reacts on and enlarges the demand . In Europe , museums and schools of art organized on a popular basis to instruct the public at large , chronologically and scientifically arranged , are of recent origin . Until within the lifetime of the living generation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capricious gath. erings of royal and aristocratic patrons , seldom well instructed , or actuated by a higher motive than princely ostentation . Consequently , there was in them no historical sequence , nor did they furnish adequate means to study the development of art at any fixed period ; while much less were they collected with a view of ministering to the happiness and refinement of the subjects of their founders , however much individual artists may have been petted by them . Still the world is largely indebted to defunct royalty for thus securely placing in their palaces precious works , which otherwise might have perished or been obscured in private hands . But even in exhibiting pictures and sculptures that gratified royal pride to possess , less attention was shown to displaying their merits as works of art by placing them in the most favorable conditions , than to making them play the secondary part of decorations to sumptuous halls , such as we see in the Pitti and other Italian palaces , in which both the light and general arrangement are very bad , or in confused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but originally designed for a different purpose , like those of the Uffizi in Florence , and the Luxembourg and Louvre at Paris . Fifty years ago all galleries were of a similar character . Besides being badly hung and intermixed as to schools and styles , so that their finest aesthetic effects were not to be perceived , and the spectator 's mind was confused in regard to dates , methods , and motives-inharmony existing where only harmony should reignpictures were subjected to periodical scrubbings and repaintings , sometimes ignorantly done with good intentions , but not unseldom as profitable jobs secured by crafty restorers , heedless of the mischief they did to art itself and the reputations of the old masters . Considerable confusion also was allowed to exist as to the attributions of paintings and marbles , the identical object being baptized and rebaptized according to the shifting assumptions of the hour , . based on the opinions of interested persons or shallow amateurship , instead of being subjected to the critical acumen of professional judges . Indeed , the chronological and historical study of art , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principles as well as particular technical facts , is a science of our own day ; one yet in its infancy . With it there is growing up a oublic and private conscience // 1870. 5 ' in these matters which aspires to get at the exact truth , less to do homage to names or further exalt distinguished reputations than to mete out justice to each artist and period , to elevate art itself to the level of a serious study , and to enlighten the public . Slowly the older galleries of Europe are being subjected to the reforming demands of this fresher spirit , while the newer museums of South Kensington , London , Berlin , and Munich are directly organized more or less in accordance with its enlightened requirements . Those best known to Americans are the English . Fortunately , they are models from which we can borrow many organic features greatly to our own advantage , besides the examples they exhibit of how much that is precious in art , despite some blunders , can be secured even at this late hour by a liberal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in purchasing ; while the general arrangement , supervision , and cataloguing of the objects themselves for study , place England in the foremost rank as a practical conservator and popular teacher of art . And this is wholly due to an established class of cultivated amateurs , owning private collections in all departments , such as do not yet exist in America , though one is just now forming . England actually precedes America a century in this matter , counting from the period when her present distinctive school began to appear . As it has occurred in England , so in America artists and amateurs must precede institutions of art , by force of their organic laws . Therefore , if we had no other positive indications of the former besides the public recognition of the uses and merits of museums , this fact alone would indicate the growing existence of those classes to whom the masses must necessarily turn for aesthetic entertainment and instruction . In fact , America has now several artists of a certain eminence in their respective spheres , mostly of a realistic tendency , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number who aspire to embody ideas in preference to merely portraying facts ; or else who attempt to incarnate in material forms their own sentiments and thoughts . Feeling , however , is the exception , not the rule , of American art . There are considerable fancy and a certain rude adroitness of composition , as in its literature , aiming at the particular and special rather than file broad and general . We are yet too young in art to have inspired it with those profound emotions and convictions which distinguish its highest flights in the Old World , or to have acquired other than a superficial knowledge of its history , methods , and purposes . Our great art lies latent in that future , the full character of which no one yet foresees . When and how it may be born time only will disclose . Now , I desire simply to take cognizance of the actual facts of to-day , as the seedlings of the projected institutions which are to guide us in our attempt to realize in art something commensurate to our political and commercial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our landscape painters , representative artists in their sphere-Church , Bradford , and Bierstadt-have become known in England by the exhibition of their principal works . They fairly represent the general spirit , style , and ambition of the material school of which they are the chiefs ; a school which is animated by the prevailing desire of the people at large to achieve something striking in mechanical execution and spectacular sensation ; something which in conception is really novel and grand ; effective on first view , though in substance wanting the positive merit that comes only of consummate knowledge and skill . As a nation , we are inclined to discount our progress before it is really accomplished , and are impatient to get gain and glory before we have deserved them . This national haste to reap harvests before they are fully grown , gives to oui current art // a rhetorical aspect , imposing on the first glance . It is not destitute of good qualities and substantial merits , especially as regards topographical exactitude in illustrating the physical landscape in its most prominent features ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a mental childhood , and eagerness to possess before winning the more solid prizes of life . Our sculpture , as a whole , displays the same intellectual and technical crudity of inception and execution , with similar imposing defects of style and composition , governed as it is more by a desire of fame and riches than by the love of art itself . It is a national misfortune that the men of the most pretence and least real ability dominate the public taste , and make their ideas and works pass as current coin with the masses . The sole way of escape out of this land of bondage is by a training which shall teach the public how to discriminate between the permanent and ephemeral , profound and shallow , true and counterfeit , in everything affecting their aesthetic enjoyment and moral well-being . Now , with all due gratitude to those popular artists who have made art a household object to the million , who otherwise might have gone to their graves unknowing and indifferent to it in any shape , it is no wrong to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation may become at once a better judge and patron . Before Powers , Palmer , Rogers , and their school became the popular favorites in sculpture , and Church , Bierstadt , and their followers , in painting , there were both sculptors and painters of superior mental calibre , though less widely known ; incomplete artists in execution , but complete in feeling ; and even now exercising over cultivated minds , because of their sincerity and devotion , and of the earnestness of their work , an influence which their more worldly-minded successors are never likely to possess . Stuart , Cole , Allston , Horatio Greenough , and Crawford came to us before we were prepared to accept and get from them their best , or let it teach us all it might ; so that both these artists and the nation , as regards art , were only mutually groping their way to a clearer understanding of each other and their common subject in the dark , as compared with present opportunities . In their time there was no popular comprehension or desire of artistic education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wielding no slight intellectual power in society , although not so much as is their due . This is a great step forward ; the chief one preparatory to the greater of establishing public galleries and museums , which , by providing adequate sources of comparison and instruction , will enable the people better to decide on the relative merits of artists and schools of art , and thus do fuller justice to their teachers and themselves . These institutions , also , will put greater heart into the young blood of the American school , perceiving that an authoritative tribunal and triumph are secured to those who achieve the right to posthumous entrance , not to mention honors while living . Our best men hitherto have failed quite as much from want of this sort of hope of a final haven of rest in their labors , as from the absence of an immediate stimulus to labor . Indeed , until we possess ample resources of instruction and incitements to ambition of the character of the great institutions of art in Europe , it is hopeless to expect the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not yet an art-loving people , and without a deep-seated passion for the beautiful in the popular mind there can be no great development of art . Having said thus much about what we have not , a few words in regard to what we have in hand in our youthful aesthetic constitution may afford some encouragement to the workers in the good cause . As the songs of birds proclaim the coming spring , so does the increasing number of young artists of actual // promise announce that the budding season of our national art is nigh at hand . But we must do as much for them as we do for the birds-provide the nests in which their offspring may be sheltered and reared until strong of wing themselves . The best ambition and talents are of small avail without means to train them to effective technical handicraft or a matured exercise of their highest powers . We have abundant talent , and are not without some evidence of genius in this direction . But both are now more fettered or crippled by want of opportunity for serious study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ' so , although inclined to a liberal expenditure for art , are not sufficiently educated to decide on the quality of purchases to discriminate between honest art and its showy substitute ; and they can not be until they secure for themselves at home the necessary means of comparing what they buy with works of acknowledged merit in great galleries . When this is accomplished , the unfledged amateurs who now flood America with worthless copies of old masters , or garish , ill-designed originals , because they are " so cheap , " will cease to be of am4hority as judges of art , to the detriment of the taste of the nation . The young artists also , instead of becoming content to repose on a few easilywon laurels , repeating themselves without advancing , will be put on their mettle to rival real masters , old and new , besides being fired by that sympathy with genius which is sure to show itself whenever there is any aesthetic bottom in* common . Death has recently robbed the country og perhaps , its most promising landscapist , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rare native gifts . Unhappily , his physical strength was not equal to his zeal and knowledge . But his intuitive perception of nature , possessing himself at a glance of her aesthetic secrets and best moods , joined to forcible design ; firm painting , deep harmony of coloring , intense application , and a quick insight into the merits of other systems and periods , tended to place him in the foremost rank of 1andscapi*ts of any school . His work was thoroughly realistic in form and character , vigorous with the life of nature itself independent of though in harmony with , man 's owa works  --  a strong objective art . There exist simple sketches and studies of his which contain more general and particular truths of nature , enriched by the pure feeling and sentiment that bespeak a head and heart alive to her best outward conditions-as , for instance , those beauties of form , hue , tone , and arrangement in one composition which are independent of any introspective interpretation of her divine spirit by the imagination , or an overruling creative will in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canvasses of the more pretentious realists of the Bierstadt sort . He impressed not so much the fancy or imagination as the senses and the intellect in general , chiefly by intense , firm coloring , truthful , positive design , and fine choice of subject-matter , repeating nature s features in their most charming aspects ; following no school or system other than the closest observation of the landscape itself . Hotchkiss was an artist in every fibre of his being and will ; shirking no labor and evading no difficulty by cunning subterfuges of pencil or palette , as is too common with those who seek to reap what they have not sown . To the last he was a strong learner , steadily improving in details and touch , and constantly giving hints of power in reserve for superior efforts . He lived so absorbed in his work that but few individuals had the opportunity to know his rare ability , and died just as it was maturing to a point that would have placed him at the very head of the American landscapists of his class . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than the absolute forms of nature , stands equally high on the opposite pole of art . 4 // The distance in perfection of color and design between Inness and Hotchkiss and the earlier landscapists-Doughty , Durand , and Cole-although confined in time to a single generation , is really as great in true progress as has occurred in the old schools in a century . Neither of the former dodges technical difficulties , or attempts to substitute for the actual the appearance or shadows of things , as if nature was only seen in confused dreams and poetical or sensuous reveries , with outlines lost , forms undefined , and colors dazed , according to the Tilton theory of painting ; a deceptive suggestion of realities taking the place of their truthful representation  --  a practice which leaves so much scope of disguise to feebleness of hand , perception , and thought ; but both paint with unmistakable force and fidelity , according to the habit of the old masters . However spiritual their motives , their work is boldly material and clear in design and hue . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American school that the manly , straightforward , honest system of study and labor , in art as in character , is the very best for effective results . In following it out , he has likewise shown us that there exist in our race as sound elements of substantial progress as in any other . John La Farge , of New York , although hampered by ill health , is another conspicuous example of rare attainments in painting . He is as essentially spiritualistic in feeling as Hotchkiss was realistic . With him the divinity within objects-their animating principle-speaks out , reminding the beholder more of the existence of another and higher sphere of life than the present . A flower painted by him bears the same relation to the real plant that an angel of Fra Angelico does to The actual man . It is an exhibition of its highest possibilities of being rather than of its present material organization . However beautiful this may seem to the eye , La Farge makes his subject present a still more subtle beauty to the mind , which finds in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This phase of art is rare in any school . Possessing a keen analytical intellect and sturdy imagination , detective of the hidden springs of thought and passion , pure in expression of character , Elihu Vedder , now in Rome , requires only a certain amount of outward pressure and concentration of will to cause him to rise to eminence in a brief period . But he needs a cultivated audience to adequately comprehend and enjoy his favorite motives , as well as a critical one to spur him to continuous exertion and restrain his fancy from running too wild . He has the same acute observation of the landscape , joined to an equally firm , positive method of painting , as Hotckkiss had ; although , unlike him , instead of making the landscape the sole aim of his art , he uses it only as a background or means of expression of human emotions or of reflecting the supernal passions which he delights to evoke from it . His insight into the heart of man and nature is highly poetical , with a tendency to the weird @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , imbued with a nice sense of wit , than any other American painter I know . In general , his motives are of a highly intellectual character , and cover a wide range of topics , varying from an absolutely realistic treatment to the grotesque , supernal , abstract , and sentimental-which last , however , is almost always sure to possess a delicate touch of the humorous . At times he resembles Blake in facility of abnormal invention , hut never , like him , is he religious in feeling . Blake believes in and sees the Jiosts of superior worlds , heavens and hells . Vedder projects them out of his own brain as curious inventions to perplex , amuse , or astonish the spectator . With him there is no personal Godhead or celestial hierarchy , other than what man creates for himself . His art recognizes an infinite spirit in the universe , // 55 neither absolutely good nor evil , but of the nature of a causative force which bewilders rather than enlightens and protects mankind , assuming shapes dictated by his roving imagination . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coarse , sensual , or mocking , but notably elfin-like , subtly quaint , profoundly mysterious and solemn ; a medley of pagan , classical , and the Teutonic pantheistic visions , forcing their old forms into new moulds of no less intense signification . LaFarge 's sensitiveness to the unseen life of the universe , being entirely Christian in sentiment , presents a striking contrast to Vedder 's , which roams through space and the infinite in quest of subject-matter , without other aim than to give liberty to pent-up ideas which crowd for utterance . Unfortunately for his own fame and that of the school , he fails to do that complete justice to both which he might were he to apply himself to his art with the assiduity it calls for . Indeed , were I limited to actual performances of great Works , published to the world at large , by either of the three young artists just sketched , I should be forced to keep silence . I speak , therefore , of their artistic promise rather than of its positive fulfilment . Vedder may never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already indicated . But it is the duty of the American public to bring to bear on him all possible pressure to induce him to work persistently . Each of them has done enough which has come under my own observation to warrant my placing them among the most hopeful symptoms of our future art . If the next generation produces a relative number of artists who shall show as great an advance over these three as they have shown over their immediate predecessors , America may then take a secure position in the art of the world , provided that the new genius will resolutely discipline itself by systematic study and labor . I might cite more examples of original cleverness and varied talents , like those of Whistler , William Hunt , the sculptors Ward and Brown , and a score of other men , now winning local if not European renown ; but enough have been cited to establish the fact that our artists , as well as our public , are now ready to welcome and help sustain museums of art , because they imperatively require them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a profession which has become an integral part of the national education , as well as the nation 's most important and prolific source of enjoyment . We must look also at our standing as regards amateurs and scholars , to see if we as a people are equally ripe for these institutions ; for their immediate organization and support will depend more on the students arid connoisseurs of art than on the artists themselves or the general public . In America , where every initiative in education must be taken by individuals , it is absolutely certain that no steps to advance any branch of learning ever will be undertaken until there are to be found a sufficient number of persons of wealth and aesthetic culture willing to assume for the public the duty which it really owes to itself to do at once and thoroughly . Have we at this juncture enough of such disinterested individuals , of sufficient property and the right sort of training ? Unlike the founding of scientific institutions , experience proves that wealth and culture must be united in the same person to effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a college , institute of technology , or museum of natural history , on the general principle of their usefulness , or for religious seminaries , without comprehending specifically anything of their studies or doctrines . A distinguished banker of Boston takes Professor Agas siz 's word for it , that it is important to the world of science to know what reptiles and fishes exist in the waters of the Amazon , and hands him a check for an unlimited amount // to fit out an exploring expedition to catch them and put them into bottles for the inspection of his students . The hard-headed legislators of Massachusetts are convinced on abstract grounds , by the same learned scientist , that it is expedient for the promotion of natural science to vote liberal sums to erect buildings in which to catalogue and exhibit the fossil remains and more recent specimens of the animal kingdom , which not one individual in a hundred goes to see , and still fewer comprehend or are entertained in seeing . I do not say this in disparagement of these studies , which are regarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , but simply to recall the fact to those most interested in the latter that it is far easier , in the present mental disposition of men of wealth , to collect funds for museums oT natural than of artistic objects , although the one has only a limited interest for the people at large , while the other is attractive to everybody . It is curious and instructive to retrace the geological history of the earth , by suites of fossils and minerals , out of primitive chaos through infinite ages down to our own , and , by means of the contents of long files of glass jars and mounted skeletons , man 's own development from the first organic germ to his present imperfect b.eing ; but this study is limited to mere changes of matter , while that of art offers an exact chart of the progress of mind itself as it rules and shapes matter to its own volitions , or in obedience to those elementary forces which anticipate and create all material things . The one is the servant , the other the master @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creation , especially as seen preserved in alcohOl , are repulsive apart from their value to science . Neither is co mparative anatomy , in the shape of wired skeletons , very agreeable to the common eye . But a museum of painting and sculpture entertains and instructs every mind in some degree or other . Pictures and statues are human souls reflecting themselves in ours as by an enchantment of our senses . They mingle pleasure . with teaching by assuming those guises which are most seductive to tbe outward man , while depositing or awakening within us ideas and emotions that fructify into spiritual happiness . Art is the exquisitely-flavored fruit of the tree of life , which only to taste confers immortality . Descending from the higher to the minor arts of a museum , we find no less to gratify the eye and much to interest on account of their relation to the industrial welfare of the country . Yet such is the hardness of our hearts , the blindness of our vision , toward the highest , purest , and most complete of the sources of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while many musenms and schools of natural science have been founded and amply endowed , those of art exist only in name or in the minds of a few amateurs who , perceiving their importance in the progress of civilization , have just begun to obtain a public hearing to plead for their establishment . Providence , however , matures its best gifts slowest , keeping the richest treasure in hidden store until man is ready to give it welcome . So it is happening with art in America . The period of its advent approaching , we detect a simultaneous stir in various quarters in the brains of artists and amateurs widely apart , moved by a common impulse to accomplish a common end . Wealthy connoisseurs , who have hitherto collected for their own gratification , are now proffering their stores of art and knowledge as free gifts to the public , solicitous to enjoy while living some of that patriotic satisfaction which must ensue to every one on hearing " Well done , thou good and faithful servant of the Lord , " from the voices of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first amateur to erect a beautiful building , endow it with a fund , and make it over to the national Capital for purposes // of art , in charge of an intelligent board of trustees , whose duty it is to fill it and open it to the public . Mr. Peabody did the same for Baltimore not long before he passed away . In both instances the edifices have anticipated their contents , the value and usefulness of which will depend on the good judgment and aesthetic training of those to whom is confided the office of securing objects of art . Generous gifts have already been proffered . But with them begins the delicate task of discriminating between what is of real value for the ends in view , and works that would discredit museums and mislead students . Here comes in the need of competent experts , not merely in painting and sculpture , but in bronzes , metals , precious and common , glass , ceramic ware , majolica , porcelains , lacquer , enamels of all kinds , gems , medals , coins , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inlaid furniture , miniatures , missals , ivories-in fine , every branch of ancient and modern industry in which ornament plays the conspicuous part . No connoisseur can master the whole field of great and little arts . Nevertheless , each should be represented as completely as possible in a cosmopolitan museum . At the opportune moment , doubtless , the right persons to buy , arrange , and catalogue will be forthcoming . Indeed , our country can command at this moment more ability of this character than would appear possible on first thought . Naming only a few , Mr. August Belmont of New York has shown such a ripe taste in the selection of modern pictures for his private gallery as to indicate him as one of the aesthetic guides , combining wealth with culture , to whom the country will naturally turn at this juncture . Mr. James Lenox , of the same city , is a connoisseur in another department of approved efficiency , having collected rare works of art and books , which he has just given to New York , with an ample fund @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , many of the rich citizens themselves , by means of a committee of more than fifty of their number , including the chief amateurs and artists , are organizing a plan for a Metropolitan Art Museum on a comprehensive scale , intending to have it vie , as a practical school of art and complete gallery , with the best in Europe , so far as it is practica. ble at this day to secure for it fine original specimens of painting and sculpture of all countries , and systematic series of the minor arts of all epochs . If one be permitted to judge of the probable results of this undertaking by the enthusiastic spirit of the addresses made by New York 's most distinguished citizens , on the occasion of choosing the committee , it would seem that neither money nor energy will be wanting to make it the leading institution of America , and a formidable rival of all foreign ones in purchasing the most noteworthy objects that may come into the market . Apparently , the names of such committeemen and buy . ers of works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Roberts , James Lenox , A. T Stewart , R. L. Stuart , S. G. Ward , W. T. Blodgett and others of similar taste and fortunes-their collective wealth being not short of one hundred millions of dollars-are sufficient to warrant the sanguine expectations of the inaugurators of this movement , provided they speak by authority . It may prove difficult to secure the same unity of action as of purpose among so many chiefs . The public will watch their labors with deep interest . They have a greater guarantee of success , inasmuch as so many artist-amateurs like F. E. Church , R. M. Hunt , J. La Farge , W. J. Hoppin , D. Huntington , J. Q. A. Ward , and Russel Sturgis , Jr. , actively participate in them . If the necessary millions of dollars be forthcoming , there need be no failure from want of sufficient gui dance . Rumor states on good foundation that A. T. Stewart , by himself , has already devoted upward of one million dollars to erecting a fire-proof gallery in the Renaissance // style , which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' *New York . Mr Bryan , one of the few connoisseurs of the old masters , has already given his collection , valued at one hundred thousand dollars , consisting of several hundred examples of the French , German , Flemish , and Dutch schools , some of rare excellence , and interesting works of the early Italian , besides valuable specimens of American portraiture of the period of the Revolutionary war . The Historical Society , in whose museum it is now deposited , likewise owns a series of paintings and sculpture , chiefly American , which is intended as a nucleus for a great public gallery to be erected in Central Park , the right of location having been alreadj secured . But it would seem advisable to unite its resources with those of the Metropolitan Art Committee , and t4hus make a more complete museum and efficient organization than can be had by their separate and perhaps rival exertions . Although Washington , Baltimore , New York , New Haven , and even Chicago , may be said to have preceded Boston in their undertakings for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ erected buildings , or organized museums in embryo , while Boston had nothing to show except the feeble collection of antique casts , copies , and modern pictures belonging to its Athen*um-no merchant prince having come forward to imitate the example of Mr. Corcoran at Washington , Lenox and Stewart at New York , or Mr. Street at New Havenyet she proves to be behind none of her sisters in her convictions and intentions . Indeed , she carries away the palm of practical sagacity in quietly maturing a plan , which , if executed with similar intelligence and persistence to what is shown in her other departments of liberal education , will give her the real lead in aesthetic as in other branches of intellectual culture . Without notifying the public or exciting any discussion in the pewspapers , a plan of artistic training on the basis of collections and schools like the South Kensington has been put into shape by a few competent amateurs , who bid fair to do all the more for Boston because they possessThoth the culture and means requisite to carry it on to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people themselves as an established public institution . It is a decided advantage for the early stage of the Boston project that it is managed by a few individuals agreed on all substantial points , even if not so lavishly endowed with colossal fortunes as their 2esthetic rivals in New York . Nevertheless , funds have been secured for lieginning a building capable of meeting present wants , as well as a large lot of land in the heart of the city , sufficient to respond to all the requirements of 2 great museum ; a design for which , comprising all the modern improvements of lighting , heating , and wall surfaces , and means of artistically exhibiting both large and small objects according to their epochs and history , have been elabo. rated by Russel Sturgis , Jr. , who , besides his knowledge as an architect , has a connoisseur* s acquaintance with the arts themselves , and knows precisely what each department needs for its best accommodation . Unless an architect understands the specific requirements of each branch of art in an edifice of this character , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its intended purpose , however skilful and learned he may be in massing and decorating his building as a whole . The value of the land given to the city for its Art Museum is not less than five hundred thousand dollars . Boston is peculiarly fortunate in having among her citizens interested in this enterprise several prominent amateurs , whose experience and taste give it weight with the public , and inspire confidence in its success . Among these we find C. C. Perkins , whose works in Tuscan sculpture have gained him a Europeaa // 59 reputation ; the distinguished Senator and ardent lover of art , whose exertions to save Washington from being made altogether hideous by the periodical fits of madness of our legislators in ordering statues and pictures of incompetent artists deserve public recognition ; Mr. T. Appleton , who has recently give a the Tosti collection of engravings to the Public Library ; Mr. Louis Thier , who collected and catalogued the celebrated Gray collection bequeathed to Harvard College ; and other gentlemen of similar disposition . A charter for an Art Musuem based on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the same time , measures are initiated to supply the public schools with casts of the best antique and medieval sculpture . All this displays the earnest , intelligent work of sagacious thinkers ; a more serious desire to impart to the youth those principles and ideas that underlie noble work , and to make them familiar with its forms , than to glorify the originators or their city by a premature spasmodic effort , or a pretence of knowledge and feeling , having no sound basis in the hearts and minds of the population at large . As more books are read in Boston than in any other city by the masses , on account of the facility with which they are furnished by the city authorities , so her populaton may be the first to reap a harvest of aesthetic culture , owing to the simple plan of placing in the public schools casts and photographs of choice objects . If occasional verbal instruction likewise be given in the history and constitution of art by competent lecturers , it will prove a cogent refiner of manners , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ useful talent now wholly lost from want of an opportunity to declare itself . As this grateful task of making a practical beginning of instructing the pupils of the city in aesthetic knowledge has fallen into the proper hands , we may hope shortly to witness such beneficial results as will prompt to its rapid extension and enlargement of scope . Although , as I declared in the beginning of this article , we can not speak of art museums as matters of fact in America , yet it is evident their day is nigh at hand . The public wish them ; earnest men are laboring to found them ; and there is an adequate number of artists and amateurs to meet the immediate requirements of their organization . The future supply of competent acquirements to respond to an enlarged demand is simply a question of the very aesthetic training which the institutions themselves will provide . There is no substantial reason for doubting that our cities can have at their option museums which shall compare favorably in general utility and value of contents with those recently organized in Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the amount in money and the value of the objects already given for this purpose within a brief period must astonish those who have not considered them . The Corcoran and Peabody gifts at Washington and Baltimore exceed one million dollars ; the Lenox at New York half as much ; the Bryan gallery , one hundred thousand dollars ; Lawrence 's gifts of armor , Gray 's and Appleton 's of engravings , to Boston , more than seventy-five thousand ; land in Boston , five hundred thousand ; Street school of design at New Haven , two hundred and fifty thousand-an aggregate of several millions , besides the larger sums already partially raised or contemplated by the great projects of New York and Boston . Large sums will flow more readily and easily into the treasuries of organized working associations than smaller can be secured for those only in contemplation . At all events , a sound beginning of a sound end in the civilization of America has been made , and all nterested may hopefully watch its progress . J. JACKSON JARVES.      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
