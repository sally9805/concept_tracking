txt Louis NAPOLEON used to say that nothing Out Latin civilization would give permanent peace and prosperity to Mexico- The experiment in that direction to which he lent his influence was not a successful one . The downfall of the unhappy MAXIMILIAN , postponed a little while by our civil war , only happened . a few years before the exit of the imperial champion of the civilization of the Latin races . Whatever Mexico might have been , it is certainly a most uncomfortable neighbor . Its vast area , 2,000 miles in length and 1,100 miles from sea to sea , contains a sparse and semi-barbaric population that requires constant watchfulness and . supervision . With a great deal of fertile soil , the agricultural productions of the Republic are yet limited to the meagre demand of home consumption . From : its rich and varied . resources , only a small export trade is derived , and the American traveler in Mexico , when his attention is not diverted by brigands , is struck with the general air of languor and lassitude that everywhere prevails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' the rural portions of the country appear like some enchanted region where it is always afternoon , and . the people take one long siesta . The present generation seems utterly incapable of arousing the Republic from its lethargy and realizing anything substantial from its magnificent possibilities . Americans , however , have no occasion to complain of Mexican inactivity along the border , or wherever American commerce touches the interest of our Mexican neighbor . The continual cry from the Rio Grande is for help to repel the invasion of the robber bands which dash over the line and back again , before the exasperated settler can take the saddle . There may be some exaggeration in the reports daily sent up from Texas . There may be some truth in the rumors of an organized attempt being made to push back the boundary line until certain Mexican mines are " corraled " by American claimants . But , in spite of all this , our Mexican neighbors on . the Rio Grande are undoubtedly a great nuisance . Their remonstrances about the Apache raids from Arizona are doubtless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compared with those which we suffer that we have little patience to listen to them . Once in a while we hear faint echoes of turmoil in the Pacific ports of the Mexican Republic ; and it is notorious that American trade with those ports is carried on in the face of the most vexatious discouragements and impediments . If there were anything like a regular and settled Government in the States that border the Pacific , American commerce would flourish , to the exceeding profit of the people of both Republics . But it seems to be necessary for the Mexican Government to maintain a standing army all along its four thousand miles of Pacific coast line , in order to preserve the peace , protect trade , and keep order . There are rich mines in Sinaloa , Sonora , Durango , Lower California , and Chihuahua ; American capital and enterprise would soon bring these treasures into the circulation of trade . Already , notwithstanding the disorders of the country , something has been done in this direction , though nothing worthy of the magnificent resources of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brigandage . It was complained , the other day , " that numberless robberies and murders were committed , and no steps were taken by the proper authorities to ferret out or arrest the culprits . " Mining superintendents and engineers who go into the interior to open veins of ore take their lives in. their hands . As soon as they accumulate a little store of precious metal , an insurgent chief ? who is really a masquerading brigand ? pounces upon the hacienda and loots it , leaving behind the dead bodies of the foreigners ; or the rascally native employes organize a mutiny , cut the throats of their overseers ; and make off with their booty . It is seldom that punishment ever overtakes these banditti . In the Pacific ports of the Republic things are no better . As a rule , the officers of the Government , remote from the capital , are irresponsible creatures who hasten to enrich themselves by every variety of exaction and oppression . If the foreign trader escape these , he is almost sure to fall into the hands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the Custom-house at Mazatlan , La Paz , or San Blas has collected a deposit of $25,000 or $30,000 , there is a " revolution . " Some bold ragamuffin , with a fiery mustang , a pair of jingling spurs , and . a carbine , issues a grotesque pronunciantiento , in which he pronounces for " God and . liberty . " He gathers a handful ? not too large ? of equally ragged adventurers about him ; they overthrow the regular Government of the State for the space of twenty-four hours , more or less ; levy " forced loans " on the . hapless German , French , and . American traders , seize the specie in the Custom-house , and fly to the mountains . The revolution is over ; all things  --  except the cash  --  return to their former places ; and , within a month , the revolutionists are loafing about the gamingtables of Mazatlan with easy nonchalance . Under such discouragements as these American merchants are endeavoring to build . up trade with the Mexican ports of the Pacific . Lumber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other goods are exported from San Francisco and Puget Sound . It is a trying undertaking , and the few naval vessels that are sent to that portion of the Pacific are kept busy looking after American interests at the Mexican ports . Rear Admiral Alan- reported . to the Navy Department , the other day , that the Saranac had been sent to La Paz , in answer to complaints made by American citizens . There are , to be sure , constant applications of this sort from even the smallest seaports . Every consul likes to have the flag of his country floating from the masthead of a war vessel in port . Even a town . whose markets would be swamped . by an invoice of a bushel of Chili peppers calls for a man-of-war . But it is notorious that even a much larger naval force than that we can now spare would be inadequate to properly protect American commerce on the Mexican coasts . If Mexico were a powerful neighbor we should consider this state of things ground for belligerent remonstrance . As it is there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patiently for some solution of this difficult problem -- the relations of Mexico to the United States .
