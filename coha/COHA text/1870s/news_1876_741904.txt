txt Mr. DANA 'S case is one which may well set the more intelligent voters thinking . He is nominated by a Republican President to a Republican Senate , a committee of which , consisting of Senators from both parties , but a majority of Republicans , reports his name unfavorably , urged to that course by Gen. BUTLER , Mr. BEACH LAWRENCE , the New-York World , and no one else . The almost unanimous approval of the press of the country , both Democratic and Republican , and the urgent support of the best men in New-England , count for nothing against the opposition of Gen. BUTLER and his friends , availing themselves of a serious but unfounded charge against Mr. DANA 's probity . Every consideration of legitimate partisanship would seem to call for , the confirmation of the appointment , for there was no political reason why the President should not select Mr. DANA , and it is not pretended that there is any valid political reason why the Senate should not confirm . It is true that Mr. DANA opposed Mr. BUTLER 'S @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion of BUTLER thus shown he agreed with the present majority in his district ; with the majority of the Republican Party in the State , which has repeatedly refused Mr. BUTLER 'S application for nomination as Governor , and . with the majority of Republicans generally , who were ? long since sick and tired of BUTLER and Butlerisni , regarding them as things , in the expressive language of the President , which it is " time to unload . " Moreover , Mr. BUTLER says that he makes no charg , o against Mr. DANA 'S Republicanism , and affects to despise his opposition to himself . If we try to get at the real causes of the opposition to Mr. DANA , we find them somewhat confused , We only know concerning the action of the committee what those who guided it choose to tell us . This is , that Mr. DANA was first accused of and condemned for " literary piracy , " and for denying the offense under oath . This charge was sustained by such evidence as LAWRENCE and . BUTLER chose to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was disapproved . Of the two witnesses , or rather the two pleaders , before the committee , one was interested , the other was notoriously tricky and untrustworthy , and both were personal enemies of Mr. DANA . Prima facie , their appearance before the committee was not in the public interest , and their statements were open to the most obvious suspicion , and ought to have been subjected to rigid examination . Without any examination , so far as appears  --  certainly without any thorough examination , which must have revealed the gravest insincerity and inconsistency with truth in the assertions of these gentlemen ? the committee resolved to condemn Mr. DANA 'S appointment . Subsequently they consented to wait and hear Mr. DANA 'S defense , which he , when ho learned the committee 's action , promptly declined to offer , . and then the committee submitted their adverse report . We are now informed that the secondary motive for this course was the opinion of the committee that Mr. DANA 'S letter , refusing to defend himself before a committee that'had treated hint with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shows how hard it is to forgive those whom we have injured . It does not occur to the committee that the " offense " is from them , or that a private gentleman can have any objections to appear before them and try to prove that they were mistaken when they took the word of interested witnesses of indifferent repute that he was a thief and a perjurer . They do not see that they in any way disqualified themselves for judging Mr. DANA , ' or for calling him to account before them when they prejudged his case without a hearing . There are some charges which no gentleman can notice at all , but must leave to his own reputation to dispose of ' . The charges made against Mr. DANA are not of this kind , and no one pretends that they are so . They ought to have been considered and examined impartially . But no gentleman can be blamed for refusing to defend himself before a body which , on the partial testimony of his known enemies , has already announced its belief that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the treatment which he has experienced , the Senate committee brings into strong relief one of the most trying difficulties . in our civil service . It gives ground for the opinion , only too general at home and abroad , that those who aspire to honorable distinction under the Government are excluded by the small prejudices of powerful politicians , and are not estimated according to their worth . It is not desirable that BUTLER 'S influence with United States Senators should outweigh great merit in an appointee , and a favorable sentiment practically universal . Nor is it right that a Senate committee , dealing with our foreign affairs should , in the first instance , be capable of great injustice to an esteemed public character , and then shut him out of the public service because he resents their treatment . The country can not afford to render its positions of honor disagreeable to its best men , by besetting the path to them with injury and scandalous mistreatment.                   @ @
