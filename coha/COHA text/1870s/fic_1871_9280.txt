It 's astonishing cheap , Jacob , astonishing cheap ! Salary of my clerk , Luke Hardy , five hundred . Too much , too much ! I must cut that down . Dick Chubbuck , fifty dollars . The blundering rascal ! He costs me three hundred at the least calculation ; making an outlay of seven thousand and fifty , and leaving a clear profit of twelve thousand nine hundred and fifty dollars . That 's not bad for one year 's business ; not bad . Ah , Jacob ! ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jacob ,  --  coming in fast . My old father was wont to say to me , patting me affectionately on the head , " Get money , Jacob , get money . Honestly if you can ; but , at any rate , get it . It is the motive power of life : with it , you are somebody ; without it , nobody . " And I took his advice , and found it good too . I 've worked hard and long , and now the name of Jacob Tracy is as sound on ' change as the best . Yes , Jacob , get money ; and , Jacob , there 's a bit of advice your old father forgot , which I will give you ,  --  " Keep it , Jacob , keep it . " ( Enter Horton , c . ) Horton . Horton Yes , Jacob , keep it . I do n't know what it is ; but I advise you by all means to " keep it , Jacob , keep it . " ( Coolly takes a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lights it . ) Tracy . Jacob Tracy ( Starting up . ) Horton ! goodness , man , where did you drop from ? Horton . Horton From a ' bus in front of your door . Tracy . Jacob Tracy I thought you were in Cuba ? Horton . Horton Did you ? Well , you see you were mistaken . " I am here , " as Capt . What's-his-name says . Tracy . Jacob Tracy What brought you back ? Horton . Horton The A 1 copper-bottomed clipper , " Never say die , " Capt . Hall Bemish commander . Tracy . Jacob Tracy Nonsense , man ! What do you want ? Why are you here ? Why do n't you speak ? Horton . Horton Now do n't lose your temper , Jacob . Keep it , Jacob , keep it . Why am I here ? Ca n't you guess ? The treasury 's empty . Tracy . Jacob Tracy Not another cent will you get from me , you infamous scoundrel ! Horton . Horton Keep cool , Jacob , keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so young as you were when you first appeared at the City Bank . Tracy . Jacob Tracy Silence ! We shall be overheard . What do you want ? Money ? Horton . Horton Not exactly . I want a partner in a little business transaction ,  --  a partner with money , you understand , Jacob ! Tracy . Jacob Tracy Business ! A pretty man of business you are ! Horton . Horton Well , I am rather keen , as you should know . Hey , Jacob ? Tracy . Jacob Tracy This is infamous . Speak out : tell me where you have been , and what you want . Horton . Horton Well , then , here 's my story , dramatically arranged : Dramatis person .  --  A covetous grocer and a reckless young man . Scene .  --  The interior of a certain bank . Reckless discovered as discount clerk . Enter covetous grocer , who presents a note for discount , bearing the endorsement of one Richard Hardy , well known on ' change . The endorsement is a forgery . Tracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Horton . Horton No , indeed . Neither did Reckless ruin the grocer , though he was the only one in the bank who knew the endorsement to be a forgery . Pitying the grocer , he obtained sole possession of the note , though at a great expense ,  --  that of paying it ; but he knew his man , and thought it a good investment . So it has proved . Tracy . Jacob Tracy Yes , villain , it has , indeed ! for you have taken advantage of that to extort from me ten times its value . Horton . Horton Possibly . A chain of circumstances required the absence of Reckless from the country for a short time . He notified his friend the grocer , and was kindly assisted by him in his efforts to seek a foreign clime . He left for Cuba ; found Cuba too slow , and his money going too fast ; and , when it was all gone , he took passage for home in the " Never say die . " There you have it ,  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here you have us ,  --  covetous grocer , reckless young man . Tracy . Jacob Tracy And the upshot of this is , that you want more money ? Horton . Horton Not exactly . I have a little scheme in view that may be made mutually beneficial . You heard me speak of Capt . Hall Bemish . Capital fellow , and a first-rate sailor ! He and I have put our heads together , and , with your assistance , propose to take a cargo into Wilmington : in short , run the blockade . He 'll find the ship , you shall furnish the cargo , and I 'll go as your agent . Tracy . Jacob Tracy Will you ? Not quite so fast . I will have nothing to do with this business . Horton . Horton Oh , very well ! then I must look elsewhere for assistance . Is Mr. Richard Hardy in town , think you ? Jacob . Jacob Tacy Richard Hardy ! Horton , you are a villain ! Well , give me the particulars of your precious scheme . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this before her . ( Both rise . ) Horton . Horton Not a syllable . You can trust me . ( Enter Julia , c. , comes down , l. , speaks as she enters . ) Julia . Julia Tracy O father ! I 'm so glad you are here , for I want your assistance  --  A stranger ! Tracy . Jacob Tracy A friend of mine , Capt . Horton : captain , my daughter . ( Both salute . ) He called upon business  --  Horton . Horton Which has been very suddenly and agreeably turned to pleasure . Julia . Julia Tracy I 'm so sorry I interrupted you ; but I want you to assist me . I 've found such an object for your charity ! Tracy . Jacob Tracy Child , you are always finding " objects of charity ! " Julia . Julia Tracy But this is a case of real suffering and want . A poor woman whose husband fell in battle , who has three children to support , has very suddenly been taken dangerously sick ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jacob Tracy Well , well , here ! ( Gives money . ) But do n't be too lavish of your bounty ; for these are hard times , Julia , very hard times . Julia . Julia Tracy Oh , thank you , father ! I knew I could depend upon you . You are always so kind ! Horton . Horton ( Crossing to Julia . ) Permit me to add my mite to your offering . To aid the unfortunate is a duty incumbent on us all , and the performance of which should always bring pleasure . How much greater is the pleasure when we know our bounty will be dispensed by the hand of an angel ! ( Gives money . ) Julia Julia Tracy Oh , thank you ! Gold ! How generous ! Horton . Horton ( Aside , and crossing back to l . ) Rather considering it is the last of my shiners . However , Jacob will make that all right . Julia . Julia Tracy Now , father , I wo n't bother you any more . I 'll leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no , stay ! we were about going to my office . I shall be engaged but a short time , and will soon return . Julia . Julia Tracy Why , father where 's Nettie ? I have n't seen her this whole afternoon . Where can she be ? Tracy . Jacob Tracy Never fear for her : she knows enough to keep out of danger , if not out of mischief . Come , captain ! ( Exit , r . ) Horton . Horton Miss Tracy , my business completed , I trust you will allow me the pleasure of paying my respects to you again . Julia . Julia Tracy Captain , any friend of my father 's is heartily welcome here . ( Both bow , captain goes to door , r. , and turns . ) Horton . Horton ( Aside . ) Beautiful , and Jacob Tracy 's child ! That endorsement is really becoming valuable . ( Exit , r . ) Julia . Julia Tracy Capt . Horton ! I wonder who he is . A friend of my father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not very wonderful , for no one ever comes here . Business , nothing but business . When will father think of something else ? He has worked long and hard enough to have some rest ; but he thinks of nothing but making money . No time to give to me ; no time for company . I 'm sure his money brings no comfort to our home , no happiness to me . In my rambles this afternoon , I passed the cottage of Abel Thorne the blacksmith . It is a poor little cottage ; but it rang with the shouts of children , and Mr. Thorne sat at the window , reading to his daughter , who looked the picture of content , as she sat at her sewing . Why do n't my father read to me ? He has money enough to buy fifty places like Abel Thorne 's . Nettie . Nettie ( Outside , c . ) Be careful of the steps , Chub ! There you go ! I told you so , you great , big , awkward , good-for-nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carrying a large paper-bag of sugar , followed by Dick Chubbuck , who has on his shoulder a large basket filled with packages . ) Dick . Dick Chubbuck I could n't help it , Nettie : ' pon my word , I could n't . It 's them darned big feet of mine . They flop about like an elephant 's . Nettie . Nettie Ha , ha , ha ! what an idea ! You like an elephant ! There 's only one thing which makes you look like an elephant , Chub . Chub . Dick Chubbuck What 's that , Nettie ? Nettie . Nettie Long ears . Chub . Dick Chubbuck Long ears ! Why , Nettie ! where 's your natural history ? Long ears are signs of a jackass . Nettie . Nettie Ca n't help that , Chub . Yours are awful ! Julia . Julia Tracy Why , Nettie ! where have you been ? Nettie . Nettie Hallo , Aunt Julia ! Here we are , Chub and I , and the sugar ( sticking her fingers into the bag of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is the sweetest . Chub . Dick Chubbuck You ought to . You 've had your fingers in that sugar all the way up stairs . Nettie . Nettie Now , Chub , do n't tell tales ! Oh , dear , my arms ache so ! What shall I do with the sugar ? Julia . Julia Tracy Take it to the kitchen , child ! Why , where have you been ? Look at your feet ! they are covered with mud . Nettie . Nettie Why , so they are ! I 've only been having a frolic with the cows , in Mr. Blake 's pasture . Guess I must have slipped into the bog . It 's all Chub 's fault . Chub . Dick Chubbuck Mine ? Why , I have n't been near Blake 's pasture to-day . Nettie . Nettie If you had , I should n't have got into the bog . Chub . Dick Chubbuck Yes ; and the bog is not the only place you 've been into . Miss Julia , she 's been over head and ears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would be hard work for you to get over ears in any thing . Julia . Julia Tracy Take the basket into the kitchen , Dick , if you please . color=redPage 223 Nettie . Nettie Yes ; and I 'll take the sugar . Chub . Dick Chubbuck Now , Nettie , keep your fingers out of that sugar , or I 'll tell Mr. Tracy ! Nettie . Nettie Pooh ! I do n't care . Julia . Julia Tracy Why , Nettie ! what makes you so rude ? Nettie . Nettie Do n't know . ' Spect it 's all Chub 's fault . Chub . Dick Chubbuck Me ! Now , Miss Julia ! hear that . Hear the aspersions cast upon the character of the most innocent , lamblike  --  Nettie . Nettie I say , Chub . Chub . Dick Chubbuck Well . Nettie . Nettie There 's a cold chicken in the kitchen .

I fear I should be considered but an indifferent guardian of a motherless child ; but , since Lucy 's death , her merry laugh and roguish pranks have been the only brightness in our home , and I have not the heart to check them . I wonder if Luke has brought up the keys yet . No : the nail is empty . What a dear good fellow he is ! I do so like him ! I am sure , if father knew half his worth , he would advance him more rapidly than he has done . Oh , there he is ! ( Luke enters door , c. , hangs key on nail , r. of door , and is about to exit , c . ) Luke ! Mr. Hardy . ( Luke turns , and comes down , l . ) Hardy . Luke Hardy Good evening , Julia  --  Miss Tracy . Julia . Julia Tracy Miss Tracy ! Hardy . Luke Hardy I brought up the keys , as usual , and  --  that 's all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's all . ( Serious . ) Why , Luke ! what 's the matter ? has any thing gone wrong ? Hardy . Luke Hardy Oh , no ! The fact is , I am not very lively to-night . I have been thinking of making a change . Julia . Julia Tracy A change ? Hardy . Luke Hardy Yes , Julia . You saw the brave boys who , two days ago , marched along our streets on their way to the army . Something in the sight stirred my blood to quicker motion . Something of the glorious fire which blazed within their breasts lit an answering flame in mine . I thought of the fields that call for brave hands and strong arms , of the stirring life , the soldier 's glory , devotion to liberty and union ; and I loathed the tame , ignoble life which holds me here a slave . Men 's work is now where treason threatens . My place is there . Julia . Julia Tracy You , Luke , leave us ? You are right : duty calls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What will father do without you ? He depends upon you . Luke . Luke Hardy Depends upon me ? Why , Julia ! the pittance I receive from him scarce keeps the wolf from our door . But for the kindness of my uncle , Richard Hardy , my mother would fare but poorly . I have written to him , asking him to give my mother a home while I am gone . Julia . Julia Tracy O Luke ! you must not leave us . Luke . Luke Hardy I must , Julia ; for there are other reasons , one more weighty , why I should go . Julia . Julia Tracy Other reasons ? One more weighty ? what is that one , Luke ? Luke . Luke Hardy A secret , Julia . Julia . Julia Tracy A secret ! Now , Luke , we have been good friends for ten long years , and you should tell me your secret . Come , confess your mighty and weighty secret . Hardy . Luke Hardy I can not . Julia . Julia Tracy But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? You must tell me , sir . Tracy . Jacob Tracy ( Outside , r . ) Julia ! Julia . Julia Tracy Father 's calling . I 'll be back in a moment , so prepare to confess . ( Exit , r . ) Hardy . Luke Hardy Confess ! no , no , Julia . If the humble clerk dares to love the daughter of his wealthy employer , he knows better than to confess , at least to you . Fool , that I am , why am I here ? The sight of her almost takes away my reason . I can hardly contain myself while in her presence . I know well that the daughter of the rich Jacob Tracy can never be my wife ; and yet I am drawn to her presence , against my better judgment . No , no : I was right . The only course to be pursued is to put distance between us ,  --  to quit this spot , and , in the stirring life of camp and field , strive to forget . I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment , I may forget myself , and declare a hopeless passion . I will away at once . ( Exit , c . ) ( Enter Chub , l . He has a knife in his right hand , a plate under his right arm , a chicken on a fork in his left . A voice with a strong Hibernian accent is heard outside . " Out of that , you thief ! " And , as he enters , a broom is banged upon his head . ) Chub . Dick Chubbuck Now this may be hospitality ; but I do n't see it . Kindly invited into the kitchen by Nettie , to take a piece of chicken , and seeing but one piece , I took it . Having acquired the piece , I found I was to have no peace from the feminine ruler of that culinary abode , the cook . She called me a hog , and , evidently impressed with the truth of the well-known maxim , " Root hog , or die , " proceeded to root me out with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much like a culprit pinioned for the drop ; and , if I do n't drop him into my longing mouth , my name 's not Dick Chubbuck . There 's nobody about , so I proceed to dissect him after the most approved fashion . ( Seats himself upon table , c. , during the last part of his speech . Enter Nettie , l. , with a book under her arm . ) Nettie . Nettie Why , Chub ! Chub . Dick Chubbuck Why , Nettie ! Nettie . Nettie What are you doing with that poor chicken ? Chub . Dick Chubbuck Poor , Nettie ? Why , he 's as fat as butter . Nettie . Nettie What are you doing ? Chub . Dick Chubbuck Well , Nettie , I am about performing a surgical operation ,  --  removing by the process of amputation the lower limbs of this once-happy feathered biped . Nettie . Nettie Oh , do n't ! Why do n't you eat it ? Chub . Dick Chubbuck Will you allow me to suggest , my inquisitive friend , the necessity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adapted to the capacity of my by no means capacious mouth ? Nettie . Nettie Why , Chub ! Where did you get all those big words ? I ca n't understand you at all . Chub . Dick Chubbuck Ca n't you ? Well , you see , Nettie , I once worked for a man who made dictionaries ; and I think I must have swallowed some of the words with the dust of the sweepings . But what have you got there ? Nettie . Nettie Oh , this  --  this is my fairy book ! Chub . Dick Chubbuck Fairy book ? Nettie . Nettie Yes , it 's real splendid !  --  all about knights and dragons ; princes who rescued beautiful princesses , and terrible ogres who devoured tender young ladies . Chub . Dick Chubbuck Now do n't , Nettie ! You 'll spoil my appetite for this tender young chicken . Nettie . Nettie I 'll read you a story , Chub . Oh , they 're so nice !

Nettie Do be quiet ! That 's the way all fairy stories commence ,  --  " Once upon a time "  --  Chub . Dick Chubbuck What ! All at the same time ? Nettie . Nettie Now , Chub , if you do n't behave yourself , I 'll not read another word ! Chub . Dick Chubbuck I 'm dumb . Proceed . " Once on a time . " Nettie . Nettie ( Reading . ) " Once on a time , on the borders of an immense forest , in a stately mansion , dwelt a rich merchant "  --  Chub . Dick Chubbuck Married or single ? Nettie . Nettie O Chub !

We 'll see if you ca n't be made to keep silent . ( Exit , l . ) Chub . Dick Chubbuck Her pincushion ! I 'm in for it now . If that child once gets possession of a pin , there 's no comfort for my weak flesh . I think I 'll leave . Too late , for here she is . ( Enter Nettie , l. , with pincushion . ) Nettie . Nettie ( Seating herself as before . ) Now , sir , we 'll see who rules here ! Chub . Dick Chubbuck O Nettie ! do n't stick pins into me ! I 'm sore now with that last attack of your pincushion .

Ten years ago I lost my mother ; it was a sad day for me when her body was borne from this house , and I recollect well how lonely and almost broken-hearted I was as I sat here alone . There was no one to cheer or comfort me ; for my father , always immersed in business , had quickly returned to his avocations . A lad in the employ of my father , bringing the keys to the house at night , spoke so kindly and sympathizingly to me , that his words and looks have never been forgotten . I have watched for his coming every night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and asking Heaven to bless him for his kindness to the poor motherless girl .

Only think ! it 's three years since he went away . Julia . Julia Tracy Yes , three years , Nettie ; and long years they have been .

Father , once so kind and considerate , has become a cruel , tyrannical persecutor . The riches he has acquired are fast taking wings under the schemings of that infamous Capt . Horton , who , by some mysterious influence , controls him . I have been importuned to name the day when I will bestow my hand upon Capt . Horton . I can not do it .

Julia Tracy Capt . Horton , I must decline . The nature of the interview you wish I can readily imagine , and it would be useless . Horton .

Horton Ah ! but you will change your mind when I tell you that I love you sincerely and devotedly ; when I tell you that your father desires it ; that it is necessary to save his fortune , to save him from prison . Julia . Julia Tracy From prison !  --  my father ! What mean you ? Horton . Horton That I have accidentally  --  quite accidentally  --  acquired the power to convict your father of a felony that would , were it known , place him in prison for the remainder of his life .

I do not believe my father ever committed a crime , or that you have the power to condemn him ; and I would rather die than become your wife . Horton . Horton Very fine , Miss Julia , very fine ; you would make a capital actress . But you must listen to me ; you must name the day ; for what I have said is true .

It is too horrible ! and yet , my father 's anxious , careworn face , his evident fear of Capt . Horton  --  Oh , no , no ! it can not be that I must be sacrificed ! ( Enter Tracy , c . ) Tracy . Jacob Tracy Julia , once more I must insist upon your treating Capt . Horton with more respect . I will have no more of this foolish strife against my wishes .

Jacob Tracy Yes , child , very much . Nettie . Nettie I 'm sure I do dearly ; for she is so kind and good to me , and she was so kind and good to my mother .

You must be a good little girl , and never do any thing wrong . And she told me how good you had been to her ; that she married a bad man , who treated her cruelly ; and you took her home , and loved her . I did n't know what it all meant then ; but I 've grown older now . Did n't you love her , grandpa ? Tracy . Jacob Tracy Love her , child ! Heaven only knows how dearly . Nettie .

Horton has been here with the old story , the old entreaty , that I should fix the day for our marriage . I refused . He then declared his power to convict you of felony . Is this true ? Tracy . Jacob Tracy It is , Julia . He has the power indeed . Julia . Julia Tracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this man has told you part . I will tell you the whole . The love of money has been the curse of my life . Twenty years ago I was a poor , struggling man : with a few hundred dollars , I had managed to put myself in business . It was a hard struggle then . I found an opportunity to make a very handsome transaction by the use of five hundred dollars . The money was only needed a month . I made a note for the amount , and presented it at the city bank , borrowing the name of a well-known merchant as endorser . Julia . Julia Tracy Borrowing ? Tracy . Jacob Tracy Well , well , forged the name : I suppose that is what it would be called , though I intended to pay it when it should become due . When it was due , I went to the bank to pay it : judge of my surprise to find it had been paid three days before . I was alarmed , fearing it had fallen into the hands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account ; for , in three days after , it turned up in the hands of Capt . Horton . Julia . Julia Tracy O father , father ! Tracy . Jacob Tracy Julia , it was a wicked act ; but I have paid dearly for it . Capt . Horton 's silence has cost me ten times the amount of that note , and now he claims your hand  --  Julia . Julia Tracy O father ! I can not marry him : he is so reckless , so wicked ! he would make my life miserable . Tracy . Jacob Tracy Fear not , child . You shall not marry him . The love of gold has shut my eyes to all else . The fear of discovery has closed my heart to all good . But something in that child 's voice , as it brought back those old scenes , has awakened better feelings ; and , rather than sacrifice you , I will go where that villain would consign me ,  --  to prison .
