A. SENATOW S FIDELITY YINDICATED . THE defeated attempt to annex San Domingo to the United States , the recall of Mr. Motley from the mission to England , the removal of Mr. Sumner from the head of the Committee on Foreign Relations , on which he had long served , the rupture of friendly intercourse subsisting between him and Mr. Fish , are likely , both in their public and personal aspects , to prove matters of permanent interest . While many contributions have been made to the discussion , the more elaborate are the letter of Mr. Fish , October 29 , 1877 , printed in the Boston Evening Tran8cr*t , the reply of one of Mr. Sumner 's literary executors through the same journal , November 28th , and a paper of Mr. J. C. Bancroft Davis , in support of Mr. Fish , dated January 3 , 1878 , and appearing in the New York Herald . Various persons have at times had relations to the controversy ; but lately it has been treated as one which chiefly concerned Mr. Fish and Mr. Sumner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ esteem are not the pending question . Mr. Sumner , in 1870 , resisted , in the Senate , with all his power , the annexation of San Domingo as fraught with evil to the colored race , and as promoted by measures which violated international law , while Mr. Fish strenuously supported it in the cabinet . Whether , in this or other measures on which they may have differed or agreed , one or the other is entitled to the higher rank as a statesman , is not now in dispute . The issue is a narrower one , involving chiefly the validity of the reasons alleged at different times for Mr. Sumner*s removal , which the public has quite generally attributed largely to the intervention of the President , and of his Secretary of State , Mr. Fish . The discussion sweeps a wider field , but it begins and ends at this point of contention . In an interview with a reporter at Boston , October 19 , 1877 , // Mr. Fish stated that , " with regard to the alleged negligence of Mr. Sumner while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fact , susceptible of proof from the Senate records , that drafts of treaties meaning treaties , from eight to eleven in number , remained in the hands of the committee for several months , some of them , as near as Mr. Fish could remember , for more than two years . " In reply to a written request for a list of the treaties referred to , he answered by letter , October 29th , enumerating nine-one each with Mexico , Colombia , Guatemala , Nicaragua , Austria , Salvador , and Great Britain , and two with Peru-as " transmitted to the Senate for its action , and referred by that body to the Committee on Foreign Relations , while Mr. Sumner was its chairman , and which remained unacted upon at the time when he ceased to be such chairman ; " and later in the same letter he referred to the nine treaties as having " failed to receive the consideration of the committee at the time when Mr. Sumner 's appointment as its chairman expired . " By note of November 7th , merely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the public . In an interview held at Garrison 's , November 10th , with a reporter of the New York flerald , he treated with ridicule the suggestion ascribed to Wendell Phillips , that Mr. Sumner had " prepared and digested " the treaties referred to , which thus made final action only a formality , and replied , " with a certain bland smile of contempt , " that , " on the contrary , he had pigeon-holed those treaties ; he would pay no attention to them whatever . " Again , by letter to the Herald , November 10th , evening , he supplemented with further statements what he had said to the reporter in the afternoon ; thus , in the brief period of three weeks , coming before the public five times to make and support charges against Mr. Sumner , and each time with no appearance of being a reluctant witness-certainly without being governed by any self-imposed rule of silence or reserve . Before October , 1877 , Mr. Fish seems to have been , not publicly but privately , making the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in September , em route from London to Edinburgh , General Grant stated that he had said to George William Curtis , at Long Branch , in 1871 , that " Mr. Sumner had not done his duty as chairman of the committee , because he had hampered the business of the State Department by pigeon-holing // treaties for months ; " and the ex-President added : " I told Mr. Curtis that there were nine or eleven treaties before the Senate from the State Department that had been there several months , and had been in Mr. Sumner 's hands , but had never been laid before the committee . I wrote from the spot , Long Branch , to the State Department , and to my own surprise there proved to be more treaties than I had said that had been in Mr. Sumner 's own hands for a longer time than I expected . . . . The work of that committee , when Mr. Cameron took charge , was in a most deplorable state , due entirely to Mr. Sumner 's obstructiveness and dilatoriness . " General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his information , and from it he obtained a formal list of the " pigeon-holed " treaties . Mr. Fish , as its head , being the only officer connected with it who was brought into constant communication with the President , and having six years afterward been quick to support a renewal of the charge , appears as the author of the original charge which General Grant repeated with so much emphasis in his interview . The charge of suppressing important public business , thus authorized by Mr. Fish , and many times repeated by himself and others who relied on him as authority , is assuredly a very grave one . It implied official unfaithfulness , and even moral delinquency . Whether a statesman , living or dead , was able , wise , or farsighted , is always a fair question for discussion ; but the charge of moral delinquency , such as Mr. Fish originated and spread , and that too against one who could no longer speak for himself , could only be justified by undoubted evidence . Stated so positively and in such a quarter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but for a fortunate suggestion that the Senate records should be searched and made known , this calumny might have remained forever attached to an eminent Senator . On November 21st the injunction of secrecy was removed from the Senate proceedings , on the motion of Senator Hoar , of Massachusetts , and Mr. Fish 's repeated charge found to be untrue . Mr. Sumner 's chairmanship ended March 3 , 1871 . It was found that he reported the Mexican protocol ( referred December 8 , 1869 ) on January 11 , 1870 ; the Darien Canal treaty with Colombia ( referred April 1 , 1870 ) on July 13 , 1870 ; two treaties with Peru and one each with Guatemala and Nicaragua ( all four // referred December 8 , 1870 ) on January 12 , 1871 ; one with Salvador ( referred January , 1871 ) on March 1 , 1871 ; one with Great Britain ( referred February 28 , 1871 ) on March 1 , 1871 , leaving only the Austro-Hungary treaty ( referred December 14 , 1870 ) unreported-eight of the nine treaties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charged he had " pigeon-holed " in his committee . Not only did he report them , but he reported them with more than the dispatch customary with committees . Five of the nine were kept with the committee only about a month , and that month a broken one , which included the holiday recess , and a sixth was reported the very next day after it was received . The treaty with Salvador was with the committee seven weeks , the last fortnight of which Mr. Sumner was prostrated with a severe illness , which kept him from the Senate . The Darien Canal treaty remained with the committee only three months , although it is still pending in the Senate , which has not been able to come to a conclusion upon its merits for the period of nearly eight years since it was reported . When we consider the deliberation and obstractions to which public business is subjected , particularly in Congress , Mr. Sumner will be regarded by all who study these dates as having dealt with his share of it with extraordinary dispatch . Senator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the proof of diligence which this record gives , all the more impressive because of the various duties pressing on Mr. Sumner , and his belief that no other committee could show such a record . Eleven days after Mr. Fish had appeared by letter in the Herald , his charge against Mr. Sumner was shown to be untrue by the solemn record of the Senate . What , then , was his duty * He had made the charge to ex-President Grant , who was spreading it in Europe and the United States . He had repeated it by letters and interviews . He had made it , not against a living rival , but against a dead Senator , one with whom he had often held sweet counsel . The code of honor , the Christian canons , the instincts of human nature , commanded an instant retraction and apology under his own hand . The case did not admit of a vicarious defense . There are some duties which can not be delegated-and one is that of recalling a false imputation against the character of another , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead . But all at once Mr. Fish was silent . One who had five times in three weeks come before the public , and chiefly as a volunteer , all at once stopped writing letters and meeting interviewers ; and from November 21 , 1877 , when his accusations were shown to be untrue by the publication of the Senate journal , he has maintained an impenetrable reserve . Withdrawing at this interesting stage of the discussion , he seems to have obtained a substitute to take his place . Mr. J. C. B. Davis , his former Assistant Secretary of State , spares time from new duties on the Court of Claims to write a paper for the Herald in his behalf . This mode of justifying by proxy has two advantages : it relieves Mr. Fish of the unpleasant necessity of stating at the outset how he came to make such untrue charges against a dead Senator* and further enables him to avoid responsibility for new positions taken in his defense , which may be found as unsubstantial as his original charge of " pigeon-holing " treaties . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " in which the interviewed , when his statements have been shown to be contrary to the fact , with great facility changes his positions , coolly throwing on the interviewer the responsibility of misapprehending him . Not , however , from Mr. Davis or any other substitute , but from Mr. Fish himself , under his own hand , an explanation is required by every law of moral duty . Mr. Davis 's method of narration is certainly unique . He relates some conversations where plainly he was not present ; others , in a way that leaves the reader in doubt whether he is reciting another 's story or his own ; talks of the thoughts , anxieties , remembrances , and states of mind of Mr. Fish , as if the two were one ; and recounts frequent and long interviews at Mr. Fish 's house-matters of which Mr. Fish is the only competent witness  --  and in some instances he differs radically from Mr. Fish 's versions . He undertakes to say , giving no authority , what took place between Mr. Sumner and Mr. Fish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house , when they two were alone together ; and what Mr. Fish said to Senators , when he ( Mr. Davis ) does not claim to have been present . The paper abounds in vague phrases as- " it was said ; " " it was no secret ; " " one Republican Senator went so far ; " " the President and Mr. Fish stated to more than one Senator ; " " there appeared on the part of leading // Republican members " - in all wliich the generality of allegation and suppression of names make any attempt to test the truth of the statements impossible . If he is a witness , let him qualify by showing presence and opportunity ; and , if he is only acting as amanuensis of Mr. Fish , let him say so . A paper of such a character as he has given carries no weight as evidence . One part  --  and a large part it is-of Mr. Fish 's as well as of Mr. iDavis 's statements ought to be eliminated from the discussion . They write with facility of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his denial , or the different version he might give ; and they undertake to put in testimony of this kind which they did not give in his lifetime . Recent statutes deny to a party the right to testify to the conversations of a deceased adversary , for manifest reasons of public policy . The rule is justly applicable to other than legal controversies , and should be applied more stringently against parties whose previous allegations against the deceased have proved untrue . Fa18u8 in uno , fal8u8 in omnilus , is a maxim which , though subject to limitations , holds a legitimate place in the law of evidence . The public will require better proof of Mr. Sumner 's conversations , manner , and thoughts , than such testimony from such a source . Mr. Davis in his paper jumps the charge of " pigeon-holing " with an acrobat 's dexterity . He says that , " at or about the time the change Mr. Sumner 's removall took place , the President and Mr. Fish stated to more than one Senator that the current business of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the present session ; and particularly that no treaty which had been sent to the Senate during the session which followed Motley 's recall had been acted on . " This shifting of positions is adroit , but it will not answer its purpose . Mr. Fish 's uniform charge , as given to the public and to General Grant , is pigeon-holing in committee , not inaction in the Senate ; and the list of nine treaties which he gave was one which he alleged had not been reported , not a list of treaties reported , which were not pressed in the Senate . If Mr. Fish told Senators what Mr. Davis asserts , then he gave them a different account from what he has given in letters and interviews . Mr. Davis very quietly slips in this new charge in place of the old one , without calling // the reader 's attention to the substitution . Let it be noted , too , that he associates the ex-President with Mr. Fish in the making of charges to Senators ; while the former in his interview denied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it had taken place . Mr. Davis says , " The unrevealed records of the Senate in executive session will show whether Mr. Sumner made any attempt during that winter 1870- ' 71 to secure the action of the Senate on these treaties . " They might , or they might not . Mr. Sumner might have appealed urgently to Senators to take up the treaties , and the general expression might have been against his appeal , and there the matter ended without a record . If Mr. Davis can find anything in the Senate journals to impeach Mr. Sumner 's fidelity , let him produce it , and not darkly hint at points against him which do not exist . On the assailant rests the burden of proving his charges . There is a presumption in favor of the right-doing of public business which has passed into a maxim . Reputations are to be assailed only by proved facts , not by cunning insinuations . Mr. Sumner 's friends have no occasion to fear records which have already so well exposed the calumnies industriously circulated against him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one is , that Mr. Sumner " did not move forward the treaties and secure the Senate 's action upon them . " No such intimation was made in the caucus or in the Senate when Mr. Sumner 's removal was debated March 10 , 1871 ; nor by President Grant , when giving reasons for it in the summer of 1871 ; nor by Mr. Conkling , July 23 , 1872 , when , at the Cooper Institute , he defended with much elaboration the removal , stating instead , what is now dis . proved , that Mr. Sumner did not report " six or seven treaties ; " nor by Mr. Howe , Mr. Hamlin , Mr. Cameron , and Mr. Anthony , when they explained in the Senate the cause of the removal April 28 , 1874 ; nor by General Grant , in his interviews in 1877- ' 78 in Scotland or in Egypt ; nor by Mr. Fish , in his five appearances before the public in October , November , and December , 1877 ; but it is , for the first time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly seven years after Mr. Sumner 's removal , and almost four years after his death , and only when Mr. Fish 's repeated accusation has been completely disproved by the record . // Mr. Davis 's assertion , that the President and Secretary at that time stated to Senators Mr. Sumner 's neglect of public business , is disproved by the facts . Such a statement , if believed , would have inevitably been used in the cancus and in the Senate . The Senators who promoted the removal were sorely pressed for reasons which should be distinct from the San Domingo issue , and they would have seized upon an argument calculated to carry public opinion with them . Not one , however , even in that hour of bitterness , saw fit to accept Mr. Sumner 's challenge to an inspection of his record as chairman , or to deny his fidelity . Mr. Howe and Mr. Nyc expressly admitted it , and the silence of others was an implied assent . If any one of all those who voted for the removal had received the information which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Secretary , he could have met Mr. Sumner with a positive denial of his fidelity , and vindicated the propriety of his removal before the country . That no Senator received the communication , as stated by Mr. Davis , is shown by the fact that no Senator reported Mr. Sumner 's alleged neglect to the caucus or the Senate , and that the positive assertions of his fidelity were left unquestioned . But the substitute charge is as unfounded as the original one . No affirmative evidence is of its truth and Mr Sumner 's friends mio'ht given , rest content with challenging the assailant to supply his proofs . But they can well advance beyond mere negation , and bring his surviving colleagues on the committee and in the Senate as witnesses to his character and fidelity . No legislator , it may be remarked , can be held responsible for the refusal of the legislative body to act when he has duly reported a measure and brought it properly to its attention . The body may insist on its own order of business , or be averse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treaty , the French claims , the Alabama claims , and the civil rights measures , are all instances of dilatory action , which neither chairmen nor committees could prevent . Some of these Mr. Sumner urged , as is well known , with untiring effort , but without success . If , prima facie , a chairman is to be deemed culpable for the non-action of the legislative body , no chairman could stand the test . It is for Mr. Davis to show , before he can sustain his charge , an occasion when Mr. Sumner should have urged // a treaty , and did not , and what treaties he so neglected ; when , if ever , any Senator upon his committee , or not upon it , asked in the Senate for the consideration of a treaty , and found him obstructive or indifferent ; or when , if ever , Mr. Fish solicited Mr. Sumner 's attention for the purpose , and it was not given . Many notes of Mr. Fish to Mr. Sumner are preserved , mostly of a very familiar character , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them is there a suggestion that any treaty has been neglected ; not one speaks of delay or calls for action . The testimony of Senators who were serving with Mr. Sumncr at the time of his removal in March , 1871 , is here given . Messrs . Patterson , Schurz , and Casserly , were members of the Committee on Foreign Relations at that time . Messrs . Casserly , Thurman , and Bayard , were his political opponents ; and with some of the others , for instance Mr. Trumbull , he had at times strong antagonisms on public questions . But , whatever their differences , political or personal , they have cheerfully borne their emphatic testimony to the remarkable fidelity of their deceased colleague . Ex-Senator Patterson , of New lliampshire , a member of the committee with Mr. Sumner , writes February 25 , 1878 : " Mr. Sumner 's fidelity in the discharge of his senatorial duties was so generally recognized that I could not have believed that any person would be found to question it , if I had not seen it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in response to your question , that I think he was exceptionally faithful and prompt in pressing the consideration of all matters referred to his committee , and in urging action upon the same , after it had been reported to the Senate ; and my own belief is , that Mr. Sumner never exhibited greater activity or ability , and never manifested a stronger desire to expedite the business of his committee , than during his last term of service as its chairman . I never saw or heard an intimation that he was either slack or obstructive in the discharge of his duties as chairman , until I read the paper lately published by ex-Secretary Fish in response to Mr. Phillips 's strictures upon the utterances of President Grant relative to Mr. Sumner . It so happened that I was absent from Washington , attending the annual election in New Hampshire at the time Mr. Sumner was dropped from his committee , and so did not hear the discussions upon that subject either in the caucus or the Senate . It was , however , a matter of frequent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember to have heard any one give , as a reason for his being dropped , a premeditated and willful holding back of treaties which had been referred to the committee , or even a careless neglect of foreign affairs . " It was rare , if ever , that the files of our committee were cumbered with unconsidered business . It was Mr. Sumner 's habit to drive his work and not to be driven by it . He kept the table of the committee clear , and ready for new matter as it came to hand . It certainly never occurred to me , and I have no reason to suppose it did to any of my associates upon the committee , that our chairman 's zeal in the discharge of his official duties flagged during his last term of service , or that personal feelings toward the Secretary of State influenced his action as a Senator in the slightest degree . The charge that Mr. Sumner , simply to gratify personal spite , designedly and maliciously delayed action , either in the committee or the Senate , upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The record shows it to be untrue , and a wrong done to the memory of a statesman whose name will be revered and honored in spite of this violation of the rest of the grave . " Mr. Sumner undoubtedly had great confidence in his own judgment of public affairs , and perhaps was liable , through the strength of his feelings , to do injustice to the motives and opinions of others ; but he was not suspicious or malignant , and his patriotism was too constant and strong ever to have allowed him to gratify his personal dislikes to the sacrifice of a public duty . All the treaties mentioned by Mr. Fish in the article already alluded to , when referred to the committee , were taken up and acted upon with the usual promptness , and were reported back to the Senate by our chairman with no more than the ordinary and necessary delay . Nor did Mr. Sumner 's activity stop there . More than once , as I well remember , he reminded the Senate that those treaties were on its table , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was of such a character as to demand immediate action , and as no real interest of the country would be sacrificed by delay , the Senate preferred to go on with the legislative business upon its crowded calendar , during the short term , and so declined to go into executive session for the consideration of the treaties . Two out of the nine treaties spoken of by ex-Secretary Fish , it is true , could not be classed among what are called stock treaties . ' They did not relate to the general questions of international intercourse , but yet were of such a character as would allow them to be held in abeyance without detriment to any public interest . That // relating to the Mexican commissioners , it was understood , would meet with serious opposition , and could only be ratified , if at all , after long debate . The Darien Canal treaty had such wide and far-reaching relations , and was to inaugurate expensive and protracted operations in a locality so distant and little understood , that it demanded time for investigation , both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought best that these should go over with the others to the extra session , when there would be ample time to consider them . It is not an unusual thing-indeed , I think I may say it is the common practice of the Senate  --  to allow executive business pending near the close of a session , if it does not press for immediate action , to go over to the extra or special session , if it is understood there is to be one . This gives time for the consideration of legislative business which always crowds , and necessitates hasty action in the closing days of Congress . " Ex-Senator Schurz , of Missouri , another member of the committee with Mr. Sumner , now Secretary of the Interior , writes , May 15 , 1878 : " I was a member of the Senate Committee on Foreign IRelations during the last two years of Mr. Sumner 's chairmanship , and I have never heard his diligence in preparing and pressing forward the business of that committee questioned by any one , until now after his death . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and know , from my own observation , that his official duties , especially those connected with foreign affairs , were constantly occupying his mind and engaging his energies . If the charge of negligence had been brought against him while he was at the head of the Committee on Foreign Relations , it would have been unanimously put down as utterly absurd by all those who had any knowledge of the business of that committee . " Mr. Sumner never hesitated , neglected , or ceased to press the business of the committee upon the attention of the Senate on every available occasion . As to the list of treaties recently mentioned by Mr. Fish in his letter to the Boston Transcr*pt , I do not pretend to have any specific recollection . But I feel warranted in saying that if those treaties , or any of them , went over from the regular session of Congress to the extra session of the Senate immediately following it and called especially for the transaction of executive business , it was by no means an unusual , but a very common and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the close of a session of // Congress there is a vast accumulation of legislative matter to bc disposed of in a hurry ; that there is scarcely time for the calm consideration of anything ; that the Senate at that period devotes most of its time in executive sessions to the confirmation or rejection of the nominations still on the calendar ; and that extra sessions of the Senate , immediately following the adjournment of Congress , are called for the special purpose of transacting business which requires consideration and could not be sufficiently considered amid the turmoil of a closing Congress . To cast blame upon Mr. Sumner , or any one else , for permitting important business to go over to the extra session of the Senate under such circumstances , if in the instance mentioned by Mr. Fish it did go over , seems entirely gratuitous . " The reasons for which Mr. Sumner was dropped from the chairmanship of the Committee on Foreign Relations were discussed in open Senate , and even the debate which had taken place in the caucus of Republican Senators on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favored the removal of Mr. Sumner ventured to hint at remissness in the conduct of public business on the part of Mr. Sumner , or at a difference of opinion between him and the Secretary of State concerning the acquisition of Canada , as forming part of those reasons . The record in the Congressional Glol3e speaks for itself . Neither have I ever , until now , heard these two things privately mentioned by any one as making the retirement of Mr. Sumner from the chairmanship desirable . To put his retirement from a post which he had held so long and so honorably , upon such grounds , appears very much like an after-thought , and to accuse a man like Mr. Sumner , whose highest pride was in his fidelity to public duty , of negligence or obstructiveness in the discharge of those duties , now that he is in his grave , is , to say the least of it , very ungracious business . " Ex-Senator Casserly , of California , another member of the committee with Mr. Sumner , writes , February 19 , 1878 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1871 , while I was on the committee with Mr. Sumner , I can say that in the committee , as its chairman , he was faithful and diligent in reporting and pressing treaties . He was equally so in the Senate , where he was apt to be rather persistent with treaties of importance . It is my recollection that treaties sent in to the Senate during the session ending March 4th were , unless the emergency was great , usually laid over for the // special session of the Senate immediately following . The Mexican Claims treaty encountered from the first much opposition . I do not recall the circumstances connected with the Austro-Hungarian treaty , or the Darien Canal treaty . Generally speaking , I should say that the delays , whatever they were , in disposing of important treaties were imputable to the Senate rather than to Mr. Sumner . I refer more especially now to the session ending March 4 , 1871 , when he was excluded from the committee . Whatever specious pretexts for this proceeding may have been given then , or may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motive for it is to be found in Mr. Sumner 's unflinching opposition to the San Domingo job . This was the understanding at the time among all of us Democrats in the Senate , and not a few Republicans . " Senator Morrill , of Vermont , writes , January 24 , 1878 : " I can not pretend any other than a general impression touching the manner of Mr. Sumner in the discharge of his duties as chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations ; and that impression was and is that he was remarkably attentive to all subjects referred to the committee , and I never noticed that he was dilatory in pressing them upon the attention of the Senate . To the very last he seemed to me especially ambitious not to shirk his senatorial labors . I was also frequently at his room , and there always found him a hard worker . " Ex-Senator Trumbull , of Illinois , writes , January 25 , 1878 : " I am amazed that there should be any controversy as to the fidelity with which the late Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Foreign Relations . During the eighteen years I served with him in the Senate , no member of the body was more prompt in his attendance , or more attentive to business than he , saving only the period while he was physically disabled by the brutal assault of 1856 . In 1871 , when Mr. Sumner , after a service of ten years , was displaced as chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations , no one intimated that it was because of any delay or neglect in the discharge of duty either in the committee-room or as a member of the Senate . So far from it , his fidelity was admitted by all ; and , though my personal relations with him were not at the time of the most agreeable character , I was so well satisfied that the good of the public service required his retention as chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations , that I did not hesitate to protest against his removal . I regard the accusation that // Mr. Sumner , either during the last year of his service as chairman of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , failed or neglected properly to bring forward and press upon the consideration of the Senate treaties or any other matter referred to his committee , as cruelly unjust , and wholly unwarranted by the facts . " Ex-Senator Fenton , of New York , writes , * January 29 , 1878 : " I know of no Senator more faithful and efficient in pressing committee-business committed to him than was Mr. Sumner . During the years I served with him in the Senate I never heard it charged or intimated , nor did I ever for a moment think , that he was careless or remiss in the discharge of duty , whether relating to treaties or other matters before his committee or the Senate . His views relative to the acquisition of Canada , whatever they may have been at the time of his disconnection with the Committee on Foreign Relations , were not urged or referred to privately or publicly , to my knowledge , as a reason for his displacement . " Senator Thurman , of Ohio , writes , May 24 , 1878 : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggestion that Senator Sumner was remiss in the discharge of his duties as chairman of that committee . The suggestion greatly surprised me , for he was very remarkable for his punctual attendance in the Senate , and I had always supposed that he was equally diligent in the discharge of his committee duties . I can not but think that those who have intimated the contrary are very greatly mistaken . " Senator Bayard , of Delaware , writes , February 18 , 1878 : " In reply to your inquiry as to the fidelity of the late Senator Sumner in conducting the business of the Committee on Foreign Relations while he was the chairman , I will say that , not having been a member of that committee , I can speak only of its business as presented to the Senate , and there I can well attest Mr. Sumner 's remarkable assiduity in attending to all the duties of his position . In this he was conspicuous , and I never knew his steady fidelity to fail or flag even when ill-health and suffering would have given him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretext for his removal from the chairmanship he had held so many years than an alleged lack of attention to its duties . In his lifetime I never heard such a suggestion , for it would have been considered absurd . When he was deprived of the chairmanship , there was no man in the Senate so well equipped as he for the place , and not one more assiduous // in his devotion to what he believed to be his duty ; and in this there was no abatement until death relieved him . " Similar testimonies have been received from other associates of Mr. Sumner in the Senate , as ex-Senators Morrill , of Maine , and Logan , of Illinois , and Senators Anthony , Windom , and Spencer ) but there is not space to insert them here . Senator Sherman , of Ohio , now Secretary of the Treasury , in the debate on Mr. Snmner 's removal , March 10 , 1871 , while considering himself bound by the action of the caucus , declared the change " unjustifiable , impolitic , and nnnecessary ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tribute to his memory bore testimony to his remarkable fidelity . The leading promoters of the removal admitted in the debate his perfect fidelity , and no Senator alleged or hinted the slightest default either in the committee or in the Senate , whether arising from inattention , obstructiveness , or any other cause . That was left for the fertile imaginations of Mr. Fish and Mr. Davis . The breach of personal ( not official ) relations between the Secretary and the Senator was assigned as the cause of the removal by its advocates in the Senate debate of March 10 , 1871 . But it was shown at the time that Mr. Sumner was always ready to confer freely with Mr. Fish on public business , and indeed had done so but a few weeks previous , and that the breach of personal relations was caused by " a gross insult , " so called in debate , which Mr. Fish had given Mr. Sumner in the dispatch to Mr. Moran of December 30 , 1870 , previous to which they had been engaged in friendly intercourse and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it was termed by Senator Schurz , did not avail at the time to mislead the public . The debates in the caucus and in the Senate , and the public journals in their leaders , paragraphs , and correspondence , pointed to Mr. Sumner 's determined opposition to the San Domingo scheme and his exposure of the proceedings of its leading promoters as the motive or justification of his displacement . The reasons for Mr. Sumner 's removal heretofore given having failed , Mr. Davis has attempted a new one , which no assailant of Mr. Sumner hitherto has ventured to suggest , viz. , that the Senator by a memorandum of January 17 , 1871 , sent by him to Mr. Fish , in answer to a call for his advice as to the negotia // tions with Great Britain for the settlement of the Alabama claims and other questions , proposed that " the withdrawal of the British flag from Canada can not be abandoned as a condition or preliminary of such a settlement . " This , according to Mr. Davis , was communicated by Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governed in their votes by the communication , making them , as he says , " their practical answer " to the memorandum ; and he then states that for diplomatic purposes this reason was not given to the public , but only the reason " that Mr. Sumner was not on speaking terms with the President and with Mr. Fish . " The presumption is against Senators having been influenced by such an argument , if it had been used . It is not customary , on account of a difference on a single measure involving no party passions , to dismiss a chairman from a post he has held with universal approval for a long period , but it is found easier and more consistent with the proprieties to vote him down on that question than to remove him altogether from his place . A few considerations show this newly-devised explanation of Mr. Sumner 's removal to be absurd . No such reason was given at the time of the removal , either in the caucus on March 9 , 1871 , or in the Senate on March 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . The " non-speaking " reason , and that alone , was insisted on by Senators who advocated the removal . If the embarrassment of negotiations had been a reason , it would have been given at once . Mr. Davis intimates that it would have been " the height of indiscretion " to give the reason while negotia-* tions were pending ; but why so * The removal of a chairman who was making exorbitant demands against Great Britain would have shown our friendly disposition , and made negotiations easier . But no attempt to conceal a reason operating on the minds of Senators could have succeeded . In some way the reporters would have discovered it . Nothing is more easy to detect than the considerations governing the action of public men who are codperating in the support of a measure . Mr. Davis 's explanation why this reason remained a profound secret will not stand a moment 's scrutiny . If reasons of state required Senators to keep this cause for the removal a secret , the secret would have come out when those reasons of state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the Treaty of // Washington had been concluded and ratified in June , 1871 . The fact that this alleged cause for removal was not made public then , or whenever after the causes of the removal were canvassed by Senators , proves that it never existed , that it never had any place in their minds , that it was never communicated to them . It was not mentioned by Mr. Conkling when he defended the removal in his speech at Cooper Institute , July 23 , 1872 ; nor in the debate in the Senate , April 28 , 1874 , when it was explained or defended by Howe , Hamlin , Anthony , and Cameron ; nor by Mr. Fish himself in his interviews and letters of October 19 , October 29 , and November 10 , 1877 ; nor by any one except Mr. Davis , and by him only after the pretext of unreported treaties had been disproved . Mr. Howe , writing so recently as in the last number of this IREvIEw , gives only the non-interconrse reason , thus lending no sanction to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a justification of the removal , was thus an after-thought , taking the place of another after-thought , which had failed . The statement , then , that any position of Mr. Sumner in relation to the acquisition of Canada was in the mind of any Senator when voting for his removal , or was ever communicated to any Senator as a reason for removal , may fairly take its place with the charge that he never reported the nine treaties . But who are " the leading Senators " with whom Mr. Fish is said to have conferred ? Were not the two Messrs . Morrill , Messrs . Schurz , Sherman , Trumbull , and Wilson , as leading Senators as any who favored Mr. Sumner 's removal ? These all , however , sustained him in caucus . Either , then , Mr. Fish did not communicate this argument to them or to any of the twenty-one who voted in Mr. Sumner 's favor in the caucus , or , if he did , they placed no reliance upon it . If he withheld it from the twenty-one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voted for the removal in the caucus , upon what principle of selection did he proceed ? Were the Senators who voted for removal any more pacific in disposition toward England than those who voted against it ? Among the former was Mr. Chandler , who was most zealous against Mr. Sumner ; but it was he who made , in April , 1869 , the most aggressive speech against England ever made in Congress , and who then proposed to obtain by negotiation a surrender of all the British possessions in North Ameri*a // as the basis for a settlement of our claims , and who , in the same speech , recited the offensive propositions he had from time to time made , such as the withdrawal of our minister from the court of St. James 's , the repeal of the neutrality laws , the declaration of our neutrality between England and Abyssinia , and who said that " the sixty thousand veteran soldiers of Michigan will take the contract to take possession of the Canadas in thirty days . " Indeed , Mr. Chandler , who proposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sumner for desiring only a peaceful acquisition , with full consent of England , and of Canada also , would be an interesting spectacle ! Surely he was not one of " the leading Senators . " Nor could there have been among them , for reasons already given , Messrs . Conkling , Howe , Hamlin , Cameron , or Anthony . Who , then , were the nameless , undesignated " leading Senators " to whom Mr. Fish made known the memorandum which , as now alleged , he then thought a fatal obstruction to an important negotiation  --  a secret , kept so well for seven years , and now first revealed by Mr. Davis ? If it were true that Mr. Fish ever made the communication to Senators which Mr. Davis now alleges , such communication would also have been made , first of all , to the President , before even it was mentioned to a Senator . But General Grant , in all his justifications of Mr. Sumner 's removal , puts forth two only , " the pigeon-holing " and " the non-speaking " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the summer of 1871 , at Long Branch , and in his interviews in Scotland in September , 1877 , and at Cairo in January , 1878 , without ever making the remotest allusion to the reason which Mr. Davis now resorts to when the others have failed . Again , and finally , as showing that no views of Mr. Sumner about Canada ever prompted a vote for his removal , it should be remembered that the removal was attempted at the beginning of the session , in December , 1870 , and threatened in debate , on December 21st , some weeks before the memorandum of January 17 , 1871 , about Canada was written . Mr. Davis assumes to give the terms of Mr. Sumner 's memorandum of January 17 , 1871 . Taking it as given , Mr. Sumner appears to have thought the proximity to us of the British possessions a cause of irritation and disturbance , by furnishing a // basis of operations for Fenianism , and , in order to make the settlement complete and prevent all controversy in the future , he proposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this continent . This proposition was neither dishonorable nor unstatesmanlike , and it is in harmony with the best opinions of our time . The single sentence of the memorandum already given alone invites criticism ; but by those words , written not in a formal paper , and signed only with initials , he meant merely to say , as the event showed , that the cession of British America should be our first request in order to reach , as a final consummation , perpetual peace between the two nations . That this was his thought is shown by other expressions in the memorandum , as where , cordially accepting Sir John Rose 's idea that all causes of irritation should be removed , he added : " Nothing could be better than this initial idea . It should be the starting-point . " That he laid no greater stress on this part of his memorandum , appears clearly enough from a letter he wrote soon after to George Bemis , in which , mentioning the fact of his memorandum , he refers to the clause in it concerning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reference to the clause concerning Canada . But , as demonstrating that he held no impracticable , no obstructive position about Canada , this fact alone is sufficient-that he supported in the Senate the Treaty of Washington , and while he criticised some omissions and moved certain amendments , and spoke at length upon its various provisions , he made no complaint that it did not provide for the cession of Canada ; and , indeed , made no reference to the matter whatever . This was not the first occasion on which Mr. Sumner had shown his desire for the acquisition of British America , as he had already supported that of Russian America . Always , however , he insisted that it should be made by peaceful annexation-by the voluntary act of England , and with the cordial assent of the colonists . This view appears in his speech at the Republican State Convention at Worcester , September 22 , 1869 , where he recalled the aspirations of our fathers for the union of all Englishmen in America , and their invitation to Canada to join our new nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prophetic of political unity ; and pictured our country as hereafter destined to // cover the continent " from the frozen sea to the tepid waters of the Mexican Gulf ; " but , referring to the whispers of territorial compensation for our claims against England with territory as the consideration , he rejected such a solution altogether , except with the full concurrence of Canada herself , declaring with emphasis , " Territory may be conveyed , but not a people . " Is there anything in this aspiration unworthy , visionary , or impracticable ? Rather is there not something in it lofty and inspiring ? Everywhere races of common origin and speech are gravitating to oneness and solidarity . Such is the lesson of history , and such also is the spectacle of our era . This generation has seen Italy rise from a geographical expression to a national entity-her various kingdoms , duchies , pontifical states , provinces of a foreign dynasty , all becoming one country , which stretches the length of the historic peninsula . It has seen likewise Germany , no longer a mere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one people , and realizing the Fatherland of patriotism and of song . At this hour it sees in the far East the Greek race , in whose language mankind has found its culture , its philosophy , and its religion , yearning for a nationality commensurate with the common speech , and centred in a renowned capital on the iEgean or the Bosporus . Such a generation will respond with sympathy to Sumner 's thought of Canada joining speedily the sisterhood of American States , even if , with a seer 's instinct , he anticipated , as he often did , the fullness of time . In the final week of his life , even on the very day he left the Senate for the last time , at whose close he was smitten with mortal agony , he was finishing his " Prophetic Voices concerning America , " in which he had gathered what from age to age had been foretold of her greatness and destiny ; and among these he placed his friend Cobden 's contemplation of the coming union of Canada with us . What nobler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : That after an illustrious career of devotion to universal liberty , carrying into age the fresh hopes of youth , he died , cherishing fondly the vision that the country he had loved and served was to grow in peace to an empire wide as the domains of the English-speaking race on this continent !
