THERE was a female population of ten years and over of 13,970 ,  - -  079 in the United States , according to the last census , and of this 1,439,320 , a trifle over one-tenth , were engaged in various trades and occupations . The bulk of this one-tenth consisted of domestic servants , 867,354 . In numbers next came the tailors and seamstresses , 97,207 ; next milliners and dressmakers , 90,480 ; next teachers , 84,047 ; next cotton-mill operatives , 64,398 ; next laundresses , 55,609 ; next nurses , 10,170 ; and next boarding-house keepers , 7,060 . To separate the servants from the others shows that not more than 371,966 women at that period ( 1870 ) were engaged in the various trades , professions , and occupations , which is a small number compared to that of other countries . It is further shown that a number of occupations for which women seem well fitted do not attract them , or obstacles are thrown in the way to prevent them from engaging therein . On the other hand , according to the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem to be altogether unfit ted , as may be seen in the following descriptive list : Hunters and trappers 2 Livery stable keepers 11 Sextons Boat hands 30 Drivers and hackinen 196 Pilot 1 Miners 48 Saw mill operatives Steam boiler makers 8 Charcoal and lime barners 5 The number of boarding-house keepers is considerably greater than is given , owing to the difficulty of obtaining accurate information . The desire to appear well is so strong , in many instances , that she who is engaged in this way will not admit it to the agent of the census bureau , the stereotyped reply being that the family is private - that feeling lonely and being socially disposed , she usually has a few friends staying with her to enliven her home . She maintains this under rigid questioning , and as the working of the census bureau rests on the system of voluntary statement , it is not easy to get at the truth . Thus if she persists in appearing in the statistical record as a social widow surrounded with a few convivial friends , she may not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American woman who is without special training , she has but one way of keeping her head above water , which is taking in boarders . It is a thin veil thrown over a catastrophe persistently ignored . The woman may be down in the struggle , but she contrives to hold aloft that shabby flag on which she has inscribed " genteel . " The inability of the woman to undertake any other way of making a living than in keeping a boardinghouse shows how helpless she is in her icrnorance-an ignorance that is characteristic rather of woman in the upper walks of life than in the lower , for the " accomplishments " which she acquires are not learned with a view of using them in a practical way . Yet there are some women wrecked on social reefs , and stranded on boarding-house sand-bars , who might find more solid footing , but the absorbing sentiment of the " genteel " compels their unused faculties to sleep . The simple and independent existence earned in making bonnets , for instance , in their opinion , is not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offers the comforts of a home for a consideration . Here we encounter that word " lady , " whose constant use has worn it threadbare and rendered it almost as shabby as its poor relation " gented . " It is an infliction which pervades the ranks of women from the // mistress of a Madison avenue mansion to the scullion in the basement , and has become so soiled by use and misuse that one takes hold of it warily . The " genteel " husband writes on the hotel register after his own name , " and lady " ; that simple word wife not being up to the mark . A " lady " advertises in the " Herald " that she wants a situation to do chamber work . Another desires a place as nurse . As far as women are concerned , we have come to be a nation of ladies . The desire to be a lady is consuming ; the cook is insulted if she is told she is not one . A drunken , profane woman is ejected from a street car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lady , begorra . Ascending the social scale there is the same deep-rooted determination to be a lady in others , found in the heart of the cook and the ejected woman . If fashion decrees that the mistress , to vindicate her right to such a title , shall wear a robe en chczmeau , Bridget follows in her traces as closely as her feeble sense of art will permit . A fond impression exists that the claim to such a title remains unimpaired in keeping a boarding-house . There is the semblance of hospitality in it ; the " comforts of a home are offered , " as if the guest were entertained without price . " None but ladies and gentlemen of the highest respectability are received " into it . The aspirant to this board is thus given to know that those who gather around it with prandial intent are high in the social scale and very exclusive . It would be more gratifying to some minds to know that the beefsteak were tender than to be informed of the exact social status of those who eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If the subject is referred to , it is as something incidental , and daily effort is made to ignore the object of the guest 's presence at the table . If a remark is ventured as to the want of tenderness in the said steak , it is regarded as a personal reflection , and perhaps an affront , by the person who presides over the establishment . In a word , she is often so highly respectable as to neglect and rather disdain to do what she has undertaken to do , and belongs to the class of those who are above their business . If a delicate complaint is met with an account of the loss of the husband or father , and that inevitable " rev&amp;se of fortune , " with perhaps a tear , the complainer , under pain of being a brute , must thereafter hold his peace , and eat his leathery meat in silent resignation . That old proverb which says that there are no foolish callings , but only foolish people in them , teaches a lesson . To do the work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it as well as he can , means both wisdom and happiness ; and the same is true as to woman . The harassing doubts as to the respectability of the calling mar the life and take away the dignity of manhood . The boarding-house as a temporary accommodation is useful , but its influence has been mischievous to American society , in weakening the home feeling and developing a gregarious spirit . To live in a crowd has become a habit . The boarder in his vacation does not seek that secluded nook in the country profitable to mind and body , but hies him to another board ing-house or hotel to meet other crowds where he continues to live in communication with the public . Instead of settling alongside of a brook with rod and line and a few companionable volumes , he lounges on a veranda or threads the German , taking his town life with him . The privacy of family life is not an enjoyment , which under natural conditions it would be . The delicate relations and expansion of home do not exist , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is but little distinction between its intercourse and that which it extends to acquaintances , through lacking opportunities . The growth of the finer sentiments is dwarfed in such an atmosphere . There are comparatively few people // of the large cities who have the love of a country home in their hearts , owing to what they cons*ler its isolation . There is no " society " there . They depend on others for their daily quota of happiness , and do not think of drawing on themselves . This is nationally characteristic of both rich and poor . The rich man builds or buys a fine house in a group of other fine houses at the springs or the seaside , in the midst of a crowd of his fellows ; the poor man buys a tenement in a row of other tenements or goes into the cheap boarding-house . There does not seem to be sufficient individuality in either to stand solidly and reliantly on his own legs . The money which a family spends in three or four seasons of Newport or Saratoga would buy a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an educator of manhood and womanhood would be worth more than any " society " that ever existed . Children would grow up with the trees and become natural like them , instead of the poor creatures which one so often sees in " society . " Family ties would become stronger , as well as home virtues . The first step of the woman who desires to go out of the routinary orni*re is to make herself independent , as far as may be , in regard to the material wants of life . The sense of freedom thus conferred in a self-respecting person is a source of much enjoyment . The first move in this direction is the practice of economy until it becomes a habit . Next comes an acquaintance with the ordinary details of domestic life and a habit of depending on herself for primary wants , such as the preparation of her food and the making of her raiment . The woman who can cook her own food , make a robe and a bonnet , has already accomplished most of the journey which leads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want of cleanliness often associated in the mind with the preparation of food , which comes from seeing people do it who are coarse and ignorant . The sight of a little French interior does much to remove such an idea . In a dwelling of two rooms and a diminutive kitchen , the house wife will perform all the duties of the household without help , for herself and mate , and remain tidy and attractive through it all . She will make the raiment with which she is clothed , and in addition will work at lace , artificial flowers , or what not , to contribute to the family purse . If she be alone in the world , with such accomplishments , her independence is almost assured . In that case one room and the kitchen of 4x5 suffice . In the small piece the cooking is done in the daintiest and cleanliest manner ; the other room serves as dining-room , bed-chamber , and drawing-room , and contains nothing to offend the eye or the nose . At the window of this well-kept room the inmate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is no misery in sight ; on the contrary a canary bird pleases the ear with its song , and a pot of flowers gratifies the sight . She is plainly clad , but in nothing that offends the eye of an artist . Her little table does not bear the luxuries of the season , but the homely , wholesome food which nourishes a healthy body . She has solved one of the chief problems of life ; she has adapted her wants to her means , and all her wants are satisfied . This woman is rich . This shows that the performance of household duties is not necessarily offensive , even to persons of refinement . An untidy Bridget seen in the kitchen is almost enough to take away the appetite ; a neat person in the same place gives a new flavor to the food . There is a disposition among us to look down on household work as something menial and unworthy of women . In many instances they prefer to employ help and increase the expense of living until bankruptcy arrives , then evade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a course , it is hardly necessary to say , would keep their hands and souls // cleaner by scrubbing their own floors and basting their own roasts . This is the pride of wearing fine garments and feasting on woodcock and champagne without heeding how they are to be paid for , yet disdaining the useful and wifely work of a family . Here is presented an interesting question in ethics . The moral sense takes different forms in different countries . The Greek pilgrim , having bathed in the Jordan where Christ was baptized , believes himself sure of heaven and entitled to a large license in the conduct of life . In Sparta it was not so much the crime of stealing as the discovery which was culpable . In France bankruptcy is social ostracism , and in the United States it is an event which hardly affects the social position . The married woman of France who distributes her favors to others than her husband may possibly be regarded with indulgence , but if she attempts to cheat her creditors she is hurried before the tribunals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband in evading creditors by having property transferred to her , but she may not put stabs in the marriage contract . It is well , therefore , not to assume moral superiority , for virtue is more or less relative or conventional . The young woman who has a natural aptitude for the art of preparing food , and hesitates about going in among the pans on account of what she considers the humbleness of such occupation , is informed that many great people , even kings and queens , have occupied themselves with the kitchen , and with a zeal which gladdened the heart of Brillat-Savarin as he recorded it . More , if the gastronomic traditions of France may be credited , women sometimes ruled the State through their knowledge of the kitchen . A few years ago the worthy Prof. Blot endeaVored to create good housewives , but the hour and the man did not come together , for when he strove to turn women 's thoughts kitchenward their ears were deaf . His effort was made in the era of financial plethora , when the idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and his wise counsels were unheeded . The forerunner of the hygienic and economical cuisine held aloft a loaf of wholesome bread , saying it was the foundation of human happiness ; the women tittered , and yet it was true . With the enthusiasm of a reformer he offered to teach women how to turn dyspeptic stomachs into healthy ones , and consequently miserable husbands and fathers into members of a happy family . Again the women tittered , and continued to titter , until the apostle of the kitchen , finding that his glad tidings fell on ears that did not understand , became discouraged and withdrew into obscurity , whither a few of the faithful followed him , but even these abandoned him after a time , and then he died . The Professor came in the spirit of a missionary possessed of a scheme of propagandism . The symbols of his office were soup and bread , for they were the principal auxiliaries by which the gastronomic tenets were to be spread . He proposed to make of a restless , eager , unsatisfied people a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the household , and consequently to change thriftless , idle , extravagant women into good wives and mothers . It was nothing less than a revolution which the Frenchman contemplated . Some who comprehended the scope of his mission listened to him , but with apathy . The greater part smiled when the propagandist of wholesome nourishment unfolded his scheme , accompanied with Gallic zeal , gesture , and accent . The thing itself and its exponent appeared to be ludicrous . So he preached and taught in vain . That the man exaggerated the importance of his plan is doubtless true , but there was much in it worthy of serious consideration . Had he appeared among us ten or fifteen years laterthat is , in the present and the time to come-he would have found the ground // in a better condition for the seed , which had been thrown on barren soil . Many a woman who thoughtlessly laughed at the Professor would now lend a willing ear to his voice , for necessity is an imperious master . The young woman , without neglecting the *esthetical part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future husband familiarize herself with the practical matters of the household . This acquaintance with the values of the necessities of the household simplifies housekeeping and relieves the husband of a burden . Indeed , this knowledge should more properly form part of the duties of the wife . The kitchen is still a more important matter , and the woman should know how to manage it , for unless she possesses such knowledge the cook is not apt to do her duty . There is an affectation of ignorance on this and kindred matters in many fashionable young women which , it is to be hoped , will soon go out of fashion . The effort which Mrs. Crawshay made in London to organize " lady help " was naturally a failure . To do her own domestic duty , let alone that of others , is as much as can reasonably be expected of a person of education and independence , and when she arrives at the point of doing this , she does remarkably well , both in the duty she performs and in the example which she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ servants , recruited from gentlewomen , is one of those impracticable schemes so frequently born in the minds of the self-appointed leaders and reformers of society who pass their time on the rostrum in the midst of preambles and resolutions . The publicity obtained in these platform plans has probably more to do with their formation than a sincere desire to ameliorate the condition of woman , for the first step which is made toward her improvement is to place her on a platform , and turn the subject into a show business . She is put forward in the lyceums to recite her wrongs and claim her rights-into county fairs to contend for ridiculous premiums , such as for the longest hair , the greatest stature , and the largest baby . It may be safely assumed that modest and industrious women can never be trained in this way . In a word , they should never be taught to abandon that purity and unobtrusiveness of manner which is the natural attribute of their sex . This modesty of demeanor and of dress is the chief charm of attractive women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and robes of glaring color , are an abomination in the sight of the true man . To this the women of " our set " may observe that they do not wear such things , but whether they do or not these gewgaws must still be considered as national ornaments , for they are met at every turn . But there is a growing custom which is worse than that of wearing jewelry : face painting-faces painted to hard , unnatural white and rose tints , and eyes that are koheled . These are the characteristics of a woman that shall be nameless , but many thus equipped are comprised in the category of honest women , and would resent being taken for what they appear to be , with that indignation of which the virtuous person is supposed to be always fully supplied . Paint is not confined to the matured and maturing beauties who are doubling the critical capes of the thirties and the forties , but is reaching the faces of the young women . This painting of the lily is matter of regret , for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beauty of her complexion , the delicate nu*ance of it being recognized in the term of " the American tint . " To move away from the artistic side and look on the moral one , it appears still worse . Ten or fifteen years ago the calling of the woman who wore a painted visage was undoubted ; it was to a certain extent the sign of her commerce , and there are yet old-fashioned people who judge a painted face with the eyes of the past . The motive which leads her to this // qwq Hence , most of the managers of the better class metropolitan theatres are pursued with applications from young women for engagements . Most of them are without more preparation than that furnished by a few lessons from a professor of elocution , and they generally ask to be allowed the principal parts when they are unequal in most cases to the subordinate ones . They occasionally persuade managers to receive them because the dramatic public treats them with leniency or because it is not critical , and as long as this is allowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be in America what it has been in the pasta place of indifferent amusement to people of culture . The elementary lesson which every young woman should learn , who has a talent for the stage , is to speak good English ; when she achieves this it is time enough to think of the technical features of the new calling . In the best theatres of New York there is not one actress in five who speaks her language correctly . Good , healthy English-such , for instance , as that of Ada Dyas-free from the old stage accent , is exceedingly rare . Grace of movement and gesture , voice modulation , and dramatic expression , however important they may be , should not be thought of until the pupil is able to speak her mother tongue . To a novice the theatrical profession is as deceptive as it is attractive . In the event of failure , ordinary occupations become dull to the eye which has danced with excitement behind the footlights . Theatrical intoxication , in a word , is apt to interfere with the performance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind it is work , often in the midst of jealousies and discussions , and unless the young woman possesses talents which ensure sucess , she had better turn to some less brilliant but more reliable occupation . To become a painter in oil , the woman must throw aside certain considerations in which she has been educated . One of these arrests her at the threshold , the primary one of the profession , which is painting from the human figure . If she is not prepared to disregard this one , it is hardly worth while to continue , for she can never compose groups of figures who has not studied them after nature . If she really wishes to be a painter , and not a weak dabbler in colors , she must be ready to adopt some of the habits of the man , such as being complete master of her time , going off in the country without restraint to draw and paint whatever she fancies , exposing herself to all kinds of weather . Talent and industry do not suffice ; there must be opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of art , and consequently an ear absolutely deaf to the decrees of society . Domestic charges here stand in the way of progress , and the woman , like the man , is better without them . Art has no sex . In literature the woman has already done much , , as shown in the work of such women as Miss Thackeray , Mrs. Edwards , Miss Braddon , Miss Eliot , Mrs. Stowe , Mine . Sand , Th . Bentzon , and others , who furnish more than half the novels of the day . She contributes her share to the magazines and weekly journals , showing as much aptitude therefor as the man . In painting she is rather behind in the English-speaking countries , but in France the woman has made more progress , and it may be reasonably expected that the woman here will follow in her footsteps . The field for drawing has been widening in America during the last few years , and begins to offer advantages to the woman who has a taste in this direction . As usual in art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supply the demand in illustrated magazines and newspapers , which should be supplied here . Where the woman does not possess sufficient talent to succeed in this , she might apply herself profitably to wood engraving , which requires little more than perseverance and delicacy of touch . It is given to a comparative few to // meet the requirements of accepted actresses , singers , writers , and painters , but there are other fields not yet entered on which offer work admirably adapted to woman 's hands , indicated in the advertisements of the journals of the day . This indeed is one of the best places to learn the condition of each department of work . The making of artificial flowers , for instance , has assumed considerable proportions , and the supply of workers has been for years behind the demand , as the advertisements show . Taste and finger dexterity are necessary to excel in it , and these belong more to woman than to man . The best workwomen in this branch of industry are brought from France , chiefly because the women who engage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who makes herself mistress of this occupation sees her way to the head of an establishment of half a dozen workwomen , the enjoyment of her independence and of doing a branch of artistic work which she understands . Two of the most profitable callings are chiefly in the hands of foreigners - bonnet and dress making . Here , as in everything else where taste and manual dexterity are required , the Frenchwoman , according to the common opinion , surpasses all others . This is owing in some measure to the fact that a more cultivated class of women engage in the business in France than here . The principal fault in the American seamstress seems to be that she settles down to senseless servile labor , and does not strive to educate herself up to the requirements of her occupation . Such a one is employed and directed by her French sister , who is continually exercising her mind with the questions of taste and profit . The profession of keeping accounts is one for which woman seems to be well adapted , and in the era of economy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will probably find it to their interest to employ her . She is well fitted for the duties of selling at retail in the dry goods , variety , lace , and jewelry shops , in which she is engaged , but not to the extent that she might be . The woman finds work in the printing houses , but under discouragement from the trades unions ; indeed , these male organizations have thrown obstacles in her way in other directions . She has shown herself a skilful telegraphic operator , and might also be a good stenographer if she made the effort . Watchmaking is a trade for which she is especially adapted , yet comparatively few are engaged in it . Other crafts suggest themselves in which women might do well ; such as the making of lace , embroidery , curtains , locks , keys , brushes , silk ; spinning in cotton and wool ; cutting in silver ; working in polished steel , patent leather , artificial teeth , crystal ; carving in wood ; manufacturing perfumery ; operating sewing machines ; and painting porcelain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with success , at a moderate remuneration , but which would of course be more profitable in the United States , where labor is higher . Since men will shave or have themselves shaved , the doing of it might better be confided to the woman than the man , on account of the delicacy of her hands and softness of touch . Her appearance as a barber would probably create some masculine merriment , which in the end would die away in silent satisfaction . Her gentleness renders her efficient as a teacher , and what is often of more importance to her than efficiency , the calling of such a one is still within the domain of respectability . She has the pas of the boarding-house keeper , and walks intellectually on a higher level . She feeds the mind , while the other feeds the body . If she has an aptitude for imparting instruction , it is commendable in her to teach , but if she is incapable as a teacher and knows how to make a dress , the path of duty is clear . Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through devotion to respectability , which is an epidemic throughout the country . If she enters on the making of dresses with fear and trembling , Lit her perturbed soul be quieted with the knowledge that a French princess did the same work in London with a delightful unconsciousness of doing anything that implied a coming down . " So far there has been a lack of earnestness and patience in women who desire to fit themselves for special occupations . The sooner they become convinced of the necessity of serving a regular apprenticeship the better . If they are to compete with men , they must go through the same training ; without this their work will be inferior , and their wages consequently less . The present custom of paying less for work because it is a woman 's is unjust , but it will doubtless in the end give way to a more equitable mode of settlement , brought about by that commercial value of the production in which there is no recognition of sex . John Stuart Mill says that " the things in which man most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hammering at single thoughts , " but there seems to be no especial reason why it should be so in professions where the endowments of the woman are equal to those of the man and where her physical characteristics are not an obstacle to their pursuit . Woman is stronger and has greater power of endurance than is generally believed . The other day a woman swain ten miles in the Thames . There are few men who could do as much . The mare has the swiftness and endurance of the horse , and if the woman were permitted to enjoy the natural advantages of the man , in training , pastime , and work , she would not lag much behind him . Complaint has been made against the saleswomen in the shops , by purchasers of their own sex , to the effect that they are lacking in roliteness compared to the salesmen . That both sexes in this department of work are 4 wanting in this respect is probably true , but the women are hardly more so than the men . There are establishments where both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be desired , which , regretful to state , comes from instructions so strict that any dereliction therefrom is equivalent to dismissal . This is a question of money , for the employer knows that politeness augments his business . Indeed , it is a matter of such importance that it is difficult to understand how an employer permits any other course in those who sell his wares . In some women as well as men there is a stubborn resistance to that civility in word and gesture necessary in the sale of goods , which arises from the notion that to be thus is to be servile . When they divest themselves of this idea , it will be better for them and their employers . It is but just to add in their behalf that the purchasers are sometimes exacting and irritating , and an uncommonly good temper is required to bear therewith . But no purchaser , however trying she may be , can long resist uniform courtesy , and at last she is shamed into propriety of manner through the mental contrast which she in the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The reflection must come to her mindunless her nature be much warpedthat though she has an equipage at the door , the woman before her is more of a gentlewoman than she , and thus she is constrained to imitate her . On the other hand many a purchaser is stimulated to exaction by the stolidity of the saleswoman she encounters  --  a provoking phlegm and stiffness which make bargaining difficult . Thus , if the buyer is sharp and decided in manner , it is sometimes because she is provoked to it by a like manner in the seller . She who is engaged as seller in a shop would do well to bear in mind that she is there to make her way in the world , and that the mode of doing it successfully is by selling as much as possible . In // other words , she must be in earnest ; and if she is so , no prompting from her employer will be required to make her polite , for she will understand that it is as much to her interest as to his . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be traced to the door of the woman . The head of the family toils and harasses himself in business to provide with money wife and daughters who are consumers producing nothing-idlers , who as such get into the habit of gossip , frivolity , and philandering . On one side it is all work , on the other all play , which is an unjust and unnatural division . The toiler spends perhaps $10,000 a year to satisfy the seekers of pleasure , for which he receives a meagre consideration , if the matter be judged after that standard of equivalent for equivalent by which the affairs of the world are regulated . He may be regarded as a lodger and partial boarder in his own house , seeing something of its inmates every seventh day . Through the pleasure-seeking of mothers and daughters his spiritual as well as material wants are indifferently attended to , for such women rarely make affectionate comforters or good housewives . The roast is over or underdone , and the shirt is minus a button or two . It is surprising how a group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ withstand a stroke of adversity with a degree of fortitude , but the little pin-pricks of a domestic life badly regulated overcome him . This is the return for his outlay . There are some things of which no estimate can be made in dollars and cents , such as the affectionate ties which unite a family ; but in a family such as is here referred to the bonds of union are apt to be weak , owing to the divergence which exists between the worker and the idlers in thoughts , aims , and occupation . They look in different directions ; his eyes are set on the lower end of the town , to that financial wheel which he is doomed to turn theirs on Central Park , the opera , and the soir6e . To take a commercial view of it , the $10,000 must be regarded as a poor investment in this case ; and yet it is to some extent the man 's fault , for the moral and intellectual condition of the woman generally depends upon him . He has suffered the woman to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her going to and fro in pleasure rounds , and her misdirecting of the household , instead of asserting his rights as master of it . One of the customs of such a mis* tress , most subversive of order in home life , is that of keeping up a large circle of friends and acquaintances . It thins down friendship to attenuation . Those who have a right to expect a gen erous. part of it through family ties or long associations get a meagre share in the general spread . Extended relations with society , in a word , have a tendency to dry up the heart as far as true and abiding friendships are concerned . Thus , what is given to society is generally taken from the home circle . Were the sweetness gathered up which the visiting woman dispenses in a dozen houses in a day it would make a bouquet that would perfume the domestic hearth for an indefinite time . Especially since the war have woman 's housing and trappings become a heavy tax to man . The Indian has his wigwam , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nature is wise in the selection of her abode , and instinct builds according to the wants of the occupants . It is left to a crude civilization to construct that which is ill adapted to the requirements of a true home . Man 's primary wants are air , light , sun , shelter , a couch , and a seat . The departure is wide of the starting point . The spirit of ostentation is seen in the surcharged ornamentation of the houses without , and to some extent within . To many eyes the gilt , glitter , and vivid coloring of a monster second-class hotel , or the dwelling of a man risen to sudden affluence , are still beautiful , producing much the same effect which a Broadway stage does on the eyes of the sim // pie savage . The striking crudities are blazes of glory . The manifestations of this ostentatious spirit were greater a half a score of years ago , when the tongue somewhat ingenuously told what was passing in the mind in what has come to be regarded as American brag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ houses remain as monuments of brag and bad taste . A successful stock-jobber is lauded for his wealth , lives according to his estimated fortune , which death or accident reveals to be but a small part of that attributed to him . The admiration for wealth is taking deeper root than ever , and what is most desired after the substance is the shadow ; that'is , the reputation of possessing a fortune not possessed . There is want of solidity and simplicity , and the foundations of wealth are not secure . Most of the houses have mortgages on them , and securities are variable . Every few years a panic sweeps over the country , and scarcely any man 's possessions remain intact . To possess a fortune once in an old country is to possess it for a lifetime ; here it is apt to slip through the fingers every time a failure of the crops or a commercial panic happens . What most powerfully contributes to this instability of fortune is the love of ostentation which induces people to live beyond their means . Only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a social inflation and crude luxury prevalent . Hotels are full of looking-glass and paint-and the food is poor . Restaurants abound in marble-top ta1*les and marble floors , and semi-civilized refreshment . Splendors are often found in the dwellings of the rich to the neglect of home comforts . A general spangle invests society . It is like an Oriental town seen at a distance with its graceful minarets and glinting domes , which , on near approach , proves to be far from what it promised . The gorgeous dwelling is a house of glass , where that which transpires around the hearthstone is visible to the hundreds that go by . The Briton erects walls , if need be , to screen the family from the public gaze . This sentiment is not characteristic of the American , and he calls the Englishman 's desire for privacy exclusiveness . The dweller in the transparent house , living for strangers as much as for his own flesh and blood , is as mindful of his effects as the manager of a theatre preparing a stage scene . Any one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With the absence of privacy there is naturally absence of simplicity and naturalness , for they go together . There is not thoroughness in this house of glass ; some of its pictures are bad , although they bear the name of genius ; some of its precious stones are off-colored , its library does not contain books that are bought to be read , and half of its wine-cellar is poison . It is the story of suddenly acquired wealth , which is as old as the world . ALBERT RHODES .
