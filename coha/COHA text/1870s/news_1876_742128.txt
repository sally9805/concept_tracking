txt It is all very well for certain theologians to argue that man is a . free agent , but they can hardly reconcile this dogma with the fact that he can not select his ? own hair . Nature deals out the regulation supply of hair to each new infant without consulting in the slightest degree the taste of the infant or that of its parents . It thus happens that there is a vast amount of disatisfaction among mankind in respect to hair . The light-haired sigh vainly for dark hair , and the dark-haired yearn for unattainable golden locks . Men whose moral nature imperatively demand curly hair are mocked with hair that is as hopelessly straight as the spine of a ritualistic clergyman ; while the African , whose hair curls naturally and closely , longs for , heaven as a place whore crooked hair is made forever straight . Of course , there are expedients by which sanguine natures try to modify and improve their hair , but they are , after all , vain and unsatisfactory . Those who hanker after golden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ardently desired , can have their original hair bleached and painted , but the result is not worth the trouble and expense . The intelligent public is never deceived into confounding counterfeit hair with genuine golden hair , or into mistaking the blue-black ' dye that conceals the grizzled locks of an ancient beau for the work of nature . Moreover , the process of dyeing the hair is at best a risky one . A black oar , or a golden nose are not to be desired , and yet a slight accident with the dye-bottle may suddenly produce those startling phenomena . Occasionally , too , the dye penetrates to the brain of the user , and the result is a yellow-brained , or blackminded lunatic . Still more unsatisfactory is that hollowmockery , the wig . No matter how skillfully it may be made , its insincerity forces itself upon the notice of every It is the those who have yielded to temptation in the shape of hair-dye that it is better to wear the hair we have than to dye with drugs that can not satisfy the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who does not know in his secret heart that even the wild Indian of the Plains would view that wig with scorn and hatred , were it brought to the notice of his discriminating tomahawk . Painful and hopeless as have hitherto been man 's relations with his hair , a great discovery has just been made , which will not only enable us all to undergo a permanent change of hair , but which even places within reach of the intelligent leopard a sure and easy method of changing his spots . Like many other great discoveries , this was made by accident , and though it incidentally cost a number of lives , it will be hold , in the estimation of most lathes , an extremely cheap discovery at the price . A year ago the British ship Strathmore was wrecked on one of the Crozet Islands , a group of rocks that are situated below the bottom of the page hi most geographies , and are , indeed , among the most southern bits of land on the globe . The survivors , who at first found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ island , were obliged to subsist exclusively upon penguin 's eggs . The penguin , as all students of natural history know , is a large , fat bird , which sits on the extremity of its tail feathers , and divides its time between laying eggs and laying plans for the capture of ? fish . The eggs are not savory , for , though they are well planned in point of size , they are injudiciously mixed with more sulphurettecl hydrogen than an epicure really needs . We can imagine with what wry faces the people of the Strathmore began to devour these eggs ; but we can not imagine the delight with which they recognized the remarkable effect wrought upon them by their unaccustomed diet . First , their complexions grew clear and fair , and then their brown , black , or gray hair slowly assumed a gorgeous golden tint . When , after six months of egg diet , they were rescued by a passing vessel , they resembled a theatrical company of blonde burlesquers , especially as their supply of clothing was remarkably scant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English climate , and to English beef and beer , has made no alteration in the brilliancy of their locks , and there is no reason to doubt that they will remain blonde and golden for the rest of their happy lives . With what joy will those who vainly sigh for golden hair learn that there is balm in the Crozet Islands in the shape of penguin 's eggs . They can sail for that marvelous region , shipwreck themselves upon the magic rocks , and eat themselves into a state of bewildering beauty . That thousands of our countrywomen will demand to be sent to the Crozet Islands without delay is , of course , self-evident , but a little reflection will show that the desired end can be attained without the discomforts of a long voyage and a hazardous shipwreck . What is the ingredient in penguin 's eggs which colors the hair of those who eat them ? No chemist will have the slightest hesitation in replying that it is the excessive amount of sulphur which they contain . Every one knows that sulphur possesses the property @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its fumes , and it can easily be comprehended that the survivors of the Strathmore were thus transformed by the bleaching powers of the sulphur which , in the condition of sulphuretted hydrogen , was so conspicuously present in the penguin 's eggs . Hence , those who wish to change themselves into yellow-haired blondes need not go to the Crozet Islands , neither need they live upon penguin eggs . All they have to do is to remain quietly at home and confine themselves to a diet consisting chiefly of sulphur . The use of sulphur baths , sulphur ointments , and smelling bottles containing sulphurotted hydrogen would doubtless hasten the desired effect , and it is possible that in the course of two or three months of persistent sulphurization even Gen. Loa. &; could transform himself into a sunny-haired blonde whose beauty would inspire unusual confidence and esteem . Hereafter We shall hear no more of hair dye or hair-dyers , and the demand for sulphur will be so enormous as to task the resources of our best volcanoes to their utmost limits .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
