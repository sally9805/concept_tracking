THE ROCK OF THE LEGION OF HONOR . By BERTHOLD AUERBACH , AUTHOR OF " ON THE HEIGHTS , " zro . CHAPTER IX . A TRANQUIL 5rOT . ONTHS have gone by . The steamboat ITt stops at Fluelen , on the Lake of the Four Cantons , and from a carriage , whose arrival from Italy was unmistakable , Herr Merz and his daughter alighted , both looking sun-burnt and ruddy . A large quantity of luggage was carried on board the boat , and the Italian coachman thanked the gentleman and the lady with great fluency . And after the boat had shoved off he bade them good-by , accompanying his words with the most lively southern gesticulations . On board the steamboat there was a promiscuous company speaking a great variety of languages ; but one common sentiment animated the minds of all , as they gazed upon the grand scenery and the cottages on the shores amidst the steep cliffs . Each one received the impression according to his own particular mood and state , and the conversation was pitched upon that peculiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As then they listen to the melody without being conscious that they are listening , so now a great variety of subjects was talked of ; but there was all the time this accompanying feeling of the magnificent natural scenery around them , pervading all their converse , and often producing a sudden silence . Not far from the helmsman Louise sat alone , looking out upon the landscape . She paid no regard to the looks of which she was the object , or to the casual observations which she happened to overhear . Sortie took her for a widow just out of mourning , and others for the young , newly married wife of the old gentleman who accompanied her . Her father had come across a former deputy , a member of the same political party , who had joked Louise on not having fulfilled his expectation that she would get married . Herr Merz was now standing with the man on the other side of the boat , and they were engaged principally in talking over public affairs ; they were neither of . them in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in political matters . Hcrr Merz 's old acquaintance informed him that the daughter who had been betrothed during that first winter at the capital had now three children , and that he was to meet the next day in Lucerne his youngest married daughter , who had been on a wedding trip to Italy . He had five daughters who were all married  --  the youngest to a manufacturer and the others to army and government officers . He was lavish of his praise of the present generation of young men , differing in this fromn many in our day ; he said that they were less romantic than we old men had been ; more reasonable and energetic . He made cautious but unevasible inquiries , how it had happened that Louise was still single . Herr Merz could not but declare that this // was , with the exception of the loss of his wife , the one trouble of his life ; he tried to submit himself to it , and to renounce the hope of domestic happiness for his child . The friend of Herr Mera @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his youngest daughter 's husband , whom he had accidentally met on the boat , and introduced him to Herr Merz and Louise . They were making the circuit of the lake , and Louise was afraid that the evening , and perhaps a longer time , would be spoiled by this chance meeting , to which the beloved solitude would have to be sacrificed without any adequate compensation . As they neared a small bay of the lake they saw a bright house , with a newly laid out garden , that looked inviting . Louise heard it said that there was a landing-place here , and she begged her father to disembark . The place seemed so cheerful , so attractive ; there was no time to consider the matter , the bell rang , Louise hastily raised her hand-bag , and induced her father to take his , the planks were shoved out , Louise and her father went ashore , and the luggage was landed after them . From the shore Herr Merz said good-by to his acquaintances , and Louise nodded a farewell to them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned away . " Thank you , father , " exclaimed Louise , drawing a long hreath . " I do n't know why it is , but it seems to me that I 've dreamed of this place , just as it is , with the lake sparkling before it , the fountain bubbling up , the house shingled just like that , and the bell ringing as it 's ringing now up there in the village . Oh , it is pleasant to knoW how many beautiful , quiet spots there are in the world ! " The hostess came up and welcomed the strangers in French . She said , pointing to the house , that the two baicony rooms , in the corner commanding the finest view , had been left vacant that very day . Caspar , the factotum of the house , who proudly wore his high cap , with the name of the hotel embroidered on its band , nodded to the host&amp;ss with a glance which said , " They are people of rank ; a man with three orders in his button-hole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too , seemed to consider it his duty to greet the travelers ; he settled himself before Louise , slowly winking his eyes as he looked at her ; the hostess motioned him away , but Louise said she liked animals , and called him to her ; he sprang briskly toward her , then ran back to his mistress , as if to say : " You see , the strangers like me directly , they know at once that I 'm a good fellow ! " Louise took her father 's arm , and they went toward the house . In front of it two children were playing on a board . At one end , working a stick in the sand , as if rowing a boat , stood a boy , dressed in a red blouse , his legs bare from the ankles , covered by fine stockings , to the short trowsers , and wearing yellow shoes of the natural color of the leather . A little girl , in the picturesque costume of the province , sat on a stool at the other end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let her drink once from the lake . The boy assented with a gracious wave of the hand , and she bent low over the sand , as if drinking . Louise held her father back , saying , in a low voice , " Oh , what a charming picture ! " She spoke to the children in French , and they answered in the same language , the boy with a sort of condescending politeness , the girl very prettily . Father and daughter went to their rooms , which they found very pleasant . Louise left all the arrangements to Herr Merz , who asked about other inmates of the house , learning , in reply , that thee was no danger of disturbance from them as e were artists*ho spent the whole day strolling among the mountains . Louise stood on the balcony , pressing her hands to her breast , or stretching her arms out , as if she would fly . When her father joined her she exclaimed , " Oh , father , I feel as if pure happiness were pouring down upon me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a dewy air to breathe in the world . " " And you will find many pleasures here , " her father replied . " There are five French painters with their wives and children in the house . " CHAPTER X. A JOYFUL GREETING . THE quiet prospect from a firmly fixed dwelling is most refreshing after one has been for days viewing the swiftly passing scenery from the moving cars or the deck of a steamboat . With this feeling Louise and her father sat comfortably together on the balcony , looking out over the lake and toward the mountains . &amp;o sound was heard except the plashing of the fountain in the garden , sometimes broken by the shout of the children who were chasing each other on the shore . The sunset glow came over earth and sky , and the lake reflected the ever-varying tints . Night drew on , the village bells rang , the children hurried home . The boy in the red blouse allowed no one hut himself to ring the house bell , which called the inmates together for supper . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned toWard them for a moment ; but the conversation , carried ' on entirely in French , was quickly resumed . The father and daughter sat , in conformity with the usual rule , at the lower end of the table . The person at the head appeared to be an old soldier , who wore a mustache , white like his closely cut hair . He turned to two ladies seated at his right and left , and nodded , as if pleased with the appearance of the new-comers . The strangers felt that they had entered a circle of people forming a society of their own , and that they must wait to see what reception was given them . Opposite Louise sat a young // man who spoke to no one . Was he shut out from the circle , or did he hold back voluntarily ? She could not decide . Before the meLd was over he left the hall as if angry , without bowing to any one . When the company rose Louise nodded to ' the two children who had met her so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manner their mother approached her , and soon asked whether she had left children at home , as she seemed so fond of them . Louise colored slightly as she answered in the negative . The company repaired to the reading and music rooms , and Louise followed . A few gentlemen moved toward the piazza and began to smoke , Herr Merz among them . As no one addressed him , he went alone to the garden , and along the lake shore , till he was joined by the gentleman who had sat at the head of the table , and who introduced himself as an officer from French Switzerland* He was the oldest regular guest of the house , and extolled the happy manner of life in it , saying that there was always a straggle in the minds of the inmates whether they should recommend the comfortable place for the sake of its worthy proprietor , fearing as they did that the comfort would be destroyed by a crowd of visitors . Louise , without staying long in the parlor , came to join her father , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what had been the matter with her discontentedlooking opposite neighbor at table . The colonel explained that he was a German physician accompanying a patient oppressed by a nervous melancholy , who never left his room . The young man was , of course , somewhat worn by the society of his patient , who never wished him to leave him ; and , moreover , his discontent must be considerably increased from the fact that he did not speak French , and must feel himself excluded from the society in the house . The hostess had told Louise that the full moon would rise over the mountains about eleven o'clock , and that she ought not to miss the wonderful sight ; Louise wanted to wait for moonrise , but both she and her father were so weary that they went to rest and were soon asleep . But Louise suddenly opened her eyes , awakened by the bright light of the full moon . She arose , stood at the window , and looked out at the wonderful landscape in its dreamy light , and at the lake reflecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boat was coming down the silver stream of light from the upper lake ; in it sat a man , sending out a clear jodel into the moonlit night . The boat came nearer and nearer , the jodel grew louder , more animated and powerful ; the house windows opened , voices of men and women cried : " Monsieur Edgar ! " A shout , which rose like a rocket , answered from the lake , and more and more madly and merrily jodeled the man in the boat . The host and hostess , and the factotum Caspar , hastened to the shore , calling out to each other : " Herr Edgar is coming ! " and the dog barked . The boat came to land . A tall man , wearing a pointed hat , which he now lifted , greeted the people of the hotel and those who appeared at the windows as he sprang ashore . In a loud voice he told them that , as there was now no night steamer to the place , and he had not chosen to wait in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a boat and rowed himself over . Louise then heard the hostess say that his corner room was no longer vacant , as a young lady and old gentleman had taken it that very day , but that they would probably not stay long . The new-coiner entered the house , and his baggage was brought in after him . All became still again , the moon shone over mountains and the lake ; all was quiet , but Lonise felt her heart beat . What is this ? Ah , we still meet strange events , like those related in old tales and legends . Is not this such an event , that a man should come floating over the moonlit lake , and that a joyful welcome should meet him ? But how will it all look by daylight-in the midst of the prose of our world , with its fixed hotel rates ? The fountain before the house plashed and bubbled , and it , too , sounded as if it had learned the cry , " Monsieur Edgar ! Monsieur Edgar ! " So it went on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TIlE NEW NEIGHBOR . IN the morning Louise did not wake until the breakfast-bell rang . Her father told her that he had taken a long walk in the neighborhood , and , in compliance with her wish , had sent a telegram to Lucerne ordering his letters and a daily journal to be sent to him here . Louise hardly knew what she had desired , sat up in bed and tried to collect her thoughts , whether she had been dreaming or it had been real . She begged her father to wait for her in the next room until she had dressed , but directly asked him through the closed door whether he had heard any thing of a Monsieur Edgar who had arrived during the night . " Why , yes , " replied her father ; " and every body is glad  --  the people of the inn , the guests , the waiters , and especially Caspar , who said to the cowherd : Now we shall have a jolly time ! Monsieur Edgar is here ! ' And I heard him speak to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Louise wanted to tell her father that she had witnessed the man 's arrival , and to ask him whether he bad yet seen the bringer of so much joy , but she refrained . They soon went into the breakfast-room , where breakfast was served at small round tables . At one table the guests had all eyes directed to one person , and talked only with him ; and in his lap were seated the boy with the red blouse and the little girl , who had on to-day a white dress . // He was tall , with a dark complexion , thick to bear them company , but , as she was not inheavy hair , and closely trimmed black beard . vited to do so , she passed on . It was silent in His voice was musical , and the expression of the house and in the garden , except that the his countenance friendly ; he now put up his two children were playing on the shore of the eye-glass , which was lying before him on the lake with the dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked some question , in a low tone , of his duty to entertain the guests . of the mother of the two children . Now came along the nervous invalid with He had evidently asked about Louise and her his companion , and Louise and her father safather , for the answer was given in the same luted them ; but , as the invalid made a motion low tone , and all eyes turned toward father to excuse himself , they went on without joinand daughter , who soon had the whole room ing their society . to themselves , as the company went into the Louise went to her room , wishing to get her garden , where the new arrival , Monsieur Edgar , materials for painting , and find out some good was leading the children back and forth by the point of view , but a peculiar shyness prevented hand . her from doing it . How could she venture qwq man . " member of the Swiss Confederate Assembly , " Who ? " and Herr Merz soon became engaged with him " Herr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very animated discussion of politics , and was should never have believed that he would wear invited with his daughter to go into the small by daylight , in the presence of these mountains , cottage , which the old man had fitted up comwhere every thing of the kind seems so paltry , fortably ; and , as all his children were married a decoration like that . " She narrated to her off , he was living in it alone with his wife . It father what had occurred , and there was a tone was a refreshing glance into a quiet , retired of depression in her voice as she added that life . qwq When the artists returned at evening Louise was introduced to them , and also to Monsieur Edgar . After tea they assembled in the musicroom , and the m other of the two children sang some pleasant French songs , accompanying herself on the piano , while her sister , a slender girl with hlonde locks , after much urging , played the violin . The sight of the violin-player and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steadfastly upon her . Louise sat near her father , and whispered to him : " Do n't you think that the violinist looks like Marie ? " Her father nodded . Monsieur Edgar now took a vacant seat.by the side of Louise , and requested her to sing , or to play the piano . She declared that she had no musical talent , and the tone in which she said it was so sincere that he said he believed her , and was fully convinced that she did not out of affectation as- , sume a modest diffidence . Louise expressed her thanks , but it struck her as rather strange that the , man , who had seen so little of her , saw into the depths of her soul . She wanted to ask how he came to have so good an opinion of her , but she suppressed the question , for perhaps-as she tried to persuade herself-this was a new specimen of French politeness . To his remark , that he should have judged from her voice in speaking that she could sing , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something of a voice for singing , but it was so inferior that she had given up the practice . He continued the conversation , and in apt language upheld the claims of music as being the only unifying art . People *of different nations and different social circles found in the realm of tones a point of oneness , which was high above all tongues , and was something universal . He added , jestingly : " If the people who were building the Tower of Babel had known how to sing , there would never have been the confusion of tongues . " His manner of speaking was so simple and effective , and , whether in jest or earnest , was so much to the point , that there was plainly to he discerned not only social tact , but also deep and varied thought in many directions . Louise , who was in the habit of constructing the whole thought and sentiment in its entirety out of single expressions which came from the depths of conviction , looked with an expression of pleasure at the speaker ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the violinist , and then went with his friends into the garden . Louise and the ladies soon followed . Jest and laughter in the soft moonlight were heard along the shore , mingled with the plashing of the waves of the lake . Louise felt at home in this circle of guests , and when she was alone with her father , congratulated him and herself on their good fortune in having stopped here . On the next morning the eu-representative appeared with his boat in front of the house , and sent the boatman to Herr Merz to invite him to take a sail far out on the lake and to catch some fish . The village pastor , a jolly comrade , who turned to good service his angling craft , was to be of the company . Louise ventured to take with her her little sketching-book concealed under her mantilla , and went by the road along the lake shore , then up a hill to a point where there was an extensive view , and , having made sure that there was no one in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from her work in excellent spirits , and there was much good-humor at the table , for the three men had had good luck in fishing , and their booty was a part of the dinner . The sky clouded over , but the painters were not detained from continuing their work . Caspar , who united to his other multifarious vocations that of an infallible weather prophet , predicted a severe storm for the evening , and they had hardly seated themselves at the teatable when it began to thunder and lighten . Only the ladies went into the music-room , but they did not venture to strike a note now , when the storm was raging so fearfully outside . The artists had gone out to view the bright flashes of lightning , and were only driven into tke house by the pouring rain . CHAPTER XII . A JODEL-CALL A*D A CRY OF DISTRESS . THE morning dawned bright , the trees and grass glistened in the sunlight , and the outlines of the mountains were sharply defined against the cloudless blue sky . Louise , followed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ventured to take , and equipped with a mountain-staff , ascended a spur of the hill not far from the inn . The brook , swollen by the recent rain , could be heard rushing along on one side of the footpath . She expected to find the bed of the brook higher up , and the farther she went the more courageous became her heart ; she often turned round and gazed out upon the lake , and she was brimful of happiness . Now she stood upon a jutting cliff , whence the brook could be seen rushing below . She stopped , stuck the staff upright in the mossy soil , placed her left hand to her cheek , and jodeled merrily to the eujianse of air . Hark ! Beneath , from the defile , an answering jodel was given . Was not this the voice of Monsieur Edgar , as he had sung that night in the moonlight upon the lake ? Once more Louise uttered a jubilant carol , and once more the same answer was returned from the defile below . Then cried a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy l Where are you // What ! is this Herr Edgar ? Does he speak German ? Louise went onward ; she was standing upon a rocky ledge , where it was precipitously steep , when Herr Edgar called out from below , but now in French , that she must stop , she was in a dangerous place , where she might be precipitated into the abyss . She fixed the point of her staff in a fissure of the rock , bent forward and looked over to the brook beneath , where was a light scaffolding of boards , and Herr Edgar wrapped in a plaid , with large wooden shoes on his feet and an easel in front of him . " Go back , " cried he , in an anxious tone ; " take the left between those two firs ! Will you come where I am ? I will show you the way ! Only wait until I have uncased myself a little . Are you all alone ? " " No ; I am here too , " cried the small guide . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She was obliged to hold on to the bushes on both sides in order not to slip down ; but at last she stood near the bridge , which she could not get upon , for there was here an arm of the brook through which she would have had to wade . Herr Edgar begged her to excuse him for not getting to her sooner , but his costume had impeded him . He pointed to a ladder which lay on the shore , and the boy quickly laid it across the rapid current to the rock on which the light bridge rested . Herr Edgar told Louise to go down on it backward ; she did so , and now stood on the frail and unsteady platform . " Go no farther ; for the bridge will not bear two persons , " cried Herr Edgar , adding , in a jesting tone , " The bridge which I have built for myself over the rushing stream of life will only bear me ! " Louise could make no reply . The painter said that he had kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as she had found it out , she might now quietly take a view of it . In a cheery tone he added that she had better put on his over-coat , for it was quite cool here , and he would like to christen this place as Rheumatism Grotto , for it was with no little difficulty that he had got rid of a rheumatism which he had contracted here last year . He speedily muffled himself up again , and then asked , " Are you German , too , and was it you who jodeled so loudly ? Strange ! You can jodel and can not sing . I took you for one of the mountain-boys . " He trod hard upon the platform , anil it shook ; but he now added , " I think the bridge will bear you and me . Come down ! " The painter extended his hand to Louise , who stood near him , and looked now at the picture on the easel , now at the rocks , the rushing brook , and the surrounding scenery . Which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by art ? The brook leaped over a rock , but was divided into two branches by a boulder , on which a young fir-tree with ditliculty held its place . To the right was a small ravine , in which the foliage of many years had grown undisturbed , and now glittered in colors of wonderful beauty . Above , through the branches of the fir , a small opening of blue sky could be seen . " Have you nothing to say ? " asked the painter , as Louise stood perfectly speechless . " I would rather be silent . I can only say that it is well done ; one can see in the picture that you work con amore , for light , atmosphere , and coloring convey this impression to the soul . " " Thank you . I am glad that you have not begun by opening a parliamentary debate , as so many of our German ladies of culture do in looking at a work of art . At once an interpellation is offered to the artist , as if he were literally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you intend by that ? Whence do you get the other ? Above all , how do you manage to conceal the inferiority of art , which can never equal the actual beauty of nature ? " ' Louise was agitated . Why did the painter make use of such a comparison as this to the former Daughter of the Parliament ? But Herr Edgar continued in a pleasant tone : " Ah , Erlinlein , there 's nothing so provoking as this holding a discussion on a work of art . If one could express in words what the picture tries to express , the painting would be entirely superfluous . " Louise was again moved . The artist had given utterance to what she had herself felt in Italy , and what had been her own hard-bought experience . " I believe that I now see , " said she , " what art can and should do . The distant range of mountains refreshes the eye of the lover of nature , but- " " But what ? " " Ah , pardon me for having recourse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Do n't stop ; you are on the right path . You also sketch ? " " Yes , I have painted a little , but shall not attempt it again . " " Yes , you are right in your but , " ' resumed Edgar . " In order to have atmospheric effect , there is no need of towering mountains and a distant prospect . A few trees , a hill , and the sky over it , would be sufficient . " Louise did not continue the conversation , begging Herr Edgar not to leave off painting , as it would be highly interesting to her to watch the progress of a work of art . Herr Edgar at once complied with her request , and went on painting the masses of foliage , telling at the same time how he owed to this nook of the world the happiness of his life ; he requested Louise to stand a little one side-it was not easy to get a glimpse of the place-there he had painted in , in bright colors , the order of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wa* painting the picture for the second // time , and that he had given the rock the name of " The Rock of the Legion of Honor ; " for he owed to the painting which he had brought out the previous year his reputation , and that external badge of distinction , which , as the world goes , is not to be slighted . He spoke in a peculiarly confidential tone , without looking at Louise , fixing his eyes now upon the rocks and now upon the easel . At last , turning to her , he inquired what part of Germany she lived in . She named the place , and the artist said that he had picked up some good studies , and hoped to produce many good pictures there yet . He painted on , asking whether Louise was acquainted with the garrison town . She said that she was . " And have you ever known Marie , the daughter of the late Major Von Korneck ? " " Oh , certainly . She is an old friend of mine . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her betrothed . " The bridge cracked , and the painter uttered a cry as he fell . Louise also screamed , but seized the picture as she slipped , and raised it on high . The painter got up again , and , dripping with water , saw Louise grasping nervously the painting , which she kept from being wet . " Take it , " cried she ; " I can not hold it any longer . " He hurriedly took the picture from her hand , and , having placed it safely on one of the posts of the bridge that projected out of the water , seized Louise and bore her , rather than led her , to the shore . " Have you received any hurt ? " inquired he . " None of any account , only I can not step on my left foot . " The boy was soon on hand , and , hastening to the inn , brought back with him the father of Louise , who was borne to the inn in a sedan chair , Edgar following with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RUFFLES . LouIsA 's misfortune produced an excitement throughout the house . They were very glad that there was a physician among themselves , and the young man who had been hitherto so silent and reserved , even overlooked by the rest , now became a centre of interest . He found , on examination of the foot , that the ankle was severely sprained . Caspar , the factotum , had remedies at hand for all such accidents , and came with a pot of liniment , which he extolled as having been highly useful for cases of that kind during his service in the papal army . He was not a little elated when the physician made a provisional application of the salve . After her foot had been swathed , Louise begged to be left alone . She puzzled herself with conjectures in regard to the emotion which the mention of Marie 's betrothal had caused in Herr Edgar , and she could fi ? d no satisfactory solution of the riddle . Then she tried to imagine what the inmates of the house would have to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , and sleep at last happily delivered her from all thoughts and speculations . When she awoke it was still bright daylight , and to her great delight she saw before her the painting on an easel . She had her father and Herr Edgar called , and calmly stated to them that she could , of course , have ha dnot the most remote suspicion of any relations existing between Herr Edgar and Marie von Korneck . And now she heard for the first time that the cavalry captain had only assumed the part of Marie 's betrothed for that special occasion , so that she might become more intimately acquainted with him . She concealed her face with a pocket-handkerchief , and the painter said , " This is one of her wild pranks , but she is too free . No girl ought to do such a thing as that , and , least of all , a girl who is bound by a promise to another . " Louise was sufficiently composed and collected to defend Marie , and she could not help making mention of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fitted for being an actress . The painter looked earnestly at Louise , and begged that he might be permitted to relate how he had become acquainted with Marie , and what was the nature of their connection . Louise , drawing a long breath , sat upright . Her father placed his hand on her brow , and requested the painter to defer it until the next day . Louise did not venture to oppose , and the painter withdrew , leaving Louise and her father alone . She asked him then whether it was really the fact that the captain had only pretended to be engaged when at their country house . Herr Merz had to confirm his statement . Evening came on , Louise grew feverish , and the physician gave her a composing draught . No sound was heard about the house , and Caspar even stopped the fountain , that its constant plashing might not be heard . The next morning Louise awoke greatly refreshed . Herr Edgar sent to ask whether he might see her , and Was answered in the affirmative . In presence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yesterday evening , herr Merz , you stated to me how lively an interest you had taken in all the affairs of our father-land ; and I can but agree with you , that the way in which the whole of the present generation of young men is made to serve in the army has something barbarous in it . Most certainly this waste of strength and wealth is in complete contradiction with the humane character of our age ; but probably you have been less called upon to observe how // many finely tricked out and seemingly excellent persons , but with no real , sound basis of character or preparation for life , are the result of this state of thinks . I know it to be a fact . I am the son of a soldier , and was early left fatherless . I wore a uniform from my seventh year . My mother was poor , and she was obliged to earn her living . For fourteen years she was housekeeper in the country , not very far from where you lived . I caused her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I was so apparently ungrateful as to leave the xuilitary life and follow my inclination for art . You can imagine the distress of my good mother ; and in her complainings that I should become a vagabond it sounded very strangely to hear her often regretting that I should never wear , as my father did , a decoration on my breast . You see that it is not out of vanity , but from compliance with this strange wish of my mother , that I wear a badge . But , pardon me , I am digressing . I have endured many kinds of want , but it is a happy circumstance that we are so constituted that we forget the pain and suffering of the past . It seems to me now as if some one else , and not I myself , had undergone this experience . It is now four years since a great piece of good fortune happened to me . A German merchant , who had acquired a large property in Scotlind , and built a handsome villa near Bieberich , wished to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had seen a landscape of mine for sale at a picture-dealer 's , and I received from him , unexpectedly , the commission to ornament the drawing-room .

An older sister of the rich merchant 's wife , a very noble and highly cultivated lady , took me under her special protection , and I can say that , next to my mother , no other human being has been so much to me as Frau Agatha . What could have been more favorable ? I had kind , appreciative , and helpful friends . I was enabled to induce my mother to give up her situation , and to live with a sister married to a forester at N- ; and , besides , I had large wall spaces and the best light for my pictures . " There was within me a perperuni rejoicing . At midsummer a friend of my patroness came to live at Bieberich , and with her Marie von Korneck . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old lady had no taste for paintings , and was proud and honest enough not to pretend to have any . Marie , on the other hand , took a great interest in my work . " Once I was sitting at twilight in the garden , dreaming of the future , and looking out into the wide-spreading beautiful landscape , when I heard my patroness say to her sister , as they were strolling together in the walks , Yes , if I wanted a wife for Edgar , Marie von Korneck would be the one . ' It thrilled me . I had derived sincere satisfaction from Manes always fresh and genial spirits , but to win her , to call hermy own , had never come into my thought . I openly confess that I have a strong dread of poverty ; I have experienced it in its most bitter forms . I often said to myself in my quiet , thoughtful hours , You must never establish a household on any uncertain prospects .

" Herr Merz shook his head in denial , and Edgar went on : " I often used these and stronger expressions in my self-reproaches , but my renunciation of domestic joys and of love was based upon the well-matured consideration that I was outside of the ordinary arrangements of social and civil life , outside of those employments based merely upon getting a support-I had followed my inclination in the choice of a calling , and was resolved to repress in its behalf every inclination for domestic establishment . I said to myself that I ought to make the sacrifice , and I saw very many of my fellow-artists come to naught , because they were not able to follow out the tendencies of their genius , being obliged to produce good salable works in order to support wife and child . I had a friend who introduced into every picture two girls , one a blonde and the other a brunette , whether they fitted in or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the other usually in silk  --  the pictures sell for a good price , but they are travesty of true art . And so I was determined to maintain myself free in my art as far as possible , having only myself and my mother to provide for . I did not consider myself justified in drawing a family into such an uncertain struggle . " All at once it seemed different , and something within me said that I ought not to make this renunciation . I ridiculed my fear of poverty , calling it poltroonery , representing to myself that one ought to win for himself a position* in life , and to be successful in a variety of relations . I became more and more intimate with Marie , and her cheerful , gladsome temperament infused into me fresh inspiration . The fear would often insinuate itself that it was too great a risk to undertake to support another , without having any certain dependence of my own ; but whenever I saw Marie and heard her voice , all these reflections vanished . We were both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bitterness of that sham external well-being of which I have before spoken . I could consider myself fortunate in comparison with Marie , for she must be dependent on a life of service , subject her youthful inclinations to the humors of a not low-minded , but particular and fussy old lady , and I could not but admire that elasticity of temperament which enabled her to preserve the genial freedom of her na // self out better than I am-I did not have the courage to confess my love , and used often to say to myself that , if Frau Agatha had not dropped the words I had heard , I should never have specially thought of Marie as one whom I desired for a wife . " Then autumn came , and there was an indefinite and not plainly outspoken relation between Marie and myself . " The time for setting out upon their journey came , and I accompanied Frau Agatha to Biebench in order to bid good-by to our friends . Their trunks were packed ; Marie looked excited ; we stood at a window and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a good thing for y ow to travel , grievous as it may be to me . ' She looked fixedly at me , but made no reply . It was plain to me that I involuntarily revealed the conflicting emotions within , and I only said : Give me your hand and let me say farewell here ; I should rather not do it at the steamboat landing ; and let me say that we should lie rejoiced and consider it as a possession for life that we have met each other , and can preserve indelible pictures of memory in our souls . If on either of us good fortune smiles , we know that the other will afar off be refreshed by it . I have long thought about giving you some external token of remembrance , hut I can not determine upon any , and it is better so . You have only the recollection of a meeting in the journey of life , and I wish you from my heart a prosperous journey. * Edgar stopped . After rather a long pause he went on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; I do not know how I came to do it ; I will hereafter be more concise . " The boat is in sight ! was suddenly called out . Trunks and boxes were carried to the landing . My patroness went with them to the boat , intending to accompany them a part of the way on the river ; I bade them farewell at the house , and Marie and I said nothing more . I saw tears in her eyes , and through my own tears I saw that she trembled . " The trunks were taken away , and all was desolate . I went through the rooms , which seemed to have been pillaged , and , suppressing my suffering , said to myself that it was well that it was over , that I had no right to bind another 's lot to my own . " Then I saw on Marie 's sewing-table a pair of lace ruffles that had been forgotten . I can not say how it happened ; I took up the ruffles , hastened down the steps , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoving off . I tried to hand the ruffles to Marie ; but the captain , thinking that I wanted to go in the boat , grasped my hand , drew me on board , and we were off . " The old lady looked at me in surprise , but Frau Agatha extended to me her hand , and I saw that Marie trembled . We sailed on in silence for a while , and then I said : We have THE ROCK OF THE LEGION OF HONOR . 63 only a few minutes more , for we must disembark at Walluf . ' " It is kind in you to come , ' said Marie . There was something so touching in her tone that all my prudent reflections vanished , and every drop of blood in me was stirred . Marie , ' said I to her , only a few moments remain , now hear what I have to say . I have no right to bind your fate for life to mine , and so I am resolved that I will not be an obstacle in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should open . Give me three years-that is to say , I leave you free if I do not write to you for three years . I will strive to earn a competency foiour support , and if I do not succeed you are free . I beseech you not to engage your life indissolubly to me . Will you promise me that ? ' She assented . " I have nothing more to tell . I forgot to say that we had confessed our love . " The bell rang for landing , and , in presence of my patroness and the old lady , we kissed each other for the first time . " Again Edgar paused . He did not venture to look at Louise , but cast his eyes down to the floor , although be would have liked to know how Louise now regarded him . At last he continued : " I was in a strange mood , full of conflicting feelings ; sometimes I considered myself as betrothed , sometimes as perfectly free . Nothing has been settled , there is nothing binding . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I had earned enough to make my mother independent for many years , and now I went out fresh and free into the world . I was in Italy , and , strange to say , at the same time Marie was , but I did not know it until after she had returned to Germany . I came hither . I painted the picture like the one you have seen . I received in Paris the highest mark of distinction -I may be allowed to say that the external badge was prized by me only on my ijiother 's account , and , in fact , her letter , in answer to mine informing her of the bestowal of the badge of the Legion of Honor , was a very happy one . I have a good reputation , and commissions for several years in advance . Now could I offer to Marie a competent support . I wrote to her . I have again journeyed hither in order to execute a commission for a picture like the other , but smaller ; I am expecting news of Marie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then said , in conclusion : " You know now what is and what has been . " The three sat speechless for a while , and then Louise said : " I thank you , Herr Edgar . " Edgar rose and left the room . Herr Merz remained with his daughter ; but soon after he went to Edgar , and he had nothing else to say to him except to ask , " Will you smoke a cigar with me ? " They sat and smoked in silence , until Herr Merz again went to Louise 's room . // CHAPTER XIV . ON THE LAKE AND IN THE HOUSE . DAYS passed away ; Louise could be carried into the open air , where she reclined upon a lounge in the garden . The children engaged in their play around her ; the ladies sat with her , and also the physician , who seemed to have been loosed from a spell , as he found that Edgar was a German and inclined to be on friendly terms with him , as well as was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a genuinely worthy and highly cultivated man . Yes , even the hypochondriac , whom he attended professionally , quitted his solitary chamber and caine to Louise . He was the first to express the opinion to her that she ought to marry Edgar they would make a handsome couple . Louise trembled , and all the by-standers looked at each other in wonderment , and then cast down their eyes to the ground . The invalid , who seemed . to be recovering , had expressed the thought of all the rest . They were expecting letters , and whenever Caspar , the man-of-all-work , brought the letter-bag , Louise was much excited . What news will come from Marie ? and suppose she herself should come , instead of writing ? She begged her father to take their departure from the place , but the physician would not give his consent , and so she remained . By daily intercourse with Herr Edgar she became better and better acquainted with his genuine , fresh nature and his open , free soul ; but there was a veil between their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Finally , on the second Sunday , a letter came to Edgar in Marie 's handwriting . Louise saw Caspar deliver the letter ; she saw that Edgar grew pale as he read the superscription . He held the letter in his hand without opening it . The rest of the company had received letters , and ivent away to seats by themselves in order to read them . Herr Merz had received both letters and newspapers , and , having excused himself to his daughter , went into the house . Edgar still remained standing motionless in the same spot with the unopened letter in his hand , and at length , stepping up to Louise , said : " Frfiulein Merz , whatever may be the contents of this letter , I must say to you beforehand what decision I have come to . I can never call Marie mine , for my heart belongs to another . I think that it is not so bad to be untrue once , as to be false to one 's inner self for a whole lifetime . As I am now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not make Marie happy . I have asked myself whether it would not be the best thing to throw the letter unopened , into the lake . Your look tells me that I ought not to do so . Well , then , will you open the letter ? " " I ? " " Yes , you . Nothing which concerns me , and which has to do with my life , is to be kept a secret from you . " Louise hastily opened the letter . She was struck at finding no writing inside , but only a printed sheet . On yellow parchment-like paper were the printed words : " MAinE VON Konaxoir , ALanEcaT voN BnuumwsTocK , Late Captain of Ceveiry , Amstrath on the Royal I*maia R- , Betrothed . " Edgar took the printed sheet and opened it , thinking that there must be some line from Marie , but there was not a word . He seized Louise 's hand , saying , " Now I am permitted to say it . May I say it ? I am thine . Will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not now , not now , not here , " cried Louise ; she was aware that persons were looking at them from the windows and the balcony . " I will go into the house. ** Caspar was quickly on band ; but no other man was to be found , and so Caspar and Edgar bore Louise in the sedan chair back to the house . They came across her father , deeply engaged in reading his paper , and he cx-claimed : " Louise , they have proposed me again as a candidate . We shall pass next winter at the capital . " Louise shook her bead . " Do n't you believe I shall be chosen ? " " That is not the reason ; but I am chosen ! And I choose-here . Now , I beseech you , speak yourself , " said she , turning to Edgar . He could hardly utter a word . Louise 's father embraced him and eumbraced his child . They sat together in cheerful mood , and Edgar assured Herr Merz that he could offer a modest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gave a description of the fine studio at his country seat , that was fit for a real artist , and not for a mere dilettante . Louise rose to her feet , and she could now step without pain . The physician directed that the ankle should be swathed with a single bandage , after which it would be well . The old representative of the confederation had for years strictly kept to holding no sort of relation with the strangers at the inn , as he wanted to be undisturbed , and as lie himself and his wife were perfectly satisfied with the peacefulness of their house and the inspiring influence of the natural beauties which surrounded them . But he had now entered into such friendly intercourse with Herr Merz that he suspended his long-standing regulation . The host and hostess greeted him with great respect , for which he thanked them in genuine , rustic heartiness , paid them some compliments , and also had a good word for Caspar . He went to the rooms of Herr Merz , and , after a hearty congratulation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man that it is not fitting for you and your child to celebrate a betrothal here in this inn , half on the highway , as it were . My wife also desires me to // say that she wishes you would do it at our house . " The invitation was gladly accepted . The betrothal was celebrated in the house of the ex-representative , under the sympathizing eyes of his wife and the hearty words of the old gentleman himself . Louise wore the betrothal ring , and the first thing she did with the hand on which it was was to write a letter to Edgar 's mother . Then shp took his arm , and they strolled through the village back to the inn . Louise 's betrothal put the whole company into a fresh excitement , and the melancholy invalid was the first to present his congratulations . His mental oppression seemed to be disappearing gradually in the society of cheerful people . Then came the children with flowers , the painters ' *vives , the men-all were in jubilant spirits . Caspar dragged a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Honor ; he directed the hostess to tell them not to be frightened , if they should hear firing ; and now crack went the cannon from the rocks , and the echo came from over the lake and the distant mountains . Louise and her betrothed went into the garden ; they recalled all the time since their first meeting until the present moment . In the evening , when the moon shone brightly , they took a boat and rowed far out on the lake ; there they jodeled into the soft air of night , and moved the hearts of all who heard the joyous notes . How happy must they be out there alone ! * * * * * * At the station of a mountain district in Central Germany a vehicle was again drawn up , but now it was a close carriage . The leaves from the beech - trees whirled through the air , and cold , wet gusts seemed to he making sport , now rushing off toward the range of hills , and now unexpectedly sweeping back with a sudden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the whistle sounded the coachman came out from the carriage , holding on his cockade hat with both hands , and still chewing the last mouthful he had taken . The train rolled into the station , the snperintendent betook himself to the first-class car , opened it , bade Herr Merz a hearty welcome , and congratulated him on his re-election . He quickly added , however : " Excuse me for not having yet congratulated you on the marriage of Fraulein Louise . Allow me to ask whether she will come back here with her husband ? " " Certainly she will ! By spring . They are now in Paris . " Herr Merz felt chilled , and drew his cloak close around him as he stood at the station . The beginning of the northern winter seemed to him , who had come from the south , so much the sharper and more inclement . The luggage was taken out , the train rolled on ; Herr Merz wanted to look after his own effects , but the station-master tried to dissuade him from doing so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that he would see to every thing . Herr Merz persisted in looking after it himself , saying that there was one box which must be handled with 3pecial care . " You have not been playing a practical joke like that of your daughter 's friend , Fr*nlein Von Korneck , who took with her in the cars a dog bundled up like a baby ? " " No , nothing of that sort . It is a picture painted by my son-in-law . Come and see me and I will show it to you . " " What does it represent ? Mount Rosa , or the Righi , or the Jungfrau ? " " Neither of theta . A cliff on the Lake of the Four Cantons , which is known to no one else but ourselves it used to be called the Rock of the Legion of Honor , ' and now it is called The Rock of Love .
