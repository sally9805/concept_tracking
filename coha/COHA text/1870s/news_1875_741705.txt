txt The storm has blown itself out , and the Parliamentary session is drawing to a peaceful , though not , so far as the Ministry are concerned , a dignified and triumphant close . The effect produced by Mr. Plimsoll 's protest was so decided and universal , the blunder of the Government was so patent and inexcusable , that Mr. Disraeli and his colleagues saw at once how hopeless it was to think of adhering to their policy , or even of attempting to extenuate its folly . So they collapsed on the instant . Without waiting for Mr. Plimsoll 's apology , the President of the Board of Trade hurried in a short bill investing his department with tho widest possible powers for dealing with unseaworthy ships . Some idea of the sort of despotic rule which will be established under this measure may be gathered from its first provision , which is as follows : ? ? The Board of Trade may forthwith , and from time to time by special order , appoint a sufficient number of fit and . proper persons , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having authority to detain unseaworthy ships , and may from time to time revoke any such appointment . It any officer so appointed has reason to believe , upon inspection or otherwise , that any British ship , ' by reason of the defective condition of her hull , equipments , or machinery , or by reason of overloading or improper loading , is unfit to proceed to sea without serious danger to human life , he may order the ship to be detained for the purpose of being surveyed . " What this comes to Is , in other words , simply this , that the Board of Trade are to have power to appoint anybody to do anything they like . There are no rules , no restrictions , uo definitions of any kind . The Board of Trade take upon themselves for the seat six months to prevent any unseaworthy ships from going to sea , and no doubt very large powers are necessary for such a task . SIGNIFICANCE OP RECENT EVENTS . In order to appreciate , however . the extraordinary comedy which has just been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alas hitherto been strenuously opposed to being : saddled with such a responsibility . and has argued in the most eager and resolute way in order to prove that it was altogether absurd and impossible for any public authority to exercise such powers . Of course there is a distinction between asking for special powers and carrying them out to the full extent ; and it may be pleaded on behalf of the Board Trade that they are only endeavor:ng to provide a sufficient margin for exigencies , and that the experiment is merely a temporary one . All the same , a good many nights of the session have been spent in spinning reasons against the course which is now to be taken . To thoughttul men , who think that the country ought to have its affairs managed in a calm , collected manner , and in accordance with some ' consistency of principle , nothing can be more melancholy than to observe how easily the minds of ' responsible statesmen may be turned , as cm this occasion , from one side of a case to the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service was perfectly veil known before Mr. Plimsoll took to cursing . It was investigated by a royal commission , and the Board of Trade officials had also collected a great deal of information fearing on every branch of the question . Nothmg has happened to change the state of affairs , or to present it in a now light except . Mr. Plimsoll 's frenzied outbreak , and yet all at once everybody has got to be of one mind on what , after al ! , is , even to the most competent technical authorities , a most difficult and complicated question . It is very easy to pass severe restrictive laws , but it is another thing to get them carried out ; and besides there is no saying bow muoh may not be done by a change of tactics on the part of reckless ship-owners to evade or defeat the law . The House of Commons stopped short m the discussion of toe Shipping bill just at the point where these difficulties would have had - to be faced ; and now , in a fit of blind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take a leap in the dark . There is nothing more dangerous than legislation on the impulse of the - moment and for the mere sake of satisfying a sudden emotion . Such a measure as the Shipping bill demands very careful and cool consideration , and the original mistake will certainly not be repaired by the gush of sentiment that has just taken place . It is difficult to see how , if every ship is , as Mr. Reed proposes , with Mr. Plimsoll 's support , to obtain a Government warrantee of seaworthiness before it leaves port , the owner of it can be made responsible for any losses which may occur . inasmuch as he will be provided beforehand with an official certificate that he has done everything he could possibly be expected or required to do to make his ship safe . MR . PLIMSOLL 'S APOLOGY . On Thursday afternoon the House of Commons was , of course , packed to overflowing in all parts in a vague and , as it proved , vain hope that there would be a repetition of the sensational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the House , in Westminster Hall , there was a crowd waiting to see and cheer Mr. Plimsoll ashe-went into perform his triumphant penance , and a great shout was raised when he appeared , accompanied by his wile and . several friends . When he entered the House itself there was a faint cheer of recognition from the Radicals below the gangway. but generally the members had the good sense to remember that they would be stultifying themselves if they expressed approval of one who lay under the censure of the Speaker . This cause of restraint , however , was quickly got rid of , and when Mr. Plimsoll rose and said that patriotism , common sense , and right feeling led him to withdraw such terms and expressions as had transgressed parliamentary usage , and to apologize for herring used them , everybody gavo way to the desire t ? applaud . Nor was the friendly feeling toward Mr. Plimsoll in any way changed by his curt and emphatic declaration that he did not withdraw ' any statement of fact . The manner in which Mr. Disraeli spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the President of the Board of Trade had previously introduced his penitential bill , showed in the clearest possible way that the Government was heartily sick of the whcle affair , and would be glad to think that it would soon be forgotten . This , however , is not likely to be the case . All over the country indignation meetings have been held , and the table of the House of Commons is covered with petitions blaming the Government and sympathizing with Mr. Plimsoll . It seems to be now . not impossible that the et measure of the Ministry , the Agricultural Holdings bill , will be passed before the ens of the session . A GENERAL REACTION . Now that this political explosion is over , a general sense of apathy and deadness has fallen on society . Everybody rushed off to Goodwood , and scarcely anybody has come back . There has , in fact , been a universal scatter in high life . The Prince of Wales has gone on a visit to his mother at Osborne , and will take care to be at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year are said to be ? in better condition than usual . Trade continues very dull , and this seems to the city magnates a very good reason for seeking a change of air . THE CASE OF THE COLLIES . Sergt. Ballantine , the counsel for the Brothers Collie , now on trial for defrauding the London and Westminster Bank by means of accommodation bills , has intimated that be means to call the heads of thi chief houses in the city in order to show by their evidence how general is the practice for which the Collies are being prosecuted ; and this threat has created some uneasiness . There are a good many respectable people who are beginning to think that , on the whole , it would be better to let the Collies alone . There can be no doubt that . whether or not they only did what others do , at least they excelled in the magnificent scale of their operations , both commercially and socially . The biggest house in Kensington Palace ; Gardens , with the fattest flunkeys , in powdered hair and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Collies ; and when he saw Albert Grant 's palace rising at the foot of the Gardens he felt bound to have his own mansion rebuilt in a style of unexampled grandeur . The estimated liabilities of . the firm are said to be nearly ten millions , and it is doubted whether the quarter of a million assets alleged to exist has not been greatly exaggerated . COL . BAKER 'S CASE . In another direction society is still much exercised in mind about , the case of Col. Baker . Yesterday an attempt was made to get the trial postponed on the ground that public opinion was unfairly excited against the defendant , but the Judge was firm , and . the trial is now going on at Croydon . It is one of those cases , of course , on which , even when the evidence has been heard , it is scarcely possible to come to a very positive conclusion , and whatever be the verdict there will be the usual difference of opinion on the subject . The young lady 's desperate escape from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . proves at least the perfect sincerity of her fear . THE PERENNIAL CRAZE . It would appear that Mr. Whalley is not left alone in his efforts to expose and bailie the aggressions of the Jesuits . One day next week Lord Oranmore and Browne -- what a noble conjunction  --  has given notice that he will call the attention of the House of Lords and the Government to the following paragraph from the Weekly Register , a Roman Catholic print , and inquire whether the information contained in it is correct : The Queen and the Cardinal  --  Reception of his Eminence at the Prince of Wales ' Garden Party. ? The onestion of Cardinal Manning 's precedence was indirectly settled at the Prince of Wales ' garden party last week , when her Majesty the Queen was present . The Prince of Wales advanced to meet the Cardinal on his arrival , cordially shook hands with bun , and then presented his Eminence to his royal mother , who received him moat graciously , and conversed with him for a while . His Eminence . remained within the royal circle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the highest rank . The answer , if an answer is given , will , of course , be that the Prince 's party was not an affair of State , but only a mixed social gather .. ing in which official distinctions were ignored .
