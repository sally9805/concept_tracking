// THE POET AT THE BREAKFAST-TABLE . VII . I WAS very sure that the Old Master was hard at work about something , - he is always very busy with something ,  --  but I mean something particular . Whether it was a question of history or of cosmogony , or whether he was handling a test-tube or a blow-pipe ; what he was about I did not feel sure ; but I took it for granted that it was some crucial question or other he was at work on , some point bearing on the thought of the time- For the Master , I have observed , is pretty sagacious in striking for the points where his work will be like to tell . We all know that class of scientific laborers to whom all facts are alike nourishing mental food , and who seem to exercise no choice whatever , provided only they can get hold of these same indiscriminate facts in quantity sufficient . They browse on them , as the animal to which they would not like to be compared browses on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age he belongs to ; and if he seems to be busy with what looks like a small piece of trivial experimenting , one may feel pretty sure that he knows what he is about , and that his minute operations are looking to a result that will help him towards attaining his great end in life , - an insight , so far as his faculties and opportunities will allow ; into that order of things which he believes he can study with some prospect of taking in its significance . I became so anxious to know what particular matter he was busy with , that I had to call upon him to satisfy my curiosity . It was with a little trepidation that I knocked at his door . I felt a good deal as one might have felt on disturbing an alchemist at his work , at the very moment , it might be , when he was about to make projection. - Come in ! - said the Master in his grave , massive tones . I passed through the library with him into a little room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just at the right moment , - he said . Your eyes are better than mine . I have been looking at this flask , and I should like to have you look at it . It was a small matrass , as one of the elder chemists would have called it , containing a fluid , and hermetically sealed . He held it up at the window ; perhaps you remember the physician holding a flask to the light in Gerard Douw 's " Femme hydropique " ; I thought of that fine figure as I looked at him . - Look ! - said he , - is it clear or cloudy ? - You need not ask me that , - I answered. - It is very plainly turbid . I should think that some sediment had been shaken up in it . What is it , Elixir Vita ! or Aururn *otae5 lie * ? - Something that means more than alchemy ever did ! Boiled just three hours , and as clear as a bell until within the last few days ; since then has been clouding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess at the meaning of all this , and to think I knew very nearly what was coming next . I was right in my conjecture . The Master broke off the sealed end of his little flask , took out a small portion of the fluid on a glass rod , and placed it on a slip of glass in the usual way for a microscopic examination . - One thousand diameters , - he said , as he placed it on the stage of the microscope . - We shall find signs of life , of course . - He bent over the instrument and looked but an instant . There they are ! - he exclaimed , - look in . I looked in and saw some objects not very unlike these : - The straight linear bodies 00 00 were dart-98 July , // earth peopled itself without any help . Possibly the difficulty would n't be so great as many people suppose . We might perhaps find room for a Creator after all , as we do now , though we see a little brown seed grow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ground , apparently all by its own inherent power . That does not stagger us ; I am not sure that it would if Mr. Crosse 's or Mr. Weekes 's acarus should show himself all of a sudden , as they said he did , in certain mineral mixtures acted on by electricity . The Landlady was off soundings , and looking vacant enough by this time . He turned to me. - Do n't think too much of the result of our one experiment . It means something , because it confirms those other experiments of which it was a copy ; but we must remember that a hundred negatives do n't settle such a question . Life does get into the world somehow . You do n't suppose Adam had the cutaneous unpleasantness politely called *sora , do you ? - Hardly , - I answered . - He must have been a walking hospital if he carried all the maladies about him which have plagued his descendants . - Well , then , how did the little beast which is peculiar to that special complaint intrude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose there was a special act of creation for the express purpose of bestowing that little wretch on humanity , do you ? I thought , on the whole , I would n't answer that question . - You and I are at work on the same problem , - said the young Astronomer to the Master . - I have looked into a microscope now and then , and I have seen that perpetual dancing about of minute atoms in a fluid , which you call molecular motion . Just so , when I look through my telescope I see the star-dust whirling about in the infinite expanse of ether ; or if I do not see its motion , I know that it is only on account of its immeasurable distance . Matter and motion everywhere ; void and rest nowhere . You ask why your restless microscopic atoms may not come together and beTcome self-conscious and self-moving organisms . I ask why my telescopic star-dust may not come together and grow and organize into habitable worlds , - the ripened fruit on the branches of the tree Yggdrasil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's province . It frightens people , though , to hear the suggestion that worlds shape themselves from starmist . It does not trouble them at all to see the watery spheres that round themselves into being out of the vapors floating over us ; they are nothing but rain-drops . But if a planet can grow as a rain-drop grows , why then - . It was a great comfort to these timid folk when Lord Rosse 's telescope resolved certain nebuke into star-clusters . Sir John Herschel would have told them that this made little difference in accounting for the formation of worlds by aggregation , but at any rate it was a comfort to them . - These people have always been afraid of the astronomers , - said the Master . - They were shy , you know , of the Copernican system , for a long while ; well they might be with an oublielle waiting for them if they ventured to think that the earth moved round the sun . Science settled that point finally for them , at length , and then it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disputing the fact any longer . By and by geology began turning up fossils that told extraordinary stories about the duration of life upon our planet . What subterfuges were not used to get rid of their evidence ! Think of a man seeing the fossilized skeleton of an animal split out of a quarry , his teeth worn , down by mastication , and the rem*1ns of food still visible in his interior , and , in order to get rid of a piece of evidence contrary to the traditions he holds to , seriously maintaining that this skeleton never belonged to a living creature , but was created with just these appearances ; a make-believe , a sham , a Barnum's-mermaid contrivance to amuse its Creator and impose upon his intelligent children ! And now peo // pie talk about geological epochs and hundreds of millions of years in the planet 's history as calmly as if they were discussing the age of their deceased great-grandmothers . Ten or a dozen years ago people said Sh ! Sh ! if you ventured to meddle with any question supposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To-day such questions are recognized as perfectly fair subjects for general conversation ; not in the basement story , perhaps , or among the rank and file of the curbstone congregations , but among intelligent and educated persons . You may preach about them in your pulpit , you may lecture about them , you may talk about them with the first sensible-looking person you happen to meet , you may write magazine articles about them , and the editor need not expect to receive remonstrances from angry subscribers and withdrawals of subscriptions , as he would have been sure to not a great many years ago . Why , you may go to a tea-party where the clergyman 's wife shows her best cap and his daughters display their shining ringlets , and you will hear the company discussing the Darwinian theory of the origin of the human race as if it were as harmless a question as that of the lineage of a spinster 's lapdog . You may see a fine lady who is as particular in her genuflections as any Buddhist or Mahometan saint in his manifestations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the supposed founder of the family to which we belong , and even go back with you to the acephalous mollusk , first cousin to the clams and mussels , whose rudimental spine was the hinted prophecy of humanity ; all this time never dreaming , apparently , that what she takes for a matter of curious speculation involves the whole future of human progress and destiny . I ca n't help thinking that if we had talked as freely as we can and do now in the days of the first boarder at this table ,  --  I mean the one who introduced it to the public ,  --  it would have sounded a good deal more aggressively than it does now . - The Old Master got rather warm in talking ; perhaps the consciousness of having a number of listeners had something to do with it . - This whole business is an open question , - he said , - and there is no use in saying , " Hush I do n't talk about such things ! ' * People do talk about em everywhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think about em , and that is worse , - if there is anything bad about such questions , that is . If for the Fall of man , science comes to sub . stitute the RISE of man , sir , it means the utter disintegration of all the spiritual pessimisms which have been like a spasm in the heart and a cramp in the intellect of men for so many centuries . And yet who dares to say that it is not a perfectly legitimate and proper question to be discussed , without the slightest regard to the fears or the threats of Pope or prelate ? Sir , I believe , - the Master rose from his chair as he spoke , and said in a deep and solemn tone , but without any declamatory vehemence , - sir , I believe that we are at this moment in what will be recognized not many centuries hence as one of the late watches in the night of the dark ages . There is a twilight ray , beyond question . We know something of the universe , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of what is farthest from us . We have weighed the planets and analyzed the flames of the sun and stars . We predict their movements as if they were machines we ourselves had made and regulated . We know a good deal about the earth on which we live . But the study of man has been so completely subjected to our preconceived opinions ; that we have got to begin all over again . We have studied anthropology through theology ; we have now to begin the study of theology through anthropology . Until we have exhausted the human element in every form of belief and that can only be done by what we may call comparative spiritual anatomy , we can not begin to deal with the alleged extra-human elements without blundering // into all imaginable puerilities . If you think for one moment that there is not a single religion in the world which does not come to us through the medium of a pre-existing language ; and if you remember that this language embodies absolutely nothing but human conceptions and human passions , you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as already existing in those to whom it is addressed . I once went to a church in London and heard the famous Edward Irving preach , and heard some of his congregation speak in the strange words characteristic of their miraculous gift of tongues . I had a respect for the logical basis of this singular phenomenon . I have always thought it was natural that any celestial message should demand a language of its own , only to be understood by divine illumination . All human words tend , of course , to stop short in human meaning . And the more I hear the most sacred terms employed , the more I am satisfied that they have entirely and radically different meanings in the minds of those who use them . Yet they deal with them as if they were as definite as mathematical quantities or geometrical figures . What would become of arithmetic if the figure 2 meant three for one man and five for another and twenty for a third , and all the other numerals were in the same way variable quantities ? Mighty intelligent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how is this any worse than the difference of opinion which led a famous clergyman to say to a brother theologian , " 0 , I see , my dear sir , your God is my DeviL " Man has been studied proudly , contemptuously , rather , from the point of view supposed to be authoritatively settled . The self-sufficiency of egotistic natures was never more fully shown than in the expositions of the worthlessness and wretchedness of their fellow-creatures given by the dogmatists who have " gone back , " as the vulgar phrase is , on their race , their July , own flesh and blood . Did you ever read what Mr. Bancroft says about Calvin in his article on Jonathan Edwards , - and mighty well said it is too , in my judgment ? Let me remind you of it , whether you have read it or not . " Setting himself up over against the privileged classes , he , with a loftier 5ride than theirs , revealed the power of a yet higher order of nobility , not of a registered ancestry of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , preordained in the council chamber of eternity . " I think you 11 find I have got that sentence right , word for word , and there s a great deal more in it than many good folks who call themselves after the reformer seem to be aware of . The Pope put his foot on the neck of kings , but Calvin and his co*hort crushed the whole human race under their heels in the name of the Lord of Hosts . Now , you see , the point that people do n't understand is the absolute and utter humility of science , in opposition to this doctrinal self-sufficiency . I do n't doubt this may sound a little paradoxical at first , but I think you will find it is all right . You remember the courtier and the monarch , - Louis the Fourteenth , was n't it ? - never mind , give the poor fellows that live by setting you right a chance . " What o'clock is it ? " says the king . " Just whatever o'clock your Majesty pleases , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great deal more humble than the follower , who pretended that his master was superior to such trifling facts as the revolution of the planet . It was the same thing , you remember , with King Canute and the tide on the sea-shore . The king accepted the scientific fact of the tide 's rising . The loyal hangers-on , who believed in divine right , were too proud of the company they found themselves in to make any such humiliating admission . But there are people , and plenty of them , to-day who will dispute facts just as clear to those who have taken the pains to learn what is known about them , as that of the tide 's rising . They do n't like to admit these facts , because they Tue Poet at the Breakfast-TabQ // throw doubt upon some of their cherished opinions . We are getting on towards the last part of this nineteenth century . What we have gained is not so much in positive knowledge , though that is a good deal , as it is in the freedom of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observation and inference . How long is it since Mrs. Piozzi wrote , - " Let me hope that you will not pursue geology till it leads you into doubts destructive of all comfort in this world and all happiness in the next " ? The Master paused and I remained silent , for I was thinking things I could not say . - It is well always to have a woman near by when one is talking on this class of subjects . Whether there will be three or four women to one man in heaven is a question which I must leave to those who talk as if they knew all about the future condition of the race to answer . But very certainly there is much more of hearty faith , much more of spiritual life , among women than among men , in this world . They need faith to support them more than men do , for they have a great deal less to call them out of themselves , and it comes easier to them , for their habitual state of dependence " teaches them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they ever do , it may be feared that the pews will lose what the ward-rooms gain . Relax a woman 's hold on man , and her knee-joints will soon begin to stiffen . Self-assertion brings out many fine qualities , but it does not promote devotional habits . I remember some such thoughts as this were passing through my mind while the Master was talking . I noticed that the Lady was listening to the conversation with a look of more than usual interest . We men have the talk mostly to ourselves at this table ; the Master , as you have found out , is fond of monologues , and I myselfwell , I suppose I must own to a certain love for the reverberated music of my own accents ; at any rate , the Master and I do most of the talking . But others help us do the listening . I think I can show that they listen to some purpose . I am going to surprise my reader with a letter which I received very shortly after the conversation took place which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a special license , such as belongs to the supreme prerogative of an author , that I am enabled to present it to him . He need ask no questions : it is not his affair how I obtained the right to give publicity to a private communication . I have become somewhat more intimately acquainted with the writer of it than in the earlier period of my connection with this establishment , and I think I may say have gained her confidence to a very considerable degree . Mv DEAR SIR : The conversations I have had with you , limited as they have been , have convinced me that I am quite safe in addressing you with freedom on a subject which interests me , and others more than myself . We at our end of the table have been l*tening , more or less intelligently , to the discussions going on between two or three of you gentlemen on matters of solemn import to us all . This is nothing very new to me . I have been used , from an early period of my life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politics and religion . I have seen gentlemen at my father 's table get as warm over a theological point of dispute as in talking over their political differences . I rather think it has always been very much so , in bad as well as in good company ; for you remember how Milton 's fallen angels amused themselves with disputing on " providence , foreknowledge , will , and fate , " and it was the same thing in that club Goldsmith writes so pleasantly about . Indeed , why should not people very often come , in the course of conversation , to the one subject which lies beneath all else about which we occupy our thoughts ? And what more natural than that one should be inquiring about what another has accepted and // ceased to have any doubts concerning ? It seems to me all right that at the proper time , in the *ra*er * ? ace , those who are less easily convinced than their neighbors should have the fullest liberty of calling to account all the opinions which others receive without question . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it is a sentry 's business , I believe , to challenge every one who comes near him , friend or foe . I want you to understand fully that I am not one of those poor nervous creatures who are frightened out of their wits when any question is started that implies the disturbance of their old beliefs . I manage to see some of the periodicals , and now and then dip a little way into a new book which deals with these curious questions you were talking about , and others like them . You know they find their way almost everywhere . They do not worry me in the least . When I was a little girl , they used to say that if you put a horsehair into a tub of water it would turn into a snake in the course of a few days . That did not seem to me so very much stranger than it was that an egg should turn into a chicken . What can I say to that. ? Only that it is the Lord 's doings , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should find some little live creatures , or what seem to be live creatures , in any of his messes , I should say as much , and no more . You do not think I would shut up my Bible and PrayerBook because there is one more thing I do not understand in a world where I understand so very little of all the wonders that surround me ? It may be very wrong to pay any at* tention to those speculations about the origin of mankind which seem td conflict with the Sacred Record . But perhaps there is some way of reconciling them , as there is of making the seven days of creation harmonize with modern geology . At least , these speculations are curious enough in themselves ; and I have seen so many good and handsome children come of parents July , who were anything but virtuous and comely , . that I can believe in almost any amount of improvement taking place in a tribe of living beings , if time and opportunity favor it . I have read in books of natural history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my little Flora , who , as I used to think , could do everything but talk , it does not seem to me that she was much nearer her savage ancestors than some of the horrid cannibal wretches are to their neighbors the great apes . You see that I am tolerably liberal in my habit of looking at all these questions . We women drift along with the current of the times , listening , in our quiet way , to the discussions going on round us in books and in conversation , and shift the phrases in which we think and talk with something of the same ease as that with which we change our style of dress from year to year . I doubt if you of the other sex know what an effect this habit of accommodating our tastes to changing standards has upon us . Nothing is fixed in them , as you know ; the very law of fashion is change . I suspect we learn from our dress-makers to shift the costume of our minds , and slip on the new fashions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to new styles of dressing every season . It frightens me to see how much I have written without having yet said a word of what I began this letter on purpose to say . I have taken so much space in " defining my position , " to borrow the politicians'phrase , that I begin to fear you will be out of patience before you come to the part of my letter I care most about your reading . What I want to say is this . When these matters are talked about before persons of different ages and various shades of intelligence , I think one ought to be very careful that his use of language does not injure the sensibilities , perhaps blunt the reverential feelings , of those Who are listening to him . You The Pod at the Breakfast- Table . // of the sterner sex say that we women have intuitions , but not logic , as our birthright . I shall not commit my sex by conceding this to be true as a whole , but I will accept the first half of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we do not always care to follow out a train of thought until it ends in a blind cul tie sac , as some of what are called the logical people are fond of doing . Now I want to remind you that religion is not a matter of intellectual luxury to those of us who are interested in it , but something very different . It is our life , and more than our life ; for that is measured by pulse-beats , but our religious consciousness partakes of the Infinite , towards which it is constantly yearning . It is very possible that a hundred or five hundred years from now the forms of religious belief may be so altered that we should hardly know them . But the sense of dependence on Divine influence , and the need of communion with the unseen and eternal , will be then just what they are now . It is not the geologist 's hammer , or the astronomer 's telescope , or the naturalist 's microscope , that is goia*g to take away the need of the human soul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself , that Star which never sets , that all-pervading Presence Which gives life to all the least moving atoms of the immeasurable universe . I have no fears for myself , *nd listen very quietly to all your debates . I go from your philosophical discussions to the reading of Jeremy Taylor 's " Rule and Exercises of Holy Dying , " without feeling that I have unfitted myself in the least degree for its solemn reflections . And , as I have mentioned his name , I can not help saying that I do not believe that good man himself would have ever shown the bitterness to those who seem to be at variance with the received doctrines , which one may see in some of the newspapers that call themselves " religious . " I have kept a few old books from my honored father 's library , and among them there is another of his which I always thought had more true Christianity in its title than there is in a good many whole volumes . I am going to take the book down , or up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - and write out the title , which , I dare say , you remember , and very likely you have the book . " Discourse of the Liberty of Prophesying , showing the Unreasonableness of prescribing to other Men 's Faith , and the Iniquity of persecuting Different Opinions . " Now , my dear sir , I am sure you believe that I want to be liberal and reasonable , and not to act like those weak alarmists who , whenever the silly sheep begin to skip as if something was after them , and huddle together in their fright , are sure there must be a bear or a lion coming to eat them up . But for all that , I want to beg you to handle some of these points , which are so involved in the creed of a good many well-intentioned persons that you can not separate them from it without picking their whole belief to pieces , with more thought for them than you might think at first they were entitled to . I have no doubt you gentlemen are as wise as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as doves . The Young Girl who sits by me has , I know , strong religious instincts . Instead of setting her out to ask all sorts of questions , I would rather , if I had my way , encourage her to form a habit of attending to religious duties , and make the most of the simple faith in which she was bred . I think there are a good many questions young persons may safely postpone to a more convenient season ; and as this young creature is overworked , I hate to have her excited by the fever of doubt which it can not be denied is largely prevailing in our time . I know you must have looked on our other young friend , who has devoted himself to the sublimest of the sciences , with as much interest as I do . XVhen I was a little girl I used to write out a line of Young 's as a copy in my writing-book , " An undevout astronomer is mad " ; // but I do not now feel quite so sure that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not tend to weaken the idea of a personal Deity . It is not so much that nebular theory which worries me , when I think about this subject , as a kind of bewilderment when I try to conceive of a consciousness filling all those frightful blanks of space they talk about . I sometimes doubt whether that young man worships anything but the stars . They tell me that many young students of science like him never see the inside of a church . I can not help wishing they did . It humanizes people , quite apart from any higher influence it exerts upon them . One reason , perhaps , why they do not care to go to places of worship is that they are liable to hear the questions they know something about handled in sermons by those who know very much less about them . And so they lose a great deal . Almost every human being , however vague his notions of the Power addressed , is capable of being lifted and solemnized by the exercise of public prayer . When I was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ferney with my parents ; and I remember we all stopped before a chapel , and I read upon its front , - I knew Latin enough to understand it , I am pleased to say , - Deo erexit Voltaire . I never forgot it ; and knowing what a sad scoffer he was at most sacred things , I could not but be impressed with the fact that even he was not satisfied with himself , until he had shown his devotion in a public and lasting form . We all want religion sooner or later . I am afraid there are some who have no natural turn for it , as there are persons without an ear for music , to which , if I remember right , I heard one of you comparing what you called religious genius . But sorrow and misery bring even these to know what it means , in a great many instances . May I not say to you , my friend , that I am one who has learned the secret of the inner life by the discipline of trials in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time when I thought more about the shade of color in a ribbon , whether it matched my complexion or not , than I did about my spiritual interests in this world or the next . It was needful that I should learn the meaning of tkat text , " Whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth . " Since I have been taught in the school of trial I have felt , as I never could before , how precious an inheritance is the smallest patrimony of faith . When everything seemed gone from me , I found I had still one possession . The bruised reed that I had never leaned on became my staff . The smoking flax which had been a worry to my eyes burst into flame , and I lighted the taper at it which has since guided all my footsteps . And I am but one of the thousands who have had the same experience . They have been through the depths of affliction , and know the needs of the human soul . It will find its God in the unseen , - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - it must and will breathe its longings and its griefs into the heart of a Being capable of understanding all its necessities and sympathizing with all its woes. , I am jealous , yes , I own I am jealous of any word , spoken or written , that would tend to impair that birthright of reverence which becomes for so many in after years the basis of a deeper religious sentiment . And yet , as I have said , I can not and will not shut my eyes to the problems which may seriously affect our modes of conceiving the eternal truths on which , and by which , our souls must live . What a fearful time is this into which we poor sensitive and timid creatures are born ! I suppose the life of every century has more or less special resemblance to that of some particular Apostle . I can not help thinking this century has Thomas for its model . How do you suppose the other Apostles felt when that experimental philosopher explored the wounds of the Being who to them was divine with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ multiplied itself into ten thousand thousand // implements of research , challenging all mysteries , weighing the world as in a balance , and sifting though its prisms and spectroscopes the light that comes from the throne of the Eternal . Pity us , dear Lord , pity us ! The peace in believing which belonged to other ages is not for us . Again Thy wounds are opened that we may know whether it is the blood of one like ourselves which flows from them , or whether it is a Divinity that is bleeding for His creatures . Wilt Thou not take the doubt of Thy children whom the time commands to try all things in the place of the unquestioning faith of earlier and simpler-hearted generations ? We too have need of Thee . Thy martyrs in other ages were cast into the flames , but no fire could touch their immortal and indestructible faith . We sit in safety and in peace , so far as these poor bodies are concerned ; but our cherished beliefs , the hopes , the trust that stayed the hearts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cast into the fiery furnace of an age which is fast turning to dross the certainties and the sanctities once prized as our most precious inheritance . You will understand me , my dear sir , and all my solicitudes and apprehensions . Had I never been assailed by the questions that meet all thinking persons in our time , I might not have thought so anxiously about the risk of perplexing others . I know as well as you must that there are many articles of belief clinging to the skirts of our time which are the bequests of the ages of ignorance that God winked at . But for all that I would train a child in the nurture and admonition of the Lord , according to the simplest and best creed I could disentangle from those barbarisms , and I would in every way try to keep up in young persons that standard of reverence for all sacred subjects which may , without any violent transition , grow and ripen into the devotion of later years . Believe me , Very sincerely yours , 107 I have thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it lately . She seemed at first removed to a distance from all of us , but here I find myself in somewhat near relations with her . What has surprised me more than that , however , is to find that - she is becoming so much acquainted with the Register of Deeds . Of all persons in the world , I should least have thought of him as like to be interested in her , and still less , if possible , of her fancying him . I can only say they have been in pretty close conversation several times of late , and , if I dared to think it of so very calm and dignifled a personage , I should say that her color was a little heightened after one or more of these interviews . No I that would be too absurd ! But I begin to think nothing is absurd in the matter of the relations of the two sexes ; and if this high-bred woman fancies the attentions of a piece of human machinery like this elderly individual , it is none of my business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Young Astronomer 's lines . I find less occasion for meddling with them as he grows more used to versification . I think I could analyze the processes going on in his mind , and the conflict of instincts which he can not in the nature of things understand . But it is as well to give the reader a chance to find out for himself what is going on in the young man 's heart and intellect . WIND-CLOUDS AND STARDRIFTS . III . The snows that glittered on the disk of Mars Have melted , and the planet 's fiery orb Rolls in the crimson summer of its year ; But what to me the summer or the snow Of worlds that throb with life in forms un-known , If life indeed be theirs ; I heed not these . My heart is simply human ; all my care For them whose dust is fashioned like mine own ; These ache with cold and hunger , live in pain The Poet at the Breakfast - .

There are two veils of language , hid be-neath Whose sheltering folds , we dare to be our-selves , And not that other self which nods and smiles And babbles in our name ; the one is Prayer , Lending its licensed freedom to the tongue That tells our sorrows and our sins to Heaven ; The other , Verse , . that throws its spangled web Around our naked speech and makes it bold . I , whose best prayer is silence ; sitting dumb In the great temple whe.re I nightly serve Him who is throned in light , have dared to claim The poet 's franchise , though I may not hope To wear his garland ; hear me while I tell My story in such form as poets use , But breathed in fitful whispers , as the wind Sighs and then slumbers , wakes and sighs again . Thou Vision , floating in the breathless air Between me and the fairest of the stars , I tell my lonely thoughts as unto thee . Look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rude measure ; I can only show A slender-margined , unillumined page , And trust its meaning to the flattering eye That reads it in the gracious light of love . Ah , wouldst thou clothe thyself in breathing shape And nestle at my side , my voice should lend Whate'er my verse may lack of tender rhythm To make thee listen . I have stood entranced When , with her fingers wandering o'er the keys , The white enchantress with the golden hair Breathed all her soul through some unvalued rhyme ; Some flower of song that long had lost its bloom ; Lo ! its dead summer kindled as she sang ! The sweet contralto , like the ringdove 's coo , Thrilled it with brooding , fond , caressing tones , And the pale minstrel 's passion lived again , 0 Tearful and trembling as a dewy rose The wind has shaken till it fills the air July , With light and fragrance . Such the wondrous charm A song can borrow when the bosom throbs That lends it breath . So from the poet 's lips His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every cadence of its wave-like flow ; He lives the passion over , while he reads , That shook him as he sang his lofty strain , And pours his life through each resounding line , As ocean , when the stormy winds are hushed , Still rolls and thunders through his billowy caves ! Let me retrace the record of the years That made me what I am . A man most wise , But overworn with toil and bent with age , Sought me to be his scholar , - me , run wild From books and teachers , - kindled in my soul The love of knowledge ; led me to his tower , Showed me the wonders of the midnight realm His hollow sceptre ruled , or seemed to rule , Taught me the mighty secrets of the spheres , Trained me to find the glimmering specks of light Beyond the unaided sense , and on my chart To string them one by one , in order due , As on a rosary a saint his beads . I was his only scholar ; I became The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for asking ; so from year to year We wrought together , till there came a time When I , the learner , was the master half Of the twinned being in the dome-crowned tower . Minds roll in paths like planets ; they re-volve This in a larger , that a narrower ring , But round they come at last to that same phase , That self-same light and shade they showed before . I learned his annual and his monthly tale , His weekly axiom and his daily phrase , I felt them coming in the laden air , And watched them laboring up to vocal breath , Even as the first-born at his father 's board Knows ere he speaks the too familiar jest Is on its way , by some mysterious sign Forewarned , the click before the striking belL The Poet at the Breakfast-Table. // He shrivelled as I spread my growing leaves , Till trust and reverence changed to pitying care ; He lived for me in what he once had been , But I for him , a shadow , a defence , The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Leaned on so long he fell if left alone . I was his eye , his ear , his cunning hand , Love was my spur and longing after fame , But his the goading thorn of sleepless age That sees its shortening span , its lengthening shades , That clutches what it may with eager grasp , And drops at last with empty , outstretched hands . All this he dreamed not . He would sit him down Thinking to work his problems as of old , And find the star he thought so plain a blur , The columned figures labyrinthine wilds Without my comment , blind and senseless scrawls That vexed him with their riddles ; he would strive And struggle for a while , and then his eye Would lose its light , and over all his mind The cold gray mist would settle ; and ere-long The darkness fell , and I was left alone . Alone ! no climber of an Alpine cliff , No Arctic venturer on the waveless sea , Feels the dread stillness round him as it chills The heart of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worlds that crowd the sky . Alone ! And as the shepherd leaves his flock To feed upon the hillside , he meanwhile Finds converse in the warblings of the pipe Himself has fashioned for his vacant hour , So have I grown companion to myself , And to the wandering spirits of the air That smile and whisper round us in our dreams . Thus have I learned to search if I may know The whence and why of all beneath the stars And all beyond them , and to weigh my life As in a balance , - poising good and ill Against each other , - asking of the Power That flung me forth among the whirling worlds , If I am heir to any inborn right , Or only as an atom of the dust That every wind may blow where'er it will . I am not humble ; I was shown my place , Clad in such robes as Nature had at hand ; Took what she gave , not chose ; I know no shame , No fear for being simply what I am . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At Nature 's mercy . I am as a babe Borne in a giant 's arms , he knows not where Each several heart-beat , counted like the coin A miser reckons , is a special gift As from an unseen hand ; if that withhold Its bounty for a moment , I am left A clod upon the earth to which I fall . Something I find in me that well might claim The love of beings in a sphere above This doubtful twilight world of right and wrong ; Something that shows me of the self-same clay That creeps or swims or flies in humblest form . Had I been asked , before I left my bed Of shapeless dust , what clothing I would wear , I would have said , More angel and less worm ; But for their sake who are even such as I , Of the same mingled blood , I would not choose To hate that meaner portion of myself Which makes me brother to the least of men . I dare not be a coward with my lips Who dare to question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their wisdom on their knees , Some prone and grovelling in the dust like slaves ; Let the meek glow-worm glisten in the dew ; I ask to lift my taper to the sky As they who hold their lamps above their heads , Trusting the larger currents up aloft , Rather than crossing eddies round their breast , Threatening with every puff the flickering blaze . My life shall be a challenge , not a truce ! This is my homage to the mightier powers , To ask my boldest question , undismayed By muttered threats that some hysteric sense Of wrong or insult will convulse the throne // Where wisdom reigns supreme ; and if I err , They all must err who have to feel their way As bats that fly at noon ; for what are we But creatures of the night , dragged forth by day , Who needs must stumble , and with stammering steps Spell out their paths in syllables of pain ? Thou wilt not hold im scorn the child who dares Look up to Thee , the Father ,  --  * --  dares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand The worlds were cast ; yet every leaflet claims From that same hand its little shining sphere Of star-lit dew ; thine image , the great sun , Girt with his mantle of tempestuous flame , Glares in mid-heaven ; but to his noontide blaze The slender violet lifts its lidless eye , And from his splendor steals its fairest hue , Its sweetest perftsme from his scorching fire . I may just as well stop here as anywhere , for there is more of the manuscript to come , and I can only give it in instalments . July , The Young Astronomer had told me I might read any portions of his manuscript I saw fit to certain friends . I tried this last extract on the Old Master . It s the same story we all have to tell , - said he , when I had done reading. -W e are all asking questions nowadays . I should like to hear him read some of his verses himself , and I think some of the other boarders would like to . I wonder if he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read their own compositions in a sing-song sort of way ; but they do seem to love em so , that I always enjoy it . It makes me laugh a little inwardly to see how they dandle their poetical babies , but I do n't let them know it . We must get up a select party of the boarders to hear him read . We 11 send him a regular invitation . I will put my name at the head of it , and you shall write it . - That was neatly done . How I hate writing such things ! But I suppose I must do it .
