txt A sinking fund is the product of certain revenues pledged to redeem certain obligations on maturity . It is usually a bargain between a public debtor and a private creditor , whose observance depends , almost absolutely , on the respect of the debtor for a ' solemn pledge , and for whose disregard the creditor has but seldom any adequate remedy . Being a creation of public honor , a sinking fund is a device to be regarded with abhorrence by every right-thinking Tammany politician . Its productiveness is a perpetual reminder to him that money is being saved which could , with great advantage ? to the party , be spent under the direction of Aldermen vitally interested in the distribution of labor tickets . Its alleged sacredness is a standing insult to the persons who regard public revenues as the legitimate spoil of those who can get control of them .. Mr. JOHN KELLY is greatly disturbed in mind because Gov . I/owl:sox has refused to assist him in alienating the sinking fund of the City of New-York from the purposes for which it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to abuse the Governor for that decision , and the ? bankers whom ho selects to keep the City balances are showing their gratitude for what they evidently regard as a highlyremunerative privilege by circulating petitions in Wall-street urging the Legislature to pass the bill in question over the Governor 's veto . Mr. KELLY imagines that when he ha ? shown that there is in the sinking fund a surplus of nine millions and a half over and above the amount for which it was originally pledged , he has proved his case . It does not seem to have occurred to him that the only surplus with which a Legislature can deal is that which will be left after the bonds secured by the sinking fund have been finally liquidated . And he is careful to avoid all reference to the fact that the sinking fund is employed solely for the purpose of investing in the securities of the City of New-York . In ' other words , the City applies the annual revenues of the sinking fund , first to the payment of interest on the bonds secured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these bonds as mature during the year , and then to the pur. chase of its own bonds , i. e. , the virtual decrease of its debts . To be strictly accurate , there are two sinking funds , one for the redemption of a portion of the City debt , and another for the payment of interest on that debt , and there is a fourth purpose to which the revenues of these funds are applied  --  namely , the increase of the " general fund " which is employed for the reduction of the amount annually raised by taxation . The average annual receipts of this latter fund amount to three millions of dollars , and in the Controller 's last report , the surplus revenues of the sinking funds account for $1,100,000 of the total receipts of the gene rhl fund which are deducted from the amount of the tax levy . Mr. KELLY assigns two reasons for interfering with the present methods of applying the revenues of the sinking funds . First , he regards the bonds payable from assessments due by . property-owners , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a debt of the City as much as any other form of bond , " In that case , let Mr. KELLY propose without evasion or periphrasis , a bill permitting the funding for a long term of years of the assessment bonds for which he considers the City " actually liable equally with any other form of bonded indebtedness . " The tax-payers will then discover that the bonds which they have heretofore been taught to regard as merely " temporary " debt are really as permanent as any of their other burdens . They will further discover that the money which was nominally lent to improve private property was really given away , and they will be very apt to see the point of the bill introduced at the instance of the Mayor of Brooklyn , prohibiting the officials of that city from undertaking any more street improvements , nominally a charge on the property benefited , till the money to pay the contractors has been actually deposited in the City Treasury , To deplete the ' sinking . fund , as Mr. KELLY proposes , in order to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a financial juggle , as transparent as it is dishonest . Mr. KELLY 'S second reason for asking the Legislature to set aside the Governor 's veto is that some four millions and a half of City bonds mature next year , which it will bo impossible to meet without a very considerable increase of taxation . That , again , is a case which Mi ' . KELLY should have frankly met by asking power to renew so much of these bonds as he thought could not be met without serious inconvenience . As it happens ' that the Legislature has all but agreed on the bill reducing the annual expenses of the City by two millions of dollars , as another million will bo saved next year from the reduction in the State tax , and as the City never provides for a less redemption of debt out of taxation than one million a year , the grounds of Mr. KELLY 'S alarm are not particularly obvious . In the attempted defense of his bill , Mr. KELLY fails to account for the remarkable provision that the outstanding stocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once be paid out of the sinking - fund , nor does he explain why onehalf of the bonds payable from assessments are not permitted to share in the now security which he proposes to furnish for the other half . Of the twenty millions or so which are outstanding of bonds payable from assessments , some nine millions are denominated " improvement " bonds , and are not therefore , included under the phrase assessment " bonds , which is used in Mr. KELLY 'S bill . On that point , at least , its ambiguity is sufficiently obvious . In its main feature  --  that , namely , of compelling the City to sell a portion of its bonds in order to liquidate others  --  it is simply a characteristic trick to cover up and confuse a very simple operation . From first to last , the bill is a mere financial windbag , and now that it has been punctured by the Governor , we trust that the Legislature will refrain from the attempt to inflate it again .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
