txt Senator MAnvix 's bill in behalf of pauper children is a portion of that humane legislation in this State which is an honor to its civilization . The modern and enlightened view in regard to those most unfortunate little ones , the offspring of paupers , is that they should under no circumstances be allowed to grow up in an alms-house , under the inevitable influences of such an institution . Of all hopeless victims of human neglect , those are the most so who have a parentage of pauperism and crime . Moral evils intensify themselves by inheritance . When a reformer ( as is not uncommon in all our States ) meets in a country poor-house with the third gen - erationof paupers and prostitutes , he knows at ' once that , humanly speaking , the case is almost beyond any hopeful treatment . The child is condemned before he begins his career . The object of all the best modern legislation on this subject is to break up heredity and to utterly change surrounding circumstances . By the New-York law of 1875 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community was inaugurated hero . No almshouse was permitted to retain a pauper child between the ages of 3 and 16 , unless he was hopelessly defective , but was compelled to place him in asylums or private families . The child of a pauper was not to be held in law a pauper , and the inheritance of pauperism , and all its attendant evils , was to be broken . This act of wise humanity , under the intelligent supervision of the State Board of Charities , rescued thousands of innocent children from lives of shame and idleness ; and will continue in coming years to work in this happy direction . It is a law which should be imitated in every State , until it can be said that nowhere in the Union is a child brought up in an almshouse . Senator Marvin 's bill , which has already passed the Senate and is before the House , makes some improvements on the original law in that it removes children as 3%. sung as 2 years from the poor-houses , and removes all children  --  the sick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paralytic  --  from the charge of such institutions . But in the debate in the Senate the Roman Catholic members appended an amendment , which , while fair in appearance , may give occasion for much trouble and confusion afterward . This provides that children may only be . transferred to such asylums , or institutions " as are governed or controlled by.officers or persons of the same religious faith as the parents of such children , as far as is practicable . " When it is remembered that probably seven out of ten of the paupers of the State are nominally Roman Catholics , it will be seen how largely such an amendment would throw the administration of pauper , children in New-York into the hands of one sect . One institution for such children near this City , the " Protectory. " already draws from our tax-payers ( who are mainly Protestant ) some $225,000 per annum , on a pro rata allowance of over $100 per capita , while the Legislature has just allotted it $50 , - 000 more in the Supply bill . This amendment would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowance , and would tend to concentrate too many children in one institution . But in remote country districts such an amendment would occasion mast annoyance . Often the only asylum within hundreds of miles is under Protestant charge , dna the children must be sent far away at great expense or the law ho violated . The " defeetive " . children would otherwise be t.ansferred to the State asylums for the idiots , blind , deaf and dumb , and the like , where they would have the best of treatment . Now , such children must be transferred to the ' hospital wards of Catholic institutions , often not under the wisest management . In this City , for instance , a crippled or ruptured pauper child could not be sent to those excellent asylums , the " Orthopaedic " and that for " the ruptured and crippled , " but must be placed in the sick ward of the " Protectory . " There are no abuses for which such nu amendment might he designed as a remedy . No Catholic has complained of poor children of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Poor-house Superintendents are always sufficiently ready to gratify the religious prejudices of the poor . It is simply an effort of the priests to grasp more of our Poor law administration . They - Would keep their hold upon , and draw public money for , the care of even the poorest and most ignorant . Both the State Board and the volunteer Board for the State Charities oppoN : , this amendment . We trust that the House will strike it from the bill .
