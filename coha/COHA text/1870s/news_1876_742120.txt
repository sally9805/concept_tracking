txt JOHANNA TURBIN is a resident of the District ' of Columbia who , some time since , had a little difficulty with her husband . After a lively debate , in which Mr. TURBIN displayed an unbecoming obstinacy , his wife convinced him of his error by summarily killing him , and subsequently soothed her wounded feelings by cutting him in pieces . A brutal Grand Jury , wholly forgetful of the respect due to Mrs. TURBIN 'S sex , indicted her for murder , of which crime she was found guilty . On Tuesday last she was arraigned for sentence , but fortunately for the honor of our country , the Judge was a truly chivalrous man . He informed Mrs. TURBIN that she had committed " a most atrocious and revolting " crime , and that " if there ever was a case in which capital punishment was deserved " it was the case under consideration . Nevertheless , the Judge felt " a repulsion " toward hanging a woman , and he therefore announced that he would take measures to secure the commutation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass , and that the criminal could confidently count upon escaping the gallows . Thus we are spared the disgrace of hanging a woman merely because she had committed an atrocious crime , and the sacred right of women to kill their husbands is established more firmly than ever . Hitherto women who have been tried for murder have been acquitted on the plea of insanity . Of course , this was merely a legal fiction , invented in order to remedy the failure of the law to exempt the sex from capital punishment . Every one knows that Mrs. HARRIS , Mrs. FAIR , and other female homicides , were perfectly sane , and were acquitted solely because of their sex . Still , no lawyer has so far ventured to claim an acquittal for a female homicide on the solitary plea that she was a woman . While the fiction of " temporary insanity " has always secured the desired result , it was a clumsy way o supplementing a defect in the law . That defect , no longer exists . The Washington . Judge has boldly decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This decision renders the insanity plea henceforth unnecessary , and when Mrs. HOUSE kills her next husband , and is indicted by an ignorant grand jury , her counsel will save her from the gallows by merely proving that she is a woman , and citing the precedent established in the case of Mrs. TURBIN . That no plea of insanity was made in Mrs. TURBIN 'S behalf may seem strange , but it is readily accounted for by the fact that she , was a colored woman . lc is universally recognized by our courts that colceed criminals are neVer insane . As a rule , the colored murderer has neither money , friends , nor political influence , and hence he is hanged with groat promptness , and the inexorable impartiality of the law is thus justified . Had Mrs. TURBIN been a white woman , the jury would have found her insane without leaving their seats . Being a colored woman , the hypothesis of her insanity was out of the question , and hence had it not been for the Christian Judge , who regarded her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been hanged for the murder of which the jury was compelled to find her guilty . The judicial announcement of the great truth that women ought not to be hanged is a matter upon which honest and straightforward people ought to congratulate themselves . To laymen who can not appreciate the subtleties of law , it has always seemed unpleasantly disingenuous to ask for the acquittal of a female homicide on the false plea of insanity , when the Judge , the jury , and the public perfectly well understand that the defense was the fact of the defendant 's sex . Henceforth there will be an end of this sort of thing . When next a woman is tried for murder , her lawyer will call witnesses who have seen her try to hit a nail with a hammer , and have noticed the subsequent state of her fingers , or who are prepared to swear that they have known her to mend broken chairs with mucilage ; and having thus proved her to be a woman , he will demand and secure her acquittal . The maxim that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will hereafter be an acknowledged principle of our criminal jurisprudence , and even the humble colored woman whose razor carves the throats of objectionable husbands will no longer be in peril of her life because her color is judicially held to be incompatible with insanity . Having gone so far in our determination to honor and protect woman , we ought to go a step further . Now that it is settled that no woman can be hanged for murder , we should also exempt the sex from punishment for lesser crimes . We have given women authority to take our lives whenever they so desire , and we ought to be equally willing to surrender to them our property . The chivalry which refuses to hang a woman for murder but which punishes her for theft is inconsistent . What is wanted is an amendment to the Constitution guaranteeing to women the full enjoyment of theft , arson , forgery , and other crimes . The world will then know that we are the most chivalrous people in existence , and that our respect for women is so unbounded that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be as irresponsible as full-grown lunatics or chemically pure idiots.
