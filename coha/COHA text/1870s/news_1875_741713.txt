txt What the late Mr. Ely , of Newton , used to tall the " average man " of Massachusetts is having rather a serious time of it in politics justnow . With the leaders in doubt , of course it is hard . for the average man to see just what ought to be done . It is a good . many years since the Republicans of this State have had to wonder whether they were going to win or not . The great fight , if any , used to be over the nomination . That once secured it was a walk over the course for whoever was selected . The annual convention of the Democrats was a farce , and some people wondered how they could muster tip enthusiasm enough to pay for a hail and the *tiler contingent expenses of a State convention . The result last year . however , changed the phase of affairs , and for the first time in the recollection of the younger politicians of this generation , Massachusetts bad a Democratic Governor . There were many reasons which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a matter of course , was a lack of votes . When it was announced that William Gaston , Democrat , had defeated Thomas Talbot , Republican , it seemed to most people as though the earth would soon stop revolving upon its axis , and try to turn on that of some other planet . CAUSES OP THE DISASTER . As the campaign of last year shows plainly the breakers on which the party was temporarily wrecked , and as they must be avoided this year , it may be well to briefly consider what they were . Gov . Talbot had taken a strong stand for prohibition , and had shown a vigorous determination to stand by his colors . This weakened him somewhat with those members of the party who favored liberal legislation , and . there was a good deal of indifference on that account . The Democrats organized quietly , but thoroughly , while the Republicans were not very enthusiastic and did not dream of the necessity of much work . But one of the great causes of defeat was the persistence with which many candidates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the friends of some Congressmen , issued split tickets  --  that is. regular Republican tickets with the exception that Mr. Gaston , the Democratic nominee for Governor , was substituted for Mr. Talbot , the Republican nominee . This has alwaysebeen a custom in many districts , and it has been growing and spreading considerably of late years . The theory has always bean that a certain number of votes can be caught in that way , and as the Governor has always had a good majority , few Republicans have ever hesitated to whittle it off a little to contribute to a local triumph in a close district . There seems to be no doubt that there were 200,000 or 300,000 ballots of that description printed in Eastern Massachusetts in that campaign . It was such a favorite pastime with the . Republicans that the Democrats ordered 80,000 of that kind in one printing-office in Boston . These split tickets were pushed hard in every district in this if not in all sections of the State . It had worked charmingly before . but this time it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polls a good many good Republicans saw too late that they had . helped defeat the head of their ticket , and got the rest in , without meaning to mar its uniformity . For the Secretary of State , Treasurer , Auditor , and Attorney General , Republicans were all elected . To be sure a good many divisions and bickerings and the general looseness of party lines contributed to-the defeat , but the completeness with which the right kind of a split ticket was pushed at all the polling places , drove in all the nails and clinched them on the other side of the line . THE NEED OF THIS CAMPAIGN . There seems to be no possibility of a mistake in the same direction this year . The Republican Party will be slow to repeat its error . What they seem to need more than anything else is to put General Harmony in command of all the forces , and let him lead . Petty quarrels have been very numerous in consequence of the long lease of power which the party has enjoyed , and with which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best interests of the State . These and more serious divisions must all be buried . GOV . GASTON 'S ADMINISTR 4 . TION . The past year has not been one of special moment . The average man thinks Gaston has made a good Governor . The only complaints come from Democrats , who think that he has not leaned toward them cften enough in appointments , forgetting that he has a Republican Council , and must be particular in those matters . A great many people are exceedingly angry because he would not hang the Pomeroy boy . A great many Democrats , - when they found victory perched on their banner last Pall , were sorry they bad not nominated Mr. Saltoustall , or some more prominent Democrat , as Mr. Gaston is not severely partisan . If they had nominated Mr. Saltoastall , it is safe to assume that be would not have been introduced at the Harvard Commencement dinner as a Governor who was elected by the votes of his political opponents , because he could not have been other wise elected . There is some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will end in smoke , as he is the best candidate the Democrate can put forth , and they know it . Hence , his renomination is sure . The fight for the other places on the Democratic ticket will be warm this year , as the prospects of success are more flattering than usual . There has been some talk of a mixed ticket of Democrats and Republicans , but it is believed that it will not come to anything . THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES . The three men talked of for the Republican nomination are Dr. George B. Loring , Hon. Thomas Talbot . and Hon. A. H. Rice . Judge Devens has been mentioned , but refuses to be considered as a candidate . He was our Bunker Hill centennial orator , and he is a man who stands exceedingly well among all classes in the State . He is one of the Judges of the Supreme Court , has a life appointment which is congenial to his tastes , is not a man of wealth , and hence he prefers to remain where be is . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where he would have to take up the practice of law again , and he probably knows too well the unsatisfactory nature of political service to wish to enter the - lista at this time and resign his judgeship . There is no question as to his fitness for the position , nor does there seem to be any question in regard to his election it he be nominated . But , as I have said , he utterly refuses to consider the question , and is not in the field in any sense . Mr. Talbot , who was defeated . last year , by Got . Gaston , is one of the self-made men who are not few in this State  --  one whose early opportunities were not so numerous as some have enjoyed , but whose self-reliance , shrewdness , and great natural abilities have made him a successful and prosperous business man . He has frequently been honored with office , and his duty has always been well done . His friends are numerous , and they feel sure that he can be nominated at Worcester . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interests of the party to promote his personal aggrandizement . While he daily receives indications from all sections that his nomination will be unquestioned , he is considering all the circumstances of the case , and debating whether it will be best for him to take the nomination if it should be tendered . to him . He is certainly fair in the matter , and though one of the firmest temperance men in the State he wants the license law to have a fair trial . Mr. Rice was for some time a member of Congress , and he is a gentleman of high reputation . his strength is largely in Boston , where he is best known . He has a large number of strong and influential friends , who are zealously at work for him , and who feel buoyant and hopeful . With the masses he may seem a trifle too aristocratic , or at least that idea has been advanced in several sections . Dr. Loring is pretty generally known in the country . lie has a multitude of friends , and they mean to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one thing is certain . The Republican Party must unite thoroughly on some candidate . If Dr. Loring is nominated , the friends of Mr. Talbot and Mr. Rice must all unite in securing his election , and so must it be if Mr. Talbot or Mr. Rice are nominated . Mr. Gaston is a strong candidate ; the drift-wood which goes with either one party or the other has been gravitating toward the Democratic Party for a year or two , and it the Republican Party desire to win , they must be united and active .
