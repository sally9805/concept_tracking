Thaxter , Celia , 1835-1894 : O the merry wind , and the merrier rain from Poems , in Silhouettes And Songs illustrative of the months ( 1876 ) O the merry wind , and the merrier rain , And welcome indeed is the spring again ! Though fierce from the north the swift gust flies , And the drops fall cold from the cloudy skies , And the snow-streaked fields lie still and dead , And harshly the crow calls overhead ,  --  The willows are bursting their shining buds , And the roadsides gleam with their silver studs , And down by the river their boughs they hold To the gray sky , glowing like ruddy gold ; And the alder catkins are swinging free , And toss like the children 's locks in glee . Look up at the maple 's crimsoning tips , Red as the children 's cheeks and lips ! O merry the wind and merry the rain That blustering brings us the spring again ! Celia Thaxter . Thaxter , Celia , 1835-1894 : How better far than a golden floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months ( 1876 ) How better far than a golden floor The children find the bare earth once more ! The frost had locked it so safe and fast , But April has found the key at last ; Her warm hand has unlocked it all , And here are treasures for great and small ! The snow no longer our business stops , Plenty of room now for marbles and tops ! And , children , when you are tired of play , Come over the fields to the woods away , Where sweet at sunset the hyla sings , Like a quaint brown bird that has lost its wings . Come to the brook where the cowslips stout Their broad bright leaves push bravely out . Listen , the robin is calling loud ; Look at his gay red breast so proud ! Feel how the wind blows soft and warm ,  --  Who would believe it could bluster and storm ! The days are growing so still and fair , ' T is pleasant only to breathe the air ; And life is lovely in field or street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thaxter.
