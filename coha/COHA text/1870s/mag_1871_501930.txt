WITh AN ACCOUNT OF THE ORIGIN AND COMMAND OF TILE FIRST ThERE NAVAL EXPEDITIONS OF TiLE WAR . FIRST PAPER . rpii* rebellion which commenced in the .1 .. spring of 1861 , though long threatened , found the country almost wholly unprepared for the conflict . Few in the Free States could be made to believe there would be an appeal to arms for the alleged or real grievances of which certain impassioned leaders complained . There had been severe party strife for years , threats to nullify or resist Federal laws , which gradually assumed a sectional character ; but the real differences or causes of difference were not such as to lead necessarily to hostilities , had not war or the subversion of the Government been the design of some of the ambitious and trusted men in high official position . But while almost the whole of the people of the Northern States were disbelievers in any civil war , a very different condition of things existed at the South . There the apprehensions were serious and almost universal that a fierce struggle was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every State were opposed to armed resistance to the Government , and opposed to any scheme for dissolving the Union . Yet they bad been persuaded , and actually believed , that they were greatly wronged and oppressed by Federal legislation . But their o**position to violent mensures was tame and negative from the very fact that there was no substantial cause for complaint , while the decisive element was mischievous , positive , energetic , and belligerent . The secession or disunion party had by activity and vigilance obtained possession of the State governments through the South in 1860 , and made extensive preparations to resist the General Government . The election of Abraham Lincoln , brought about by the secession leaders who had deliberately and designedly broken up the Democratic organization , was made the pretext for seceding from the Union . As soon as the result of the election in 1860 was known , before any action bad been taken , and while the Democratic party had the President and a majority of Congress , the State of South Carolina took instant measures for dissolving her connection with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unprovoked and uncalled for by any serious *rievance or aggressive actioll of the Federal Government , was followed by other States . Members of Congress with dramatic ostentation and parade resigned their seats and left Washington . Scenes similar to these , but not carried to so great length , had previously occurred , and the Administration and others from the North appear to have viewed these proceedings , now as then , as an excess of party bitterness which would exhaust itself in words . No effective measares were taken to counteract them and strengthen the Government When , therefore , Congress adjourned and the change of administration took place on the 4th of March , 1861 , the new incumbents found the Government wholly unprepared by any extra-legislative an thority or preparation to maintain itself against the formidable combination that had so long been maturing schemes for its destruction . The Navy Department was perhaps in the most feeble and deplorable condition of any branch of the Government for the emer*ency-without vessels , or armament , or men , and without legal authority to increase or strengthen either . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , greater in extent than the whole coast of Europe from Cape Trafalgar to Cape North , was ordered in April ; and as we had not vessels , guns , or men for such a work , a navy had to be improvised to enforce it . Ships in the merchant service which could be made available were forthwith procured , guns were manufactured , men were enlisted , and the whole resources of the country were put in immediate requisition to meet the crisis . But although the energies and abilities of the nation were taxed and called out with wonderful and unexampled rapidity , they did not satisfy the impatience of the people , who had been taught , and were willing to believe , the rebellion could be suppresseinl and peace be restored in ninety days . // The Government discharged as it best could with the limited means at its disposal the new and extraordinary duties which , in addition to ordinary current affairs , devolved upon it . The change of administration involved in some respects a change of policy and of men in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their new positions , and entitled to encouragement and support even had the times been propitious . Coming from old opposing parties , their political principles were not in all respects homogeneous . Little time was given them , however , for concert and concentration before war-intestine war , the worst and most to be deplored of all conflicts-was precipitated upon the country . The first call for seventy-five thousand men to serve for three months seems , since the experience we have had through four eventful years with a million of men under arms , to have been insignificant in numbers and ridiculous in time for the suppression of that formidable rebellion , which shook the continent , shattered the framework of the Government , and taxed the energies of the nation ; but without any previous preparation the call embraced as many as the country could readily arm , equip , supply , and organize ; and few then believed we were to have a protracted war . Little , comparatively , was attempted , and but little was accomplished at the beginning . The rebels , having resistance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conflict . Reverses to the Union cause followed , with murmurs and general dissatisfaction because the Administration was apparently so dilatory and inefficient in its movements , and because our undisciplined troops were not invincible and irresistible . Time was necessary to equip our few naval vessels ; to procure and to prepare the purchased and chartered steamers for naval service ; to recall our foreign squadrons ; to manufacture ordnance , to get supplies , and to enlist seamen . No allowance was made for these things by the inconsiderate and unthinking , who , under the impression that vessels were ready and equipped , and crews enlisted and trained , were loud in their complaints of the inefficiency of the navy and the Navy Department . But those who were intelligent and informed on the subject , instead of complaining , were amazed that so much in so brief a period was accomplished . The rebels felt and acknowledged it . A joint Committee of the Confederate Congre ' *s , " appointed to investigate the administration of the Navy Department " of the insurgents , in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their navy , dwell on the energy and power which they bad encountered . They say : " The vast naval resources , great commercial school for seamen , numerous artisans , and vast workshops enabled him to augment this formidable force with a rapidity unequalled in naval history , while the naval resources of the world were open to him . It would have required many years , even under the most favorable circumstances , for us to have built and equipped as many and such vessels as the enemy began the war with . " Admiral Da Pont , writing from Port Royal July , 1862 , said to a friend : " I do not hesitate to say that nothing has ever come up to the energy of the Navy Department in any country . The improvised navy for which Mr. Welles was so abused , and which in my judgment saved us a foreign war by preventing the blockade from being broken by the English and French , are among its great deeds . " While most persons anticipated a speedy suppression of the insurrectien and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Navy came to a different conclusion , lie saw that this was no mere impulsive outbreak . The retiring Administration , without being specially committed to the secession movement , had studiously abstained from the exercise of any authority to prevent or suppress it . It had placed no garrisons in the forts of the South , though the local authorities were organizing actively for armed resistance to Federal laws . Were the new Administration to attempt to send troops or supplies , which was anticipated and expected by the secessionists and their sympathizers , the movement would be denounced and resisted as just cause of offence . This was made manifest when the Administration in pursuance of its duty endeavored to send provisions to the small garrison in Sumter . That peaceful attempt of the Government to discharge its duty was made the pretext for an assault on the fortress and the flag . White the retiring Federal Administra ( // hon had done nothing toward maintaining the national authority in the insurrectionary region , the State governments which were in the hands and under the control of the secessionists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws to obstruct and break down the Federal Union . Their proceedings nad been deliberate , and so extensive and powerful , and Congress had left the Federal Government so wholly unprepared for the conflict , that the Secretary of the Navy was convinced the struggle would be severe , and that the duration of the war would extend far beyond the three months for which the troops had been ordered out . lie took his measures accordingly . Without specific legal authority , he proceeded not only to buy and charter merchant steamers , but he assumed the rcsponsibility of immediately ordering , without law and without appropriations , the construction of over thirty naval steamers , none of which could be completed within six months from the attack on Sumter and long after the terms of the 75,000 men had expired , which many supposed would close the insurrection . It is not necessary to speculate on what would have been said and done had the insurrection been suppressed within ninety days , with this large increase of our naval force and immense expenditure . As it was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extra session , before even the message of the President had been received stating the object for convening Congress , was the introduction of a resolution by the then Chairman of the Naval Committee of the Senate , inquiring by what authority and at what rates the Secretary of the Navy had increased his expenditures and made contracts and purchases for the navy . At home and abroad the blockade was pronounced an impossibility ; but the Navy Department put forth all its energies to establish and make it effective . There were soon employed in the various navy and private ship yards , foundries , and machine shops a force of not less than twenty thousand mechanics and workmen , exclusive of seamen enlisted in the service . As soon as a small force was placed before the principal ports to cut off traffic with the rebel States , the Navy Department commenced projecting expeditions on the coast . The first of these was for the capture of the batteries which the rebels had constructed at hatteras inlet , from which point they were sending out small marauding craft to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coast . Preparations for the lIatter* s expedition , an enterprise which originated in and was put in operation by the Navy Department , were begun in July . General Scott , who was consulted , and of whom military cooperation was asked , consented to spare troops from Fortress Monroe to accompany the expedition when the navy was ready , provided the detachment was not detained after the result , whatever that might be . On the 9th of August I wrote Flag Officer Striagham in relation to the Hatteras expedition , that " in order to take the batteries to which you allude , General Scott assures me he will authorize General Butler to detail a military force to accompany the expedition . " When this assurance was given General B. F. Butler was in command at Fortress Monroe ; but on the 13th of August , four days after , General Wool was ordered to relieve him , which he did on the 19th of August . The order which General Scott promised on the 9th to issue to General Butler was promj ) tly given when required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an express nnderstanding that the troops should return to Fortress Monroe , and not remain at the inlet to garrison the forts . General Butler , relieved by General Wool , sought and was assigned to command the 900 men that were detailed to accompany the navy , and embarked with Flag Officer Striugham in the Minnesota , which sailed from humpton Roads on the 26th of August . The success at hatteras , the first naval expedition , and it may be said perhaps the first substantial victory of the war , was followed by the more important expedition to Port Royal under Admiral Du Pont . In this expedition the co*peratin* military force was commanded by ( lcneral Thomas W. Sherman . Both of these expeditions originated in the Navy Department . They were quietly planned , and matured with a secresy unknown to the military operations of that period . Hence probably the correspondents and writers of the day , who usually obtained their first information of events through the War Department or from army officers , mis- // stated and gave erroneous accounts of these and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military officers which strictly belonged to naval coinmanders . Naval officers were invariably prohibited from givin information of naval movements for publication , and newspaper corresponden , always inquisitive and generally intelligent , were for this reason carefully excluded from the expeditions , and as far as possible from all knowledge in regard to naval operations . This rigid and restrictive policy of the navy was in such marked contrast to that of the military , where correspondents were generally welcomed and often furnished with every facility to obtain and publish army operations , was unsatisfimctory , led to much misrepresentation of the Navy Department , and sometimes to gross injustice to the navy . Many of the perverted statements which had their origin in pique toward those who excluded , and favor toward those who received and encouraged them in their effurts to be the first to lay before the public news which all desired to know , but which it was impolitic and often injurious to publish , have gone into the histories which , hastily got up , were afterward without examnination adopted as authentic . Nearly every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represents him as a subordinate attached to a military enterprise . They speak , not of Fla* Officer Striugham 's expedition , but of " General Butler 's expedition to hatteras . " Some of them assame that the expedition ori*inated with and was achieved by him , when he merely went under orders with two battalions which were sent in compliance with a request made by the Navy Department for troops to assist Flag Officer Striagham , the naval commander , in a naval expedition of which he knew nothing until he received orders from General Scott directing him to aid and cooperate in a naval enterprise . The preliminary arrangements for the expedition which resulted in the capture of Port Royal , a more important and more elaborate undertaking , were commenced really before those of Hatteras . As early as the 25th of June a board was convened in the Navy Department , composed of Captain , afterward Rear-Admiral S. F. Du Pont , Professor A. D. Bache , Chief of the Coast Survey , with whom the Secretary of War associated , by special request , Major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Engineers . Later , Commander , now Rear-Admiral Charlie II . Davis , who officiated as secretary , was added to this board . Time object and purpose of the Navy Department in convening this board , and the date when the expedition under Flag Officer Do I*ont was first contemplated , will be best understood by publishing the original order , which was on the 25th of June , only two months after the proclamnation of blockade had been issued and beIbre it had been made absolutely efficient at all points : Confidential . NAVY DEPARTMENT , June 25 , 1861 . Captain S. F. IOu PONT and Prof. A. D. BACHE , Board , etc . GENTLEMEN : The Navy Department is desirous to condense all the information in the archives of the Government which may be considered usefol to the blockading squadrons , and the Board are therefore requested to prepare such matter as in their judgment may seem necessary ; first , extending from the Chesapeake to Key XVest ; secondly , fi-om Key West to the extreme southern point of Texas . It is imperative that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Atlantic coast , and Feroandina and Port Royal al-c spoken of . Perhaps others will occur to the Board . All facts beariu* upon such a contemplated movement are deso-ed at an early moment . Subsequently similar points in the Gulf of Mexico will be considered . It is also very desirable that the practicability of closing all the Southern ports by mechanical means should be folly discussed and reported upon . Very respectfully , etc. , GIDEON WELLES . On the 18th of September a division of the Atlantic squadron took place . Captain Do Pont was appointed commander of the South Atlantic blockading squadron . On the 12th of October he mcceived final orders , and sailed on the 29th . In his final instructions , which were strictly confidential , Bull 's Bay , St. lIelena , Port Royal , and Fernandina were named as accessible and desirable points ; hot the preference of the Department for Port Royal was not put in writing , lest it might by some means become public and the rebels put on their guard . The views of the Department in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do Pont in conversation , but the opinions of that officer did not at first coincide with those of the Department . his choice was Boll 's Bay , from an apprehension that Port Royal was // too strongly fortified and that he could not get his flag-ship , the Wabash , over the bar . Bot he came into the measure at the last moment-having been finally persuaded , as he afterward admitted , by the Assistant Secretary , who visited New York for that purpose before he sailed ; and he frankly said after the result , that to have gone to Bull 's Bay , which was his design , would have been an error . The destination was , however , left indefinite in his orders , and his conclusions were not to be communicated to the commanders of the various vessels until they sailed , when the point of rendezvous was indicated in sealed orders , which were not to be opened until at sea . This uncertainty in regard to the final destination of the squadron prevented the enemy from concentrating a formidable force at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with large expeditions , the departure of Du Pont 's squadron was delayed , and it did not get off until the 29th of October . As soon as the arrangements for that enterprise were completed , and before the squadron left Hampton Roads , the attention of the Department , previously occupied , was intently directed toward New Orleans , the most important place in every point of view in the insurrectionary region , and the most difficult to effectually blockade . The whole country , and especially the great Northwest , was interested in the free and uninterrupted navigation of the Mississippi , the ocean outlet of the immense central valley which contains within its slopes one-half the States and territory and is the very heart of the Union . New Orleans is the great depot for its products , and Forts Jackson and St. Philip , which protected it , were the gates that barred ocean communication with the city . To gain possession of the river and of the city was one of the first objects which addressed itself to the Administration after the war opened , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specially interested . The unity of the inhabitants and States of the valley under one government , and the unresisted communication of its people through the natural and national highway which belonged alike to those on the upper as well as the lower Mississipi , called out the combined energies of all . The Government sympathized with and responded to the demands that were made 673 for the assertion and maintenance of this great national right without rest.rietion or interruption . Military plans had been projected from the beginning to obtain control of this national thoroughfisre and the city near its mouth ; but all of these schemes contemaplated a combined army and navy movement which should descend from Cairo on the upper waters of the Mississippi . The idea of ' a naval conquest of New Orleans from the Gulf was not entertained by the army or the Administration . When , therefore , the Navy Department had perfected its arrangements for the Port Royal expedition and given final instructions to Flag Officer Da Pont , it begun to consider the embarrassments and difficulty of blockading the Mississippi Delta , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As early as the 31st of July the Department had proposed to Comumodore Mervine , then in command of the blockading squadron in the Gulf , to establi.sh and hold a battery at or near the head of " the passes of the Mississippi , " and he was authorized to take for that purpose naval guns that were at Tortugas , a large number having been borrowed by the War Department and sent out to Fort Piekens on the recommendation of Captain Meigs of the Engineers , but never used . These guns were left exposed on the beach at Tortugas . The fiAlowing is an extract from the communication of the Department referred to : NAVY DEPARTMENT July 31 , 1861 . Flag Officer Wam . MEEVINE , commanding Gait Blockading Squadron . SIR : . . . . A large number of naval guns sent out to Fort Pickens have been landed at Tortugas . If you deem it practicable in your judgment to establish and hold a battery at or near the head of the passes of the Mississippi ( and the subject is most earnestly pressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take any number of these guns and construct such a riattery . An engineer officer will proba. bly be detailed by the senior army officer at your request , and laborers to assist might be hired at Key West . Time necessity of taking measures to effectually close time river seems to leave no alternative but the construction of one or more 1 ) atteries , and any expenditures to accomplish this will be approved Imy the Departmaent . Very respectfully , etc. , GIDEON WELLES The capture of the forts and the city by a naval expedition from the Gulf was at that time entertained by no one , and an // effective blockade of the numerous passes by naval vessels alone seemed impossible . One or more batteries above the delta was deemed the best , and perhaps the only effectual method of preventing communication . In the mean tirue the rebels had in July taken possession of and repaired the fortifications at Ship island , ten or twelve miles off the coast , and some sixty miles from New Orleans , about equidistant from Mobile , and one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strategic importance of this place was felt , and as soon as the Department became aware of the facts the following communication was addressed to Flag Officer Mcrvine : Confidential . NAVY DEPARTMENT , August 23 , 1861 . Flag Officer WILLIAM MERVINE , commanding Gulf Blockadin* Squadron . SIR : In your despatch No. - of the 22d July , you report that you intend to visit Ship Island . It has been a matter of surprise and regret that you should have permitted so impor nt a position as Silip Island te have been fortified and retained by the insur , . , ents . At tins distance it is difficult to understand tile reasons for tile apparent inactivity and indifference that have governed in this matter . If the force under your command is not all that we conid wish , or all tilat we intend it shall be , still it is sufficient for some demonstration , and it would be well to make up in activity and extra exertion for the want of numbers . You have large ships , heavy batteries , young and willing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ship Island . They alight have been prevented entirely from intrenching themselves upon it . In order to have ( lone tllis , smaller vessels would have been necessarily substituted to gimard the passes . This , it would seem , nli*ht have been done . I allude to tIlese matters , not knowing what action you have taken in the premises since the 2*d nIt . Tilere is great uneasiness in the public mind , as well as anxiety in the Department , on the apparent inactivity of our squadrons . I am , respectfully , your obedient servant , GIDEON WELLES . The naval preparations made in consequence of these orders alarmed the rebels , who during their occupation of Ship Island had intrenched themselves and rebuilt the fort which had been previously destroyed . Captain W. W. McKean relieved Flag Officer Mervine of the command of the Gulf squadron in September . The works on Ship island were abandoned by the rebels with some precipitation soon after , and on the 17th of September Commander Melancton Smith of the steamer Massa chusetts landed a force and took possession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and strengthened the fort by a formidable armament of nine-inch Dahlgren guns and rifled cannon . Barracks were also erected from the materials which tIle rebels left on the island when they fled ; and having in view at that early day an effective naval demonstration in that quarter , the island was held by the navy until troops could be sent to occupy it . The importance of retaining the island for naval operations was duly appreciated by the Government , and on representations from the Navy Department a military force of 2,500 *ncn was promised for its occupation . This force was intended to relieve the seamen from confined shore duty and allow them more active service afloat . Some effort was required to effect this object , and circumstances favored the application . General Butler had rendered important services early in the war at Annapolis and Baltimore . These services were as much of a civil as military character , and as such were valued by the Administration . The leading and educated army officers , while they recognized the ability of General Bulter as a civil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not admit that his education , training , genius , or capacity were military , or adapted to his military aspirations or the position assigned him . He had been relieved from command first at Baltimore and then at Fortress Monroe . But his brief administration at Baltimore and some 6 his acts and papers had made him popular in that stormy period . in order therefore that he might have command commensurate with ll* office and retain nominal military rank and position , he was early in the autumn , after he accompanied Flag Officer Stringham to hatteras , sent to the New England States , which were made a distinct military department , to which he was assigned , with authority to raise by enlistment a force to serve on the coast wherever wanted . in raising these troops a difficulty had occurred between him and Governor Andrew of Massachusetts , causing additional embarrassment to the Administration , from which it was felt all would be relieved were this restless officer sent to Ship island or the far Southwest , where his energy , activity , and impulsive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fore , we continued to assist in the movemeat for descending the river , whatever might be its termination , we felt the necessity of projecting other and more effective and definite measures , having in view the capture of New Orleans and the possession of the lower Mississippi by a naval expedition , which should ascend from the Gulf But it was not easy to convince others , and particularly military men , that such an enterprise was feasible . Little encouragement was received from any quarter . In general and desultory conversation with military and naval men and others , the passage of the forts and capture of New Orleans was spoken of as a desirable but not a practicable naval undertaking . Yet it was noted and remembered by the Navy Department that our steamers had passed and repassed the batteries at Hatteras and Port Royal , had overcome them without serious injury to the vessels , and it was asked why could not the forts in the Mississippi be passed in like manner ? There were , it is true , a narrow channel , a rapid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encountered , which might prove more formidable than the batteries at Hatteras and Hilton Head ; but with steamships the propelling power of the vessel-now no longer dependent on wind and tide-was subject to the commander , and with some loss of vessels , some sacrifice of life , it was believed the forts might be run . This was an occasion when it became necessary to take great risks to accomplish great results . What was early spoken of as a possibility-an event hoped for rather than attainable-gradually gained favor with the Navy Department , until the conclusion was reached that it was not only practicable , but the best step which could be taken for perfecting the blockade , getting possession of the river , and to aid in suppressing the rebellion . The Assistant Secretary , Mr. Fox , who had been familiar with the river while in the merchant service , was earnest and unequivocal for a purely naval attack , and was confident the passage of the forts might be effected without military assistance . When , therefore , intelligence of the capture of the forts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had been effected  --  the squadron under Du Pont , like that under Striagham , having passed and repassed the batteries , Du Pont 's in a circle , thus incurring double risk , without material injury to the vessels or serious loss of life  --  the views of the Navy Department in regard to the passage of Forts Jackson and St. Philip and the capture of New Orleans , hitherto speculative and uncertain , were confirmed , and measures for its accomplishment were commenced . President Lincoln was made acquainted with our views and our programme for passing the forts and the capture of New Orleans by the navy , and our belief in its success , based on the fact that steam had wrought a revolution in naval warfare , practical proof of which was furnished in the achievements of the navy at Hatteras and Port Royal . If the forts were passed , the fall of New Orleans was certain . He became deeply interested , but w s at first somewhat incredulous as to the feasibility of the enterprise . Among the important movements projected , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom there were many in and about the War Department whom he saw daily , had not suggested it . They had a different programme , and he had faith that the combined army and navy descent of the river which had been resolved upon , and was a favorite scheme in army circles , would sooner and more easily secure the city than any naval expedition ascending from the Gulf . His attention had been wholly directed to this combined movement for descending the Mississippi , which seemed more plausible and more powerful than the proposed ascent , where the fleet must struggle a ainst a strong current and pass two of the most formidable forts on the continent . But , it was urged , the very fact that they were formidable , that the rebels confided in their strength , was an argument in our favor . On that side of the city they felt secure , and their chief preparations were and would be to resist approaches by the immense organizations from above , of which they had bean and would continue to be duly warned . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a different direction , and their suspicions should not be aroused . Secrecy would conduce to the success of a naval expedition . If it were to go forward , it was advisable that the measure should be discussed as little as possible , and for the time it was not necessary that the War Department should be made ac // quainted with our purpose . The naval success in the two preceding expeditions , of which he had known but little and which had been quietly conducted , inspired the President with confidence in naval management and naval power , and with very little hesitation he came into the project . Difficulty was experienced , however , in getting satisfactory and reliable topographical and hydrographical information , and correct knowledge of the actual defences at the time . The Assistant Secretary of the Navy , as already stated , was acquainted with the river and the general aspect of the place , and felt confident the low shores and batteries could oppose no insurmountable obstruction , for the larger vessels could overlook them . About this time Commander D. ID @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irregular cruise on which he had been improperly sent . Having wholly failed to carry out the plan on which he had been surreptitiously despatched , he was subsequently ordered to the Gulf squadron , and had been stationed for a period off one of the mouths of the Mississippi . On his return the Navy Department , having decided to make a naval attack on the forts and city , was glad to avail itself of his recent observations , and of whatever information he possessed in regard to the river and the forts . He was therefore questioned and soon taken into our confidence . lie entered with zeal into the views of the Department , but expressed great doubts whether the forts could be passed until reduced or seriously damaged . This he said might be effected by a flotilla of bomb-vessels with mortars , which could in forty-eight hours demolish the forts or render them untenable . Commander Porter 's proposition was a departure from the original plan of the Navy Department , and was strongly objected to by the Assistant Secretary . It would not , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means considered by the army and Commander Porter , whom it consulted , essential to success ; and as a mortar flotilla would furnish additional power and would probably render success more certain , it received favorable consideration from the President and Secretary of the Navy , and was adopted as a part of the programme . As a co6perativc military force would be necessary , President Lincoln desired that General McClellan , who had just been installed General-in-Chief , should be advised of the plan and his approval and cooperation obtained . He therefore made an appointment for consultation at that officer 's residence . At that time General McClellan occupied the house of Bayard Smith on the corner of H and Fourteenth streets , the present Washington residence of the Hon. Samuel Hooper of Boston . I had proposed that the conference should take place at the Executive Mansion , but the President objected that we should be constantly interrupted by persons whom he could not refuse to see-members of the Cabinet and others . This meeting took place *ot far from the middle of November . My impression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was prior to the 18th of that month . I was accompanied to the conference by Assistant Secretary Fox and Commander D. D. Porter , both intelligent men in their profession and each acquainted with the passes of the Mississippi and aware of the difficulties to be overcome . These gentlemen called at my house by previous arrangement to talk over the subject about an hour before the meeting , and went with me to General McClellan 's . The President , General McClellan , and the two gentlemen named , with myself , were the only persons present at the conference . General McClellan listened attentively to the proposition , but I thought with little confidence in its success . To reduce the forts and capture New Orleans he seemed to suppose must of necessity be a military operation , which would require an army of at least 50,000 men . He could not spare so large a force , nor had he a competent military officer of high rank whom he could detail to command such an expedition and conduct the siege . When , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that a military force of 10,000 men to garrison the forts and hold the city after the navy had obtained possession was all that was required , he came readily into the arrangement . We had already obtained the promise of 2,500 men for Ship bland , who were to be largely reinforced for a descent on Texas or an attack on Mobile . These troops , which were being recruited , might go forward with that expectation , and at the // proper time when the navy was ready coald be diverted to the Mississippi and New Orleans . The proposal of Commander Porter for a bomb flotilla met his decided approval . He deemed such a battery absolutely essential to success . As our preparations would be formidable and consequently attract attention , and as there were spies and rebel sympathizers among us , it was concluded it would be best that the impression should continue that Texas or Mobile was the objective point , without specifying which ; and to make matters still more indefinite , Charleston and Savannah were talked of . Profound and impenetrable secrecy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . Major Barnard , Chief Engineer of the Army of the Potomac , who had been employed on Forts Jackson and St. Philip , and knew their strength , was by advice of General McClellan consulted . This officer fully appreciated the magnitude of the movement and its immense importance to the country . He also approved ascending the river to capture the city , but considered it all-important that the forts should be reduced before any attempt was made to go above them . This he recommended should be a combined army and navy movement with ironclads and mortars . The original proposition of the Navy Department was to run past the forts and captnre the city , when , the fleet being above and communication cut off , the lower defences must fall . But the military gentlemen deemed the reduction of the forts before the p ssage of the naval vessels was attempted to be absolutely indispensable . The General-in-Chief , whose time and mind were occupied with the immense army then organizing in front of Washington , designated Major Barnard for consultation and advice in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention its importance demanded . Major Barnard in successive interviews , and finally in a private memorandum , after giving the whole subject considerstion , states : " I should consider necessary , first , a powerful fleet bearin* from 300 to 400 guns ( as many XI . and IX . guns as can be had ) ; second , half a dozen ironclad gunboats ( or as many more as can be had ) ; third , 10,000 troops ( all these might not be necessary in reducing the works , but they should be with the expedition to take immediate advantage of its success ) . I should hope to reduce the works without regular siege operations ; but even if it became necessary to resort to them , the powerful artillery of the fleet would make a large sie*e train unnecessary . . . . The fleet should be accompanied by say 15 to 20 mortar vessels , such as are now being equipped . But to pass those works ( merely ) with a fleet and appear before New Orleans is merely a raid-no capture . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communications are perfectly established . " These were the general views of an officer who appreciated and always did justice to the navy ; who did not think 50,000 men or regular siege approaches necessary ; but who called for half a dozen or more ironclads when we had not one , and deemed fifteen or twenty mortar vessels essential , and the reduction of the forts before the passage of the vessels was attempted to be necessary . Commander Porter took a similar view in regard to the reduction of the forts before the passage of the ships . lIe proposed to destroy the works in forty-eight hours with a mortar flotilla , and was confident he could effect their destruction in that time . In its essential features his proposition corresponded with those of the army engineer . Both made it a point that the forts should be first reduced . Both were strongly combated by the Assistant Secretary , who adhered to the original naval programme , that the steamers could pass the forts without reducing or even bombarding them . But in deference to military authority and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the latter for a mortar flotilla was adopted as an auxiliary force , which might render assistance and be of no detriment to the expedition . The labor of preparation , especially after the scheme of a bomb flotilla was adopted , became immense , and was en tered upon with alacrity and energy . Suitable ve* sels were to be purchased and adapted to war purposes ; immense mortars and shells were to be cast and mortar beds prepared ; guns , carriages , prqjectiles , ordnance of every description ordered , and stores and supplies of all kinds provided . It was now an interesting inquiry what // naval officer should be selected to command the expedition . An officer was wanted to carry out a plan already determined upon by the Department  --  a plan that was not in all respects concurred in by the military authorities , which had not received their full sanction , nor had the original programme the approval of any naval officer . The duty to be imposed upon him was novel , and required courage , audacity , tact , and fearless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ability to discriminate and act under trying and extraordinary circumstances , lie was to be made fully acquainted with the object and purposes of the Department , and to ideiitify himself with them , lie was also to be informed of the deviations which , on the su*gestion and recommendations of others , had from abundance of caution been made . These he was to adopt or dispose of as he might judge best when on his post and in full command , but with a distinct understanding that he would be held accountable for the result . Every prominent name in the higher grades of the navy was studied and scanned . The merits and characteristics of each officer in the service had been canvassed in every particular after the war commenced , and the especial traits and reliability of each one examined , that we might know his qualities and fidelity , in order that we might rightly judge to what place or position he was best adapted . Seniority had its influence , but was not always satisfactory . Among the few marked for ability , nautical experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never yet been given a high command nor been fully tested and tried as chief , was Captain David Glasgow Farragut . Other names were considered and their merits weighed , examined , and compared . The important question of earnest , devoted loyalty to the Constitution and the Union was of course a primary consideration . There was little douht that the naval officers who had continued in service until the close of 1861 , when this subject was under consideration , were faithful ; but there were different degrees of fidelity as well as of capacity . Some officers had wavered at the beginning , who became afterward zealous in the cause ; some throughout were cool and indifferent , who nevertheless obeyed orders as a matter of duty ; but most of those who remained in 679 the navy were patriotic and devoted to the country and the flag . Such as believed their obligations to their State or section to be paramount to those they owed their country had , prior to or at the commencement of hostilities , shown the sincerity of their convictions by tendering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exception , those who withdrew were Southern men . But the general demoralization which prevailed throughout the South caused the Navy Department , and for that matter every branch of the Government , to hesitate and doubt who that belonged to that section could be trusted . So general was the defection that confidence in all was impaired . Such was the uncertainty in regard to men , and so sectional the conflict , that the Navy Department felt it a duty at the commencement of difficulties to supersede every Southern officer in command of a vessel on a foreign station . But while the great body of Southern officers left the service in that crisis , those that remained were , with scarcely an exception , of undoubted and marked fidelity and patriotism . Sacrifices which others did not and could not make they submitted to . From a sense of duty and love of country they became aliens , exiles from their homes and kindred . Prominent among these was Captain Farragut , a Southern man by birth , a resident of the South from choice . lie had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of secession when intioduced struck him with abhorrence , as not only an error but a crime . Nationality is a sentiment with men who are employed professionally and for life in the Federal service ; and among military , and especially naval officers , there is an undoubted tendency to centralism . Extraordinary efforts were made by leaders in the secession movement to enlist the State pride , local feeling , and personal ambition of naval officers of the South , and to weaken their Federal attachment . To a considerable extent these intrigues were successful . Failing to make themselves acquainted with the true political theory and structure of our system , many officers , naval and military , educated by their country and paid from its treasury , became estranged from the Union and abandoned the flag . Not so with Farmgut . Nothing could shake his fidelity to the country and Government , which he // loved with filial devotion and had served from his earliest youth . Residing at Norfolk , unemployed , on waiting orders , in the winter and spring of 1861 , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the period , and for the first time in his life became an active partisan . With his whole heart and energies he maintained the cause of the Union , and contributed to its success in Virginia by the triumphant vote in February , when the secessionists were beaten hy 60,000 majority . In the belief that this clear exoression of the popular sentiment was conclusive and the State made faithful , he reposed in comparative yet vigilant security until the firing on Sumter , when the violence of the secessionists , followed by the secret action of the Convention at Richmond , warned him that Virginia had swung from her moorings . The Convention was composed of a majority of nominal Union men , but many of them were of a passive and negative character , who trusted there would yet in some way be a compromise . The secessionists , who were violent , positive , revolutionary , and wanted no compromise , cowed and controlled them . On the day when intelligence was received that the ordinance of secession had passed the Convention , Captain Farragut determined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be in the Union ; he would recognize and serve under no flag but that under which he was born , which for fifty years , in every land and clime , he had supported , and to defend which he had always been ready to yield his life ; his hand should never be raised against it , nor would he be indifferent to its cause . Collecting hastily a few valuables , he placed his wife , sister , and their children in a carriage , put his loaded pistols in his pocket , and within two hours from the reception of the news that Virginia had decided to secede he proceeded to the Baltimore steamer , then at the wharf . Leaving all else behind , he resolved not to be denationalized or torn from the Union ; he would know no country but that which he had loved and served from his childhood . The next day he passed through Baltimore , then in that excited insurrection which followed the massacre of the Massachusett* volunteers . The ordinary channels of travel by steamers and railroads were ii*terrupted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ procure means of transportation or to leave the city . He found by accident that a common canal boat was leaving the wharf for Philadelphia . On this boat , which had indifferent accommodations for about eighteen persons , there were crowded nearly three hundred-fugitives , like himself and family , seeking refuge in the North . He reached New York after some annoyance and inconvenience with but slight pecuniary means to sustain himself and his exiled and dependent family . Being onwaitingorders - for the Department , which did not then know these particulars , was moving with cautious , vigilant , and wary steps , careful and guarded whom to trust , a ndin the employment of Southern officers particularly circumspect-Captain Farragut felt his pecuniary resources insufficient for his support in the great metropolis . Always modest and unobtrusive , and almost a stranger in New York , he found a resting place for a few days under the roof of a friend whom he had previously known , until he could obtain a secluded place out of the city , adapted to his limited means . He succeeded in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a rent of $150 per annum , which he plainly furnished , and to which , with one servant , he retired to await events-ready , however , and anxious to serve his country and give himself to her cause . Active employment was not immediately given him , partly for reasons already stated , and partly because there were not at that early day naval vessels and positions for all in the higher *trades . A sifting of the naval officers was required to preserve harmony and render the service efficient . Some of them were old and infirm ; some were physically and others mentally incompetent ; but none would admit infirmity , and all wanted employment . While it might have been wrong to dismiss any of them from the service , it would have been a greater wrong to have given some of them active duty . Congress , therefore , at the extra session in the summer of 1861 , took steps to relieve the Department of this difficulty , and under the act of August 3,1861 , for the better organization of the military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as should be retired from active service . Captain Farra*ut was made a member of that board . The duty I ' // was delicate and responsible , requiring sagacity , just discrimination , impartiality , and decision ; for they were to take the Register and pass on the merits of each and every officer on the active list of the navy . I had met and been favorably impressed by Captain Farragut some fifteen years previously , daring the Mexican war , when I was officiating in the Navy Department as chief of a naval bureau . He at that time made what was considered a remarkable proposition to the then Secretary of the Navy , John Y. Mason , which was a plan to take the castle of San Juan d ' Ulloa . I was present when he stated and urged his plan . It was characterized by the earuest , resolute , and brave daring which at a later day was distinctly brought out in our great civil conflict . Secretary Mason heard him patiently , but dismissed him and his project as visionary and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and though we had not met for years , the impression then made upon me remained and was alluded to . He was gratified with my allusion to it , and remarked they thought him crazy , but he was still satisfied the enterprise was feasible and that he would have e taken the castle had he been permitted the opportunity . Naval men in whom I confided spoke well of him , but I think few , if any , appreciated his high and really strong qualities , and most of them , if aware of the New Orleans expedition , and had the choice of a commander devolved upon them , would likely have selected some other favorite . Farragut was attached to no clique , which is sometimes the bane of the navy , was as modest and truthful as he was self-reliant and brave , bad individuality , and resorted to none of the petty contrivances common with many for position and advancement . A division of the Atlantic squadron had been made in the autumn , when Flag Officer Da Pont embarked for Port Royal ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a division of the squadron in the Gulf . Such a division would throw the contemplated New Orleans expedition within the limits of the western squadron , and the necessary appointment of an additional flag officer would serve as a cover to the expedition , and not excite curiosity or comment as to any ulterior purpose . In scanning the Register with the Assistant Secretary fhr the flag officer to command the expedition he spoke favorably of Farra*ut , and his recommendation chimed in with my own impressions and convictions . Further inquiries were necessary , however , before deciding so important a question . This was attended with some difficulty and embarrassment . There were rivalries and jealousies in the service to be encountered . The knowledge of the expedition was confined to a few , and could not well be imparted to others , even to those whose opinions it was an object to ascertain . Nor would it do to select and make known the purpose in hand to one who would hesitate , or who had not the combined dash , daring , heroism , good sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsibility of selecting the commander was great . Everything depended upon it , and the country would , and ought to , hold the Secretary of the Navy responsil ) le for the selection . Many excellent officers in secondary or subordinate positions , who implicitly obey orders , fail as leaders or commanders-in-chief . In the long interval of peace our officers had not had opportunity to develop their respective peculiar or extraordinary qualities and capabilities , nor had the Department the benefit of any such development to assist in its choice . Farragut had a good reputation , had been severely trained , and had always done his duty well , but had never commanded a squadron or achieved eminent distinction . his name is now a household word , and his fame extends abroad ; but in 1861 he was not more prominent than others of his grade . Those great qualities which have since been brought out were dormant . He had a good but not a conspicuous record . All who knew him gave him the credit of being a good officer , of good sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his duty in every position to which he had been assigned . There were others also endowed with these traits , but the question was , Had he , or any one , the higher qualities which are essential for a chief , and were indispensable for this the most important naval expedition ever undertaken by the United States , and which in fact had , in some respects , no precedent or parallel in naval annals ? Would he adopt the Department plan , make it his * and carry it intG // effect ? We had at that time no admiral or chief naval officer to identify himself in our programme , and whom to consult , and collision and rivalries among the commanders of squadrons were to be avoided ; at the same tune subordinates were to be impressed with confidence and zeal . Flag Officer McKean , who succeeded Commodore Mervine in command of the Gulf squadron , found his health giving way under his extensive and exacting duties ; it w s therefore necessary as well as expedient that a division of the squadron should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directed to obtain Commander Porter 's opinion of Captain Farragut . There had been an intimacy between the families of Farragut and Porter , dating back to the administration of Mr. Jefferson , when the father of Admiral Farragut had conferred essential favors on the elder Porter , who had reciprocated those fhvors by assisting young Glasgow Farragut , then a boy nine or ten years of ace , to obtain a midshipman 's warrant . He adopted him as a proteg6 , and made him virtually one of his family . In gratitude and affection young Farragut soon after took the name of David , and was so baptized in the Episcopal church at Newport . As Commander Porter had been let into the secret of the expedition , and the relations between him and Farragut were such as here stated , there was propriety in getting his opinions preliminary to inquiries of Farragut himself . Admirals Shubrick , Joseph Smith , and one or two others , spoke well of him for the position of flag officer , without being at the time aware of the other and important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ascertain the ideas , feelings , and views of Captain Farragut himself , and this , if possible , before informing him of the expedition , or committing the Department in any respect . Nothing , as has been stated , was put on paper which related to the actual destination of the expedition , and every movement was made with caution and circumspection . Under these circumstances it was thought best to intrust Commander Porter with a confidential mission to proceed to New York on business relating to the mortar flotilla , and while there to ascertain , in personal interviews and conversations on naval matters and belligerent operations gener ally , the views of Captain Farragut on the subject of such a programme and naml attack as was proposed by the Navy Department , without advising him of our object or letting him know that the Departmnent had any purpose in Porter 's inquiries or knew of them . The following letter , written to Commander Porter , is so worded as to furnish no information of the expedition or the special object intrusted to him . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destined for the Mississippi . His authority to see and sound Captain Farragut was unwritten : NAVY DEPARTMENT , November 18 , 1861 . Commander DAVID D. PORTER , U. S. Navy , Washington , D. C. SIR : Proceed to Philadelphia and New York and examine at those places thc schooners purchased by the Government , whether any of them are suitable for bomh vessels . In New York Mr. George D. Morgan , 54 Exchange Place , and Commander Henry H. Bell , will show you what vessels of that class are already Iitting for service . If , in your judgment , none of these are capable of being arranged for mortars , you are authorized to purchase six suitable vessels , and Conemander Bell will arrange theln as you may suggest . Consult with the Ordnance Bore . u before you leave Washington relative to the mortars . You will also examine the iron-clad vessels now building at Philadelphia , New York , and Mystic , Connecticut , and report the result on your return . Upon the completion of this duty , You will return to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GIDEON W LLES . Commander Porter 's report of his interviews with Captain Farragut was favorable , and that officer was , on the 15th of December , detached from special duty and ordered to Washington , that the Department , before committing itself in this important matter , might be fully assured in regard to him in all respects . The proceedings had reached such a point , the programme was so well settled and defined , and the preparations were so far advanced , that we could no longer postpone the selection of the officer who was to command ; and it was equally necessary he should know the fact and the labor , dangers , and responsibilities he was to a. same . Captain Farragut , under this summons , arrived in Washington on Saturday the 21st of December , and in order that the Department should continue uncommitted , the Assistant Secretary was authorized to have a free , social , and discretionary talk with him on the subject , before his interview with myself . This he dii on the // day Captain Farragut arrived at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he dined , and who , as I afterward learned , was present at that interview . Captain Farragut entered at once so heartily into the subject , and was so earnest and enthusiastic , that Mr. Fox unhesitatingly made known to him the purpose of the Department , and exhibited a list of the vessels which were being prepared for the expedition . Then , and in subsequent interviews with myself , he gave his unqualified approval of the original plan , adopted it with enthusiasm , said it was the true way to get to New Orleans , and offered to run by the forts with even a less number of vessels than we were preparing for him , provided that number could not be supplied , lie was made acquainted with the project of a mortar flotilla , to be commanded by Commander Porter . This , though not of his advisement , he said he would take with him , as it was a part of the enterprise , and some of the vessels and mortars had already been procured ; but they were of less importance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on them than others . In every particular he came un to all that was expected and re 683 quired . To obey orders , he said , was his first duty ; to take any risk that might be imposed upon him by the Government , to obtain a great result , he considered obligatory ; and believing it iniperative that a good officer and citizen should frankly , but respectfully , communicate his professional opinions , he said , while he would not have advised the mortar flotilla , it might be of greater benefit than he anticipated , might be more efficient than he expected , and he willingly adopted it as a part of his command , though he apprehended it would be likely to warn the enemy of our intentions , He expected , however , to pass the forts and restore New Orleans to the Government , or never return . He might not come back , he said , but the city would be ours . Admiral Farragut was never profuse in promises , but he felt complimented that he was selected , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the emergency and to the expectation of the Government . He was , therefore , on the 23d of December , directed to hold himself in readiness to take command of the West Gulf squadron and the expedition to New Orleans . GIDEON WELLES .
