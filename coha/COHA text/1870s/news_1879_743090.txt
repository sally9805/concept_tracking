txt All art has close relations with memory , and however airy invention may be in its flight , or however erratic may be its path , it is sure to start from some remembered fact with more or less definite traces of the way back to its source . If art soars like the sky.riark above the clouds , and seems , as SHELLEY sung , to be a spirit and " bird thou never wert , " she is sure to have her nest in the ground of experience , as ' WORDSWORTH hints in his own charming ode to the same bewitching little creature . , To say that art starts from memory , indeed , is simply saying that all imagination begins with some observation or experience , and however much it may work upon the material , the material is never wholly lost . Every artist 's portfolio from the fields or shores is a store of remembrances for his fancy to work upon , and if he carries his studies into the ruins of cities , the marts of commerce , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the libraries of literature , the characters and ideas and power that come forth from his chisel or pencil or pen are shaped or distilled from that material , and show its form and color , or breathe its thought and spirit , In fact , nothing is more clear and memorable in this respect than the dependence of the great masters of our modern art upon what has gone before .. What were SHAKESPEARE and MICHAEL ANGELO but mighty memory alive with burning inspiration , and bringing burled seeds of time into startling life ? What is GOETHE 'S great drama of " Faust " but the working up into present meaning of the old legend of that name , and what can the most daring of all the new artists , RICHARD WAGNER , do , with music at his command , but take themes from popular tradition , and bring upon the lyric stage the shapes and the stories of the ancient ballads and traditions ? No aspect of the new scientific study of art is more distinct than its historical continuity , and where there is historical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and combinations and idealization of them . But our present aim is not so much to show that art starts from the ground of experience , and must , therefore , have more or less of a memorial character , as it is to call attention to ' that kind of art that claims to be directly memorial in its character and is bent upon dealing with the events , persons , and principles which are to be perpetuated . We Americans find ourselves surprised at the interest which this kind of art is winning among us , and in spite of our ambition to have a dashing art of the future which shall put our most ethereal ideas into stone or bronze , or into painting and poetry , we are obliged to confess that no fresh vision opens to us , and that the only form of art tRat has much popular interest is that which grows out of our own personal life or household or national history . It is very odd , but it is none the less true , that the most decided and conspicuous forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with their turf and flowers and landscapes and sculptures . Of our Puritan people , it may safely be said that they never dared to indulge their taste in color and in carving and in picturesque effects until Mount Auburn opened the way for those gardens of graves that now reach from ocean to ocean . The cultivated Puritans had made some progress then ( 1831 ) in literary art , although their conspicuous poets were little known ; and they were full of the new culture that was stirring the poetry and religion of Europe , but they had no field for popular art . Their churches rejoiced generally in white walls and high pulpits , without dreaming of frescoed ceilings or painted windows , rich chancels or embroidered draperies ; and what is quite remarkable , the most refined scholars found themselves in the same bare quarters with the plainest people . Judge STORY , who gave the consecration address at Mount Auburn , himself worshiped there in an old-fashioned wooden meeting-house , as it was then called , and , probably without knowing it , he opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taste and aspiration of the new generation were to find something of the old cathedral beauty and majesty which their stout forefathers left behind them in England . That cemetery now has many and fine specimens of memorial art , not without help from the best sculptors in the land  --  among them CRAWFORD and STORY . Perhaps , relatively , its fame has culminated , and not only do other rural cemeteries rival its renown , but memorial art has found more social and winning homes than among the graves , and our galleries and parks , our halls and churches , are offering to us more and more of the treasures of remembrance in the forms of grace and beauty . The recent war gave a great start to memorial art , and by the dash of its events and the color of its costumes , as well as by the strength of its characters , by tho pathos of their wounds and death , it breathed new life into canvas and marble ; it has filled the country with monuments and sculpture . It is perhaps well that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that something is left for the more cultivated taste which comes with time . It is well that patriotism , too , is learning to take counsel of history and humanity , and to unite with its personal enthusiasm larger consideration of the true fellowship and wide connections of its heroes . If our artists and our public-spirited citizens would put their heads together to design and execute a soldiers ' monument for our CentralPark upon the strongest and most expressive principles of nationality , not only this City , but the country and the world would be wiser and better . We have not any first-class monument here that gives us the life of the nation in a single structure , and the once recreant Richmond has a richer piece of American memorial art than our loyal New-York . Perhaps with the lapse of time more liberalized feelings , more comprehensive statesmanship , may chill something of the fire that made us once to crave to have visible marks of our heroes , but this change in some respects will give them more consequence with thoughtful observers , by connecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race in all lands . Take , for example , a man like ALEXANDER HAMILTON . What a memorial our best art would make of him now , not only in his personal gifts of courtesy and genius , and in his marvelous services to our arms and our Constitution , but in his relations with the progress of civil government and the whole history of liberty and law , in which the great statesmen from EPAMINONDAS to WASHINGTON , from WILLIAM the Silent to CAvoun , have done their service and won their triumphs . It is in this way , or by seeing the close connection of our leading statesmen and heroes with the whole history ? of civilization , that we are correcting the narrowness of our own career , and opening our short annals into the great record of human civilization . It may be that the pencil and mind of art may help out our philosophers and historians in this way , and present our new America before the world , in architecture , sculpture , and painting , in a way not wholly apart from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us has been that we could not find subjects for our art of date old enough to give the due enchantment of distance . But we are outgrowing that difficulty , not only by growing old ourselves , but by growing into the best life and thought of the old nations . In their scholarship and their religion , Americans are making friends from all ages , and putting their faces into our parks and schools and ohurehea . It is not too much . to believe that our popular sentiment is tending the same way , and that our new memorial art is to have something of cosmopolitan generosity with its genuine American sentiment and purpose . There is one view of this whole subject that we can only now suggest . It is that whip refers to the largo and increasing number of persons among us who have money to give , and who wish to give it , in remembrance of kindred oCfriends who are most loved , but who had no strongly-pronounced genius or heroisin to commemorate . Lot these persons give their wealth to the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and proper artistic way with the persons to be remembered , instead of spending their riches upon unmeaning monuments , and before the century closes learning , ( piety , and charity will have homes and treasures of memorial art from rich endowments.
