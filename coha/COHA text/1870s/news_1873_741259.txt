txt The proposed amendments to the State Constitution were submitted to the people to-day , and it is supposed that they have been adopted . In this county the vote was adverse . There was considerable apathy manifested by the politicians throughout the State in regard to their adoption , although there are two or three that may be of material benefit to the State . In all the Republican meetings held before the election the people resolved not to support them , coming , as they alleged , from a Democratic source . The first amendment proposed is to section 5 of article 2 , to abolish the State census . This section alone , if amended , will save the State at least $100,000 . The second provides for biennial sessions of the General Assembly , instead of annual sessions as at present . This will also be of the greatest pecuniary benefit , as tax-payers will not be compelled to pay so high a price for bad Democratic laws . One step , further , however , they might have gone , and , bysubstituting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ double , and furnished an easysolution to the public debt question without increase of the rate of taxation . Never was the maxim that " the world is too much governed " more appropriate than when applied to North Carolina . The next amendment of the section is rendered necessary by the adoption of the section above referred to , and simply substitutes biennially for annually , in reporting to the Legislature all cases of pardons and reprieves granted by the Governor . The third amendment is to section 6 of article 5 , exempting property of the State and municipal corporations from taxation , and proposes the addition of the words " or any personal property to a value not exceeding $300 . " This is an important clause to the poor man , as , under the present system , everything is taxed , not excepting household furniture , with only $100 worth exempt . The fourth abolishes the office of Superintendent of Public Works . This clause in the present Constitution has been to it what a fifth wheel would be to a coach . The fifth strikes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faith of the State untarnished , and pledging the payment of the publics debt The advocates of the amendment to this section argue that it was never necessary in the State Constitution , inasmuch as the Constitution of the United States conjins a proviso making it obligatory upon all the States to provide for the payment of their public debts . The amendment prohibits the . payment of any debt contracted in aid ? of the rebellion , also payment for emancipated slaves . The real intent of this amendment is best shown by the following extracts from the Democratic papers in this city . It is barefaced and unblushing repudiation , and if carried out in accordance with the wishes of its inventors will reduce the credit of the " Old North State " below that of Hayti . The Wilmington Journal had the following a day or two ago : " It will require a tax of $3 25 on every $1C0 worth of property of every sort to pay the interest on the public debt , so called , and the expenses of State and County Governments . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another tax will have to be levi each year to provide a sinking fund to pay the principal . ' If these taxes be levied and paid , our poop e will be sold out of house and home . Homesteads and exemptions and bankruptcy are worth nothing against a Sheriff with a tax bill in his hand . The money must come or the homestead must be sold to make it . If , therefore , you wish to save year homesteads from being sold under the Sheriff 's hammer to pay the interest on a debt contracted by the carpet-bag Government in North Carolina , go to the polls and vote for the amendments . " The Wilmington Star had the following : " It is not dishonest to avoid payment of claims that are unblushing frauds . " Appeals of the same nature have been made daily in the Democratic papers . and leave no doubt of the dishonorable purpose in thus amending the Constitution . The sixth gives the control of the university at Chapel Hill to the Legislature , thereby taking it out of the free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as believed by many , that none but a favored class can enter this college , so long as a Democratic Legislature is in power . The seventh strikes out the Code Commission , whose duty it was to'prescribe a code of procedure . and rule of practice , as provided by the first section , which abolishes the distinction between actions at law and suits in equity . The eighth and last is no doubt intended for the special benefit.of the " carpet-bagger , " and provides " that no person who shall hold any office or place of trust or profit under the United States or any department thereof , or the State or any other State , shall be eligible for a seat in either House of the General Assembly . " In view of the amendment striking out the census clause , it would be well on the part of Congress , upon reassembling , to provide for the printing of an extra number of the census report for 1570 , to supply the members of our State Legislature , ibr some of them stand in need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them on the subject of immigration . Township officers were also voted for to-day , but the returns are too meagre to indicate the result .
