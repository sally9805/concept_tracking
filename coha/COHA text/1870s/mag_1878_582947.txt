TWENTY-SIX HOURS A DAY . 11. - HOW TO USE THEM . IN a previdus paper some suggestions were made in regard to the various ways of saving time from home work for purposes of culture . It may be worth while to consider how this time may be used to advantage ; for it will be very easy to let it slip through our fingers , even after we have worked hard to get it . The first thing is to set apart some definite time in the day for this purpose . Consider that you have earned it . You certainly have , if a long day 's work can do it . Talk about the ten-hour law ! I wish every mother of little children could get her whole day 's work into twelve hours . Most mothers find their heads and hands employed till the younger children , at , least , are in bed . Take that hour , then , as early in the evening as possible . I know the mending-basket will loom up before you ; there will be a threecornered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of shoes that must be put // on in the morning . But do only what is imperative , and let the rest go . Impress it on your mind that you take this time , not as a mere selfish indulgence , but to fit yourself better for your other duties , and obstacles will vanish . Perhaps your tired head and nerves will refuse to read anything serious . Then laugh over " Alice in Wonderland , " or H. H. 's " Bits of Travel . " Whatever hour you choose , be resolute about taking it . There will be plenty of . necessary interruptions : accept these cheerfully ; but do not let trifles interrupt you , and do not be yourself guilty of making any unnecessary hinderances . You will be fortunate if you can average four or five evenings a week . But that time steadily improved for a year will accomplish an amount of work which will surprise you . You have probably heard the story of the young man who read Macaulay 's " History of England " in a few months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his meals . The books lay on the parlor table of his boarding-house , and while his companioAs were " fooling , " as they appropriately called it , he read a few pages , finishing the volumes long before he or any one else would have supposed it possible . After awhile you will find yourself planning your work ahead and crowding other duties closer , so as to leave this time free , just as your boy expedites his hoeing in the garden when there is a baseball match in prospect . When the hour is over , if you must , take up your work again ; you will at least have something better to think of than your servants ' failings or the neighbors ' gossip . Add to this time all the little odd minutes of the day . Keep your book ( with a mark in it , so that you can open it instantly to the place ) where you can catch it up when you are waiting for John to come to dinner , or holding the baby , or watching the baking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's example , and do n't let the cake burn . First of all , however , be careful not to fritter away the best of the hour reading the paper . There is a deal of time wasted over newspapers . Now do n't look at me that way , nor say in that severe tone , " We must read the papers . We ought to keep informed about events in our own country , at least . " Granted ; but how does a woman read the papers ? She generally begins with the first thing she happens to see on the first page without much regard to the arrangement of that particular journal . If political news comes first , she reads a little on that subject till she thinks , " Oh , this is stupid , " and then her wandering eyes light on the column of jokes and anecdotes . Perhaps close by is a " fashion chit-chat " or a " what to wear " article . She reads this , of course , with a vaguely virtuous hope of getting some ideas* @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought to have taught her that practical ideas are seldom found in a fashion article . In the next column is the local news , including a thrilling account of Tom Jones 's runaway . She knows T. J. and is interested to hear that " the spirited animals were finally controlled with no more serious damage than " - etc . Next comes the notice of Miss Crcesus 's wedding . To be sure she do n't happen to belong to that " set , " and so was not invited , but she feels a mild flavor of second-hand delight at the glowing descriptions of the bride 's superb point-lace and her general gracefulness , and it is certainly worth knowing that the " bridesmaids , Misses Gusher , Puffer and Troddle , daughters of some of our most wealthy and influential citizens , were radiant with the charms of their youthful beauty . " If she is " musical , " she must read about Madame Hi-puff 's concert , in order to learn that she treated somebody 's concerto " with exquisite phrasing and delicate shading , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the arpeggio passages . " If artistically inclined , she must look at the art notices . It is worth some sacrifice of time to know that " our young townsman , the gifted Mr. Burnt-Umber , throws his whole soul into his pictures , " that he has a " judicious feeling for nature , " and displays " great breadth of treatment , " and " depth of color , " and " vigorous handling . " Her imagination delights itself in the description of his " wonderful chiaroscuro , " " the crispy freshness of his foliage , " " the juicy tenderness of his greens , " etc. , etc . By this time half an hour or more has gone and she has not read the paper yet ; that is , has not read it as she fondly imagined she was doing , viz. , to learn about important current events . Now , how does a man read his paper * He first reads whatever is of value in hi* particular business , then the news fro ' . Washington , if Congress is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and failures , am the money market ; after that , if not to hurried , he turns to the editorials or seareh* out items of especial interest . In fift*i minutes he is ready to lay the paper aside . In planning to use our reading hours i // the best advantage , it is well to remember that it takes no longer to read the best than the poorest . It is easy to spend time enough over some foolish newspaper story to read one of Shakspere 's plays . Keep on hand some good , hearty book with " meat " in it , chosen because you are really interested in it , not because  it is " considered " the correct thing to read . If you are too tired and sleepy to read anything difficult , try something light , but let it be the best of its kind , not " slops . " It is a good plan to have some book like Howell 's " Wedding Journey , " or Warner 's " Back-log Studies , " to read in the odd minutes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind and body to read anything heavier , and keep the " hearty book " for the times when you are fresher . The great danger of this is that the easy reading becomes so interesting that the steady , substantial work is crowded out . But are we hot sometimes frightened into thinking that good reading must necessarily be tiresome ? Novels with exciting plots , are more fatiguing to a brain weary with the distractions of woman 's work than a thoughtful essay or a majestic poem . It is not stimulus that is needed , but change . In Macaulay 's " Essays , " or a good translation of the " Iliad , " the perfection of the style or the music of the rhythm falls on a tired spirit like showers on the thirsty earth . Yet excited and busy women stir up their already nerves with Charles Reade or Wilkie Collins , and then complain that they " ca n't read evenings ; it makes them so nervous they ca n't sleep . " Women sometimes think they will not be interested in the standard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not long since , an intelligent lady was telling me how surprised she was to find *Bacon 's " Essays " so interesting . She said : " I was lying on the lounge in my husband 's library , one evening , after an unusually wearisome day , and took it up because it was the nearest book , and I really felt as if I could not go across the room for " other . I was perfectly absorbed before I " ew it , and read for an hour with a sense *f freshness and exhilaration which I had it known for a long time . I felt as if mehow I had got back to the beginnings things . I had always supposed that 9rd Bacon , being very learned , was theree very dull and entirely beyond my com*hension . " If you like history , The world is all before you , where to choose . " If you are fond of science , you can not fail to be interested in the papers and books in this field ,  --  never so numerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you imagine any of these departments " too literary , " and can not be happy without a novel , there are works of fiction that are as important a part of one 's education as - quadratic equations , to say the least : " Romola , " " Ivanhoe , " " Hypatia , " " David Copperfield , " " Pendennis , " " The Scarlet Letter . " Just think of all the books so well worth reading , and yet people will continue to draw out of the libraries dreary " society novels , " or poor translations of worse French and German lovestories ! It is like eating apple-skins and potato-parings when bananas and oranges might be had for the picking ! Bishop Potter says : " It is nearly an axiom that people will not be better than the books they read . " Consider , therefore , what kind of books you read . No doubt many read poor books because they do not know just what they want . The catalogue of the library is a bewildering labyrinth , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ title , or because somebody else says they are " splendid . " To avoid this , it is a good plan to make a list of books and authors that you wish to read . Have in your work-basket or table-drawer , where you can lay your hand on them easily , some slips of paper or a little memorandum book and a pencil . If you have to go into the next room or down-stairs after paper , and then hunt up a pencil , and perhaps a knife to sharpen it with , the chances are that you will never make your list . Then if in your reading , or in conversation with some one who knows , you find a tempting allusion to some book or author , you can make a note of it . " With your list in your pocket or your head , you can go to the public library and intelligently choose something you really care to read and which will pay you for the time you spend . There is very little difficulty in getting good books . Most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in smaller places half-a-dozen ladies , by a systematic exchange of their own and their friends ' books , could find good reading enough for several months at least . Very few people would refuse to lend books to a club of ladies , were some one of their number responsible that they were carefully used and promptly returned . The persons who really love books most devotedly // generally take pleasure in lending them to appreciative readers . Not only keep on hand one substantial book , but let your reading run for awhile on one topic and its relations . A great deal of the good of our reading is dissipated by leaving one subject before we have read enough about it to clinch it in our minds . The next topic taken up pushes the first one out before it has had time to get rooted . Now do n't conjure up an elephantine vision of a ponderous course of reading. * , The very name is depressing , for it recalls to almost every one some discouraging experience . In the ignorance and enthusiasm of girlhood , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " course of reading . " He very willingly handed me a list of books covering a sheet of commercial note paper , made up largely of such works as Rollin 's " Ancient History , " Grote 's " Greece , " Gibbon 's " Decline and Fall , " and Buckle 's " History of Civilization , " with Whately 's " Evidences " and Butler 's " Analogy " for a diversion . With a commendable desire to be thorough and to begin at the beginning , I attacked Rollin . On account of some trouble with my eyes , half an hour a day was all I was allowed to read . By chance I happened to mention what I was doing to an enterprising sophomore of my acquaintance , who asked merrily : " How long do you suppose it will take you to read Rollin , in half-hour installments ? " " I am sure I ca n't tell , " I answered . " Well , somewhere between ten and fifteen years , " he replied ; " and you may expect to finish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The very thought so frightened me that I never opened the book again , not even to count the pages to see if he was right . But this is reading by course , and not by topics . A friend of mine tried to read Macaulay 's " History of England , " without much knowledge of the detail of English history . She found so much of which she knew nothing taken for granted as familiar , that she grew quite discouraged , and gave it up . One day she saw the " Students ' Hume . " Here was the very book she wanted , and taking that and the " Students ' France " for a basis , she constructed a course of reading to meet her own necessities . She began with the Norman conquest , for she had no interest in the endless squabbles of the Saxons and Danes . ( Some time afterward , however , when she was tracing the rise of the European nations , she was glad to read this earlier history . ) She read first the story of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the contemporary French sovereign , at the same time weaving in a woof of poetry , romance , and biography . Buiwer 's " Harold " made the times of the Norman conquest vivid and real ; " Ivanhoe , " " Kenilworth , " and Shakspere 's " Henries , " filled out the pictures of the days of the Plantagenets and Tudors ; and the " Abbot " and " Woodstock " gave her the " local coloring " of the times of Mary , Queen of Scots , and Cromwell . She ran over some of the Erckmann-Chatrian tales and Dickens 's " Tale of Two Cities , " for a more vivid idea of the awful days of the French Revolution . The gossipy " Queens of England " ( abridged edition ) showed her how the royal wives and mothers felt and acted , and Victor Hugo , in " Les Mis6rables , " furnished a thrilling description of the battle of Waterloo . In this manner , with a poem here , a novel or biography there , she made up a glowing mosaic of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries nearest allied to our own , and with none of the tedium which belongs to the popular idea of reading history , and was thus prepared to enjoy Macaulay , Thiers , or Carlyle . How much more satisfactory her two or three years ' work than if like a humming-bird , she had sipped a little here , and a little there , and alighted nowhere ! Green 's " Short History of the English People " ( the revised edition ) is even better than the " Student 's Hume , " for the frame-work of such a course of reading , and Yonge 's " Parallel History of France and England " has the important events arranged in tables , in such a way as to enable the eye to assist the memory . The deeply interesting story of the downfall of the Roman empire , the progress of Christianity , the growth . of the church , the invasions of the barbarians , and the rise of the modern European nations , can be read in the same manner with the " Student 's Gibbon " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Teuton , " White ' " Eighteen Christian Centuries , " and Creasy " Decisive Battles of the World , " to gro " , events and trace out causes and conse consequences , and Guizot 's " History of Civiiiz* tion " for the profounder philosophy of he tory . The modern discoveries in astronomy ar chemistry made by spectrum analysis , f*. another intensely interesting group of topi . One must read scientific books , however , // we make children 's dresses , with great tucks and " turnings-in , " to allow for growth . Take some standard work on English literature for the basis of another set of subjects , and read selections from the works of such authors as interest you most . Tame would be excellent for this purpose . Imagine the delight of a course of reading which should take in biographies like " Recollections of Mary Somerville , " Mrs. Gaskell 's " Life of Charlotte Bront* , " Lockhart 's " Walter Scott , " Forster 's " Life of Dickens , " " Life and Letters of Macaulay , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harriet Martinean , " and supplement each with two or three of each author 's best and most characteristic works , and with extracts from the writings of his most noted contemporaries . Why , one could move in " the best society " all the while , and that without the bother of dinner-parties and new dresses , either ! Reading by topics in this way necessitates the cultivation of the art of judicious " skipping . " Not by any means a picking out of the easy passages and excluding the difficult ones-often just the reverse ; but a selection from the book of what you want now . Another time you may want something entirely different . Suppose you are reading " Romola , " and want more information about Savonarola and his times . The first four chapters of Grimm 's " Life of Michael Angelo " will be just what you need . You may leave the rest of the book till some future day , when you wish to trace the intricacies of Florentine history , or are interested in the life of the artist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never have patience to read the whole of the first volume of Tame 's " English Literature , " would enjoy very much his chapters on Dickens , Tennyson , and Macaulay , especially if they had just read some of the works of these authors . Others , interested in the rise of the English language and literature , would turn to his opening chapters with equal enjoyment . When you find what you want , pounce upon it , whether it is in the last , middle , or . rst chapter . It is not necessary to begin at 1'e beginning of the world . Begin right in the very middle of things , wherever you are iterested , and " read out . " When you we got out , you will want to turn around * " read in " again , to the place you *gan . A recent writer maintains that best method is to read backward , taking present as a vantage-point of vital inter* , and searching for causes . Gibbon is said to have read from several books at once . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would broaden out into something else ; that to something still different , until he had a dozen books piled up about him before he was ready to return to the original work . Do not be afraid that your reading will be disconnected . Everything must hang on to something else , and have something else hanging on to it . Group the events around some central point , and then what goes before and what comes after that will take their proper places naturally . Or , again , let the different events in the history of a nation or a century be strung on the thread of some important idea . In English history it might be the rise and progress of English liberty ; and then John and the Magna Charta , Henry Viii 's defiance of the pope , the Stuarts and Cromwell , and a hundred other persons and events will fall into line . In medieval history let it be the progress of Christianity ,  --  and the confusion and clamor of sects , the roar and smoke of battles , will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the march of human progress . But you say , " I ca n't remember history . " Do n't try to . Most people try to remember too many details , and end by forgetting everything . Here , as in every other department of knowledge , you must " dare to be ignorant of many things , that you may not be ignorant of everything . " It is not the detail of battles and generals , and kings and emperors and prelates , and assassinations and dethronements and dates , that you want ; it is the march of events- " the swing of the centuries . " The details are useful to give vividness to your idea of the whole . Ifi , when you read that " the first century of the Christian era was characterized by a series of execrable emperors , who by their extravagance and their crimes were sowing the seeds for the dissolution of the empire , " you have no knowledge of the details , these words alone convey very little meaning to your mind , and are soon forgotten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Caligula , and the martyred Christians flaming in tarred sheets as torches to light Nero 's pleasure-gardens , it matters little if you have forgotten the exact succession , or the dates of each emperor 's reign . Dates are great bugbears . Some people remember them naturally ; for others it is hard and unsatisfactory work . But almost any one can remember the century in which an important event // took place . There are only eighteen since the Christian era ; that is not very formidable . Group events together in centuries , and characterize each one by some memorable facts , or men , or discoveries . Make little lists of the representative great things in art , war , literature , science . The making of the lists will help you to , remember them ; looking them over afterward will refresh your memory , without forcing you to read long chapters again . But somebody asks , " If you go reading here and there in this manner , how do you know what books you want , and when you get the books , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Just as you do other things . Look and ask . By what mysterious free-masonry does a new fashion in hairdressing spread itself through the country ? " French twists " break out in New York and Boston . In a week a few favored heads in New Haven , Hartford , Springfield and Worcester , are arranged after that fashion . In less than three months there is n't a young lady of any pretension to style in any town in New England who would think of wearing her hair in any other way . One girl says to another : " Did you see Mary New-fangle 's hair last Sunday ? " " Yes , dreadfully unbecoming , was n't it ? " " Of course ; but then it is so stylish . I wonder how she does it . " " I do n't know exactly , but ' I got a good look at it , and I think I know how it goes up . So one retires to her room , and , after an hour 's struggle with hand-glass and hairpins , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latest style which , according to Emerson , " gives a feeling of inward tranquillity which religion is powerless to bestow . " The other girl , on the strength of a greater intimacy with the fortunate possessor of the " French twist , " makes her a morning call . Naturally she speaks of the becomingness of the new style , and asks her how she does it . Of course she gives the required information , and if she is good-natured , takes her friend into her own room and does it for her . Some of the thought and ingenuity required to follow the fashions would help to teach us what books we wanted . Glance over the heads of chapters and tables of contents and you will soon find whether what you are looking for is in that book or not . Ask people who know where you can find the best reading on such and such a tol ) ic or epoch . The faculty of picking up information is a very valuable one , and like the skillful playing of the chromatic scale can only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , soon awakens the desire to own books , as it shows the need of having at hand a library-even if only a small one-of well-selected and standard books of reference . To wait till you can get the book you want from the public library is often to wait till your interest in that particular matter has gone . How strange when books are such a " fountain of delight " that people gratify alm*st every other want first ! How few young people of moderate means in furnishing a house make any reasonable provision for the buying of books ! Yet often the difference between ingrain and Brussels carpets , common and cut glass , plain shades and lace curtains1 would ' be sufficient to to make a good beginning for a library . And if the books were properly selected , and not of the kind that * cometh up as a flower , " they would be as good as new long after the carpets have faded and the dainty goblets gone to the ash-heaps . When people know how to buy books there is nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Almost any family that can afford a piano could by a little self-denial have some good encyclopedia , and what an amount of information and culture may be gained by both parents and children by a habit of constant reference to it ! Yet many people who consider themselves cultivated and intelligent , who perhaps wear velvet cloaks and costly jewelry , keep horses and smoke expensive cigars , content themselves with a showy edition of Dickens , half a dozen " blue and-gold " poets , and a few miscellaneous books , and call it a library . If you wish to get the full good of your reading cultivate the habit of writing something , either out of , or about , the books you read . You would probably wish to make a brief synopsis of the important facts and arguments in historical and scientific works . of many other books it would be most natural to write a few words concerning the general impression the book makes on your mind , whether you like it or not and the rea*ons for your opinions . It cultivates one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It helps , too , to get one 's ideas about the books into some tangible shape . I have a lady friend ,  --  by no means a lady // of leisure ,  --  who for several years has made it a rule to write in a small blank-book kept for that purpose a few words about every book she reads ,  --  sometimes an abstract of the principal points in the volume . A habit of frequent recurrence to that little note-book keeps her reading fresh in her mind . This is not formidable business if you do not attempt anything too elaborate . And even if it should take time and patience you may find your reward in the reflection that a few good books remembered are worth twenty poor ones forgotten . Before this time , perhaps some of you have asked , " But what do we want to save all this time for ? Why are not things well enough as they are ? " There is a large class of women whose one ambition is " ito have things like other people ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than their neighlors , or in the " latest style . " Beyond that , there is nothing more to wish for , and any one who bestows much time or thought on anything else is a puzzle to them . Besides these , there are other women who do not care for reading and study . Not because they are frivolous , but , as they say themselves , " they have n't the head for it . " They agree with George IV . " What , what , what-did you ever see such stuff as Shakspere ? " Of course this is a misfortune , not a fault , any more than color-blindness or deafness is . But they must not try to limit other women to their own narrow horizon . Neither of these two classes will be interested in the answer to our question ,  --  why we want more time for reading and study ? But there are a great many women who conscientiously think that they must give up their lives to sewing and house work , and feel grieved and disappointed , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read an hour a day seems to them as impossible as to climb the Himalayas , and they have been so educated by years of precept and habit that they actually feel as if they were doing something wrong when they sit down deliberately with a book . To be sure , sometimes , they are carried away by the whirl*vind of a fascinating novel , but they feel , all the time , an uneasy sense of the necessary after-repentance . Some of these women , however , will attempt any marvel of fancy work or dress-making , and " take no note of time . " Now , if these conscientious , hard-working women could only be convinced that their usefulness would be increased by reading , they would find time even among their many duties , for that which would help them to do more and better work . Let us see if such is not the case , and if it is , will it not answer our questionXVhy ? And we will begin with the very lowest and most selfish reason of all , viz. : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overworked , care-worn woman , " It does me good sometimes to forget about my work for a little while . If I can put it out of my mind I can go back to it , and do twice as much as I could if I kept on , when I was all tired out . " Overwork of any kind unfits us for our duties , as we know by sad experience . How wretched those days are when we get up in the morning with every muscle aching and every nerve on edge , when a child 's voice asking a question irritates us like a blow in the face , when we feel " as if we could n't speak a civil word to any body , " all because we " overdid " l*ouse-cleaning or sewing or preserving the day before ! This work may have seemed necessary . But this is only an additional reason for us to be economical of our physical strength . Now after some such day draw up your lounge , where the light will fall just over your shoulder , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while your spine and shoulders are supported , lift up your feet on the lounge and take your book . Try reading an hour in this position , and see if the rest and change of thought do not lighten your burdens , and make you forget your weariness . The lawyer needs to *et away from his briefs , the merchant from his ledgers , the mechanic from his shop . A man would soon go crazy who could not turn the key upon these things , however much his mind may revert to them from a distance . The men who have combined great power of work with great power of endurance , have been those who could enter heartily into something else when the working day was done . But a mother with young children can not get away from her work . It wakes up in the morning with her ( generally before she does ) , and goes to bed beside her at night . If she leaves the children it is only for a short time and that with an uneasy sense of direful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But she can sit , with her cares and comforts asleep upstairs , or may be at her feet , and " Gloriously forget herself , to plunge Soul-forward , headlong into a book 's profound , Impassioned for its beauty , and salt of truth . " // As much as she needs to read for the sake of her children , she sometimes also needs to read that she may forget for the time being that she has any children . This habit of reading will also be of great comfort to us if our lives are quiet and commonplace . We shall not fret and chafe and long after excitement and gayety if we are shut up in solitary farm-houses or in unfrequented and unfashionable by-streets . We shall not be " driven to go to bed at nine o'clock , evening after evening , because there is nothing going on , " like some uninteresting young ladies I once heard cf. We shall not dread long winter evenings and rainy days , for we shall always have good company and plenty of it . But laying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let us look a little higher . For the children 's sake we must make the most of ourselves . Many an unselfish mother has said , " Oh , I can not take all this time , there are so many things to do for the children . " She does not realize that she may do more for them in the end by cultivating herself than if she spends all her time on clothes and cooking . A generosity which makes the recipient weak or selfish is not a blessing but a curse . Have you not seen grown-up sons who snubbed their mother 's opinions in the same breath with which they called her to bring their slippers ? The meek little woman has " trotted around " to wait on them so long that they have come to think that that is all she is godd for . Their sisters keep " Ma " in the background because she " has n't a bit of *tyle , " and is " so uncultivated , " forgetting that she has always worn shabby clothes that they might wear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard work that theirs might be kept soft and white for the piano , and that she has denied herself books and leisure that they might have both . And there are other children , too noble for such base ingratitude , who feel a keen though secret sense of loss as they kiss the dear withered cheek and think how much more of a woman " mother " might have been if she had not shut herself away from the culture and sweet companionship of books . I'he love even of husband and children to be permanent and valuable must be founded on genuine respect for character . Every mother has a right to time for mental and spiritual development as really as she has a right to sunshine and air and to food and sleep . She can not exist physically without the one ; bhe can not grow VoL . XV. - 6o. mentally and spiritually without the other . If she throws herself so energetically into her duties as seamstress and nursery-maid that she has no time nor strength for anything else , ought she to be disappointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's *vages ? Is there a more beautiful sight than a circle of grownup sons and daughters with their mother as the chief center , not merely of physical comfort but of intellectual and spiritual companionshi* ? She must have brains , you say , to be this . Of course she must , and most women do have more brains than they get credit for ; the trouble being that they do not know how to use or cultivate what they have . She must love her reading and study , that she may have enthusiasm to arouse , and tact to sustain , the children 's interest in these things . If she is musical , the practice hour under her supervision will be no longer a distasteful drudgery . If she loves history , mamma 's true stories of Columbus and Arthur , Hannibal and Alexander , will be better than fairy tales . If she is fond of poetry , the children will listen entranced to the " Lady of the Lake " and the " May Queen , " to the melody of Longfellow , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she will set the boys , armed with hammers and baskets , to turning over every stone-wall in the country , not after chipmunks , but after minerals for their cabinets . They will shut up and feed great ugly caterpillars and eagerly watch them turn into gorgeous moths and butterflies . The girls will come to her with flowers from every ramble , as I saw a four-year-old " tot " last spring go running to her mother with a little basketful of dandelions and " pussy-willows , " to ask for an " atomy " ( botany ) lesson . Charles Kingsley 's mother " was full of poetry and enthusiasm , with a love for science and literature . " If Lord Byron 's mother had been a Monica his fate and influence might have been very different . Lord Macaulay says , after a speech which Lord John Russell said was the best he ever heard , " Affection has at least as much to do as vanity with my wish to distinguish myself . This I owe to my dear mother and to the interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrast to all this is it not pitiful to see a mother made of such pallid , neutral stuff that she is only a negative element in the formation of her children 's characters ? Yet some of the zeal which goes into the // latest fashions or into pie-crust would give her time enough for these other things . Remember that to every child ( till he learns better ) his mother is the ideal of everything that is noble and beautiful in womanhood . Happy the child who never is , because he never needs to be , disenchanted ! And on the other hand , as Richter says , " Unhappy the man whose mother does not make all mothers interesting . " A mother needs to read also that she may learn the best methods of managing and edubating her children . Now laugh and say something about " old maid 's theodes . " This is the place for it . It is true that one great-hearted , quick-witted mother without a " speck " of theory but rich with the wisdom of experience will do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuffed full of all the theories ever made or books ever written . Yet such a mother could not read Abbott 's " Gentle Measures with the Young , " or Harriet Martineau 's " Household Education , " without being helped at least to realize something of the importance of her work . But she must have time to think as well as to read . She needs to look carefully at each child 's peculiar disposition , and to think about her management of it . She must ask herself whether she is patient enough with the heedless , firm enough with the rebellious , stimulating enough with the indolent , thoughtful enough for the sensitive , and winning and tender enough with the reserved and undemonstrative . It is a fearful thing for a mother to be so absorbed in work of any kind as not to be acquainted with her own children , for sometimes her sins of omission are more fatal than her sins of commission . Another reason why a mother should read is that she may direct the children in the choice of books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our children what to read as how to read , else they are at the mercy of a flood of trashy fictitious literature . Hear what a New York librarian says : " You would be surprised to know the number of books young girls manage to get through with . I have an unceasing call for works of fiction . Some of these young misses average two or three books a day , and the more love ' the better they like them . " But how can a mother direct her children if she seldom reads at all and then nothing better than such books ? How can she educate , unless she herself has been educated by careful reading into an appreciation of what is really good ? A wellread mother can direct her boy to adventures as marvelous as those of the cheapest fiction in the chapters of Dr. Kane and Dr. Livingstone , to stories as interesting in Jacob Abbott 's histories of kings and heroes . Her girls need not devour Miss Braddon 's and Mrs. Southworth 's novels , while there is Mrs. Muloch-Craik @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generally glad of suggestions about , and interest in , their reading , if it is only begun soon enough , and done in the right way . " But how can I do all this , " asks a young mother despairingly , " with this little baby in my arms ? " Comfort yourself , my dear woman ; he v ; ill not be a baby in your arms always , and even if brothers and sisters take his place , they must grow up , too . For a few years they will fill up the most of your time . But if you only realize that the quality of your character is to enter into the make-up of his mental and moral status , as truly as the quality of his oat-meal porridge is to enter into his bodily substance , you will not put all your energies into the care of the one , and leave none for the cultivation of the other . A woman may do all this for the sake of her husband , as well as for her children . Sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I owe whatever I am ; to her whatever I shall be . " We need only to mention the names of Lady Augusta Stanley , Mrs. Disraeli , Mrs. Seward , Mrs. lvIill , and Mrs. Charles Kingsley , to understand what a help a cultivated and intelligent wife may be to a husband in public life . A gentleman who stands at the very height of his profession said , only a few months ago , of a friend just called to one of the most important and honorable places in this country , " He is thoroughly a self-made man , except in so far as his wife has given him the assistance of an excellent mind . " But you say at once , young men are afraid of " superior girls ; " they do not want " gifted " wives . That is because they share in the popular delusion that a " gifted woman " always is a being with indefinite back hair and inky fingers ; whose table is set with sour bread and sticky crockery ; and whose children roam uncombed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a delusion , after all ; for there have been women who were " domestic , " and yet were not entirely absorbed in the quality of their soft gingerbread , or the heels of their children 's winter stockings . In a New England village lives a bright-eyed little woman , // whose excellent classical education is of practical assistance to her husband . He is a teacher . She corrects the Latin exercises of his classes , does all her own house-work , and takes the entire care of her little child , and does it all well . Her house is bright with plants and flowers , and " like waxwork " in its beautiful neatness ; she is always tastefully dressed ; her child has that unmistakable air of being happily and tenderly cared for ; and her Latin is not like Aurora Leigh 's Greek , * * lady 's Greek , Without the accents . " A woman 's influence and work should radiate beyond the circle of home life . Here at once we stumble involuntarily upon a most perplexing discussion . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ears with such an unceasing clatter that some women have a latent suspicion that everything said about lifting them above their commonplace routine is a part of some secret plot to take them , willy-nily , from their quiet homes , and make them presidents and governors , or at least judges of police courts at once . Women of quite ordinary capacity will say , perhaps holding in their hands the fashion-book they have been diligently studying for half an hour , " Well , I like these other things very much ; but , after all , you know a ' woman 's proper sphere ' is among domestic duties " - words as true as mathematics , unless made an excuse for indolent lapsing into stupidity . It is quite pertinent to ask , What is woman 's proper sphere ? Every true woman instinctively feels , whether she confesses it or not , that a woman 's happiest place is , as Mrs. Browning says , in " The sweet , safe corner of the household fire , Behind the heads of children . " Such a home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are some who never have it . To enter upon life with the desire to get such a home , is to defeat that very purpose , or to obtain in its place a miserable substitute ; for , like every other gracious gift , it comes not by seeking , but in its own . natural way. * With some the bright vision of married life has faded in its realization into a cruel mockery . With others the black pall of bereavement has shut the very sunshine out of the heavens . In other homes , the woman 's heart yearns for the little ones who have never come , and she looks forward to a future where her name will always be written " childless . " What shall these do ? Because the heart is desolate and the hands are empty , must the head be empty , too ? Let us not deceive ourselves . Whether a woman works in the shelter of her own home or outside of it , she has duties to society and an influence over it , which she can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be , depends upon her intellectual and moral culture . We must not be hindered from any possible attainment by the fear that we shall be suspected of sympathy in a movement which so many of us regard with distrust . Just as some women drag their long dresses through the dirt , for fear that if they shorten them that terrible somebody , of whom we are all so afraid , will think they want to wear the hideous " Bloomers . " Whatever the past may have been , we know that in the future woman can and will take any place she is competent to fill . She ought/a wish no other . It is of little use for women to whine over their " wrongs , " or to storm and scold at " man 's tyranny . " Men are quite as willing to give us a place in the ranks of the world 's workers as we are to earn it , or to let other women earn it , in peace and comfort . It is well to remember that whatever has helped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by those brave spirits who have resolutely wrought at their chosen labor , ignoring the petty ostracism of their next-door neighbors , who called them " singular , " " eccentric , " or " strong-minded . " And it takes some courage to bear just that , especially if the woman is also sensitive , and longs for the approbation of others to supplement the approval of her own conscience . Did it ever occur to you how much more comfortable it must be for ordinary mortals to have the cordial sympathy of the people one must see every day , than to meet chilling indifference or downright opposition from them , even if a distant public applaud - especially if , as is usually the case , the public praise brings with it the public right of criticism ? No , we must be careful not to judge harshly those who are called to work outside of the beaten paths . We do not know how the woman 's nature has drawn back ,  --  how * **J think those married women who indiscriminately urge their acquaintance to marry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can only say with deeper sincerity and fuller significance what I always said in theory : Wait God 's will . " - From a letter of Charlotte Bronti , in Reid 's " Lift .

It sinks into insignificance beside the by one , till she is fain obliged to listen to the more important and practical one : Are voice , either from within or without , which American women doing the most that is calls her to her task .
