txt We do not understand the principle , if there be any , upon which the statute against cruelty to animals is interpreted by the Magistrates . On the 15th of this month a man named MEGAN was arrested for compelling a horse to pull a heavy load , while under the collar and saddle the animal 's flesh was a virulent ulcer . The strongest evidence to the fact was forthcoming ; but . Justice Scow , at Essex Market , discharged the man without a hearing , and only added a censure upon the officer who arrested him . Again , on the 19th , four cases of a similar character were before the Court  --  one of them remarkable for brutality . The defendant was proved to have struck a horse twenty-five times upon the head with a heavy club , and for the offense the Court considered . he was adequately punished by paying a fine of $1 . Similar cases are of frequent occurrence . We might mention many more ; but these will suffice to show the impunity with which the greatest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the law of the State is openly set at defiance , or nullified by the action of those whose duty it is to atininister it with impartiality and justice . The institution whose special province it is to see that dumb animals are in some measure protected from the cruelties of those whom they serve , might , with some reason , complain of the opposition it receives from those who by virtue of their office ought to lend it encouragement and support in the pursuance of its . humane objects . But we protest against this action of the Magistrates upon higher grounds . We might make it in the name of humanity and civilization , but that would hardly be understood by people who , in their actions , seem not yet to be very much influenced by either the one or the other . We protest , therefore , in behalf of the law of the State , which is thus prostituted to evil purposes . If we were to say that the conduct of Mr. Justice Scorr were scandalous , in that it encourages the reckless barbarity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only of the truth . It is scandalous as a piece of public policy and magisterial duty . Mr. Scorr may personally think that dumb animals are as far beneath the notice of his refined intelligence as the protection of his official authority . But the people have decided otherwise , and . the people are a higher power here than Mr. SCorr . It is not left to Mr. Score 's discretion . whether dumb animals are to be protected or not . The people , the law , says they are to be protected , and his duty simply is to administer that law . While he refuses to do this he not only renders the law a dead letter , but he encourages the repetition of the very offense which that law was framed to prevent . To pursue this view of the subject  --  and it is the only correct view that can be taken  --  we should be led on to the conclusion that Mr. Scorr is not fit for the position he occupies . That is the inevitable and ultimate result to which we should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this instance to that end . That a gross injustice has been done there is no doubt . That a misinterpretation of both the spirit and the letter of the law has been sufitred is equally beyond question . If Mr. Scorn 's personal opinions have stood in his way , he has erred . If his knowledge of the law has been deficient , he has erred yet more . But neither contingency is irremediable . The only difficulty we have about the matter is to be found in the fact that other Magistrates in Special Sessions are guilty , although less so , of the same charges that fall most pertinent- ly on Mr. Scorr  --  a fact which seems to indicate something more than a merely personal blunder . If it be the resolution of all these officials to set the laws at defiance in their capacity as administrators , it is well that we should know it . And if they persistently refuse to fulfill the provisions of the laws , as they seem to do in these charges of cruelty to animals , they will merit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who do not honestly perform the duties of their office . Then , too , they will merit the further charge of unfitness for the positions they occupy .
