ART . VIII. - THE PROGRESS OF PAINTING IN AMERICA . IT has been said that the American people do not well understand , nor even greatly relish , the arts which have to do with visible beauty . That they do not well understand them is a fact which can not easily be denied ; but that they do not much care for them is not equally certain . Not only a large sympathy with , but a growing interest in , the progress of the arts , and especially pictorial art , is becoming more and more manifest in America ; and the time may not be far distant when we may hope to find among our people a just taste and correct conceptions of beauty . It is true , however , that at present the American people are , to a certain extent , fostering a false taste for art , requiring in the drama , in literature , and all other aesthetic productions , an excess of coloring , an exaggeration of ornament , to arrest their attention and satisfy a vulgar craving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in no wise prove more fatal than in its influence on the progress of pictorial art ; and we would deem it vain to hope for better things from the public , did it not continually indicate an increasing fondness for the art of painting . Among the most promising evidences of this growing taste , no stronger could be adduced than that witnessed by every visitor to the late International Exhibition at Philadelphia . Memorial Hall was there the centre of attraction . Thousands who had , with hearts full of pride , witnessed the triumph of native ingenuity in the great hail consecrated to Machinery , turned from these triumphs of American genius to the thronged galleries of Memorial Hall The sea of upturned faces which might there be seen intent on the paintings that lined the walls , and the perpetual , almost impenetrable , crowds passing and repassing from picture to picture , indicated no small aesthetic sensibility and an unaffected interest in the art of painting . Those who witnessed this scene could not fail to ask themselves : What stage have we reached in pictorial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a question of no common interest and difficulty , and however inadequately it may be answered , it is surely one which courts // the investigation of every sincere and studious lover of art . But in any degree to appreciate the state of painting in America , it will be necessary to cast a glance at its growth and development in this country . Our Puritan forefathers seem to have cared little or not at all for the arts of design . The immediate descendants of the brave little band which left England to plant its flag on Plymouth Rock possessed none of the conditions and inducements which combine to evolve even the crudest form of art . If nature ever endowed them with artistic faculties , they were as much suppressed as their impassioned vigor and religious zeal were developed . They seem to have positively cultivated everything harsh and unpleasant , frowning down all things pleasant and attractive . On the same principle , we suppose , they prohibited bear-baiting , not because it gave the bear pain , but the spectators pleasure . They seem to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it must be extirpated like idolatry in Canaan or altarpieces in papal Rome . An occasional portrait in buff-coat and bandoleer may have been tolerated on the whitewashed wall , but more as a reminiscence of their old home than from any sense of beauty . Under such conditions or in such a medium the Muses , if they ever sought these shores , became devitalized and benumbed . The understanding distanced and gradually lost sight of the imagination . The Colonies called only for artisans to build up civilization in the wilds of a new country . All taste for the external and decorative aspect of things was lost and merged in the struggle for order and existence . There was no architecture and little literature , nothing but system without proportion . Yet we must not forget that to that very system do we owe our prosperity and the success of our Revolution . The strength and vigor of these old Puritans left its imprint on the land indeed , but we doubt if any of their qualities maintained ascendency over the people so enduringly as their positive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and even at this day the traces of their dominating influence are not invisible in many sections of the country . It would be a task of no common interest to go back in detail over the period which witnessed the dawn of taste in America and the advent of our early masters . But space will not permit that // careful investigation - which the subject deserves , and by which it might be shown , that , though our taste was then less developed , it was not so forced and false as the taste of the present day . Up to the year 1715 the art of painting was almost as little known to our ancestors as telegraphy is to the natives of Africa . It was in that year that the natives of Perth Amboy were astounded by the appearance of an odd Scotchman , called John Watson , who set up a studio and painted portraits for a scanty compensation . If we except the inspired coach-painter Smybert , and Rembrandt Peale , who painted the " Court of Death , " the early painters who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most readily be described as good sign-painters . Many of them - indeed , most of them - were the itinerant immortalizers of the heads of families , the travelling photographers of the period . Pratt appears as the Raphael of sign-painters . We are told by Niegel that Pratt 's signs were by far the best signs he ever saw . Smybert is the first artist whose productions can be said to claim a place in the history of American art . He has the merit of a pioneer . As such , if in no other regard , he undoubtedly holds respectable rank . In those days there was no gallery , no school of art , no church decoration , no architectu re , not even a public building of any importance . In the face of all these barren surroundings , with the aid of a foreign tour , Smybert producedi some very estimable copies and portraits . That the people were not entirely devoid of natural taste , and that there slumbered im them a sentiment which had been choked by the Puritan element , soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when we see such painters as Copley , Trumbull , Aliston , and West arise from among them . It can not , at the same time , be denied that these artists must all have been born with an impassioned and inspired talent for the art . We are told by Lord Lyndhurst , the son of Copley , that his father never saw a good picture until he was thirty years of age . It is impossible not to admire the perseverance and native energy which must have impelled his innate genius to work against the tide of difficulties and opposing influences . Many have lamented the dry tone and formality of manner which characterize the works of Copley while he remained on this side of the VOL cxxxv. - NO. 256. 30 // Atlantic . But much of this can be pardoned by those who have looked upon his " Death of Chatham " in the National Gallery of London . There we may see in full force his best qualities , and especially the translucence and richness of his coloring . In the Quaker painter , Benjamin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and spontaneous sentiment for his calling . His successes have not equalled those of the great masters , but he presents an unrivalled instance of strong natural talent . He divested himself of his material surroundings , and , with every influence and prejudice against him , obeyed the dictates of his genius . It may indeed , perhaps , be questioned whether his merit warranted his brilliant success ; but as the founder of a new school of historic painting he must hold high rank . Horace Vernet , and all the battle-painters who succeeded , adopted and followed his innovations , and the name of West became more extensively known in Europe than in America . Driven away by lack of encouragement , most of our early artists , and among them West , sought abroad that sympathy which was denied them here . West was chosen President of the Royal Academy , and earned the gratitude of his countrymen by becoming the teacher of Trumbull and Allston . All our early painters were encouraged to paint subjects which appealed to the patriotism , religion , and imagination of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke well for the prevailing colonial taste . But the Colonies offered so small a field of purchase that it soon became the fashion to seek abroad a larger patronage . Here their efforts met with all due reward , and the patronage of all England was not wanting to secure the services and fortunes of our Stuarts and Copleys and Wests . Yet there was no lack of aesthetic feeling with us in those days . The patronage may have been small , but the growing taste was not yet perverted . All the heroes of the Revolution were painted by the best artists , and Trumbull 's heads tell many a story not to be read in the pages of Bancroft . Nevertheless , Trumbull said to a young aspiring painter , " You had better learn to make shoes or dig potatoes than become a painter in this country " ; so small was the patronage of that time . This early school , however , understood its audience . Even at the present day there are few paintings which , in point of subject , go so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's " IDeath of Wolfe " or Trumbull 's " Hamilton " or Copley 's " Chatham " or Aliston 's " Dream of Jacob . " In the works of the last the fancy and spirit of the poet is strikingly translated to the canvas . Nor can we forget the masterly Washington , by Stuart . In every line there is a story . Stuart , of all our artists , may well be called the first colorist , and probably the first portrait-painter . His repose and softness of treatment , the depth and transparency of his shadows , his masterly handling of color , might well be imitated by the men of this generation . Dunlap , in his " History of the Arts , " tells a story curiously illustrative of the intuitive and searching genius of this painter . He was engaged by Lord Mulgrave to paint the portrait of his brother , General Phipps , shortly to embark for India . Something strange in the picture drew from his Lordship the exclamation , " I see insanity in that face . " The first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had cut his throat . Stuart died poor , although he ranked as the first American portrait-painter of his day . The writer was told by the artist 's daughter , that , had her father resisted the entreaties which led him to abandon England , he would surely have died richer in wealth and fame . As it was , he was enticed to America to paint Washington , Jefferson , and other distinguished characters of the day . Stuart died in 1829 . Thus we may see that in the early part of this century the profession of the painter in America could not be called profitable . Yet it was a period which produced , perhaps , more good artists than we have since seen in this country . In a few the technique may have been inferior , but some of them have never since been surpassed in device of subjects , coloring , and perception . Even Yanderlyn , Sully , and Malbone possessed qualities which we of to-day may well envy . Their technique was English , but their productions breathe a spirit of originality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As the American portrait school was losing its best representatives , and its more conspicuous features , there sprang into existence a class of painting which , more than any other American art productions , can be said to belong to a schooL This was the landscape school . It bears the stamp and aspect peculiar to picturesque America , and interprets pure nature . The ruddy autumnal tints of our forests , the splen. - dor of our shores compared with those of other lands , our unrivalled // sunsets , our vast rivers , were subjects for this new school . Doughty led the way . His autumnal effects at once touched the popular heart . His C* Peep at the Catskills " and " View of the Hudson " made our people first realize the artistic surroundings of color which more than on any other Northern continent prevail in America . The start once made , it was soon followed in different directions . Our artists discovered that they could learn more from the woods and the rivers and the bays of their own country than could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rome , or Paris ; and their efforts were not discouraged by the public . The demand for home scenes , scenes in which the people moved and lived , was constantly increasing , and marked an epoch in American art . It called forth such painters as Kensett , Whittredge , Russell Smith , Hubbard , S. R. Gifford , Church , Inness , Cole , Coleman , and others . Who has not looked with pleasure on the seapieces of Kensett ? Pre-iRaphaelite in the extreme , yet usually pure and broad in choice of subject ; never neglecting finish , yet never losing sight of his effect , this artist gives us space unbounded as it is not often found combined with such fidelity to detaiL Again , what could be more sympathetic or appealing than the landscapes of S. Iii . Gifford , who sought and painted native nature with its woods and creeks , its moors , its valleys , its rivers , waves , and gorgeous gilded sunsets ? Claude-like in his sunlit evenings , and in his atmospheric effects imaginative to a rare degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This entire school of landscape-painters is the product of the public taste as it existed before the war . The public mind was in greater repose , less cosmopolitan . The taste was purer , devoid of that alloy which now taints it . It is to this most healthy con* dition of aesthetic perception that posterity owes the reproduction of scenes which must ever remain identified with this continent . What subject could be more majestic and eminently suggestive of native scenery than the " Niagara " of Church ? There is sensation sufficient , one would imagine , to please the greatest lover of sensation ; but it is sensation culled from Nature in her fullest vigor . In examining some of Inness 's landscapes , we shall find it difficult at once to account for the pleasing , uncommon , yet quiet effect which greets us . After a while we discover that the charm lies in his strict observance of the laws of relation , his harmony , // his broad effects of light and shadow , his picturesque groupings the hazy transparence of his atmosphere , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be given only by that poetic fervor which approaches the fen sacr ( It is the genius of repose that lights the paintings of the group of artists which preceded the war . The taste for this repose is now singularly abandoned by the public for what might be termed an art essentially decorative . In the days of the American Art Union its walls were lined with native scenes , and the success of this institution was without parallel . Indeed , as the promoter of American art , and a gauge of the public taste for years preceding the war , the Art Union did good service , and although the withdrawal of its tutelage may have been for the best , the loss of such an institution was great indeed . It had played its part as the nurse of American art , and properly , perhaps , the time of natural patronage was at hand . Yet a gap was created which , in many respects , has never since been filled . We now come to what we may venture to term the second period of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ epoch . The war came . Vast fortunes were accumulated . Men who but yesterday had swept the streets rose to wealth and ease . Houses were bought and built in countless numbers . Pictures were needed to hang the walls of newly acquired mansions . The rooms must be furnished , the walls must be decorated , the paintings must be found . The demand came and the supply must be created , - a forced supply created by an unnatural want . It was with these new men not a question of quality , but of quantity . Their tastes were not cultivated , and everything was purchased in profusion . Paintings were turned out by the yard , good , bad , and indifferent , no matter what ; but *nsthetics had little to do in the selection . Fanned by the incessant excitement of war , the fever spread rapidly over the land , and bred that gaudy taste which has all but ingrained itself in American nature . Everything was splendid above and rotten below . It was the same in all property , in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The inflation spread over every corner of the country . We now see the reaction at every turn . In real estate , in railroads , in factories , in every walk and employment of life , do we find the terrible reaction from this unnatural state of things . This inflation took its rise in those days of cumulative wealth // when fortunes became so vast that the value of money paled before the desires of those who were poor men yesterday and millionnaires to-day . Those were the days when one of our first painters , finishing in his studio a painting to order , was offered by some son of fortune three times the amount contracted for . Works of art became articles of commerce . The Wall Street of painting might be found in the rooms of the auctioneer . Galleries were purchased and soon disposed of at large profits . The same individual would purchase and sell again and again , prices and values being out of all proportion , and not a few of the best paintings giving way to the poorest . Young painters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were summoned to supply the increasing demand . They painted and sold at figures which had never before been realized by the ablest of our artists . Yet the fault lay not with these young aspirants . It lay with the public . Had these young artists been encouraged to paint the scenes which at that time were being enacted , or had just passed away , - the scenes on the battle-fields which must ever touch the hearts of all Americans , - the first effect which the sight and recollection of such heroism and suffering would have inspired must have stamped the soul of all true men with that surpassing grandeur , the grandeur of national courage . It is indeed impossible to account for the small demand which the war created for scenes and episodes from the great struggle which for years was foremost in the minds of the people . TI*me galleries and auction-rooms teemed with scenes of every age and clime , but few were the artists who were moved to translate to canvas the fury and medley of the battle-field , the cries of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the picturesque and touching scenes and scenery which the eye of the soldier must have hailed with emotion . One young sculptor alone , John Rogers , made his fame and his fortune by the many appealing attitudes in which he has shown us the soldier 's life . But the minds of his brother artists , the painters , seem at that time to have lost their sensitiveness . This may be accounted for by lack of public encouragement , or by the more charitable supposition that artists and the public were willing that the recollections of our civil war should drop into oblivion . If this be so , it is well that painters should have led the way iu this patriotic feeling , and done nothing to commemorate a // struggle which all are now willing to forget . The time may come when men 's minds will be less agitated by the events of the late war , and when subjects connected with it will be viewed only as translations of common humanity , without the idea of conflict . Whatever the cause which may have prompted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no craving for home subjects , and were as averse to native scenes as to the waving of the bloody shirt . Painters were urged to turn out bad imitations and superficial reproductions of foreign and especially of French schools . Purchasers longed to see their walls hung with subjects which would recall to them the iReignaults , the Meissoniers and Geromes , of Transatlantic fame . The cavalier , the Turk , the Mameluke , and the grisette were all ei*ticing subjects for this purpose . A dash of green here , a dash of red or blue there , gave sufficient satisfaction to an untrained eye . Dealers purchased in Europe , and still continue to purchase , a few paintings by prominent masters , to surround them here in their galleries with inferior productions by inferior artists , which upon their native soil would bring hardly the value of the canvas These in superficial coloring approached the great ina*ters around which they clustered , and not a few were similar in choice of subject . Unable to detect the wide difference of quality , the ordinary collector was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great prices , and it was not long before the failures of Paris were thrown by cargoes upon the American market . It was partly thus by the large and increasing sale of inferior imitations of the best French masters that our young artists were forced into a track which must inevitably divest them of every vestige of originality unless the taste of the public should undergo a salutary change . A finished shoe , with pink heel and silver buckle , became more attractive to the general eye than all the soul and sensibility which might speak from a fine landscape or a fine face . Taste , instead of being formed , became perverted , the conception of the artist was sacrificed to his execution , and those who failed to purchase in France had recourse to native artists , who must needs follow the mandate of the purchaser . This bade him paint things instead of thoughts , buttons instead of heads . It is painful to realize this melancholy truth at most of the auction-sales which take place to-day . A neatly painted row of buttons on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring larger prices than productions of far greater merit which breathe that repose which of late has become so obnoxious to Americans . This love of decorative , foreign , and past scenes in many cases urges our artists to become guilty of anachronisms which can not be avoided . Before we can paint knights-errant , with sword and belt and armor of bygone days , we must first possess a British Museum or a Mus6e de Cluny . We shall then no longer be forced to contemplate some unfortunate knight of the fifteenth century confined to the Tower of London , and arrayed in the picturesque apparel of his age , with a pair of Wellington boots to mar it . It is partly to avoid these anachronisms that our young painters are forced to seek abroad the material to fill their canvas , and pander to the public taste . It is this very habit of foreign study , as generally practised by our artists , that stamps their work with lack of character and native strength . We walk through the galleries of our exhibitions , and recognize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not blame the painter , who follows only in the current of the market , which calls yearly for such immense supplies from the schools of Europe . Unhappily most of those who sought abroad the training which might lead them to acquire the style of foreign masters were only absent long enough to catch their faults of coloring , and ailed to give to the study of the figure those years which alone can make the skilled draughtsman . Now that every advantage is being offered , especially in New York , where the system of instruction is being carried to its highest pitch , there is every inducement presented to aspirant artists who may seek for native training . Italian schooling and Italian surroundings may extend the value of the artist 's product , but it can never enhance his cesthetic sensibility . When we reflect what obstacles opposed the rise of the Flemish school , and what surpassing advantages we possess , there can be no room for discouragement , but every hope of success . The Netherlands produced a school of their own only when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may have been partly Italian , but they clung sometimes ridiculously to the models of their own land . Their gods and goddesses were clothed with the flesh of plump Dutch women . IRubens never sought his models in Italy . He was the index and representative of the living organism which // thought and moved in the Netherlands . Even more so with Rembrandt . Whatever iRubens might have had of the ideal Rembrandt cast aside , choosing often for models positive ugliness . Yet we lose sight of the unsightly by the light of his chiaroscuro . The masterpieces of Italy were evolved from native surroundings . Their Madonnas were Italian women . No one ever sought elsewhere for manner or for matter , and with us feminine beauty is even more common than there , - perhaps , therefore , less valued . But the Italian public was appreciative ; and we want , above all , an appreciative public . When Titian painted his " Venus of the Tribune " at Florence , he could never have been induced to handle the subject so laboriously , never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his wonderful powers , without having an audience which for appreciation has never been excelled . Such subtlety of color , such an exhibition of light and color in their most difficult combinations without the aid of the usual effect of shadow , such softness of outline , such transparency of shade , indeed , such an harmonious embodiment of truth , art , and nature , never could have been produced without the encouragement of a fostering public . Those were the days when the great painter stood almost higher than the great prince , when the public worshipped him as a god , when the pencil could win more glory than the sword . Hence , when Leonardo da Vinci dies , we find his sovereign exclaiming , " I can make ten thousand lords , but not one Leonardo . " Those times have passed indeed , and if we recognize that they have passed , why not rid ourselves from the prevailing tendency to imitate them ? Why not search for truth in all nature with the eye of the soul-inspired artist ? Armed with such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the beautiful in the unsightly and the surpassingly grand in the hideous . A most powerful example of his Dantesque grandeur may be seen in Reignault 's " Executioner , " and the faculty of seeing the beautiful in the unsightly could scarcely be more thoroughly represented than we have it in a painting by Mr. Quartly , one of our native artists , who has chosen a native subject , which now hangs on the walls of the Academy of Design , in New York . It represents a scene on a North River pier , one of sufficiently prosaic cast to require that pleasant and genuine quality of its own which has been infused by the artist . // After walking through this last exhibition at the Academy of Design , few can leave it without carrying with them the impression that our native art possesses merits which , if but called out by the public in a right direction , would be an honor to the country . There are some , indeed , among the paintings there exhibited which would not be unworthy of the salons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can fail to notice the purity and bright delicacy which characterize Gifford , the solid German excellence of Eastman Johnson , the rich , ripe , warm repose and sleeping splendor of an autumn effect by Inness . Boston is represented in a fine painting by Porter , full of color , sympathy , and grace , a freshness and fulness of life which is not often expressed by the brush . Cast in another mould , though not less attractive , is the " High Note , " by J. G. Brown . The old man sitting in the country chair , the old fiddle into which he is throwing his soul , his pathetic expression , and his eyes dim with emotion , denote rare power on the part of this artist . Not far from this painting hangs a scene which recalls us to the old days when princes and prelates ruled the world . Wolsey and King Henry in the foreground of the banquet-hall at Hampton , the scene of riot and revelry around the tables , which recede into the hall , surrounded by ever-changing faces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lamps , is a scene and subject well worthy of Mr. Irving , the quality of whose work would not easily be surpassed had he not been preceded by Meissonier. it is , however , to be regretted that the talent of this artist has not been applied to the rendering of modern or native scenes . Space will not permit any further glance at the best paintings on exhibition at the Academy ; although there are several of equal merit with those above named , we must forego the pleasure of recalling them . It may be doubted whether visitors to the exhibition now open at the Academy will there find a full representative gallery of American art . The paintings are mainly by New York artists , and , save a very few from Boston and elsewhere , the nation is but feebly represented . There is no better encouragement to the arts than an Annual National Exhibition organized and recognized by the country . This is essentially needed . We want , for the better promulgation of recent art productions , to gather together results of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gallery where we // may yearly witness the progress of painting through the Union , from New York to San Francisco , from St. Paul to Galveston . By thus collecting the results of the year under one roof , the public taste for national art will be encouraged , and diverted from foreign imports of inferior value . And only thus can we encourage native artists to wield vigorous pencils and keep pace with the material progress of the country . Then will our painters no longer fear to pass the ordeal of criticism . A sensitive public will always be followed by sensitive critics . In all the great countries of Europe national annual exhibitions of art are fostered and carefully encouraged , and every painter considers it an honor to be admitted to the Salon of Paris or the Academy of London . At the present exhibition some of our best artists are remarkable by their absence , and few visitors can leave the building without having the conviction forced upon them that all America has not competed . Those who know by what zeal and energy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Design was founded will fully appreciate the obstacles which would beset a further development of such an institution . To found the Salon at Paris , or the exhibition of the Royal Academy in London , was an easy task compared with the difficulties of bringing together paintings from such vast distances as must be traversed in the United States . Yet the greater the difficulty the greater the triumph of such an achievement . At the present moment there are signs that indicate a new departure in American art , and promise to fill our galleries with materials ample to compensate for the years of toil which will be required . It will be open to young artists to get a thorough groundwork and training in New York , where every encouragement and the best instruction for the study of the human figure are offered . Such a training must inevitably prove of greater value than an imperfect acquisition of foreign technique . If it be true that the inventive faculty of the artist be proportioned to the active energies of the nation , then there should indeed be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not without cause that we can venture to hope that there may arise among us a new school more scientific , more correct than any yet known ; a school which shall combine the existent with the ideal as it has never yet been combined ; a great art expressive of great // thoughts at once harmonious , spontaneous , original , which shall combine the laws of proportion and the laws of beauty . In glancing back over the history of painting in this country , we can not but discover a sufficiently strong taste for the art to encourage great hopes for its future , especially when we consider that this is the only new country that has at all successfully vied with art in Europe . When these now United States were Colonies of England , they constituted integral parts of a great and ancient empire . The people were English , the richer families cultivated English tastes , the artists were Englishmen , and they looked to England as the mart where their productions were most likely to be appreciated , and receive their just reward . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of feeling and taste still lingered among us . But when our independence as a nation began to tell upon our manners and modes of thought , our taste began to degenerate . We became a nation given up to commerce , and gain usurped the worship which was due to beauty . Now , however , we are in the midst of a renaissance which began with our new school of landscape-painting , was interrupted by our civil war , but is destined , we hope , to resume its progress not only in landscape but in figure painting , till America shall not shrink from competition with the older schools of older countries . When we have reached this stage , it will be possible to realize the value of art as a powerful moral agent and promoter of high civilization . It will then be possible to realize how vital it is to the completion of American character that it raise itself from the prosaic into the regions of the true ; and we may then hope to possess what we have never yet possessed , - a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great national painting .
