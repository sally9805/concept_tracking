Brooks , Charles Timothy , 1813-1883 : " Look up the Old Mother ! "  --  long ago ' t was sung from " Look up the Old Mother ! " ( 1879 ) " Antiquam exquirite matrem . " Footnote 1 : 1Kb neid , iii , 96 . " Look up the Old Mother ! "  --  long ago ' t was sung By Roman Virgil , in his tuneful tongue ; " Exquirite antiquam matrem ! "  --  thus The blessed " Ordo " Footnote 2 : 1Kb read the words to us ;  --  The selfsame cry is in the air to-day ; We hear the summons , and our hearts obey . " Come back to the old Mother ! " we , too , sing , Tied to the ancient matron 's apron-string ; The elastic cord , which , wander where we will , Draws the last lingering truant homeward still , Sooner or later , to the Mother 's breast , In her embrace , a grateful child , to rest . To-day  --  where'er the world 's wide ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On all the winds of heaven her voice goes forth  --  From East and West they come  --  from South and North . The message rings " from China to Peru "  --  Pacific isles have caught the tidings , too ; And all  --  at least on Memory 's well-worn track  --  With loyal , loving reverence hasten back . Each seeks some favorite haunt , where once the face Of heaven and earth wore its most winning grace . One finds his way to sweet South Fields again , And steers for Derby 's Farm  --  alas ! in vain ; Then climbs the lane , half fearing , hoping still They may have left a piece of Castle Hill . Footnote 3 : 1Kb There rubs his eyes and seaward looks with dread  --  Heaven grant they may have spared old Naugus ' Head ! Another to the Common takes his way , Play-ground and training-field of childhood 's day ; To see if , still , the quivering poplar-trees Footnote 4 : 1Kb Flash in the sun and murmur in the breeze , As when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stretched their long array ; And if , in that neglected , weed grown spot The ancient Gun-house keeps its place or not . When an old son of Salem , after years Of exile , in his native streets appears , Behold , in his perplexed and eager glance , What crowds of questions yearn for utterance ! Pray , can you tell me , friend , if hereabout There lives a person by the name of Strout ? Footnote 5 : 1Kb What has become of that queer , winking man , Named Jaquish , Footnote 6 : 1Kb who could saw a load of tan ? Whose daughter Judith  --  apple of his eye !  --  ( A heroine whom Fame should not let die ) Of the church militant a soldier true ; Binder of shoes ; artist in fresco , too ; Fresh from her conflicts with the hosts of sin , Would sit , well-pleased , and scrape the violin : The mother bending o'er the buzzing wheel , To drown the rapturous joy she needs must feel , Or stooping o'er the hearth to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this rare group has gone ? Ah , well-a-day ! Thus on Time 's wave the jewels melt away ! Does the old green Gibraltar-cart Footnote 7 : 1Kb still stop , Up in Old Paved Street , at Aunt Hannah 's Footnote 8 : 1Kb shop ! Beside Cold Spring drop the sweet acorns still ? Do boys dig flagroot now beneath Legge 's Hill ? When ' Lection-day brings round its rapturous joys Does Doctor Lang Footnote 9 : 1Kb sell liquorice to the boys ? Is there a house still standing where they make The regular , old-fashioned ' Lection-cake ? Does " A True Grocer " Footnote 10 : 1Kb his own merits praise ? Does Mister Joseph Footnote 11 : 1Kb bake cold loaves some days ? Does Micklefield 's Footnote 12 : 1Kb Indian , as he used to do , Hold the narcotic weed to public view ? Echo the streets no more with Mullet 's Footnote 13 : 1Kb bell ? Has Bedney Footnote 14 : 1Kb no more Almanacs to sell ? Those Kings Footnote 15 : 1Kb of East and West @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do they walk no more ? Does ' Squire Savage still look sternly down On ill-bred urchins with his awful frown ? Deputy Dutch and dog  --  do they still chase The recreant debtor to his hiding place ? Does Louvriere still skip , with book in hand , By a short cut through Doctor Oliver 's land ? Blind Dolliver Footnote 16 : 1Kb  --  an eye in every finger  --  Still at the organ does he love to linger ? Or at the party , coming late , perchance , Tune the piano while he calls the dance ? Does Doctor Prince continue still to preach ? Does Philip Footnote 17 : 1Kb blow ? Does Master Hacker teach ? Do children sometimes see with terror , still , The midnight blaze of wood-wax on Witch Hill ? Or hail , far twinkling through the shades of night , The cheering beam of Baker 's Island light ? Our pilgrim stands in Central street , and there Wonders if still , in summer hours , the air Murmurs abroad , as evening shades come in , The tones of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dancing-hall , That beat responsive to Papanti 's call . When " training-day " is drawing to a close , And tired " Militia " long for sweet repose ; Only the showy " uniforms " would fain " Improve the shining hours " that yet remain , A few unique manoeuvres to display , A grand finale to the festive day ,  --  Do " lobster-backs " and gray-coats sometimes meet , Footnote 18 : 1Kb And come to a dead-lock , in Central street ? ( Alas ! that this proud gala-day , so bright , Should close its eye upon a true " sham-fight ! " ) But still fresh questions crowd upon his mind , And still sad answers he is doomed to find . Where is the old North Church that heard the tread Of Sabbath-breaking troops from Marblehead ? Where is the venerable " East " that shook To Bentley 's note of thanks or bold rebuke ? Where is the Old Sun Tavern ? Footnote 19 : 1Kb Where the sign That showed the " Coffee House " in days lang syne ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To childhood 's fancy in the days of yore ! The Willows  --  well may it be called to-day  --  There Memory weeps  --  the charm has passed away ! Where is the Gate , Footnote 20 : 1Kb beneath whose graceful arch We saw so many a gay battalion march , Welcomed by Washington 's majestic face ? Where is Plank Alley ? Footnote 21 : 1Kb Where is Holyoke Place ? Neptune and Vine and Court streets Footnote 22 : 1Kb  --  where are they ? With their old dwellers they have moved away  --  Gone up to that calm city in the air ; The feet of Memory still frequent them there . " In Salem is his Tabernacle "  --  so Our pious fathers cried with souls aglow ; And here their Tabernacle builded they ; Men live who once beheld it ; but to-day A wooden finger Footnote 23 : 1Kb stretches high in air And cries : Behold your tabernacle there ! Yet while the pilgrim , roaming up and down The streets and alleys of his native town , So many a well-known object @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rock-ribbed hills remain . In the low murmur of the quivering breeze That stirs the leaves of old ancestral trees , The same maternal voice he still can hear That breathed of old in childhood 's dreaming ear ; The same maternal smile is in the sky Whose tender greeting blessed his infant eye . Though much has changed and much has vanished quite , The old town-pastures have not passed from sight . " Delectable Mountains " of his childhood  --  there They stretch away into the summer air . Still the bare rocks in golden lustre shine , Still bloom the barberry and the columbine , As when , of old , on many a " Lecture day , " Footnote 24 : 1Kb Through bush and swamp he took his winding way , Toiled the long afternoon , then homeward steered , With weary feet and visage berry-smeared . Thus to some favorite haunt will each to-day , At least in fond remembrance , find his way . My thoughts , by some mysterious instinct , take Their flight to that charmed spot we called the Neck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cling ; Around her neck , like beads , my rhymes I string . She will not scorn my offering , though it be Like beads of flying foam , flung by the sea Across the rocks , to gleam a moment there , Then break and vanish in the summer air . Then hail once more , the Neck  --  the dear old Neck ! What throngs of bright and peaceful memories wake At that compendious name ! What rapturous joy Kindles the heart of an old Salem boy , As he returns , though but in thought , to take That old familiar walk " down to the Neck ! " The old Neck Gate swings open to his view , At morn and eve , to let the cows pass through . Foye 's ropewalk stands there still  --  he enters in : Adown that dusky lane shall Memory spin Full many a yarn , the while with silent tread A ghostly workman draws his lengthening thread . Through window-holes that light that black earth-floor How many a sprite peeps in from days of yore ! What wild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reverberating space ! No magic wand the Enchantress needs to wave  --  Awe-struck we stand before old Gifford 's Cave ; Footnote 25 : 1Kb While , towering o'er us  --  a strange contrast  --  lo ! Fresh as they looked when , sixty years ago , They caught our glance from far , on sea and land , The red brick walls of the poors ' palace stand . With boyish feet I climb yon naked hill , And Bentley 's Rock  --  a ruin , greets me still . Rises once more the Genius of the place  --  The same elastic step and eager face . The old man lifts the spy-glass to his eye : " There go the ships ! " again I hear him cry ; As , on his other watch-tower , once he stood , And fired his farewell shot in playful mood , And to the parting fleet his God-speed said  --  The self-invited guests of Marblehead . Footnote 26 : 2Kb In my mind 's eye , on that memorial ground A relict of the war of ' 12 limps round , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of the Neck Gate an old habitu . Whereby there hangs a tale : One cloudy night , The sentinel upon the Neck caught sight Of a strange figure creeping round the hill ; He cried out : " Who goes there ? "  --  but all was still . He challenged thrice  --  then fired  --  a canine yell Revealed his sad mistake too late and well . With bleeding foot the victim limped away , A cripple and a hero from that day . But other , fairer , memories consecrate The immortal purlieus of the old Neck Gate . Oft , on a summer Sunday 's peaceful close , ( The sweet relief no child at this day knows ! ) In the long , lingering glow of evening 's ray , ( Holy day melting into holiday ) All down through Wapping ( Derby street , I mean ) , Where trig and jaunty tars might then be seen , Leaning on old spiked cannon , taken at sea , Trophies of many a naval victory , And made to serve henceforth a double intent , Street-corner-post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sabbath evening 's quiet ray , Down this old storied street we took our way To where , beside the fresh , cool , spray-wet shore , Old Colonel Hathorne 's hospitable door Invited us to rest ; serenely there The patriarch greeted us with musing air ; But no long reverence childhood waits to pay  --  Soon to the garden-gate we found our way . How red  --  how sweet  --  the rose , the currant there ! What heavenly fragrance filled the evening air ! What but a bit of Eden could it be  --  That little garden close upon the sea ? Within , red rose and redder currant glow  --  Without , the white-lipped ocean whispers low . Sweet memories ! yet not chiefly for their sake My thoughts to-day have wandered to the Neck . Bentley and Hathorne  --  names that shed renown Upon the history of our ancient town  --  Are but as criers to-day , that point us back With glowing faces , up the shining track To where , assembled now on Memory 's hill , A group of forms more venerable still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and reflected from the heavenly height . On that memorial mount , in air serene , Walking in glory , with majestic mien , A shining cloud of witnesses appear And send us greetings from their lofty sphere . Reverent and brave , inflexible , sedate , Founders and fathers of the Church and State , Captains and counsellors , a saintly band , They beckon onward to the Promised Land . Conant , the wise and generous pioneer ; Endicott , high-souled , daring , and austere ; Higginson , Williams , Peters ,  --  well might we Cry , as in vision we behold the three : Fair souls ! to Goodness , Faith and Freedom dear , Shall we not build three tabernacles here ? On the Lord 's mountain , at the fount of Truth They dwell with Him , in life 's unwithering youth : That sweet and saintly one , who crossed the wave To find , in one short year , an exile 's grave ; He  --  twice a pilgrim , who in winter snows And savage huts alone could find repose , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he e'er find Repose for his aspiring , restless mind ? ) To whom the dark-skinned ravens of the wood In his distress brought sinking nature food ; Who , by the hand of Providence led hence , Still at his journey 's end found Providence ; And that brave preacher and strong worker  --  he Who left his darling such sweet " Legacy ; " Who , living , brought her lessons from the sky , That taught the way to live for joys on high , And with his dying smile and dying breath The precious lesson : How to conquer death . " I wish you neither poverty Nor riches ; But godliness , so gainful With content . No painted pomp , nor glory that Bewitches ; A blameless life is the best Monument ; And such a soul that soars a- bove the sky , Well pleased to live , but better Pleased to die . " Footnote 27 : 1Kb O could those saints  --  those seers and singers twain Footnote 28 : 1Kb Breathe their free spirit through my stammering strain , Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this high memorial day . Then might I utter in a worthier rhyme Those lofty lessons for the coming time , Of faith and freedom , of content and trust , The fathers breathe from heaven and from the dust . That graver task I cheerfully resign To other voices  --  abler hands than mine . But me the question now confronts ( too long Evaded by my loitering , gadding song ) , Why at this hour , when we our way retrace Back to the earliest footprints of the race Who on these pleasant shores first pitched their tent , The cradle of the infant settlement  --  The old North River side my thoughts forsake And take that lonely ramble to the Neck .  --  Forgive a would-be-patriarch ( shall I say ? ) Born all too late , whose memory stops to-day Well nigh two hundred years this side the mark , Runs back three score  --  then fumbles in the dark . I was a boy when quaint old Bentley died ; I roamed the Neck , his spirit at my side . Within its gate a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far away . There with a ghostly Past I talked  --  with awe The ancient Mother 's august form I saw . " Seek out the ancient Mother ! "  --  How and where ? Some pore o'er musty scrolls and seek her there ; But on the open land , beneath the skies That made it fair to her first children 's eyes ,  --  In that fresh air  --  upon that sacred ground  --  Methinks the Mother 's presence best is found . And so I seem to see her shadow wait To greet me , passing through the old Neck Gate . For does not Winter Island meet my eye And tell a silent tale of days gone by ? I climb yon hill and see forevermore A spectral sail approach the wooded shore . On Winter Island wharf I see them land , A ghostly train come forth upon the strand . A village springs to life  --  a busy port ; It has its bustling wharves  --  its bristling fort . Lo ! Fish Street  --  destined one day to run down To Water Street  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the charms Of those enchanting " Marble Harbor Farms ? " Are the " sweet single roses " Footnote 29 : 1Kb still in bloom ? Still do the " strawberries " the air perfume ? And from the flowers and shrubs that clothe the ground Does a " sweet smell of gardens " breathe around ? And ,  --  sons of Salem !  --  be it ne'er forgot That it was there  --  in that wild , lovely spot  --  While yet the plough had scarcely broke the land  --  They set their hearts to have the College stand . Footnote 30 : 1Kb Well can we guess what charms the landscape wore When first our fathers trod this silent shore . The child asks : Why should those green islands be Baptized as Great and Little Misery ? " Footnote 31 : 1Kb Might we not almost deem these names were given Lest those poor saints should dream this earth was Heaven ?

Such was the name they gave the spot , when first Upon their yearning eyes its beauty burst ; Till by a three fold  --  nay , a four fold claim , Salem showed right divine to be its name . For Salem they were taught of old to pray ; To Peace  --  to Salem  --  God has led their way ; A spark of strife at Conant 's breath had died  --  Footnote 33 : 1Kb In Salem now  --  in Peace  --  we dwell  --  they cried . And lo ! another wonder  --  if we here To Cotton Mather 's word may lend an ear  --  " Behold ! " they cried , " the meaning of our name In Indian speech and Hebrew is the same . This is the place of rest we came to seek : This is our comfort-haven : Nahum-Keek ! " Footnote 34 : 1Kb Here Mother Salem her first fortune made  --  The future Queen of the East India trade . Here her commercial greatness she began With that small fleet of fishers from Cape Ann . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The hum of traffic grew more loud and clear . Meanwhile , as through the field of History 's glass The various groups of scattered settlers pass , Yonder we see , from the North River shore The farmers of the region paddling o'er To where the magnates of the Church and State Reside  --  the Minister and Magistrate . There stands the house in its capacious lot , Where dwells the worthy Master Endicott , Which Roger Conant , that good-natured man , Sent to his honored neighbor from Cape Ann . Footnote 35 : 1Kb North Fields and South Fields little dreamed that day Of horse-cars running on an iron way . Each household had its family canoe , And of these " water-horses " some had two . These troopers also had their grand displays , Their General Trainings , and their Muster Days .

Footnote 36 : 1Kb Turn now from inland ferry and canoe , Where heavier , deep-sea craft invite the view . Years passed  --  our sorely tried , yet hardy town Won with her merchant ships a rare renown . Footnote 37 : 1Kb The second war gave her success a check ; I was a boy when the Brig Ann , a wreck , Crawled up to Derby 's Wharf and landed there Her Oriental cargo , rich and rare . What sweets and fragrances , in frails and crates , Gum-copal , allspice , nutmegs , cloves and dates ! Then filled the eyes of every Salem boy With mingling tears of sadness and of joy .

From Buffum 's Corner to the old Neck Gate , Peace and prosperity upon thee wait ! And from Orne 's Point to Pickering 's Point may peace Reign in thy borders , and thy wealth increase  --  The wealth they win who choose the better part : The never-failing wealth of mind and heart : Treasures not tied to earthly fortune 's wheel ; Which not e'en Time  --  the busiest thief  --  can steal : Generous aspirings  --  Truth that maketh free  --  And " thoughts that wander through eternity ; " Jewels of Knowledge  --  Wisdom 's ample store  --  Treasures laid up in Heaven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age , to find A quiet corner for the musing mind ; And he who seeks it , sure may find it here , In this old memory-haunted atmosphere . " Dreamy old town "  --  they call thee ? Well , dream on ! Thought 's dreams shall last , when Passion 's dreams are gone . Be thine the dreams that yearn for realms divine ; Pilgrims that seek Perfection 's distant shrine ; Such dreams  --  so pure , so tranquil and so true  --  As Avarice and Ambition never knew ; Not such as make the worldling 's daily life A scene of fitful , feverish , futile strife , But those calm , holy dreams that melt away Like morning twilight into perfect day .
