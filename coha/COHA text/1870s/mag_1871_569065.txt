ARTICLE VI . - THE RELATION OF THE CONGREGATIONAL CHURCHES OF THE NORTHWEST TO COLLEGIATE EDUCATION . WHATEVER may have formerly been true , it is no longer necessary to prove the importance of founding and maintaining colleges in the new States of the upper Mississippi Valley . Jf* any have formerly doubted , the facts as now presented to any observant man , must dispel that doubt . It is not to be supposed for a moment that such communities as are now found in each of the ten great Northwestern States can attain to the full growth and development of a Christian civilization without ample provisions for the higher culture . He who supposes that the colleges and universities of the Atlantic States , however sufficiently endowed and richly furnished with all needed helps and inducements to liberal culture , can supply the necessities in that regard of these great interior States , has surely never bestowed much thought on the subject 1f among all these millions , none are to enjoy the advantages of a collegiate education , except those who are sent a thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have such an education ; and the influences of liberal learning will be little felt in those great States which are soon to have the destinies of the Republic , in a great measure , in their keeping . In communities so wealthy and populous as these already are , or are soon to become , the education of the people will , for the most part , be such and only such , as is furnished by institutions within their own bosoms . The character , the culture , the civilization of the people will be little affected by the few who may receive their training at far distant colleges . Such States must and will educate their own people , or they will not be educated . If it would have been absurd and suicidal for the early New England colonies , in their infancy and their weakness , to rely on the English universities to supply them with liberal learning , still more so is it for these new States to rely on the colleges , how . ever excellent , which our fathers founded in the Atlantic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that if we commit the folly of neglecting to found and maintain such institutions in the Northwest , the number of young men who will go from those States to the colleges of the older States will relatively diminish rather than increase . At the present time , many of the parents of the Northwest have received their training in the Eastern States , and perhaps are themselves graduates of their colleges . It is natural that such parents should desire to educate their sons at the eastern colleges . But a generation of parents is soon to arise that will be natives of the Northwest and will be drawn towards the colleges of New England by no such attractions as their fathers felt , and will therefore be much more likely to educate their sons at home , than to send them abroad to far distant institutions . They will accept the means of culture afforded by their own States , such as they may be , and be little disposed to seek for those which are better abroa&amp; If then these States are to feel the influence of liberal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have , within themselves , colleges furnished with all needed facilities for acquiring it ; and the problem of maintaining , in these States , colleges of the highest order of excellence , is one which may well engage the attention of the most enlightened minds and the most generous hearts . Our national character-our future is deeply concerned . We can not afford that the great Northwest or any portion of it should be given up to an exclusively material and industrial development , without the influence of liberal and generous culture . Nor will any well informed man deny that , in most of those States , the existing provisions for the higher education are scanty , and quite inadequate . We have no disposition to disparage the various institutions which have been founded , maintained , and to a certain extent endowed by individual public spirit and liberality ; they have accomplished much for learning and for general intelligence , and their founders have deserved well of their country . We believe that , to no small extent , these institutions are the foundations on which the future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also what some of the State universities of the Northwest have ac // 131 complished , and are promising to accomplish for the future . Especially do we entertain the highest respect for the University of Michigan , and are ready to render it all honor for what it has done and is doing for liberal learning . It is an ornament to the State that has reared and sustained it . But argument is unnecessary , to show that none of these institutions , nor all of them together , can be regarded as affording any adequate provision for the higher education , in a group of States so vast , and so powerfully influencing the destinies of our republic as these . It is therefore our purpose , in this article , to invite the attention of our readers to the conditions of this great problem of the higher education , as it presents itself in the new States of the Northwest , and to make some suggestions which we think important to its successful solution . In the foreground of the whole subject , we meet the truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overlook and disregard , that neither in the Northwest nor anywhere else , is it possible to eliminate religion from the college problem . The natural and permanent relations of religion to human thought and affection render the thing quite impossible . The attempt so to construct a college , that it shall be indifferent to religion would , if successful , result in an institution with which nobody that lives would be in sympathy . It is as hopeful to look for living trees that never have any foliage , as for living men that are without any religious convictions and religious affections . Those who do not regard religion with reverence and affection do regard it with dislike and aversion . Religious emotions , religious zeal , are not confined to believers . Men are as passionately in earnest in their negations as in their affirmations . Much is said , and much may be said with truth , of the bitterness of religious controversy ; but certainly , in this age , believers in Christianity have no monopoly of that commodity . We hear much of religious bigotry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ,  --  but , in our estimation , the bigotry of negation is no more moderate in tone and no more amiable in spirit than the bigotry of faith . No matter then to whom you commit the guardianship of a high seminary of learning , believers or unbelievers , Christians or infidels , they are still men and have the passions of men , and // religion is one of the great permanent objects of human thought and interest , upon which their passions will act . Their religious convictions , tastes , and feelings will exert a powerful influence over the institution which they are set to govern . If they are believers in Christianity they will desire to make the course of study Christian in its influence , and to fill the chairs of instruction with devout believers . If on the other hand they are unbelievers , their unbelief will exert its influence on the course of instruction , and the various chairs of instruction will be filled with men as irreligious as themselves . By banishing all religion from a college , you have therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only given it over to an anti-religious instead of a religious sect . The human soul can - not be neutral to religion , neither can any institution which is under the control of human minds and hearts ; let us therefore disabuse our minds of the notion of rendering colleges unsectarian by banishing the Christian religion from them . If any one can prove that they are safer under the control of an antireligious than a religious sect ,  --  that anti-religious bigotry is more amiable than religious zeal , we may be willing to accept the conclusion . But we are not to be deluded into the notion that we have in this way eliminated the religious element from the conditions of the college problem . It is not only impossible to separate religion from any connection with our colleges , but it is well that is *o ,  --  - well that religion does sustain such a relation to the human soul , that it will never cease to obtrude and force itself upon our attention , till we give it its proper place in relation to every human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ youth of a nation , during that period of life when character is most rapidly and certainly formed , into seminaries from which all religious influences are excluded , is simply shocking . Take from the young , during that delicate and critical period of life , all those influences which come from faith in the divine and the everlasting , and nothing will remain , which can give any exaltation and dignity to the character ,  --  nothing to counteract the tendency of our nature to gross and debasing materialism . In such an absence of religious considerations , the downward gravitation of the young can only be arrested by holding before // them the golden dream of wealth , or the brilliant prizes of ambition . The moral nature will be starved , the love of truth will languish and die out ; patriotism will be despised , as only a fitting theme for the popular declamation of demagogues ; self-sacrifice will be scorned as the sickly characteristic of a weak and deluded enthusiast ; and nothing will be regarded as a worthy object of any human effort , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one 's own immediate worldly advantage . Knowledge itself will be estimated only at its cash value in the market . No wise man would wish anything to do with the education of the young , when once deprived of all use of religious considerations in his effort to form the character of true manliness . We are not now saying anything of the details of college discipline and usage ,  --  whether students should be required to attend prayers twice a day , or once a day ; or whether they should be compelled to attend on any religious services at all In these respects , variety of circumstances may perhaps justify considerable variety of practice . But we do say , that a college in which religion is not regarded as occupying the foremost rank , among the moral forces which are to educate a youth to true manliness , is founded on fatally false principles , and can not be a fountain of the highest culture . Such a college may be expected to be the Alma Mater of a generation of thinkers , such as Cicero shows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No man can account for the immeasurable exaltation of Socrates , Plato , and Cicero , and the men of their school , above all the other scholars of the Greek and Roman periods , except from the fact that they believed in God and in the immortality of the human soul . And those doctrines have not yet lost , and never can lose , their transcendant importance as educating forces . We claim therefore that our colleges and all our higher seminaries of learning must be religious ; that the men who give them their character must be religious in their convictions , their aims , and their spirit . We admit that a man without religions convictions may teach well , a language , a science , or an art . But that is far short of the whole which a teacher is to do . He is to form character , to develop manhood ; and the man who // is without religious principles and aims lacks a qualification for the performance of this function , which must be regarded as indispensable . We do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a teacher who is not religious . But we do say , that in the teachers who give tone and character to the institution , religion should be regarded as indispensable . Perhaps the opinion is of late gaining ground in some quarters , that , for the highest culture , we are to look to institutions under state or national control . Many are saying , we have already in a great measure given up the control of the elementary education of the people to the State . We must extend and round out our public school system , till it shall afford all needed facilities for the acquisition of liberal learning . We confess to have leaned at one time towards this opinion ourselves . There is a symmetry , a uniformity , a logical consistency , in such a system , which we like . But more reflection and observation have convinced us , that , however beautiful in theory , such an idea is chimerical and impracticable . Political influences are very disastrous to our system of public instruction as already existing . There is much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon it We are not going to attempt any proof of this assertion . It is a fact only too obvious , that , in all the Northwest at least , political parties and popular elections are constantly tending to defeat the efforts of good men in behalf of our public schools , and to disappoint the hopes of our ablest and best educators ; - that such men often meet , from this quarter , obstacles to the success of their endeavors , which are discouraging and heart-sickening . He who does not know this , has surely given very little attention to the subject . And these difficulties are far more serious in relation to the higher seminaries , than they are in relation to primary schools . These institutions require much larger funds , and the places in their gift are much more stimulating to ambition ; and consequently the control of them is much more eagerly sought by unscrupulous politicians . To expect that politicians of this character will not seek to manage such institutions for political purposes , if they are controlled by the State , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patronage and the // money of the government He who confidently relies on seminaries of learning under such influences to do their appropriate work has certainly little conception what such seminaries should be . The evidence of facts is , thus far , greatly against such expectations . The University of Michigan is the only one of the state universities which has produced results at all satisfactory ; and even that must yet be regarded as an experiment , in respect to the final result of which there is fear as well as hope . In the present state of things in this country it is impossible satisfactorily to adjust the relations of a state university to religion . Some men seem to think this a very easy matter ; they would advise us to conduct a state university precisely as we would do if no religious ideas had ever existed in the human mind . The undesirableness and impossibility of this solution we have already shown . It never can seem desirable to a believer in Christianity , or in any religion . It is a solution of the question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religion is true , if God is a reality , and it is possible for man to know anything about him , then to construct a university in such a manner as in no way to recognize his existence , and to provide for the education of the youth of a nation precisely as you would do if it were certain that no God exists , or that it is impossible to have any knowledge of him , is worse than absurd-it is impious and monstrous ; and all sincere believers in God must so regard it . And when the unbeliever suggests this as a solution of the religious question in connection with university education , he does but advise all theists to abandon , so far as this matter is concerned , their own creeds , and to accept in their stead , the cold , bald negations of his . This is surely not remarkably modest . A college or university under popular control will not be of this atheistic character . It will be open to the influence of all sects , both religious and irreligious . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the numbers and the activity of each . Men of all creeds regard it as their duty to propagate their opinions , and the adherents of every creed , whether of faith or of negation , will esteem a great university , controlled by the people a powerful instrument of propagation , and will therefore seek to exert upon its management such // influence as they may . In the midst of this conflict of contending religious and irreligious factions , the guardians of the institution will have a most difficult task to perform , and will be driven to innumerable compromises , in which the interests of truth and learning will be quite disregarded . Men will be appointed to the various chairs of instruction , with much more regard to their sectarian relations , than their merits as teachers and educators ; because those who exercise the appointing power are forced to harmonize , and conciliate the various sectarian intrigues and ambitions which are always active around them . This is no fancy picture . The history of any college in the United States under political control would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mode has ever been discovered by which a state university can be protected from these disastrous influences . Human nature longs for religious truth-hungers and thirsts for if ; and while it remains unchanged , religion will exert an important influence on the management of any institution of education which is under State control . We can no more escape from its influence than we can escape from the influence of gravitation while we are yet in the body . We do not . therefore believe it to be possible to place a university or a college under political control , without subjecting it to influences originating both in secular and in ecclesiastical politics , tending to corrupt and degrade it , to impair that simple love of truth which ought ever to pervade the halls of learning . A university so conditioned will not minister to the loftiest manhood , or the highest civilization . Shall we then place our colleges under denominational control ? In proposing this question , we have used a word which we never employ or meet without some degree of disgust . But unwieldy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its use as a necessity . It describes a phenomenon in American society , so omnipresent , so obtrusive and so disagreeably influential , that it must have a name , and no one has yet been fortunate enough to invent a better . And yet this word is used very loosely and indiscriminately . It describes the adherents of any particular religious opinion , quite irrespective of the nature of their principles or their // organization . In politics we use words more precisely . We do not call persons who hold a common political opinion or set of opinions a party , unless they have an organization formed and worked with a view of obtaining for those who belong to it the control of the government For this reason we do not recognize the freetraders as a political party , though perhaps there are not wanting indications that , by effecting such an organization , they may soon become a party . There are several other shades of political opinion which are discriminated by a name , which , for the want of a partizan organization , we do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a like discrimination in respect to our varying shades of religious thought And yet the word denomination is applied without any regard to these obvious distinctions . We call the followers of Alexander Campbell a denomination , although they have no national , state , or even county organization whatever . They may meet together for consultation and fellowship in limited districts , or even nationally ; but these meetings bind nothing , adjudicate nothing , decree nothing . None of their acts have any binding force ; they are not of the nature of legislation , in respect either to individuals or local societies . The same is true of the Congregationalists . Considered with respect to the county ; the state , or the nation , they are , not by accident but by principle and conviction , wholly inorganic . They have common beliefs , common usages , but recognize no legislative or j udicial authority over any individual or local society , in any county , state , or national assembly . And yet they are properiy enough called a " denomination , " because they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But certainly Congregationalists are * denomination in a very different sense from that in which we speak of the Protestant Episcopal Church , or the Methodist Episcopal Church , or the Presbyterian Church , as a denomination . In these cases , there are not only a common name and common beliefs , but a constitution , a code of laws , a government exercising legislative , judicial , and executive functions  --  a government as truly national as that of the United States ,  --  like the government of the United States , claiming and seeking to exercise jurisdiction over every // foot of our national domain , and each of these rival ecclesiastical governments , striving to win the allegiance of the greatest possible numbers of the people ; - but , unlike the government of the United States , not content with our national boundaries , but seeking to extend its jurisdiction , by means of missions and proselytism , to every quarter and corner of the earth ; and thus to become , in one respect at least like the church of Rome , a universal empire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ecclesiastical jurisdiction till it shall be bounded only by the limits of our planet , we have , within these few weeks , seen the leading members of one of these denominations withdrawing themselves from all cooperation in the cause of missions to the heathen , with men and with churches not recognizing the authority of their " General Assembly , " for the purpose of giving their influence entire , to a system of effort aiming at this universal " church extension . " Through missions thus prosecuted , it is anticipated that the American Presbyterian Church will soon extend her jurisdiction to India and China and Syria and Africa and the islands of the sea . The Congregational conception of the church neither recognizes or admits of any such " church extension . " In its very nature the church of Christ can have no such universal govern*ment ,  --  no government whatever except that of the local society . No scheme of ecclesiastical politics can combine itself with its enterprizes for evangelization or general philanthropy . It admits , it eminently favors such enterprizes ; and under its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the aim of such undertakings in Congregational hands will be purely moral and spiritual . They will only seek to give universal prevalence and power to those great truths of religion , which , if they are truths at all , are as universal as science , as comprehensive as philanthropy . It may have a certain convenience to call two things differing so widely , by the same name , because they have certain things in common . But if by calling them by the same name , we are deceived so as to assume that they are things of the same nature , we shall be likely to allow ourselves to be betrayed into the adoption of very unsound and illogical conclusions . // When therefore we ask whether our colleges should be placed under denominational control , what do we mean by the question ? Do we mean to a*k whether they should be placed under the government of a national church organism , as Princeton Theological Seminary is governed by the General Assembly ? Or that they should be subjected to the control of some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a Presbytery , a Conference , or a diocesan Bishop ? The objections to creating and maintaining colleges on such a basis are , we believe , insuperable . Ecclesiastical politics will be no less disastrous to colleges so conditioned and governed , than secular politics are to those governed by the State . There is the same natural tendency of ecclesiastical bodies to make the supposed interests of the denomination paramount in all matters to which they apply themselves , as in political bodies to make the interests of party paramount . And if the management of colleges is committed to them , it may be expected that the interests , real or supposed , of a religious denomination , will be made to override the interests of learning . Our inference is quite as obvious and quite as inevitable as in the case of political bodies ; and we know but one way in which it is possible to break its force . It may , perhaps , be denied that any real or supposed interests of a religious sect having a college under its control , can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of learning ought to be conducted . Such a denial would rather indicate an amiable , good-natured confidence in our fellow-men , than a knowledge of the actual state of things amid which we live . An important chair of instruction , for example , is to be filled . Is it then entirely certain , is it even probable , that the interests of sect , or ( what is much more accordant with the reality of things ) sectarian passions , and an enlightened regard to the interests of learning will point towards the same candidate for the place ? Is there no reason to fear that a regard for denominational interests will lead to the appointment of an inferior man , who is right denominationally , in preference to a superior man , who can not be exactly squared to that rule ? Is it so perfectly easy to fill a vacant Presidency in any of the colleges of the Northwest , with a man fully adequate to such a // station , that we can afford to insist that the candidate shall be of some certain precise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the church ? Or can it be quite consistent with the best interests of learning , to insist that the place shall only be filled by a Methodist , or one who is all right on the immersion question ? Would it have been wise to exclude Timothy Dwight from the Presidency of Yale , because , in his notions of the church , he was not quite a Congrega-tionalist ? There is a narrowness and a littleness in managing the affairs of institutions professedly consecrated to liberal learning , in such a spirit which must expose them , and the denominations that so conduct them , to the contempt of all liberal minded men . This cause is degrading our colleges in all parts of the country , but especially in the West and South . It is constantly tending to fill their chairs of instruction with men of indifferent qualifications ,  --  men who were placed there , not because they were ever believed to be the fittest men for the place , but because it was thought they would do , and they were of the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things is the legitimate fruit of subjecting our colleges to the control of such ecclesiastical systems as we have just described . It is precisely the result which comes , by a necessity of human nature , from such a system . And we predict that if this order of things becomes general in the Northwest , and is persisted in , the long future of its colleges will be as illiberal as it should be liberal , and as insignificant as it should be dignified and honorable . But this is not the whole of the unfitness of centralized ecclesiastical governments to conduct the affairs of a college . They are the most unstable portion of American society-the most likely to be rent asunder by internal convulsions . This is not an accidental circumstance , but results from the very nature of the case . All such ecclesiastical systems are , in this country , attempts to maintain a government without any power of forcibly compelling obedience . And yet they are governments which are continually in contact with the deepest and most sacred convictions , the most energetic emotions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They are thus // constantly awakening into life and energy powers which they are unable to controL They may and do legislate and command , but have no means whatever of compelling obedience . They may adjudicate , but they have no executive arm clothed with authority to compel submission to their decrees . They are precisely in the condition in which one of our State governments would be , if , with its legislature and judiciary constituted as at present , it were deprived of the right forcibly to compel obedience to its laws , and submission to the decrees of its courts . It would not be long , in such a state , before rival legislatures , rival courts , and rival executive officers , would be exercising their functions on the same territory , and in presence of each other ; and , in time , they would become as numerous as the rival ecclesiastical governments of our country ; and they would be multiplied by exactly the same process . This is the inevitable condition of all ecclesiastical governments , wherever liberty of conscience is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the rise of minorities , whose views and feelings are in irreconcilable conflict with those of the ruling majority ; and whenever this does happen , convulsion and disruption must and do ensue . To this liability all the centralized church governments of this country are constantly exposed . The church is indeed destined to perpetuity . It will be as lasting as the mediatorial reign of Christ . But no wise man can discern any signs of permanency in these ecclesiastical systems . All those arrangements which have been devised for hedging round the church with centralized governments , and marking the boundaries and perpetuating the divisions of rival Christian sects , sustain no vital relation to the life of the Church . They are confessedly man 's work . Who will contend for a moment that they are not ? And like all the other works of man , they are transient and perishable , like their author . Even while they last , they are as changeable as the drifting sands of the desert . Why then subject our seminaries of learning to the necessity of sharing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and of right ought to be , among the most permanent of our institutions ,  --  as permanent as our mountains*- // as perpetual as the springs which gush out among our hills . As they grow out of great permanent and distinct wants of society , they ought to stand on their own independent basis . Standing there , they encounter fewer popular passions , and are exposed to fewer causes of commotion and convulsion than any other portion of the body politic . They ought to be - with wise management they may be  --  the most permanent structures on earth , the Christian Church only excepted . Why then shall we insist on subjecting the permanent to the transient ? Why should we unite the destinies of our schools of learning to the changeful and uncertain fortunes of these ecclesiastical systems ? We can not therefore rely on institutions so governed and conditioned to furnish the needed facilities for liberal culture to a great continental republic . They must always be too changeful and unstable to be entrusted with an interest so precious and so permanent They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sect , rather than by that breadth and universality which are ever the attributes of liberal learning . Nor is it much better to place a college under a close corporation composed of men earnestly attached to a centralized ecclesiastical system , and pledged to be loyal to it in all their corporate transactions . The spirit of the sect will in such a case govern quite as absolutely and unrelentingly , as though the institution were directly under ecclesiastical control . Many attempts have been made to avoid at least the appearance of a narrow denominationalism , by selecting boards of trust from several denominations , and giving to no one denomination a majority of votes . This is perhaps the most unfortunate arrangement of all . The members of such a board of trust feel themselves to be the representatives and guardians of the interests of their several sects , and can never be forgetful of them . Sectarian jealousy never sleeps . The life of such a corporation is one long struggle for denominational ascendancy , or if an equilibrium of contending forces is sometimes apparently attained , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the interests of liberal learning are sacrificed to sectarian aims and ambitions ; and time will show that // what seemed to be harmony , was only a lull in the storm of sectarian conflict , till either the institution itself has been reduced to utter insignificance , or some one of the contending parties has gained an undisputed ascendancy . And while the conflict lasts , no class and no party has any confidence in the permanent usefulness of the institution . In the Northwest , one would think such experiments had been tried to the full satisfaction of all observant men . If there are any who believe that they have harmonized or can harmonize such conflicting elements in conducting the affairs of a seminary of learning , they are probably destined to learn by bitter experience how greatly they are mistaken . The millennium has not come yet . Is there then no firm ground anywhere in American society on which colleges can be securely founded , and reared up in strength and permanency , religious as the nature and wants of the human soul require they should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is there nothing on which we can build but the ever moving quicksands of secular and ecclesiastical politics ? To these very serious qn estions , if we were compelled to choose among the modes of organization we have thus far considered , we must sorrowfu*ly ,  --  mournfully-answer no . But we are shut up to no such necessity . Religious conviction , religious zeal , religious action , do not necessarily clothe themselves in the forms of ecclesiastical centralization , or bury themselves amid the rubbish of ecclesiastical politics . The words addressed by the sorrowing Son of God to Pilate are still true : " My kingdom is not of this world . " We must find the foundations for those seminaries of learning , which are to light the pathway of coming generations , in that kingdom of God which He thus characterizedin a religion which is moral and spiritual , and quite disentangled from all human politics . There are forms of religious belief the adherents of which are called " denominations , " and yet we have shown that their modes of social organization and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They have no organic , legislative , or judicial unity ; and therefore no ecclesiastical politics . They are zealous in propagating Christianity in all // lands ; but their conception of the success of their missions is , to persuade men to accept the moral and spiritual truths of Christianity , and not to extend over the proselytes they may win the jurisdiction of an organic church government . Their conception of the church of Christ is wholly moral and spiritual , and not organic . In all their missions , in all their philanthropies , their affections , their zeal , their sympathies , are expended upon Christianity regarded as truth and life , and not upon any ecclesiastico-political organisms . Such is Congregationalism , in its own acknowledged and recognized fundamental principles . In speaking thus of the Congregational system , we set up no claim of perfection for its adherents , either in the past or the present . In common with all Protestants they brought out of their Papal bondage many errors both of thought and practice which they could only be taught to abjure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In more instances than one they have sadly experienced the truth of the words of their own saintly Robinson , uttered two hundred and fifty years ago : " It is not possible the Christian world should come so lately out of such thick anti-Christian darkness , and that the full perfection of knowledge should break forth at once . " There may be in reserve for them other similar experiences in the future . But that detracts nothing from the truth or importance of what we have said . They are not bound to antiquated error by any human constitutions , courts , or systems of legislation . They are always ready for marching orders , and free to obey the word of command , whenever it shall be given , with no system of ecclesiastical politics to propagate , conserve , and defend . Such a system can not found and maintain denominational colleges after the style we have been considering . Its own nature forbids it It has no great national or universal organism to govern them , and to the interests of which they can be rendered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found colleges ( and no class of men on this continent have been so earnest and so successful as they in founding them ) , the colleges so founded will be conducted in no spirit of narrow sectarianism , but in the interest of that great system of spiritual // truth , which is the essence of Christianity , and is as universal as science . It can not be otherwise ; the nature of the system forbids . These deductions from the nature of the system , are abundantly corroborated by the facts of history ; Yale and Williams and Amherst and Middlebury and Bowdoin are known and recognized as Congregational colleges . In one of them-the most renowned and the most ancient of them all  --  a majority of the trustees are required by constitutional statute forever to be Congregational ministers . And yet those colleges have not been conducted in any spirit of sectarian narrowness . They enjoy to-day the confidence of the religious people of the nation , and that of all Christian denominations . Yale College probably graduates more Episcopalians than any Episcopal college in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unless it be Princeton , though Presbyterian churches are , in New England , few and far between . That reputation for broad , liberal , and generous culture which is drawing to the Congregational colleges of New England , and has been for generations , the choicest young men fr&amp;m every portion of our country , and from the adherents of all Protest . ant creeds , is no accident . It is a natural and logical outgrowth of those ecclesiastical and religious ideas which landed on this continent from the deck of the Mayflower . Those ideas logically adhered to have an unlimited power of founding and maintaining colleges , from the shores of Massachusetts Bay to the shores of the Pacific , which shall be religions but not sectarian . Nor has the Congregational system manifested this broad and unsectarian spirit alone in its Colleges , but equally in all its organizations for evangelization and philanthropy . The American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions originated with Congregationalists , and in the study of a Congregational pastor . It was purely an association for evangelization ,  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other names were joined with its Congregational founders in the work ; and the officers of the Board at Boston would never know what the denominational preferences of any missionary were , till informed of them from outside of Congregational lim von . xxx . 10 // its . Neither the constitution nor the spirit of that Board has changed . But their co-laborers from other denominations have conceived so strong a desire to extend their ecclesiastical organism along with the gospel , that they have withdrawn from the codperation and organized missions of their own , on strictly denominational principles . This may serve as a specimen . It is a fair specimen . The same is true of Congregationalism on the one hand , and of every form of centralized church government on the other , wherever and however they may have found occasion to manifest themselves . If then we would found and maintain , through all the Northwest , colleges which shall be religions but not in spirit and aim denominational , we can do nothing so good , as to place them under the control of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ecclesiastical and religious ideas from the Pilgrims of Plymouth ; and who conscientiously and consistently adhere to them . Such men , wishing to make the colleges they nurture handmaids of the Christian church as theq concewe of it , will conduct them just as men of like faith have conducted the colleges of New England ; they will imbue them as thoroughly as possible with the moral and spiritual truths of the gospel , and render them as broad and universal in their aims and their spirit , as the kingdom of Christ on earth . If there are any who regard Christianity itself as a narrow and exclusive sect ( and such there are ) - any who can be satislied with nothing but universal indifferentism , or the negation of all religion , they of course will regard the colleges which such corporations will found and maintain as very sectarian . To such persons we have only to say : be it so . It is impossible that fervent believers in the truth of Christianity , and zealous disbelievers of all religion , should have the same views of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ model . They must construct them according to their conception of the universe we live in ; we according to ours ; and posterity must judge of the structures we severally rear . This advantage then certainly have the Congregational churches of the Northwest for founding and maintaining colleges which shall be religious but not sectarian , that to the founding and rearing up of such colleges , those principles // 147 logically and inevitably tend , which they have received by tradition from their fathers , and of which they have shown their own appreciation , by adhering to them in the midst of difficulty and conflict and obloquy , in the new homes which they have made for themselves and their children , in that beautiful and goodly land of their adoption . They have not to resist their denominational tendencies , but logically and faithfully to obey them , and the desired result will follow . But this is not their only advantage , great as it is . A large proportion of the members of those churches are either natives of New England , or children of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all our national history , the home of cob . legiate education ; and her sons , wherever they are found , have been taught by ancestral precept and example to regard it with respect and honor . They may therefore be expected not to be behind any class of our population in aiding to found and sustain colleges , and to train their own sons to liberal learning . The fathers of New England founded their colleges , beneath the shades of the primeval forest , and within hearing of the sound of the woodman 's ax . And in all their migrations since , it has been a sort of instinct of their descendants , to found and to build the institutions of learning . As it is the instinct of the bee to build her curious cells , so that when a swarm settles upon a limb for a single night , something of their handiwork will be left behind when they take their departure in the morning , so has it been characteristic of the descendants of the Pilgrims , and of men of like faith to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have made their home in the American wilderness . It can not but be that this New England instinct is strong in the Congregational churches of the Northwest . It is also a great advantage enjoyed by the Congregational churches of the Northwest for successfully prosecuting this work , that New England not only has been but to a great extent still is the educator of the nation . 11 to-day , you would found a superior school anywhere between the Atlantic and the Pacific , you must go to New England , and especially to the New England colleges , for a supply of teachers ; just as those who want cotton goods , must go for them to the mannfacturing // towns where they are made . This gives to Congregationalists unequaled advantages , for readily obtaining the services of the best teachers the country affords . There is indeed no need of concealing the fact , that the seminaries of learning of the Northwest that are not built or governed by Congregationalists , are to a great extent under the teaching of men of New England birth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is quite wonderful to observe to how great an extent the teaching mind of the nation , not only in the schools and colleges , but in the Theological chair and in the pulpit , has come from the same source . The Congregational churches must certainly possess considerable advantages for applying and utilizing this vast superabundance of educating power , which New England is constantly generating . We can not therefore avoid the conviction that the Congregational churches of the Northwest do sustain peculiar relations to the cause of liberal learning , and are providentially charged with very peculiar and weighty responsibilities in respect to it . At least we can not avoid that conviction without shutting our eyes to the logical tendencies of that conception of the gospel and the church on which these churches are founded , and to the history of their principles , from the la*iding of the Pilgrims to the present hour . We confess too that this conviction gains in depth and strength with our years and our experience . If the Northwest is to be redeemed from the omnipresent reign of materialism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be blessed , through long coming generations , with institutions affluent of generous mental and aesthetic and moral culture , and imbuing millions and ages with its spirit and its benignant influence , these churches have a mighty work to do . They must be made to feel that they have something better to do , than merely to secure a place for their name and their form of church order among the swarming sects of the Northwest ; they must do such work as their fathers have done before them . They must even now in the struggles of their weakness address themselves to the work of founding and sustaining and nurturing into full maturity and vigor such provisions for the higher education , through all those vast regions of unequaled fertility and exuberant material resources , as their fathers made for New England and the // 149 whole Atlantic slope of the continent , when they founded Harvard and Yale and Williams and Amherst . If they will arise and prove their true Pilgrim lineage by doing such work as this for all the generations that are yet to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their right to be there , and to hand down to posterity their honored name . If they will not do this , the judgment of posterity will be unanimous , that they furnish no sufficient proof of their Pilgrim lineage . They will furnish sad evidence that they are " flu degeneri " of the Pilgrim Fathers , and have accomplished nothing to justify them in adding another to the already swarming sects of the Northwest . Congregationalists have suffered in this matter a sad disappointment . They have hoped and believed , that they could rear up such colleges as the Northwest needs by such denominational cooperation as that which formerly existed in the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions and the American Home Missionary Society . That dream is now dissipated ; let Congregationalists discern the signs of the times , and know that it was a dream , and cherish it no more : and let them address themselves , with loins girded , to the work of maintaining such simply Christian colleges as their principles call for , and as their fathers before them loved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any denominational considerations , but on the largeness of heart with which their work is conceived , on the substantial excellence of the institutions which they found , and on the generous liberality of the Christian public . If their churches enter on this work in this spirit millions yet unborn will rise up and call them blessed . We think also that there is a lesson on this subject to men of wealth and Christian liberality in all parts of our country . So far as any of the feeble and struggling colleges of the new States are founded on true principles , and managed by boards of trust that can be relied on faithfully and intelligently to adhere to those principles , there can be no fitter objects of Christian liberality than they . It is idle to say " the West is rich enough to build its own colleges . " Doubtless , but that is not the question . Do the men who are laboriously engaged in this work , and perhaps have worn out their lives in it , find it // possible to make that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that wealth greatly increases the urgency of the need , that those colleges should be nurtured into maturity and vigor , but renders no assistance in accomplishing it . In this state of the case , the fact that these infant institutions are already surrounded by wealthy and populous communities , is itself a good reason , why it should be regarded as a most excellent and wise liberality to help those men and those institutions in the great and difficult work they have in hand , arid in the success of which the nation and posterity are deeply interested . The wealthy men of a nation should be as far-reaching in the choice of the objects of their liberality , as they are in finding markets for their commodities , and the sources of their revenues . If the principles of this article are sound , Congregational men , and Congregational churches everywhere , should feel that they are , in an eminent sense , charged with the interests of education through all our national domain . They have been in an eminent sense the educators of the nation in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a no less eminent sense , in all the future .
