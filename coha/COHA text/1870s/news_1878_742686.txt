txt Representatives Herbert , House , and Hunton , of the committee charged with the consideration of the method of electing President and Vice-President , dissent from the plan Proposed by the majority . This plan proposes , in brief , to allow each State a number of electoral votes equal to the number of its Senators and Representatives in Congress , but to distribute pro rata these votes among candidates according to the popular vote . Each candidate for President and Vico-President is to have allotted to him his aliquot proportion of the electoral vote of every State in which he is voted for ; these , when counted and ascertained , must be forwarded to Washington , and the candidates having a plurality of the electoral votes shall be declared elected as President and Vice-President . The minority say - the majority , in their report , start out with the sweep ? ing assertions that our present electoral system has utterly failed ; that its oneration is inequitable ; that lit is arlstopratic in its nature , and was founded in distrust of the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " check upon the popular will . " The minority regard these as bold objections , and that they strike at the foundations on which are rested the right of local self-government in America , as does the amendment they are intended to support . Tho minority say that under the present system each political body , each State , has the right to speak for all its people . The proposed plan takes away ' from these political bodies ' the right to speak , each for all its people , and permits minorities to to speak to the whole United States , to have their voice heard here in the aggregate result , to become in ' effect voters of the United States instead of voters of the States . The right to speak by a majority , when its fundamental laws permit , is a right inherent in every Republic . The plan of the majority takes away from these republics ( the States ) this right to speak by their majorities , and confers upon the United States the right to say , by a majority of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President . Why should the right Of a majority in a State not be as sacred as the right of the majority of the whole United States I Why rob the States of this right and confer it upon the General Government 1 is it not too clear that this is simply another step toward consolidating the States out of sight in our system ? After reviewing the arguments of the majority , the minority say , in conclusion : " Wo do not concur with them that there is any widespread publid demand for such a plan as they present , or for any measure that would tend to mar the theory of our Government , obscure its origin and purpose , destroy the autonomy of the States , or rob them of any of their reserved rights . But the people do expect of the committee some measure for ascertaining and counting the votes . It was for want , of that , and that only , that the country was imperiled in 1876 . For that there is a demand , and we trust the committee will , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
