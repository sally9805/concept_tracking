txt Each post that comes to us from Japan brings seine fresh sign of the swift and wonderful changes with which that Empire is assuming the habits , the culture , and the industrial methods of the West . The ships of the Pacific Mail Company . and of the Peninsula and Oriental Company , are constantly bringing to New-York and London intelligent young Japanese , who come to study the language , the laws , the customs , and the manufactures of leading Christian nations . It is natural that the attention of these enterprising strangers should first be turned to the maritime Powers with which they have had most frequent and . intimate , if not always the most pacific , relations . It is equally natural that , if any such change be contemplated at all , the substitution of the English language for the Japanese should be thought preferable to any other . This last innovation  --  and we are assured that Mr. MORI . as well as others of the best informed among his countrymen , is fully persuaded it will be made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any record in history . The Saxons , a conquered people , with infinite difficulty and after centuries of resistance , accepted a composite speech , which to this day is largely composed of their own original tongue ; but here we have a race still independent , and probably able to remain so , deliberately proposing , for purposes of commercial and social convenience , to adopt an alien language , and to discard their own vernacular . There are , however , reasons for all things , and , with reflection , there will not be lacking reasons for the Japanese revolution . We are all apt to think that the change in that country is taking place , so to say , in a moment . ? So , indeed , it is ; but the causes that have led to the change have been at work for a very long time . Since the visit of MARCO Pow  --  the first European who , as far as we know , ever visited the Japanese Islands  --  six hundred years have rolled away ; and the people of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural to all races who breathe the air of the sea , have been heaping up knowledge of the Christian nations , their strength , disposition , and progress . The Portuguese , as usual , were the first to get a lodgment in Japan , and the Jesuits , as usual , followed them . After this , too , came the customary persecution of the Christians , the reaction from which is probably helping Japan forward in the path of civilization to-day . Driven out of the Empire in 1639 , the Portuguese were succeeded , so far as trade went , by the adventurous and thrifty Dutch ; and , in spite of frequent interruptions , the more sagacious Japanese of two hundred years ago discovered the advantages of a commerce which their descendants are now disposed to develop to the utmost . MENDEZ PINTO helped to build the railway from Yokohama to Yeddo , as well as the engineers who went out from Europe ten generations after him ; for the Japanese , unlike the Bourbons or the Chinese , are willing both to learn and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are now , reactionary and . obstructive elements in that country . The expedition of PERRI% the subsequent treaty of 1854 , the opening of the Ports to American and British commerce . were all steps that were met by strong opposition . In time , this opposition crystallized into active hostility , and the bold aggressions of the two Princes of NAGATo and SATSUMA , following after the murder of Mr. RICHARDSON and his companions in 1862-3 , led to active warlike measures  --  including the destruction of several Japanese forts and . strongholds hitherto believed impregnable -- which were , doubtless , strictly essential to strengthen the hands of the party of progress , and pave the way to the present . situation . The cross and the sword have preceded the railroad , the telegraph , and the sewing-machine ; and what is going on iu Japan might have been effected long since in China , but for the manifest radical differences between the capacities and idiosyncrasies of the two peoples . The great Embassy sent by the Tycoon to Washington . in 1860 , was the herald of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that era , but the struggle was fruitless . Shrewd mon foresaw the result , and there are living both Americans and Japanese , who then foretold that . in twenty years , Japan would bo in free commerce with all the world , and would have practically adopted the arts , customs , and appliances of modern Christian civilization . We are now in the midst of that predicted change ; and there is no doubt that , possibly restrained now and then by some little waves of reaction , the tide of progress will sweep on until the whole of the foreseen revolution shall have been accomplished . To the United States this interesting and extraordinary movement is of the highest importance . Japan , notwithstanding the intervening sea , is really our next-door neighbor . Oars was the first government to negotiate with her a treaty of comprehensive commercial alliance . The first Japanese Embassy ever sent from home was sent to Washington . America can furnish to Japan more quickly , cheaply , and in greater abundance , most of the commodities not found at home of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to add to the satisfaction with which Americans habitually regard the development of industrial activities throughout the world , they have , in the case of Japan , peculiar reasons for rejoicing in her new-born energy .
