A GLIMPSE AT SOME OF OUR CHARITIES . PART L " Wheucer a noble deed is wrought , Wheneer is spoken a noble thought , Our hearts , in glad surprise , To higher levels rise . " honor to those whose words or deeds Thus help us in our daily needs , And by their overflow Raise us from what is low I " HORACE MANN said , years ago , in one of those fine aphorisms which humortalize his idea , " Nudity and rags are only human idleness or ignorance out on exhibition . " Unhappily this sad exhibition still continues ; but it is only the body of Horace Mann which lies sleeping . The fervor for education of the people which he conjured up will not rest . Human idleness is only one form of human ignorance ; and although the rapid growing of our country finds us unprepared to meet the necessity , the minds of the people are at last awakened to the need , and are sure to move forward in the right direction . During the winter of 1867-68 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked of the New York Chief of Police the kindness to detail an efficient guide and guard to show him the way into the dark places of our city , that he might compare its condition , according to his own observation , with that of London . " And I assure you , " Dickens said to the writer of this paper , in his own forcible manner , " I can find nothing here to compare with the hopeless dens of London . It is bad enough , Heaven knows , but I see nothing which may not , if taken in season , be ameliorated , if not cured . " // These were no idle wor ( ls spoken by a novice in the art of observation of crime and wretchedness . The obscnre portions of London had been the study of his trained vision for the twelve later years of his life especially , and his active energies , his undying sympathies , his purse and his pen , were ever busy in the service of needy and suffering humanity . We would not convey the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we believe-poverty may ever be wiped out . Pray Heaven it may not be so ! If the poor sometimes need the rich , how much do the rich need the poor ? What pleasure can a whole hot-house of the rarest flowers afford , compared with the joy of putting a few roses into the hands of a sick girl lying in her unfurnished room ? We will re-assure ourselves from the words of the Master : " The poor ye have always with you . " Between six and seven millions of dollars a year are expended in benevolent work in the city of New Y6rk . These numbers are so large that , as we write them down , we turn to the statistics of the Bureau of Charities once more , to be quite sure there is no mistake . Unhappily a large part of this sum is every year absorbed in bricks and mortar . A " home " is no sooner proposed , a " society " is hardly organized , before the proposition is made to build . Surely this is beginning at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prove . The ni*ited observation of the most experienced in dealing with the suffering and uneducated always tends to show that the real growth of philanthropic work depends upon the amount of time devoted to it by good men and women whose united service is of especial value , and not upon the buildings the society has to show . Yet were these six or seven millions of'dollars all irrecoverably lost and sunk as in a pit in the bosom of the earth , we might still say to the donors , " Give once more ; we have paid this price for our experience. ** It is a happy office to be able to point out some of the beautiful effects of this benevolence , to show that there is no such pit , but in its place a wonderful garden where trees are found bearing fruit . In order to obtain any idea either of the needs of the poor , or of the methods of relieving them now in operation in America , our observation should extend itself in two directions . Our first interest should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to observe some of the details of benevolent work as now carried on . With regard to organization , our first feeling will probably be that of surprise at the youthfulness of this undertaking . As early as 1855 Mrs. Jaineson wrote these words for England : " There exists at the core of our social condition a great mistake to be corrected and a great want supplied : men and women must learn to understand each other and work together for the common good before any amount of permanent moral and religious progress can be effected , and , in the most comprehensive sense of the word , we need Sisters of Charity every where . " America waited for her great war for freedom before learning she had a work to do . When at last our young men died to abolish slavery and save the Union , we said to our selves if not to " not each other , They shall die in vain . " From that moment we knew we had a country to work for and to save . The care of our soldiers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ladies with " slopwork " women who were making soldiers ' shirts too badly for them to wear , under government contract , and who were taught to sew them over by hundreds of thousands at the cost of private purses and untiriiig voluntary labor-this acquaintance with the " ( langerous classes , " then first made general , was seed grain , which seems likely to ripen into permanent advantageous growth both to giver and receiver . A new class of amen was created or developed by our war - men scarcely suited , after four years of camp life , to take up with the sober ways of a mercantile community : dashing young officers from Europe , who freely declared they came over to " keep their hand in " at fighting , and the superannuated Irish laborer , who felt his old blood glow once more like that of the war-horse at the sound of the trumpet , and forthwith colored his beard and submitted his stanch old ribs to be thumped by the surgeon in order to be pronounced of fit ag* to enter the army . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the body-politic . The face of society was changed . Many cultivated womcii made a high place for themselves in that hour of affliction . Then the voice of Mrs. Livermore was first heard , then Mrs. Howe wrote her best poems , and other women , whose names it would be invidious to mention , showed the highest executive ability , proving themselves fine nurses , or soothing and comforting by their noble presence those who were weak or faint-hearted . It is true great examples were not wanting before our war . Mrs. Browning and Miss Martineau were at the height of their fame ; Miss Niglitimigale 's shadow had been already kissed by the poor soldier at the Crimea ; Agnes Jones was at work in her poor-house duties ; but the fact had not yet made itself clear to every woimman among us thai3 " Lives of great men all remind us We may mnake our lives sublime . " This was only understood when the pressure of cruel necessity pushed them to the front . Then first they learned the value of organization . Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the squire 's on committee-meeting night , when they talked over the subject as to how many boxes could be sent to Washington in the next fortnight from their village- " she took hold so ! " We discovered by experience then the significance of the old saying that " the figure one standing by the side of one makes eleven . " In view of this experience and of our country 's need , a plan was conceived by Miss Louisa Lee Schuyler , of New York , of such value not only to our State , but to every State in the Union* that whoever has the welfare of humanity at heart can not fail to bestow upon it the closest consideration . In Miss Schuyler 's report of March 1 , 1873 , nearly one year after she had first organized a society under the name of the State Charities Aid Association , she calls upon our citizens to aid each other , not against arale ( l men , but against the army of paupers who have come from Europe , and , like the grasshoppers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one season . We propose in as few words as possible to give some idea of what this great need is for which Miss Schuyler asks the co-operation of our citizens . In brief we find this country threatened with the curse of Europe-hereditary pauperism . But we will quote from Miss Scianyler 's report with respect to the facts : " Our whole poor-law system is an inheritance from England , and unless we change it , the results will also be the same . Already in New York State , out of a population of between four and five milliOns , over 200,000 are supported either wholly or in I ) art by public money , or one out of every twenty-three persons wholly or partially supported by the others . " No*v when we remember that this computation deals merely with paupers , or the unfortunate who have come upon the public institutions , and leaves out as impossible to estimate the unfortunate or less fortunate members of everylarge family who are supported by the rest , friends who by illness or misfortune become the first care of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of large cities mitigated by friendly gifts and visits , it will readily be seen that if this evil be allowed to grow , it will soon be too large for us to handle , and ehe sore will either fester and putrefy the State , or civilization must be crippled and retarded by the funds of the community being sunk in this vast waste heap . Happily the organization of Miss Schuyler has brought an association of men and women together which is grappling successfully with this great subject . Ia order to state the leading points of this measure , we will continue to quote from this first annual report of the State Charities Aid Association , addressed to the Board of State Commissioners of Public Charities of the State of New York : " The objects of our work are of a twofold nature . 1st . To promote an active public interest in the New York State institutions of public charities , with a view to the physical , mental , and moral improvement of their pauper inmates . 2d . To make the present pauper system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it as may be in accordance with the most enlightened views of Christianity , science , and philosophy . " " We have divided our work into three departments , representing a threefold division of the pauper class . as follows : children , adult able-bodied paupers , and the inmates of hospitals . The latter division includes the sick , the insane , blind , deaf and dumb , idiot , inebriate , and aged panpers . " The first question in starting an association for such a work was how to make is supplementary to the duties of State authorities , truly a " Charities Aid , " and not a body antagonistic or interfering either in act or spirit . Fortunately a slow-growing recognition of the need of such assistance for the State had already dawned on the mind of the government when Miss Schuyler came to its assistance . A quarter of a century before , Miss Dix had reported upon " the deplorable condition " of our county poorhouses . In 1857 a select committee , going over much the same ground , reported : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the paupers in some of these institutions . " In 1865 Dr. Willard rendered similar testimony , and it was still two years later before the Board of State Commissioners of Public Charities was appointed , " composed of eight persons , who serve without compensation , " whose business it is to visit every institution receiving State aid at least once in two years , and report upon the same to the Legislature , " with such advice and suggestion as may conduce to practical measures of reform . " This first step of the Legislature came not a moment too soon . The company of eight persons struggled under its burden unassisted for the period of two years . At the end of that time they report , in 1869 , " little interest taken by citizens in the counties in the coaadition of the poorhouses , and we attribute in a great degree to this apparent indifference the miserable state into which these houses have fallen . Though we make a strong and urgent appeal to the benevolent to look into the condition of the poor , yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any response by that class of persons . " What could the public do ? As will be seen later , even when working with authority , the visitors who went to observe abuses were sometimes insulted by the managers . The time was not yet come . On the 11th of May , 1872 , " in the hope of helping to create this active public interest in our State institutions of charities , " and to act in accordance with the views of the // " It shall be the duty of the Committee on Children to inform itself of the number , present condition , plan of education , and ultimate disposition of the children in the reformatories of this State and in the State institutions of pnhlic charities . It shall be the duty of this committee to urge upon the community the very great importance of enforcing such enlightened measures in the care and training of these children as may tend to effectually destroy hereditary pauperism in this State , and to best enable them to become useful citizens and good men and'women . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paupers to ascertain time number of ablebodied pauper men and women supported in the almshouses of this State , and the character and value of the labor , if any , performed by them . It shall be the endeavor of this committee to have work-houses erected ; to have the laws for the arrest and commitment of vagrants enforced ; to relieve the industrious members of the community from the support of the idle ; to uphold the dignity of labor ; and in a country where work can always he obtained , to take such measures as shall tend to abolish beggary and vagrancy . " It shall he duly of the Committee on hospitals : " 1st . To inform itself of the number and present condition of the sick , the inebriate , insane , hilud , deaf and dumb , idiot , and aged paupers in the New York State institutions of public charities , and to urge the adoption of such measures as are best adapted to secure the health , alleviate the sufferings , secure the humane care and comfort , and contribute to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2d . To collect and impart information in regard to the latest and most improved plans for the construction , ventilation , and disinfection of hospitals and asylums ; to prepare plans of or*anization for their kitchen , linen , laundry , and nursing departments ; and to acquaint themselves with such hygienic and sanitary regulations as are in accordance with the most advanced views of the medical profession . ' qwq remember the recent date of its birth . Some account of the bhginning is here laid very briefly before you , and we pray , in view of the large result , which shall speak for itself , that not only the work may be increased in New York , but that other States shall follow , and Boston at least , which loves not to be behind in good work , shall lead the way for Massachusetts . The success of the Elberfeld system , the valuable suggestions of Mrs. Jameson , the example of Miss Nightingale , and the practical living work of Miss Octavia Hill paved the way for Miss Schuyicr , and after the signal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should never be allowed to pause or fail in these United States . Sir Arthur Helps puts it into the mouth of one of his Friends in Council to say , in reference to the petty ambition which seems to beset women as well as men to start new projects : " I wish that men would devote themselves to furthering the projects and aims of some man who is greater than themselves , or at least umore suggestive . " Ellesmere replies : " Well , since I have formed one of the Friends in Council I have heard many vast propositions put forward , but never any like this . Are you aware that most people are rather vain ? And yet you want them to devote themselves to a kind of hero-worship , the heroes being alive , and having only made sensible propositions . " I can hardly do better than to quote a few words from Mr. E. L. Pierce 's report of the Massachusetts State Board of Charities , describing the plan of working at Elberfeld . Miss Schuyler has substantially adopted the same idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " The characteristic idea of the system is , that it establishes a very minute and constant superrision , carried on by unpaid visitors of the best class . The result has been that in 1852 , with a population of over 50,000 inhabitants , 4000 paupers were relieved at a cost not exceeding $44,000 . Although the population increased , yet the number of paupers and the cost of relief largely diminished as soon as the system was put in operation , so that in 1869 , with 71,000 inhabitants , only about 19,000 were expended , and the number of paupers had fallen to 1062 . " Nothing so general as this thorough system of investigation has yet been thought out for the great world of New York city , but Miss Schuyler 's plan is far-reaching , and possesses every possibility within its scope . Equal room is given to founding new projects or supporting the old , the main idea of co-operation lying at the root of the whole . The work of the association is divided , as These are the words of a portion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the frame-work . However interesting and useful it naight be to give still further particulars of Miss Schuyler 's organization , we dare not pause here , but must pass on to the end of the first year , that we may see what work has really been done , and how it has been done . Before twelve months had passed , six local visiting committees had been organized , numbering in all 150 persons . " They are , with the exception of some thirty advisory members , all active , earnest workers , visiting regularly and systematically , once a week or once a fortnight , time ward of the hospital ol : the department of the almshonse assigned them . Our visitors belong to no one political party , to no one creed . We are anen and wonaen working together , supplementing each other 's powers , with the one object of helping and elevating our poorer classes . " Four of these six visiting committees were hardly more than organized , and could therefore render no account of work , when the first report was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most valuable , and should not be emitted. // The first was a committee for visiting the Westchester County Poor-house , and contained forty-nine members ; the second , for Bellevue Hospital , New York city , with fifty-three members . We will endeavor to give a picture in brief of affairs at the Westchester poor-house during the year and the result of the first twelve months of labor . It was proposed to visit this institution every fortnight , and , without assuming any authority in the management ( for this they did not possess ) , they hoped to work with the superintendents of the poor for the greater comfort of the inmates . " For the sake of insuring harmony of action , they met the superintendents once a month at the poor-house . So long as the ladies were contented to work themselves , and make no criticism upon the management of the institution , every thing moved on smoothly . But in the course of visiting they became aware of many things needing immediate reform-an absence of classification , which led to gross immorality ; a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sick ; the children badly fed , badly clothed , badly taken care of , and exposed to the degrading influence of those in immediate charge of them . ' * The details of evils induced by lack of care and nursing in the poor-house may be found in the report of the voluntary visitors . They are almost too painful and necessarily too diffuse to he reproduced in these pages . Wasting children , neglected paralytics , were seen day by day ; and when suggestions for reform were made to the superintendents , they were listened to with apparent civility , but were utterly disregarded . Finally the visitors . were turned out altogether , and it was only after an appeal to the Board of Supervisors of the county and a delay of many months , and ultimately by an act of the Legislature , that the ladies were allowed to resume their duties , armed with sufficient authority to wipe out some of the cruel wrongs they had been forced at first to witness in silence . Let us turn now to the report of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospital visiting are not based on returns of boards who " walked through these buildings once a year , or once a month , or once a week ; " but in Bellevue Hospital , for example , " Each of the twenty-nine wards has been visited every week , the same visitors for the same ward , by ladies whose experience iu the supervision of their own households has made them experts as regards washing , the care of linen , cooking , nursing the sick , etc . They go often enough to know every patient in the ward , to study the character of the person in charge , to know what the work of the ward is and how well it is done ; they go in the morning , in the afternoon , at meal-times , sometimes one day , sometimes another . They write an account of every visit in hooks kept for the purpose . Each 1 ) 00k is the history of the condition of that ward and its inmates for the past year . There were , to be sure , weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absence from the city , lint the whole number of visits average at least one visit a week to every ward . It is much to the credit of the city Comniissioners of Charities that , fully aware what such a searching examination must result in , how it must necessarily bring to light abuses of which they could not otherwise know , but which would reflect upon their management , they freely and generously threw open the wards of the hospital , and from first to last have cordially welcomed our visitors , have listened to and acted upon their suggestions , and have furthered their plans in every way . The Commissioners have themselves told us there were many household duties in a large hospital only understood by women , and they would gladly avail themselves of the help we lied to offer . ' It is hard to believe the report of the condition of the New York hospitals when the ladies of the State Charities Aid Association first began their work . Lack of space , no decent washing , no soap , no proper nursing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an every-day story . By means of a Training School for Nurses , and by careftal weekly visiting , radical changes have been effected , and every month cheering accounts are given of improvements . The Training School for Nurses is worthy of mention as a most important good accomplished . The school was opened in May , 1873 , at Bellevue Hospital , with a lady superintendent , and a staff of six nurses , who passed through their two years ' course of practical study at that great hospital , and graduated with credit They were immediately followed by other classes , and now more applications for admission from excellent women in all parts of the country are received than the managers can accept . The nurses go to attend the sick in private families , in hospitals , and are sent by the Board of Health to the poor . They have been found a blessing every where . Many who formerly resisted the suggestion to call in a nurse now eagerly seek them , and surgeons in certain instances have refused to perform operations without the aid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There seems no doubt of the future high development of this new means of good . We are compelled by lack of space to add nothing to these simple statements to prove the value of the first year 's work of Miss Schuyler 's organization . But we will stay to look at the result of the second year 's labor , to be quite sure there is growth as well as usefulness in her plan . On the 1st of March , 1874 , we find " the most enlightened and influential members of the community , men and women , have enrolled themselves for active duty ; those who have never worked before in a systematic way ; those whose time is the most precious thing they have to give . " This powerful body recognize deeply the importance of a moveuient whose highest end is " the study of pauperism with a view to its reduction . " However beautiful any branch // of charitable work may be made , however iniportant it is to nurse the sick , to care for the unfortunate , what can compare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? A reduction of pauperism by oivinr useful labor to the idle sendino ' boys to Western farms and girls to house-work or skilled needle-work , would soon do much to empty hospitals , poor-houses , work-houses , station-houses , and refuges for the unfortunate . If no comfort had been given by these visitors of the association , no food to the sick , no instruction to the ignorant , during these past twelve mouths , the making plain this one great truth , that the most important labor before our people " is the study of pauperism with a view to its reduction " - this clearing up and clearing away of despair by a diagnosis of the disease-should be sufficient reward , if any were needed , to the organizers of this measure . In order to show the necessity for more general organization from another point of view , let us turn to the report of the Bureau of Charities for the city of New York . " It may be mentioned that one person was found to be on the list of nine societies at once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one house , a regular system of barter and sale of relief tickets exists . " " Furniture will be removed from room to room , and medicine bottles placed conspicuously about , to deceive the unwary or inexperienced visitor . " This is by no means the sad part of the lack of proper organization and investi , , ation . Who would not rather give twice to the wrong person , if the right one were at last provided ? but , alas ! if the money go wrong , there is none left for the deserving . For instance , the amounts supplied even to assured cases of suffering from the city bureau or charitable societies are extremely small . In the case quoted as one where relief was given by nine different societies to the samu person , the whole sum received was only eight dollars ; and the writer of this paper is cognizant of the case of a widow with children in great need who was presented by an acknowledged authority to the Cliardon Street Bureau of Charity in Boston , and received only two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the report of the New York Bureau of Charities we read , " It is evident with the present want of system , great individual suffering can exist ; in fact , a family might starve before it could be relieved . " Surely this is inexpressibly sad , and the end of such folly and injustice should be near at hand . But to return to the State Aid Association . One joyous feature of this organization is its hopefulness , and upon this point we would especially insist in speaking of the benevolent work of our country . There is room for all  --  a place for each one . We read in their second report : " When we contrast the hopelessness of so many wouldbe reformers in the older countries with the moral power possessed by the individual here , is not our faith in our republican institutions more than ever strengthened ? " It would be impossible for us , in spite of the intense interest this subject excites , to follow this energetic body of more than a thousand workers  --  a body which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some idea of the scope of its labor may be derived from the fact that its active committees exist in every county of the State , the last annual report containing detailed accounts of the condition and improvement of local institutions from eight of these committees . Subsidiary organizations for out-door relief have been formed in Newburgh , Rochester , and elsewhere with success , and several cities in other States are copying the plans of the association in the treatment of their own poor . Its influence is thus being very widely felt , and its success is so assured that the association ought no longer to be called an experiment . Little need be added here to the valuable facts we have quoted with regard to the importance of sustaining the work of the State Charities Aid Association . Here is employment for all , suited to every age and every capacity-for the inexperienced as well as the experienced , for the delicate as well as for the strong . On the corps of the Flower Mission , or in the ranks of those needed to read to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even the most tender girl might serve , and learn , perhaps , through the cultivation of her sympathies as well as of her intelligence , how by-and-by to take a still larger part in this great service . Neither , let us hope , will it be " damnable iteration " if , in the face of such a noble association , which has cost the whole strength of many lives to bring into its present working order , an association which can employ in one or other of its three great branches all the time and all the money which may be unselfishly brought into it for the highest good of the State-in the face of all this , we venture to repeat the warning of every report we open upon benevolent work , and of every earnest address from those who have had experience , " that the public should support those private charities which apply the labor test ; " that " there is a large class who make begging a tr* de , or who will only do such work and at such wages as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most , there is the greatest amount of panperismn and crime . " Let us turn now to observe the working of some of the independent charitable societies , which , in the absence of State censorship , work on , . sometimes wisely , sometimes // blindly , and thus far , in the aggregate , without apparently lessening in the smallest degree the weight of misery which overwhelms our crowded cities . The relieving of the wants of the few seems to attract a new crowd of paupers , of whom the census shows an increase rather than a decrease . ST . JOHN 'S GUILD , a volunteer society of New York city-office , 52 Variek Street . Of the 194 charitable institutions in the city of New York , not including ninety-two branch establishments , let us choose this large volunteer organization among the very few we can visit together on these pages . This large number of institutions represents " almost every known agency for meeting and supplying the material wants of a vast mixed population like that of New York . " Naturally the question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does so ranch distress still exist ? - " why are such terrible cases of poverty , suffering , and starvation brought forward from time to time in the papers and by individuals I and why there seems so much difficulty in the way of adequately relieving urgent distress , and of directing the sufferers to the proper agencies of relief l " The only rational answer to these perfectly unavoidable questions is that the methods of relief must sometimes be mistaken ones . Pauperism must occasionally be created where the benevolent intention of the giver was simply to alleviate poverty . An examination to this end was made in New York last season , and a computation made of the thousands of idle persons attracted by the free soup-houses and lodging-houses . The particulars may be found in the report of the American Social Science Association , and the result of that one winter 's experience many well serve as a warning to other cities . Let us now return to St. John 's Guild , and observe what is done under that organization . First , we find a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age , bringing money to the amount of $32,700 for one year , and goods of every description , giving their ofli*rings into the hands of one man , the Rev. Alvali Wiswall , who signs himself " Master . " This great responsibility is shared , of course , by either Andrew XV . Legget or Henry C. De Witt , one of these gentlemen being the so - called " almoner " ( or distributer , according to Worcester 's Dictionary ) of the Guild ; but as the name of the first appears on the title-page , and the name of the last at the foot of the accounts , it is not clear who really acts in this position . Besides these two officers , the names of only two men appear , those of the excellent women who , we presume , give their time and money , and should give the weight of their names , to the society , not appearing on these pages . One of these men holds the subordinate position of " warden , " the other that of " clerk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labors of Mr. Wiswall must be , understanding as we all do the difficulties which beset the minds of the wisest and most experienced with regard to these complicated questions of relief-questions which are of such vast importance to the welfare of the community . How these difficulties are settled , and to what end the public money is used , can readily be seen by referring to the pages of a recent report . " Ladies and gentlemen " are here referred to as those who assist in the distributing of the funds and the visiting of the sick , but no nanmes are given , and no special reports are ever rendered . " Tenement-house inspection is ordered in times of distress , " but who are ordered to make the inspections , or how thoroughly the labor is done , does not appear . In all this the need of detail is so great as almost to vitiate our faith in the completeness of a labor which , if well done , would be one of the difficult achievements of our age . Miss Octavia Hill has indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already become famous throughout the English-speaking world . During the past year upward of $10,000 were distributed in groceries among the poor , and other necessaries of existence in like proportion , by the Guild . " Unemployed clerks " received gifts to the amount of about $2000 in money , without any recorded service in return . The beautiful and truly self-sacrificing labors of physicians in connection with the Guild see*n to be beyond praise . Indeed , it is with a feeling of sadness that we see how much more they give , in proportion , than the rest of the community . " Time is money , " said Franklin ; hut a physician 's time is often all the money he has . The names of six physicians , " one or more of whom are in daily attendance at the Guild , " are given , and the whole sum received by them during the year is stated to be $584 66 . " Time poor are charged nothing either for attendance or medicines . " The sum of $477 74 is paid for the rent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done , this room being used altogetber by ladies , who cut and make garments for the naked and the sick . In spite of their continued and utmost endeavor , the need seems rather to increase than to diminish , and continual appeals for assistance and heart-rending descriptions of " eases " appear in the New York newspapers . Meanwhile between three and four thousand dollars are paid out in rent for " widows and others " - surely a large sum of money , considering that this society can show only forty-three dollars as earned by this same class . We know the need is all here ; we know the sums of money are small // in comparison with the suffering ; yet what " visitor " intrusted with the hard-earned money of others to give away , or even when acting as steward of the superfluity of the rich , has not often felt the difficulty of knowing how to give ' ? A few days since a friend saw a woman in the street during the coldest weather , covered only with two cotton garments . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few cents , saying she would go the next day to see her . She found the woman , when she called , dead drunk upon the floor , and was told by the neighbors that her appetite for driuk was such that she was in the habit of exposing herself with as little clothing ns decency would allow in the severest cold for the sake of getting a bit of money to fill her bottle when it was empty . It was our privilege to go one day with Charles Dickens to the East End of London . It was a quarter where formerly much coaling was done upon the river , hut some change in the current had caused the vessels to be carried elsewhere . Such hopeless , helpless poverty may the Lord never send to our shores ! Certainly there is none such here now . " I wish you to observe , " said Dickens , " how these people receive me , and then remember I have never given them one penny . " Wonderingly we followed him , and any thing more touching than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in exchange for his sympathy we have never seen . They were sure he was doing his utmost . Somewhere and somehow they felt he was putting his shoulder to the wheel , and light must follow the sunshine of his presence . Poor creatures ! We hope they make a part of the favored ten thousand for whom Octavia Hill is spending her life . One branch of the labors of the Guild is that of the sick children 's summer excursions . A floating hospital for mothers with sick children was established in the summer of 1873 , and eighteen or twenty excursions are made during the warm weather . Surely this is a most beneficent work , and we pray the ladies and gentlemen of New York , when summer returns , to visit the Master of the Guild , and to assist him in rendering his organization as perfect as possible . He calls upon no sect and no class in particular ; therefore is the work open to all . Aud during coining winters we pray him , in face of the impossibility of feeding all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be fed , to teach the women how to make clothes instead of making them for them , and , above all , to teach the children , in order that they may help their parents , and to gather together the growing boys , for whom the great West is always crying , " Give ! give ! " Our farms every where are needing women as well as men . Why , then , do we let them starve upon the cold pavements of our cities ' ? Let five of the ten thousand dollars spent in small groceries be expended in sending men and women and little ones where they shall learn to know they too are God 's children , and have a place in the world . THE hOLLY-TREE COFFEE-ROOMS . As the cold weather approached , in the autumn of 1870 , it was observed in Boston that although there was a great talk made about temperance in the Legislature , intemperance among the poor was on the increase . In the streets where ladies were wont to do their shopping , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were plenty of restaurants , where , at certain hours , excellent food was to be obtained at two or three times the market price , as may be seen in every large city . But in the poorer streets , in the avenues chiefly frequented at half past six in the morning by sewing-women hurrying to their tasks , and by teamsters already started on their long routes , no thing decent in the way of food or drink could be obtained , and what was offered could be found only at certain hours . At every corner , of course , whiskey , brandy , and gin were given out at a moment 's notice , with hot or cold water , or none at all ; and for the price of ten cents the half-chilled driver or woman , who had left home , perhaps , in the gray dawn with little enough to eat , was made to feel warm and comfortable . Surely the thought was not a new one that " if you want to conquer a vice or a bad habit , you must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Probably there is no vice for which the truly benevolent are so filled with compassion as for this one of drunkenness . Men can not divest themselves of the feeling that somehow it is more or less their fault that their brother has failed , and it is this feeling which has given a partial success even to the most violent and extraordinary means for its prevention . But there was nothing either violent or extraordinary in this new measure . One small coffee-room was soon opened in close proximity to many drinking shops on a crowded thoroughfare . The place was made bright and clean ; hot coffee and tea of good quality were found ready at all hours for five cents a cup , and a few necessary articles of food were furnished at the lowest possible prices . The rent of the place and the furnishing were paid for by friends interested in the experiment ; but " as a power-loom will go on worklug at the same kind of cloth without intermission , or a printing-machine will turn out an en ( hless quantity of one newspaper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few ordinary articles of food be cooked and served up on a gigantic wholesale // plan at the merest shade of profit over the first cost of the articles . " Thus it was that the first little coffee-room was firmly established before two months were over , and a decided change became visible in its vicinity . Others sprang up , not only in Boston , but in many other places , large and small . It was soon seen that , " properly conducted , these coffee-rooms will pay-pay the interest of capital risked , cover outlays of every kind , and that by resorting to them working-men will feel that , while being fairly served , they really pay for all they get , and are in no manner of way treated as paupers . " Indeed , these shops run their own business so entirely that a cursory observer was heard to say , " I do n't see why they call that a charity . " Perhaps this speech was as high a tribute as the work could receive . But only a beginning has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shops and better ones opened in the lower parts of all our cities , where men in the evening and on Sundays should find papers , " harmless games , which are the surest modes of recreation , " and a decent , comfortable corner to talk with a friend . We are stopping too soon with this labor onlyjust begun . There is a bare show of closing the drinking shops for a few hours on Sunday morning , but for the rest of the day and night their lights flare out , and draw in the cold and the unwary , as the summer lamp will draw the silly moths . The Hollytree Coffee-Rooms are a suggestion for something more to be accomplished . The cooking d6p6ts established by Mr. Corbett at Glasgo*v are the best examples of this plan . They are described in Good Words for December , 1862 , and January , 1863 . Mr. Corbett himself writes as follows with respect to them : " The Glasgow cooking d6p6ts do not fall under the category of charities , at all events , directly . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all along been conducted , on the strictest business principles-with the determination to make them thoroughly self- supporting . The success has been so great that the net profits placed at my disposal amount to upward of*10,000 , which , in carrying ont my principle of conducting the institution entirely on public grounds , I have had the pleasure of appropriating entirely to charitable objects All articles of ordinary cooked provisions , such as a cup of tea or coffee , bowl of sot or broth , bread and butter , plate of l ) potatoes , etc. , are supplied at the fixed and uniform rate of one penny . Of such rations there are npward of 30,000 sold daily . " hOMES FOR THE POOR For twenty-five years the thoughts of the wise and the benevolent have been exercised upon this subject . The narrow island on which New York is built was long ago crowded to suffocation on its lower end . In VOL . LvI. - No. 333-29 its struggle for air it has pushed itself out into Brooklyn andJersey City , and is stretching almost indefinitely up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nucleus remains as black as ever . We have been told of one ward of the city ( we think the Eleventh ) which covers an unusually small area , and is said to contain 80,000 inhabitants . This is probably a rude estimate , but it expresses to the mind the appearance of the district , crowded and swarming as it is with human life . Who can forget those painful letters , printed in the New York Tribune only four or five years ago , describing the fearful condition into which these tenement-houses had fallen , which had been visited by the reporter ? Or who can cease to be grateful for that paper by Dr. Henry J. Bowditch , of Boston , printed in the report of the Massachusetts State Board of Health for 1871 , recording his own inspection of homes for the poor , both in London and in Boston ? The work of the latter has been fruitful of good result . Dr. Bowditch is not a man to see a great evil and sit down idle before it . Although Boston is so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon which it is built , and its peninsular form , tend to bad drainage of the streets , and crowding together of its inhabitants . Emigrants have dropped into holes , as it were , and burrowed in them , until these pestiferons districts , if not as wide in extent as in Ne* York , seem quite as bad . London is not unworthy of study by those hopeful of reform for our large cities . With regard to building tenement-houses , a slight mistake in judgment in choosing the site , in internal arrangements , in the price of rents , may make , as we see there , the difference between comparative failure and success . Mr. Peabody , Miss Coutts , Sir Sydney Waterlow , and Mr. Allan have erected noble bnildings , but with varying results ; and the greatest success , after all , seems to have been achieved with very little money , comparatively , through the extraordinary personal influence of Miss Hill , who sums up the observations she has made upon this subject by saying , " Health more often depends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ construction and appliances . " This subj ect of the homes in which our poor dwell can not fail to be a peculiarly painful one . The slight progress made in improvement thus far , in spite of reports repeatedly published , does not look encouraging for the future . But we remember , happily , that only a few years have l ) assed since Dr. Bowditch gave his report to the public of the condition of Boston , and his study of the efforts made in London for better habitations for the poor . Our perfect faith in the " Peculiar philanthropy and benevolence " of our fortunate classes leads us to believe that the end even of this evil may also one day be // reached . In the city of Boston alone-and we take Boston for example , partlybecanse it is more strictly measurable than New York , and partly because there is in that city an organized attempt for relief : , founded upon Dr. Bowditch 's observations - there were sixty-four separate localities specified in the annual report of the State Board of Health for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no means included all , yet this report was published three years after the State was made aware of these pest-holes . The list is somewhat changed from that rendered in 1870 , but it is no shorter . An attempt was made nearly twenty-five years ago in Boston to prevent the crowding of the poor by building excellent tenement-houses upon improved methods of the adjustment of space , and admission of light and air , in desirable quarters of the city . Similar enterprises have been entered into in Brooklyn , where the best sanitary and hygienic conditions were secured by the tenants at a less rate than they could secure the same space for any where else . The , houses immediately became a perfect success commercially , and the vast number of applications received proved how great a want was thus partially met . But as we have seen by the foregoing , or as we may have learned perhaps by some experiences of our own , the end of decent homes for the poor can not be obtained in that way alone . Miss Octavia Hill 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one lever by which order may be brought out of chaos . It is impossible in the range of this article to give a full picture of her labors , but the main features of her work will be understood , we think , if we should suppose a lady of our acquaintance to buy one of the worst dens at Five Points or in North Street , and become the landlady of such tenements , taking her chance of the thieves and cut-throats who haunt these localities . No go-between is employed , the lady calls weekly for her own rents . She gives no charity , but by her attempts to give the people work and to further their welfare inspires confidence in her sympathy . This is Miss Hill 's plan , and the details of her success are worthy the profound study of every man or woman who desires to help the needy and unfortunate . Philadelphia is the paradise of workingmen . That city seems to bear the palm not only for comfortable tenements , but for cooperative companies , which work great advantage to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the good ends achieved by the Centennial Exhibition was a more extended knowledge of the humanity and wisdom of Philadelphia in this particular . The phrase " poor working-man " is hardly known in that favored city . Mr. Josiah Quincy , who has labored most earnestly for a better condition of the working people , says he was long ignorant of the cause of this desirable state of the laboring-men of Philadelphia , until he discovered that there existed within its limits five hundred loan and building associations . Apart from new tenement-houses for the poor , there was started in Boston , as a direct result of Dr. Bowditch 's efforts , in April , 1872 , the Boston Co - operative Building Company , in order to ascertain , by some well-considered experiments , by what methods , profitable enough to be readily followed , comfortable and healthy dwellings for working people could be furnished in and near Boston . Three such experiments , namely , the hiring , the buying , and the building of tenement-houses , have been entered upon . Perhaps the most interesting act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called the Crystal Palace . This building was selected " as the abode of filth , robbery , drunkenness , and prostitution . Under the rule of the company the following excellent results have been obtained : The building outside , instead of being a disgrace to the street by its filthy look , has a neat appearance . It has changed its name , and now instead of the name of contempt , Crystal Palace , ' it is styled the Lincoln Building . Before the corporation entered , riot , disorder , and arrests for drunkenness and family broils were of constant occurrence . All is now chanted . The trade of the police is virtually gone . The chief of the district reports that during two months he heard of no complaints there . The grogshop that had existed from the time of the erection of the building was swiftly swept away . A Holly-tree Coffee-House has taken its place . The basement tenements were shut up immediately after the company took possession . Very large shafts have been cut through all the floors , with ventilators above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air have now a sufficiency of both . " We should add here what is not , perhaps from motives of modesty , laid down in the report , that the true success of the Lincoln Building is founded upon the plan adopted from Miss Hill 's example of " organized work . " This building and a few others in Boston are visited by two or three ladies with an energy , self-devotion , and persistency , as well as tact , sure to bring success in the end . " What a small world it is ! " Dickens used to say sometimes , laughingly , when time same people would turn up in widely different places ; and so we reiterate again and again the same idea as underlying all our labor for the poor which is to any good end : " Educational and preventive charities are those which most truly and perumanently benefit the country . "
