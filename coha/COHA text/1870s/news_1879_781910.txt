txt From eleven hundred pages of printed testimony in regard to Justice PINCKNEY , the following points may be gathered : The Clerk of the court swore that the Judge , in throe different cases after judgment rendered , had sent for the judgment rolls and changed the verdicts and recorded judgments . It was an attorney named PARKER who went to the Clerk 's office , and , in the name of Justice PINCKNEY , demanded , got , and carried into the Justice 's private room the roll in the case of HULLER against GOETZ , in which judgment had been given for the defendant . Within , two minutes PARKER ( he was the plaintiff 's attorney ) brought back the roll to the Clerk of the Court with the word defendant " ? erased and the word " plaintiff " inserted beneath it , and " $25 damages " added ? and . the ink of this judicial forgery was yet wet on the paper . The Court Clerk testified that these changes in the judgment rolls were in Justice PINCKNEY 's handwriting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next falsification of the records of his court was in favor of the defendant , in the case of KLEIN against ELus BETZ . Judgment had been given for the plaintiff . PINCKNEY sent an officer of his court to the clerk for the roll , drove his pen bunglingly through " plaintiff " and wrote above it " defendant , " and returned the forged record to its tile without a word . These two cases open ' to the eyes of New-York property-owners and suitors a possibility of iniquity alid peril in its District Court justice that may well make them uneasy . In the case of FASSERT against MeSeenuote the plaintiff was a woman , the action was for the conversion of personal property , and judgment had been given for the defendant , with ten dollars costs . The woman had infested the court-house with her presence . She had been repeatedly seen closeted with the Justice in his private room . She learned flintily , to her astonishment , that she had been beaten . To communicate to her precisely the result of her suit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case in pigeon-hole " F , " where he had filed it . It was not there . On the next day , however , he found a judgment roll in FassEnT against MCSPEDDON hi that very pigeon-hole , but a new and wholly different roll , in which judgment was given for the plaintiff with $100 damages , $5 50 costs , $12 fees , and an order making the defendant liable to arrest ! The Clerk took the document and went immediately to Justice PINCKNEY 'S room , and said to him , " Judge , this wo n't do ! The parties on the other side have been here and seen the original judgment . You must correct this in some manner . It is outrageous . " In reply to theprosecuting attorney in the investigation , who asked the witness , " Well , what did he say to that I " the Clerk of the court answered , " Well , he trembled , and said he : know ? I did it : t did it at the instance of some of those fellows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they interested themselves about this woman . " Then the Judge asked the Clerk what could be done . The Clerk suggested that the only thing to do was to make a new judgment-roll , as like as possible to the original and genuine one which the Justice had destroyed , and to put it in the pigeon-hole and suppress the false roll . And this was done , and " those fellows over at the Sparta Club " and their woman lost their arranged robbery and imprisonment of an innocent man . And the law has been steadily at work for ten months to get this man off the Bench , and he yet sits on it , hearing the trial of causes , giving judgments , granting process , issuing warrants ! Judge Pialokarav 's district is the most important in the . City . Its southern boundary is Fortieth-street . It extends from river to river . On a shelf under the bench of this largest and wealthiest district of civil jurisdiction in New-York there was ever a supply of gin or Jamaica rum , put there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choice of the liquor was determined by the likeness of its color to water . It was drank during the trial of causes . When consumed , it was openly replaced by more brought by an officer from a groggery in the neighborhood . The Justice often leaned across his bench during proceedings and asked an officer to go out and get him something to drink . It was his habit to suspend business to go out of court to drink . He would enter his courthouse staggering drunk , and insist on going on the bench , " **25;0;TOOLONG of officers and friends : Partially delirious on the bench , he often shouted to the audience to take off their hats , when there was not a hat on a head in the room , He would cry out , " Stop smoking ! " when there was not a pipe or cigar to be seen . He would drunkenly take sides in a case he was trying , and tell a witness " be was a ? fool for giving that testimony , " and . inform him how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He would make decisions overruling the Supreme Court and Court of Appeals , then lose his grip of the case , feel it slip out of his memory and comprehension , and go out for liquor , and perhaps not come back for a couple of days . Lawyers often dismissed juries which he left in their box while he was out bracing himself with rum . His decisions when drunk often provoked roars of laughter , as often furiously outraged every principle of law and justice , and trampled down suitors and attorneys . Stratagem at times had to be used to coax him from the bench , where he was getting his calendar and all the court business into an inextricable jumble , down into his room . There emetics would be given to him , and doctors brought in to get the collapsed judicial machine into working order again . This Justice took his ermine into the neighboring ' saloon 's and there got drunk . He fought in the streets drunk . Drunk , he fought boot-blacks in the gutter . He got drunk and fought bar-tenders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would shut up his court for days to get drunk . The Clerk almost constantly had . to go through the forms of calling his calendar and adjourning the cases . It is in evidence that at times when his court had been adjourned by the Clerk and locked up , because he was off somewhere drunk , he would unexpectedly return , ascend the bench , and call and dispose of cases in the absence of the parties . His court was closed to let him recover from an attack of delirium tremens at his lodgings . There was a similar interregnum of justice in his large district while his doctor was pulling him through another and worse attack in the Grand Union Hotel . Except for irregular volunteer aid from the Justices of the other District Courts , his court was long closed while he was under enforced treatment at the One Hundred and Fifty-second-Street Inebriate'Asylum . From this retreat , in due season , he began to return to his judicial duties , but under the surveillance of one of the asylum physicians , who regularly took him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the physician entered the court-room to get his patient , he discovered him to be drunk , and the anger of the doctor at the condition in which he found his faithless charge was loudly uttered in the hearing of the court officers . It is a relief to turn from the sickening odor of this rum-soaked ermine to a charge of official extortion and corruption , which has the comparative merit of being simply wicked and not odorous of gin and Santa Cruz . A considerable part of the business in Justice PINCKNEY 'S court was under the statutory relations between landlord and tenant . Numerous warrants to dispossess tenants were issued . It was proved against the Justice that he would not sign , or look at , these papers until the applicants had seen his " Dispossess Clerk , " DAVIES ; that when taken to this person , he demanded a fee of two dollars for each , pocketed the money , did not examine the papers at all , but , with a car-conductor 's punch put ' a. peculiar hole through them ; that when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promptly signed by him . The City Marshal was a fellow-member with Justice PINCKNEY of the Sparta Club . He swore on this trial that one day he was in the clubroom with the Justice and the " Dispossess " Clerk , and that the latter had the papers in all the cases that were that day tried in court , and dictated to the Justice what judginents to Rive . To.his directions to Eutotztsx , " Judge , dismiss this , " or " Judge , give judgment for that , " this judicial phenomenon feebly interjected in one case the whine of yet unconsumed decency , " DAVIES , would that be righti " To which his clerk and copartner replied , " Never mind . Yes , it will . You do that ! " And he did it . Tie signed all the judgments as ho was told to sign them . Upon such a case as this  --  nay , ten times stronger than this  --  is it not incredible that nearly a year of effort under the laws of this civilized State has been consumed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? and that he is vet on it ?
