txt On Monday closed the twenty-second year during which ennuNcEY DEXTER , now tramstarter at the Union Depot in Albany , has been in the employ of the New-York Central Railroad Company . Alluding to him . the Albany Times sneaks thus : Improbable as such a statement may appear , It is nevertholesm true , that during that period , " Doctor , " as he is familiarly known . has never missed a train , but has been punctually on hand upon every arrival and departure of the care during the day , and his strong , cheery voice has directed many thousand passengers in the right direction . This way for the Hudson River cars l " shouts Mr. DEXTER , more than a hundred times a day . and the sound of his voice has become as familiar to the traveler as " household words . " Queer stories he can tell about the traveling days of more than twenty years ago , when there were no railroads running to Albany , and stages brought passengers from beyond Schenectady to the boats at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boats generally left here at noon-time and arrived in Now-York the next morning , and the excitement of opposition between them was much stronger than it is at present . These were the times when electioneering was carried on in a lively manner . TERTRLOW WEED and the senior Mr. CASSIDY were the great politicians of Albany in these days , and all manner of strategy was used by each to gain the success of his party ticket . " I recollect one time , " says the " doctor , " " that THURLOW WEED engagerd me to do some electioneering work for him , and $400 was nanded me for the purpose , with the promise that more should be forthcoming if necessary . Election day was close at hand , so that I had to set to work lively ; well . I went around town and hired all the men of the opposing party I could get to do some work on a boat that lay down the river . We were to go down one evening , do what there was to be done and return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be in Albany to vote certain . There were about 200 men went down with me , and not one but that I knew was our political opponent . After our work was completed on the old boat , we started for home early the next morning , but just this side of Castleton the big tub that we were on got aground somehow or another . The men were all anxious to get home , but the boat was fast in the mud . although the captain told us that the tide would change in a few hours . and we would be in Albany early in the afternoon , in good season to vote . I raved at our ill-luck as loud as the rest of them , but that was all any of us could do . Just after dinner the captain started his boat , but we seemed to get stuck worse , and as the men appeared to get suspicious of me , I went up to the captain and abused him as loudly as I could ; finally we got off , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Albany . This he appeared to do , but did n't , and after a great deal of apparent pushing , we arrived in the city just half an hour after the polls were closed , and the result was that our man was elected by a little over a hundred majority . There was some tall swearing at the absence of these men , and of course the joke was out soon after this , and for a few days I had to keep quite shady . " Other stories are to ! cl of Mr. DEXTER , showing that sharp political tricks we:13 frequent in those days ; in fact he says : " Pshaw 1 they . do n't know how to electioneer now-a-days ; the boys of twenty years ago could show them bow to do it . " But the " doctor " has given up politics many years . and now his whole time and attention is devoted to showing passengers : " This way to the cars 1 " He tells , with a great deal of pride , about his close attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , teat there was hardly ever a man but himself in the world who for twenty years never missed a day at work or has never been absent from the departure of a train . Mr. DEXTER 18 seventy years old , but does not look a day over fifty ; his short , stout figure , black hair and healthy bright eye , make the man appear twenty years younger than he is.
