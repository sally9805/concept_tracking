THERE is a story of a hard man who scouted popularity , and yet accumulated a great fortune ; but when a fire occurred , his neighbors let his warehouses burn , while they gladly saved the property of his more amiable neighbors . The plain moral of this story is too good to be effective ; but it has a subtler one , which is expressed in the proverb , Keep a thing seven years , and you will find a use for it . Keep a quality of character idle , if you can ; if it is good , you will need to employ it by and by . Morosus succeeded by other means than affability ; but the wonder is that he did not fail at the start , a whole lifetime in advance of the fire . Capacity , zeal , and vigor , however , he must have possessed . A temperament so compounded is the first prerequisite to success . Head is not enough ; head and heart are not enough ; there must also be a weighty attack ; or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enter cordially into the game , and whirl with the whirling world . " Hazlitt says : " Modest merit finds to its cost that the bold hand and dauntless brow succeed where timidity and bashfulness are , pushed aside ; that the gay , laughing eye is preferred to dejection and gloom , health and animal spirits to the shattered , sickly frame and trembling nerves ; and that , to succeed in life , a man should carry about with him the outward and incontrovertible signs of success , and of his satisfaction with himself and his prospects , instead of plaguing everybody near him with fantastical scruples and his ridiculous anxiety to realize an unattainable standard of perfection . " It is evident that the author of " Table Talk " would hardly appreciate the pathetic struggles of Don Quixote , who illustrates the unbalanced ideal tendency . Given a man who is able and willing , he must add vigor to his endowment , the part which the body contributes toward success . Men of genius that succeed owe hardly more to their mental gifts and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stronger , heavier , taller , and more enduring than any other class of men who have not made rowing or pugilism a profession . The axe may be never so sharp , and possess the momentum of the utmost zeal ; but the power of dealing blows persistently is equally essential ; there must be quantity of force , both physical and mental , as Poe argued that a poem must reach a certain length in order to be immortal . A small body has comparatively small chances . An excellent critic has said in these pages , " People will yield that to mere physical largeness which they will refuse to , or at least dispute with , littleness of body and self-distrust . " No matter how true the rifle or the aim , a light ball will not carry far ; heavy men , like heavy bullets , do the most execution , and win the battle at long range . The doctrine of " muscular Christianity " has been over-preached ; but it is one of several important halves of the doctrine of success . Disguise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cruel internecine *varfare . Success is natural selection , the survival of the fittest and the destruction of the unfit . The purest successes are won by competition , and at somebody 's expense ; alike in plant and animal they involve victory and death . I once heard a liberal clergyman extol the repose of nature . " Learn a lesson from the peaceful forest ! Why should we strive , any more than the blowing grain ? " Nothing // could be said that should be farther from the fact . To live is to contend . Each plant endeavors , almost consciously , to destroy his neighbor ; to occupy his ground , to feed upon his nutriment , to devour his substance . There are armies and invasions of grasses , barbarian inroads and extirpations . Every inch of ground is contested by theweeds ; the forest is a struggle for precedence ; the wars of the roses are a perennial feud . The serenest landscape , the stillest woodland , are the mortal arena of vegetable and animal conflict . Every field is a battle-field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the meadow grass . Strife begins with life at the lowest , and culminates in the wars of competing races arid civilizations , the mighty struggles in which the honor and the life of nations are the stakes . There are men who lay about them like the mower in the field ; everything seems to go down before their stroke as lightly as the grass before the scythe , and they advance with the same unswerving progress . These men of natural force are seldom presidents of peace societies . Not that kindness , help , arid duty play no efficient part in the world ; they are undoubted forces , and the hope of the future is in making them yet more efficient ; but they are forces which are still , undoubtedly , in the minority . 1 have named those prerequisites of success which may be called conditions of character . Conditions of method are hardly less important ; they procure that success which mainly depends upon immediate popularity . Tact and charlatanism-what strong movers of the world are they ! and though their domains are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the boundary between the two ! The Talleyrand and the Cagliostro merge into each other by inappreciable gradations . The strongest men can rarely neglect management ; popular clergymen say much less than they think ; popular politicians say much that they do not think . The man of tact expresses just so much of himself as is convenient . Rousseau and Thoreau were men who had not the tact of reserve ; they succeeded by other methods , methods which most people supposed were certain recipes for failure . Imagine the consternation with which an ambitious parent might have watched the course of the Walden Pond recluse , and his determined rejection of a career ! Yet long after the noisy philanthropies of his own and later times are quite forgotten , the life and thought of the woodland philosopher will remain illustrious . Hawthorne , in his gradual attainment of wide popularity , owed much to an unconscious tact as delicate as his literary genius . He knew that America was not a favorable market for fine thought ; yet , in spite of that consciousness , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his readers " anything but a commonplace prosperity , in broad and simple daylight , as is happily the case with my dear native land . " * He regarded the Puritans as sweet natures regard the bitter ; yet he tempers sarcasm with compliment , as when , after a discriminating criticism of them , he says : " Let us thank God for having given us such ancestors and let each successive generation thank Him , not less fervently , for being one step further from them in the march of ages . " ( " SnowImage , " p. 8g . ) Hawthorne 's satire of the Puritans is severe ; yet his sarcasm plays almost cheerfully around the shadows of these gloomy souls , who have saddened the faces of a nation . Between the invective of Tom Paine and the invective of Voltaire , what a wide interval ! In the former , a tinge of the philosopher ; h. the lat*c'x a tinge Introduction to " The Marble Faun. " // of the charlatan ; yet by the same methods , by fire and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and by uttering the thoughts of the scholar in the language of the people , each attained an astonishing , an almost incredible success . A tinge of charlatanism seems indeed almost necessary to a career , whether in business , literature , art , or science . A little unscrupulousness generally flavors the finest achievements . With the commoner forms of pretence we are pretty well acquainted ; but artifice does not seem capable of restriction to these . Nature insists , apparently , that the best of us shall use some contrivance , and will permit nobody to neglect it entirely without suffering penalties . One constantly wonders whether this fine art of management , this dash of assurance , may not be the only thing needful to illustrate a surprising number of persons who now remain quite obscure . Is it true that the finest persons are never heard from ? A seer testifies that in England he met people who were " easily superior to art and literature . " Do silent bards and philosophers meet us in the street , worcb less poets , unworldly spirits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who have not yet caught the knack of popularity , and are unable to make themselves seen or heard ? We need a spectroscope that shall disclose the fine lines . of their presence in the intellectual atmosphere , since they will not doff the garment of invisibility . What organ do these inefficient Titans lack ? Is it that they will not take the trouble to make an attack ; that they despise the methods of success ? I fear that most of these men lack force . They have not blood enough , or they are timid of failure , or have the nervous temperament . I knew a clever man who would not venture to write for years , lest on trial he should lose his private reputation among his friends for literary ability . He succeeded , however , when he attempted print . As far as natural endowments determine , the zealous men are *ar irninence the successful ones . But they have a besetting sin which , being intrinsic , is therefore , perhaps , not quite a sin-bigotry . Except in the case of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partial in order to succeed in affairs . Broad culture is seldom efficient in any immediate way ; narrow , intense purpose accomplishes the hard enterprises of the world , and is everywhere at a premium among those who are interested in getting things done . I have a respect for bigots and partisans , and believe that the world owes a great debt to intolerant , one-sided men . It must have them ; it could not push its reforms , or get its rough unpleasant work done else . Narrow men are edged men , men of single and determined purposes ; and in their purposes they are apt to succeed . The liberal , the spirits of insight , really rule all , though they are not always seen to do so ; they create the thoughts that direct the world 's forces . But they turn over their thoughts to armies of stirring partisans , who adjust by force of arms the claims of opposing truths . The philosopher would prefer to wait for evolution , and to let things settle themselves quietly ; but the reformers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wage religious wars , and piously burn the witches . There is a sad waste of force in these proceedings ; but men promise to become wiser in course of time , and meanwhile the machine creaks slowly along , and some progress is made . The successes which come of personal quality , from the gifts of the individual , may be referred to two distinct varieties of endowment . If we regard character as compounded of intellect , passion , and will , we shall find , I think , that immediate success generally depends upon the personal or passional magnetism , the individual presence of the man , while future fame is generally the // result of intellectual power and achievement . Whether he be soldier , merchant or demagogue , the man of his times influences his fellows mainly through the affections ; while , on the other hand , future success may be won , often is won , by mental power alone . In his library the thinker compels remembrance . His study-lamp finally illuminates a nation or a century . In either case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power ; but , whenever either heart or brain attains a superior development independently of the other  --  a somewhat rare separation-then it will be found that the latter qualities produce the stirring , practical men of the day . The intellect is but the third part of a man . The energetic will is another third . Sympathy , affection , the powers of emotion , are still another part of human nature that is quite as large as the intellect ; and these are more important than the intellect in determining success , as measured by happiness and the present attainment of one 's desires . The warm heart and the strong will-these make the present life ; the powerful intellect wins future fame . Men seldom make a choice , however , between present and future success . Their organization and their circumstances determine for them their lines of activity ; and they are drawn into their careers . The man who is mainly intellectual tends toward literature or science ; the man of affectional nature be comes a figure in society or the church , and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restless , energetic man builds up a great fortune , or expends his forces in travelling , fighting , or exploring the sources of the Nile . Such are the men in whom a single faculty is strongly predominant . But if intellect and the affections combine , we have the poets and men of graceful culture , " sweetness and light ; " intellect and will in predominance give us the great soldiers and men of affairs ; and if strong will be coupled with strong affections , we have the stirring ministers , the zealous reformers , the Howards , Brights , and Beechers . At rarer intervals come the really great men , those compounded of passion , power , and thought , a triplex arm and endowment-men like Columbus or Milton . Through what diverse domains do the paths of success conduct ! Business and professional success mean , in general , the creation of utilities ; the inventor cheapens commodities ; the manufacturer spins thread enough to reach to the sun ; the farmer 's comfort means that he has created a million dinners . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Arthur Helps 's maxims for business advancement . The unproductive industries traverse less commendable paths . The stock speculator succeeds at the expense of others ; his great operations mean the distress of a hundred families , whose fortunes have been drawn into the vortex of this maelstrom of a man . The " mansion of the railroad king , " as we sonorously style it . is builded with the stones of other men 's houses . Some fortunes are founded upon a phrase  --  the " dollar store " for instance . It was a clever thought , to save customers the discomfort of a dialogue with an impudent salesman . In business , much is in a name . Use a single fine word in place of a common one , and this alone may make your fortune ; as when a firm sells melodeons all over the country by the simple device of styling them " organs . " Speculators argued in vain with our suburban residents for permission to build new roads ; but when they changed the phrase , and proposed the construction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not a cent for roads , said the suburban proprietors , but millions for boulevards . Fame often comes of a phrase , as the " Hub of the Universe , " the " Contra // 1871. 223 band , " the " Wickedest Man in New York . " A funny name will make a song popular in every country where boys whistle , or where Congressmen make ad caj5tandum speeches . But these local triumphs , and even the most distinguished successes , which depend mainly upon personal endowments , by no means intimate the whole ground of genius and success . Equally important with ability , zeal , and vigor , with all that constitutes individual power and tact , is the environment of the in- dividual-favoring times and conditions , a fitting milieu , the whole complex framework of circumstance which surrounds alike the able and the incapable man . The old debate , whether circumstances or native inspiration are the most important factor in great achievements , has obscured the fact that incredible qualifications of each and every sort conspire in the production of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am about to speak . With the merely great , it may be a question between work and genius , between opportunity and ability ; but all things contribute to the greatest men . So countless are men , so sharp is their competition , so equally balanced are the forces that struggle toward the front , that the most exceptional combinations of advantage are required to place one man distinctly in advance of the rest of his age . If advantage is useless without ability , it is equally true that genius is thwarted by circumstance . Most men are born in the wrong age or the wrong country ; for nature is more wasteful of men than of apple-blossoms , and blights a thousand where she ripens one . With infinite carelessness she sprinkles superior individuals around ; they are whirled through time and space like the vagrant thistle-down ; and not one in a million lights upon the most fitting soil . Fine natures usually contend with imperfect success against circumstance ; and only those who combine the greatest genius with the most favoring circumstances are enabled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receive him who is to be the greatest man ; as the poets say , the ages expect him ; and his birth is called an advent . It is probable that individual gifts were the least rare of the conditions which produced Homer or Titian or Beethoven . They had every conceivable adjuvant-natural ability , fitting time and place , the right friends and enemies . Intellectual , social , moral , political , and aesthetic conditions alike concurred in producing them . The history of the greatest genius is the record of culminating and incredible coincidences . All the stars shone upon Shakespeare . Brahma , Confucius , Goethe , seem to be the focal points of all the fine tendencies in the universe . To have altered a single condition in the development of these greatest men , would have been to derange their career , to make it something other and less than it was . Their growth was the result of definite causes ; and had these been less efficient , a less result would have been attained . Not that we can suppose these men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been capable of remaining in obscurity . But they could not have attained , otherwise than they did , their perfect growth . Suppose Milton to have been born to any other religion than his own , or a century earlier or later than his era ! Suppose that Goethe 's parents had emigrated with him to South America , or that Charles Lamb had been born in New Holland ! Imagine Raph*iel fallen among the Puritans , or Washington an Italian , or Burns and Byron changing their antecedents , or Cromwell in an age of peace ! He who is to be a great general must avoid being shot too early ; a great artist or critic must be born at particular eras in culture ; a reformer during a fitting phase of faith ; a scientist , philosopher , or teacher must not too far anticipate the spirit of his time ; the greatest poets must // find their language at a particular point of development ; and so absolute is this necessity that one language , in the whole course of its history , seldom produces more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holds true in all the realms of life , that for success there must be an open field ; not necessarily a pathway , but an opportunity . A quite indomitable preoccupation there must not be . If you cut down the forest trees , the liberated seeds of plants that for ages have been waiting an opportunity will spring up , wi ! l take and maintain their place against the former growths . Nature aims at a rotation of crops , and the pioneer who fells the timber aids her to carry out her idea . In the same way particular men , or books , or institutions , or ideas occupy the ground to the exclusion of others equally potent . Possession is an important point in natural as well as in human law . How can any trader in New York Qutgeneral Stewart ? What chance is there for the ambitious young politician of Massachusetts while Sumner and Wilson hold their places ? Even a slight popular melody holds its own for a year against all newcorners ; it occupies the public ear , and its echoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking , will be listened to . But in due course of time it will surely be forgotten . This is the " provision made , " as Goethe says , " that the trees shall not grow into the sky . " Death and change prevent these alarming monopolies from being established ; and novelties are still in the order . But all obstacles are by no means hindrances to success . They sometimes prove to be the most favoring circumstances which seemed the most adverse to a career . Opposition is the stimulus and the aliment of many ; " to some heroic tempers martyrdom is the richest meed . " There are men who seem to have been made by opposition ; and the difficulties that men of genius conquer are their gymnasia and palaestra , their exercise , help , and stimulus . Choice difficulties , invaluable infelicities , have contributed to their advancement . Thus Wordsworth , who was born , as it might seem , the term of a whole generation earlier than his fitting epoch , actually appeared in literature not a day too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation , to create an audience among its least willing listeners ; and he proved equal to the great task which made his fame . He conquered recognition at last , and it was the struggle to bring the world abreast of him that gave him enduring power . Had he sung to a compliant audience , the world would not have granted him praise and remembrance so secure as his own . Of the difficulties , on the other hand , that , instead of aiding , have destroyed the finest genius , we can have but a vague knowledge ; for we can not positively say of any individual that he would have been a prophet had he fallen upon better times . We only know that most men miss their best possibilities . Seldom does the misplaced spirit retrieve itself ; yet sometimes , In the after-silence sweet , When strife is hushed , our ears doth meet , Ascending pure , the hell-like fame Of this or that down-trodden name , Delicate spirits , pushed away In the hot press of the noonday . Such are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attaining a given object of desire , but in a spontaneous and lovely growth of character that blooms unconsciously as the roses . In a word , the environment generally determines quite as much as the original endowment , for it turns , the scale in the competition of countless individuals that are equally gifted . Where one man of genius is born at the best time and // to the most fitting conditions , many are born to less than the best . There must be a rare individual and there must be an extremely rare conjunction of circum. * stances . The coincidence of the two is so infrequent , that an.entire race may not contribute to history more than one or two of the greatest names . " Nature being a sower of men , and constantly putting her hand in the same sack , distributes over the soil regularly and in turn about the same proportionate quantity and quality of seed . But in the handfuls she scatters as she strides over time and space , not all germinate . A certain m@ral temperature is necessary to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prove abortive . Consequently , as the temperature changes , so will the species of talent change ; if it turns in an opposite direction , talent follows ; so that , in general , we may conceive moral temperature as making a selec/ ion among different species of talent , allowing only this or that species to develop itselfT , to the more or less complete exclusion of others . " Thus Tame ( " Philosophy of Art " ) illustrates the dominance of conditions . I would by no means underrate the power of the individual in the achievement of success . Unless , however , we recognize the equal power of the second factor in the product , the power of circumstances , we are in danger of making a one-sided statement of the case . The author of " Hereditary Genius " says ( pp. 38 , 39 ) : " I believe that if the eminent ' men of any period had been changelings when babies , a very fair proportion of those who surviyed and retained their health up to fifty years of age would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eminence . Thus  --  to take a strong case - it is incredible that any combination of circumstances could have repressed Lord Brougham to the level of undistinguished mediocrity . If a man is gifted with vast intellectual power , eagerness to work , and power of working , I can not comprehend how such a man should be repressed . The world is always tormented with difficulties waiting to be solved - str*iggling with ideas and feelings to which it can give no adequate expression . If , then , there exists a man capable of solving those difficulties , or of giving a voice to those pent-up feelings , he is sure to be welcomed with universal acclamation . We may almost say that he has only to put his pen to paper and the thing is done . " There can be no doubt of the intrinsic and transmissible character of ability , of mental as well as of physical characters of all varieties . But the statement I have quoted , though true , is incomplete . It fails to account for , or to suggest any way of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom we have been speaking , the signal characters of their age or generation . Reputation , as Galton shows , is undoubtedly a criterion of greatness ; but the lack of reputation does not always prove the reverse . The greatest natures , born under wholly unfavorable circumstances , constantly die and make no sign . But the majority of such natures win a more or less complete victory over circumstances ; their powerful spirits achieve eminence in whatever direction it may be attainable . Thus their success , not being the result of a consummate harmony between the individual and his environment , may be fairly claimed as the result of intrinsic individual qualities . They are the men who are great in spite of fate , the " illustrious men " of Galton 's highest class , estimated by him to be one in a miltion . Most of these men would have won an equally complete victory over other obstacles than those that they encountered ; they would have played other rd/es quite as brilliantly , though failing to attain their highest potential success . But in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we can not conceive a change of past conditions that would not have made them other and less than // they were . They would have become eminent or illustrious according b the less or greater fortune of their environment ; but absolutely first-rate fame they could not have won . The " illustrious man " of Galton 's classification is the man who conquers all obstacles that he can reach , and shapes all conditions that are not quite beyond control ; who does the utmost that the gods allow when they are not in the supremest mood of favor . He might have been more , he could hardly have been less than illustrious . Of this class D'Alembert was a good example . Commencing his career as a foundling , he was successively a pauper , a glazier 's apprentice , and-at the age of twenty-four  --  a scholar of the first rank of celebrity . Such wonderful endow - ments as his could hardly have failed to win great success under any circumstances . But had he been born before the law of gravitation had been discovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have won the glory that Newton-in whom all happy conditions concurred-had won before him . Newtons are born among us still ; but the paths of the planets have been traced . There are Miltons still ; but the conditions which made possible the Christian epic belong to a past that can not be reproduced . Our great minds , bent upon science and material improvement , find new opportunities and methods of distinction . Possibly a poetic cycle may return when the capabilities of steam are realized . Fourier thinks that , under improved social conditions , the ratio of illustrious men might be brought up as high as one in sixteen hundreds the number of a " phalanx . " Each community , he argues , may have its Newton and its Homer , and may suffice to itself for the finest spiritual activities as well as for the roughest toil . This speculation may not after all be foolish in /0/0 ; for the percentage of superior character is certainly capable of increase . The distance already traversed between our savage ancestors and ourselves is wider than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But to reach Utopia , as well as to emerge from barbarism , requires incredible periods of time . Meanwhile , the record of the best minds is that of a search for climate . Where is the best atmosphere and temperature for the spirit ? This desire and unrest especially inspires the American mind ; it draws our scholars to Europe , our poets and our men of science , quite as strongly as the pleasure-seekers . We think that an older civilization than our own may also prove a better one for us ; that there it may be possible to grow better than at home ; to set forth from a higher point of departure . The German , the Frenchman , begins with a superior education , has the most advanced intellectual standards from the start . Goethe had the entire civilization of continental Europe to back him . An Englishman or an Italian leaves his university with the advantage of a whole lifetime of culture over the colonist . Of what use is it for a South American or a New Zealander to aim , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ environment . The American finds himself handicapped in the race for culture . We know very well where to expect philosophy , art , and poetry . The habitats of the sciences are limited , and each branch of culture thrives best within its definite zone . Varieties of ability belong to different soils , as distinctly as fruits and grains are distributed . Singers grow in Italy and Puritans in New England . Even the flame of genius has its lines of highest temperature . Great is individuality ; yet character of every kind is by no means entirely an affair of the individual . Character is , mere than has been supposed , an af // fair of Ltitude and longitude . Genius is mighty ; yet genius bends , and yields , and sways to circumstance , is made or broken by its conditions , which stunt , or aid , or slay , or crown it , as the case may be . This is the unpalatable truth which men in all ages have recognized , saying , We are in the hands of the Fates . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to conquer , to shape the Fates themselves , they say also , We are in the hands of the gods . The profoundest sufferings are those of the fine soul which discovers at last that it is hopelessly misplaced , that it is in the power of the Fates . The discipline of deep experiences , the fruit of sorrow-devotees speak of . these things as if they were known only in their private experience . Far more grave anQ general . are these facts than even the best of people who make it a bsiness to profess goodness know . In no religion is there any monopoly of the great experiences of pain or joy . No renunciation is more sharp than that of the aspiring spirit which finds that it can not by any means attain its own development ; that it must accept the position and watch henceforward the slow death of its better self . What is the loss of a child or of a consort to this conscious loss of one s own soul ? I have seen no life more sad than that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A girl of talent discovers in her quiet home that she inhabits a garden that can give her no adequate nourishment , and breathes an atmosphere which has no breath of the life she needs . There is no society , no contact with superior persons , little access even to superior books . Her brothers go away freely , one by one , to seek a better fortune ; but she must remain in this inactive home , and wait , she knows not for what . She sees that for a lifetime she is to be subjected to an experiment more cruel than that of the mouse placed in the exhausted receiver of the air-pump . The life of her body will continue , but only to watch the slowly wasting life of her spirit . No position is more pathetic than this . What is the dread of future punishment in comparison with the present starvation of the soul ? We need not anticipate an inexpressible misery , nor expect to assign it to others . Purgatory is a present fact ; but it exists in the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exists in the cramped homes of our country towns , where daughters walk sadly in their fathers ' gardens , restless , wan , as the shades of the Inferno . The unsatisfied and unsatisfiable desire , the aspiration toward achievement , the hunger for activity , the longing for sympathy , the need of work , the absence of that tone of thought , feeling , and fellowship that is equally necessary for a fine development in character or in culture , the environment of an unworthy society , the bondage of a false position  --  the lack , in short , of nearly all the aids to a healthy life and growth-all these things our finest natures long endure before they sink into the commonplace . The last transformation is made insensibly ; for nature , considerate in her severity , does not permit the sufferers to remain conscious to the end . As to charmed animals , she sends to them the kind unconsciousness of approaching death ; she bathes them in a Lethe of formulas , creeds , and resignations ; and each stranded spirit slowly loses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he set forth with " splendid purpose in his eyes . " The whole philosophy of renunciation puts upon us no such stress , offers no such moral opportunity , as that which constantly occurs in these trials of fate . The ordinary religionist endures suffering , for he expects compensation ; but it requires a higher fortitude to lose the total opportunity of existence without a murmur . The heroism of the stoic is the surprising thing . It is in meeting as boldly as he the last bitterness of truth that the spirit gains its strength . We will not be // under bonds to prove that the universe is a pleasant place . The brave girl or youth can face the facts of it ; and , so living and thinking , find.s that the religionist 's disciplines are unreal in comparison , painted demons instead of an actual enemy . No courage is comparable to that of him who dares to think for himself . In the failure even of what are called selfish desires there is often inestimable interest .

What a sense of infinite loss comes over the defeated general , the dethroned and captive emperor ! Even the obscurest aspirant , in whom a universal aspiration is foiled , feels that he has lost the inheritance of all time . How terrible to see the consequences of a great mistake , to know that the turning of a hand , the easy alternative ofa choice , a word , might have led to deathless remembrance instead of cruel contempt and more cruel oblivion ! War produces these great experiences , these inconceivable sensations ; and men make war mainly because it yields such profound emotions . Both to the leader and to the private soldier it offers unequalled excitements to the imagination , unrivalled spectacles to the sense . To the popular judgment no phenomena are so stupendous . A proud empire is hurled in a month , in a day , from the van to the rear of nations ; again , as of old , a captive emperor graces for us a modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " wiping his eyes with his glove " ; again there is a fugitive empress and court , and the rabble stray through the palaces ; and again captured generals , armies , and trophies of war are led in bitter shame through the jubilant streets of a conqueror 's capital . We witness a Roman triumph ; its events burst upon us clamorously from the clear skies of the nineteenth century , from the atmosphere of a civilization that some had fancied serene . It is to witness these things that men are still ready to lay down their lives . To attempt these successes , to risk these perditions , to thrill under these profound excitements , men rush to arms as of old and no military government could stand for a month did not war evoke a universal sympathy of men , did not its solemn pageants of shame and glory , death and victory , touch the profoundest feelings of the human heart .

I would not offer cold comfort to those who suffer ; yet I have taken no pledge to argue that the world is comfortable . Still , it is less hard to endure the penalties that an impersonal fate inflicts than the sore pang of onslaught from a spirit that decrees and brings you evil . All that is bad we have at home .
