ROMANISM AND THE IRISH RACE IN THE UNITED STATES . PART I. TuE forces which produce the most remarkable effects in this world work unseen and unthought of till the time comes for their operation to manifest itself . The fields remain bare and brown , the boughs of the forest-tree continue naked , while the seed is swelling in the soil and the sap is rising in the trunk : on a sudden , with the dawn of summer , the world reclothes itself with verdure . The transformation , long preparing in secret , breaks upon us when it comes with a suddenness which would appear like enchantment , if custom had not taught us to look for it . The phenomena of human life are the result of causes similarly and secretly acti*e . The world-spirit is for ever busy in its workshop , out of sight and forgotten , but no custom will serve us here to enable us to forecast what is coming . Nature never repeats herself , and out of the infinite variety of materials is for ever throwing out something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Buddhist religion , the Christian religion , the Mohammedan religion , the Reformation , the French Revolution , all changed the face of society , but all took mankind by surprise . We can partially account for such manifestations - or we think we can // account for them-after they have become facts ; but our insight into the spiritual forces which rule our fortuncs is far too imperfect to enable us to make a guess of what may lie before us , and to those who seriously observe the course of human history no proverb seems better founded than that which tells us that " nothing is certain but the unforeseen . " Reason is without generalizations from which to argue . Each generation of us is as if it had grown up in a single season-winter or summer , as the case may be ; past experience throws no light on the fruit which it will produce . The seasons will change . They are always changing and altering the aspect of everything , but they do not change in the same order , and fact , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America is the land of wonders . From forty million Europeans thrown into a vast virgin continent , with the arts and sciences , the accumulated knowledge and experience of all antecedent time , we may naturally look for surprises . There , unconstrained by traditions and superstitions , new ideas can organize themselves , and that under such conditions phenomena should rise which had never been seen before is no more than what reason would have expected . What no one would or could have expected is , that in America , of all countries , a creed which in the Old World a century ago was universally supposed to be worn out and done with , should have been precisely the one which has taken root there most firmly and is growing with the most amazing rapidity . A prophet , who had foretold at the time of the Declaration of Independence that within a century the Roman Catholics would be the largest single religious community in the United States , would have deserved a place in a lunatic asylum , so absurd such an anticipation would have seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared unlikely ; it would have been distressing to expect a resurrection of a belief in magic under the contemptible aspect of Spiritualism . Yet no one who understood the erratic capabilities of man 's nature would have said that either of these extravagances was entirely impossible . That in New York and New England , the chosen home of Calvinism and Puritanism , the woman of the seven hills should have set up her standard , and that American citizens would be gathered round it in millions , would have seemed an hypothesis so wild , that every man or woman with ordinary sense would have agreed that it could not be . Yet this extraordinary fact has literally come to pass , and the dream of the Ultramontanes , that the Pope will soon exercise as complete an authority in the // United States as Gregory VII . ever exercised in Europe , is scarcely more preposterous or impossible of realization than the state of things which actually exists would have seemed to the grandfathers of the present generation . In 1785 there was one Roman Catholic bishop in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Roman Catholic population was French or Spanish . They had neither school , college , convent , nor monastery . They were declining in numbers or were being absorbed in the preponderating Anglo-Saxon element . In 1879 the number of Catholics is six millions and a half . They have sixty-three bishops , five thousand seven hundred and fifty priests , five thousand five hundred and eighty-nine churches , five hundred convents , seven hundred colleges , seminaries , and academies , and nearly two thousand parish schools . The rate of increase is still rising , flocks and pastors having more than doubled in the last twenty years . The chief explanation is the immigration of Irish peasantry , which began on a large scale in 1866- ' 67 . The Irish who were in America before the potato-famine were chiefly Presbyterians from the north , part of the Protestant colony which had been planted by Cromwell . They were worth their weight in gold to Ireland , if it was for Ireland 's interest to become a Protestant country . But they were too sturdy and independent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They were persecuted away and went to New England , where they paid their debt with interest to the old country at Lexington and Bunker HilL Folly and misgovernment sent the Irish Presbyterians to America . The famine sent the Celtic peasantry thither in ten times larger numbers . They , too , when they went , supposed that they had to thank England for their banishment . So scandalously had Ireland been treated , that the people not unnaturally set down whatever they suffered at England 's door . That they would carry with them the old hostility to England , as their Protestant fellow countrymen had done , was probable enough . That their religion would survive the change was expected by no one . Their own clergy dreaded the effect upon them of contact with American liberty . The Americans themselves thought that they could absorb and as similate these ignorant millions of ragged wretches as easily as a shoal of sprats are swallowed and digested by a whale . " How long does it take , " I once asked a distinguished gentleman at New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " How long ? " he said ; " h 'm ! well , about half an hour . " The answer , unfortunately , was // more epigrammatic than true . He went on to explain that they would be scattered over a vast extent of country , where their priests could not follow them  --  a man could not remain a Roman Catholic to any purpose without priest , sacrament , or chapel-if the parents continued , for their own lifetime , to pray to the Virgin and the saints , the American schoolmaster would take care to enlighten their children . In this as in some other points the fine confidence of the Americans in the effect of their institutions has been disappointed . The Irish peasant has suffered so ong for his religion that it is in the granules of his blood . Roman Catholicism , which grew sick and stagnant in power and prosperity , has in Ireland been braced into vigor by calamity . Like the mythological monster , it has been in contact with the hard soil of fact , and has gathered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them , when they reached the New World , the Irish clergy and people set themselves to meet their new circumstances . There was money in plenty . The old sixpence-a-day wages of Ireland was turned into as many shillings , and out of the shillings the Irish boys and girls parted cheerfully with as many as were needed for a faith which was a second nature to them . Thousands , perhaps tens of thousands , were lost at first in the huge cities of the enormous continent , but the Church soon overtook its straying sheep . It watched over their marriages : the Irish in America marry wholly among themselves and within their own creed . It kept its hold on the children , and furnished them with antidotes to correct the poison of the secular schools . The lapses from the faith , once relatively large , have now wholly ceased , and after thirty years the Roman Catholic body is the largest , strongest , and wealthiest in the Union ; its members are the most perfectly organized , and the most completely obedient to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceased . It has been checked in part by the ri*e of wages at home ; other causes must be at work also , which are not understood ; for the population of the island , once so extremely prolific , does not tend any more to an increase at home , and either children are no longer born there in the same proportion , or the drift is directed into the English towns and colonies , to carry on the propagandism elsewhere . But the Irish in America are now independent of additions from without . There are already six millions of them . They preserve the abstinence from sexual vice which distinguishes them so honorably at home , and this is favorable to large families . If they go on growing as // they have grown for the last twenty years , there will be twelve millions at the end of the century . Surely a singular phenomenon ! At the accession of the house of Hanover , there were scarcely eight hundred thousand Irish Celts in existence , all told , and those a poor , trampled , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as naturalborn hewers of wood and drawers of water , for whose speedy extinction a wise legislation had provided . These Celts are now virtual masters of their own country : they turn the elections in the great English cities ; they are a weighty element in the English colonies ; while in the New World they have expanded into a nation , separate in blood , separate in religion , as little likely to merge in the old race of republican Americans as the parent stock at home is likely to assimilate with the British , yet grafted in upon the American Constitution , to bear its own fruit there for good or evil . For Great Britain , it is fortunate that the Irish emigrants have been thus steady to their faith . The Irish nationality , like the Jewish , is bound up with its religion , and stands or falls with it . Had the Irish who crossed the Atlantic merged , as they were expected to do , in American society , they would have strengthened the old feeling of enmity to the mother-country , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help to the United States , as in 1798 it looked to France , and in the sixteenth century to Spain . The Roman Catholic religion , happily , has prevented a fusion which would have been so dangerous . If not incompatible with republican institutions , it is uncongenial with them . The Irish race the other side of the Atlantic remains as separate from the Anglo-Saxon as it is at home , and , instead of the Americans being infected with the Irish ill will toward Great Britain , they have themselves an Irish problem of their own , which is becoming seriously perplexing . It seems hard to say that a man is a worse citizen because he is earnest in his religious belief , because he adheres tenaciously to an old and respectable creed , which insists on morality and the ten commandments . That religion , unfortunately , is by its own choice at war with every other , and the American Constitution is the political expression of the principles which the Pope has violently condemned . The theory of the republic is , that all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking care of his own interests , temporal and eternal ; that , so long as he does no practical wrong to others , he has a right to go his own way , to worship under his own forms , to speak his own thoughts , and to have a voice in the general management . // The Syllabus says that men are not free ; that they are not capable of taking care of themselves ; that the laity , in the most important matters , must be guided and governed by the clergy ; that the press ought to be under a censorship ; that , the Catholic religion being true , all others are false , and therefore ought not to be tolerated . We agree that the spiritual part of man ought to rule the material : the question is , where the spiritual part of man resides . The Protestant answers , that it is in the individual conscience and reason ; the Catholic says that it is in the Church , and that it speaks through bishops and priests . Thus , every true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tells him , and a republic of true Catholics becomes a theocracy administered by the clergy . It is only as long as they are a small minority that they can be loyal subjects under such a Constitution as the American . As their numbers grow , they will assert their principles more and more . Give them the power , and the Constitution will be gone . A Catholic majority , under spiritual direction , will forbid liberty of worship , and will try to forbid liberty of conscience . It will control education ; it will put the press under surveillance ; it will punish opposition with excommunication , and excommunication will be attended with civil disabilities . That it will try to do all this , as long as it accepts the Ultramontane theory which at present passes current , is as certain as mathematics . It tried before , in the dark ages ; it will try again in the age of enlightenment . Doubtless , were things ever to come to such a pass , the laity would discover-as they discovered before - that they had rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earthly matters better than the clergy . The state would again tie up the bishops and priests with fresh statutes of prccmunire . The bishops would have to be content with half the loaf , instead of the whole of it , to save their " temporalities. ' * But the battle could not be fought under the forms of the American Republic . The republic can only subsist while the citizens are individually independent , and , against a disciplined and coherent spiritual organization , a secular organization as stable as itself can alone contend successfully . To the republic as it stands , the Catholic system is a direct menace . Men must be judged by their professions . Free governments , in the New World and in the Old , stand face to face with a system which denies the axioms on which they rest  --  a system theoretically complete , aggressive , and successful ; a growing nucleus in a universe of atoms ; a compact body in the midst of divided // interests and contending opinions ; challenging a toleration which it contemptuously refuses ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to set its foot on liberty itself . M. Louis Veuillot said , in the Chamber of Deputies to the Republicans : " We claim liberty from you , when you are in power , because it is your principle ; when we are in power , we refuse liberty to you , because it is not our principle . " No wonder that modern governments look with alarm at the specter which has thus appeared among them . The Ultramontane theory can not itself triumph ; but it can make an end of hustings and ballot-box . It may win its way to a position where , if it can maintain itself , it will be fatal to intellectual freedom , yet from which we shall be unable to drive it without recourse to methods which we hoped that we had outgrown . The growth of the Irish element has , for some time , disturbed the minds of the Americans . They have absorbed a substance which they have been unable to assimilate , and it interferes with their digestion . A religion , to which the Irish vote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scale among their political parties . It is out of harmony with their institutions , and affects , in a way that no one could have looked for , their relations with the adjoining transatlantic states . The Anglo-Americans are the leading power in the New World ; they claim a right to forbid the interference of European governments in any part of the American Continent ; they have asserted a quasi protectorate from the Canadian frontier to the Isthmus of Darien ; they have regarded Canada itself as virtually belonging to them ; although they have been content that it should remain , in name , a British dependency till it desires for itself to enter the Union ; but it has been a point of patriotic belief that not the Canadian Dominion only , but Mexico , and Central America , and San Domingo , and Cuba , and the other islands , will eventually gravitate into one body with them , at no distant time . And they are now confronted with the unpleasant fact that the Catholicism , which they have already so much cause to fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the British Provinces there are two million Catholics ; in Spanish America and the islands there are forty millions ; and further annexation wears a less attractive aspect when the effect must be to swell the numbers which are already within their own borders . It has been the fashion of statesmen to assume that the time has gone by when religion can have a practical influence on politics . // The Americans are light-hearted , confident in themselves and in their principles , and , till lately , they have laughed at the idea that Romanism can be a real danger to them . The New-Yorkers are vain of their new cathedral . They have had a pride in feeling that American energy can put so much life into the oldest of the Old World superstitions . But already , in a vital point , the shoe which they have made for themselves is pinching them . If there is one thing which they are prouder of than another , it is their national schools . The Roman Catholics do not like these schools ; they insist on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can , to apply the education rate to a denominational purpose ; and in New York , and possibly in Boston itself , their numbers give them a chance of success . Nor is this the worst . In America , as in England and Scotland , they are making converts out of the Protestant communions . Weak , imaginative people , disturbed by theological controversies , are imposed on by the pretensions of a Church which sits so calmly in the midst of the confusion , and claims exclusive possession of truth . The attraction of bodies is in proportion to their mass , and a community of seven millions with a single heart and purpose works irresistibly upon floating units which want force to make an orbit for themselves . That an educated American Protestant should , at this time of day , run his head into the sand , and call himself a Catholic , is sufficiently absurd ; but the ridiculous has its tragic side , and , however assured we may feel of the ultimate result , no one can say what may happen meanwhile . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a theological controversialist , but by a moderate and sensible man of the world . A book has just been published , in New York , on the condition of " Roman Catholicism in the United States . " It is anonymous , which is in itself an instructive little fact . No public man in the United States likes to provoke the animosity of a party which is so powerful in the Eastern cities . The attitude is one of astonishment and perplexity . " The Church of Rome , " the writer says , " is the avowed antagonist of those principles which we wisely regard as the safeguards of freedom and intellectual development " ; yet he sees it rising like an exhalation from a morass , and spreading over the whole face of the country , with a rapidity which makes him almost regret the impossibility of using such methods of repression as commend themselves to Dr. Falk and Prince Bismarck , or M. Jules Ferry . " We have never , " he says , " been brought face to face , as European // governments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roman Catholicism ; but the temporary exemption does not warrant us in supposing that there is any dissimilarity between the conditions which govern Romanism in Europe and the conditions which govern Romanism in this country . Here , as in Europe , there is the inherent antagonism between Romanism and Protestantism , which must inevitably produce its results . " The free American citizen , " who was never in bondage to any man , " is claimed as the subject of an Italian priest . The duty of submission to him is preached openly by the press ; and , strange to say , in republican America no one is offended at language which would be forbidden in Paris , or even in Rome itself . In a New York paper , a Catholic tells his countrymen , that " the people need governing , and must be governed ; they must have a master ; and , in this sense , we wish this country to come under the Pope . " The Americans generally had believed the Union to be " the greatest thing " which had yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the Church is more than country , and fealty to the creed which God teaches through her is more than patriotism . " Protestants must tolerate Catholics , but Catholics must not tolerate Protestants . " The Church is in possession of absolute truth ; she alone has the right to be , she alone must be intolerant . " Language of this kind is permitted in the New World because of its absurdity . Fools are allowed to talk as they please ; their talk can do no harm . America has solved the problem of self-government . " America represents a principle which places her in the vanguard of civilization and progress . " The ravings of Ultramontane fanatics she can afford to laugh at . In that vast seething caldron of humanity a few thousand priests and their flocks may be thrown in among the other ingredients , " to make the gruel thick and slab " ; but , to suppose that these Old World extravagances can seriously affect the fortunes of the Great Republic , is to suppose that the rivers can run upward to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courses . So Americans have thought hitherto ; and so many of them think still . But the figures in the census startle them . They see that " the enthronement of Romanism means the dethronement of liberty " ; that " if America does not conquer Romanism , Romanism will certainly conquer her " ; and that the issue is less certain than they had , in their fancied security , believed . Compromise is impossible . A republican form of government implies freedom and self-reliance ; and freedom and selfreliance // are extinguished in Romanism , as a flame goes out in carbonic acid . The Jesuits are shrewd in their generation . The Jesuits say that " the most glorious enterprise for the Church to engage in is the conversion of the United States " ; and they not only think the conquest possible , but they are confident of success . The American eagle may scream- " there are times when the American eagle screeches itself hoarse in proclaiming the greatness of the nation " ; but " neither screech of eagle nor strut of peacock " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Providence , of course , will watch over her cherished darling . America will be saved somehow . But Providence " is apt to be on the side of the strong battalions . " Protestantism , disorganized and disunited , fights at frightful disadvantage against the homogeneous Roman army . " It is the quintessence of imbecility , " this anonymous writer says , " to allow a system so vast and dangerous to pursue its career of conquest unchallenged . If Romanism is essentially opposed to the welfare of American institutions , our duty is clear and imperative . " To speak in the Old World of an imperative duty in the face of an acknowledged danger would mean something serious . It would imply that the enemy was to be taken by the throat . An American , unfortunately , can set no such rigorous purpose before him . The course which is so plain and imperative is only , it seems , to scream , after all , to reiterate the indisputable truth that America is the chief representative of the " liberty , progress , and civilization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , refuses to reconcile himself , that Rome " is the enemy of liberty and culture " ; and that the modern ideas which she will not accept " are the expression of the mind 's best energies blossoming under the sunshine of intellectual freedom and spiritual liberty " ; that " Romanism impedes the cause of progress , while Protestantism moves forward like Alexander , seeking new worlds to conquer " ; and that " America is what she is because she represents , in an advanced form , certain principles which have always been in harmony with the unfolding powers of the human mind , no less than the progressive instincts of humanity . " Most important all this , but too vague for its purpose ; for the impatient mind will still ask , To what end are mankind moving ? " Progress ! " but progress whither ? " Liberty ! " But what use is to be made of it ? what aim are we to set before ourselves ? It // is exactly by these undefined commonplaces that the wearied man , to whom life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been placed in this world , not to exercise his rights , but to learn his duty and to do it , is driven back upon a system which at least knows what it is about . Men can not live on bottled moonshine , or feed on fractions whose denominator is nothing . Modern civilization builds line cities and houses , and constructs railways , and sends the lightning on its messages . It outdoes Arid , and puts a girdle round the globe in less than the forty minutes of Prospero 's " familiar " ; but , when the ordinary human being inquires to what purpose his powers are to be directed-what moral code , for the guidance of his own action , the civilization provides him , with which the Pope declines to reconcile himself  --  the only answer is , that he is to make money and improve his circumstances ; and he knows that he is meant for something better , and turns away in disgust . If this is all which civilization means , he will take the Pope in preference . The believer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following truth , and truth , he is assured , will lead him in time to ampler fields of spiritual knowledge . The reaction into Romanism is anachronism and blasphemy . He can not prevent it , but he can not look upon it without indignation . " The principles of liberty may forbid that the Roman Catholics shall be refused the same privileges which are allowed to others " but he says , " Neither liberty , equality , nor justice requires that Roman Catholicism shall be permitted to pursue its insidious methods of attack unchallenged . " It is one thing to allow to all men the right to choose any religion they please ; it is quite another thing to allow a Church , as dangerous and powerful as the Church of Rome , to sow the seeds of dissolution and destruction , without doing something to check the " evil in its stages of incipiency . " Doing something ! But what is the something which is to be done ? A hint is dropped that " a debased and irresponsible suffrage " may have to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have flowed over into America , are poor , ignorant creatures , who care nothing for the Constitution , whose interests , so far as they have any , are in Ireland and in their creed , and who vote as their priests direct them . Why should such voices be allowed to exercise a preponderating influence in the American nation ? But the thought is not followed out . " Universal suffrage " just now is the American sovereign : it is surrounded with // the sacred awe which belongs to imperial majesty , and even to breathe a word against it is treason . The remedy has still to be found , and the writer can but prolong and reiterate the note of alarm . " Should Romanism succeed in making a sufficient number of converts among the educated classes to give it a controlling power , we may indeed have fewer discords and fewer anxieties on the deeper questions of human existence and human destiny , but we should exchange the activity of life for the stillness of death and the silence of the grave . " Americans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but they must recognize the incompatibility of the Roman Catholic creed with American institutions . They must realize the intimate connection between the liberty of thought which Protestantism contends for and the spirit of freedom which their Government represents . There is no reason to suppose that the rulers of the Roman Catholic Church regret the tyranny and intolerance with which they fought to retain the dominion which they once possessed . " Intolerance , persecution , and immobility are component parts of their system . Everything which conflicts with the all-embracing claims of the Papacy is denounced as emanating from the powers of darkness and the gates of hell . " If it be asked to what purpose are such protests , " if it be unwise and unjust to attempt forcible resistance ? " " the question proves how general is the confusion in regard to some of the most important functions of citizenship . We can not remedy the evil by resorting to repressive measures . Repressive measures defeat themselves and can not be recommended . But the American who is proud of his country , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perceives that Romanism is as inconsistent with a republican form of government as slavery was . It must be encountered with a renewal of Protestant energy and the robustness of thought which that energy produces . We must reply by intelligent firmness appealing to the higher forms of patriotism . By kindling a healthy sentiment we may render unnecessary those legislative measures which other nations have found it advisable to adopt . " The allusion to slavery in this passage is extremely significant . The Americans are thoroughgoing when they are roused . The civil war showed what they would do if their country or their principles were really in danger , and , if the progress of Romanism creates difculties with which the Constitution can not deal , they will not sacrifice realities to scruples of form . A Falk law in the last extremity // may not be impossible , if all else fails to check the growth of a religion which strikes at the foundations of the state . If Romanism becomes strong enough to command a majority at any important local center the crisis will arrive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the law , and a conscientious Catholic knows no laws save those which the Church has sanctioned . " The Constitution of the United States , " this writer goes on , " repudiates the idea of an established religion ; yet the Pope tells us that this is a violation of God 's law ; that by that law the Roman Catholic religion should be made exclusive , and the Roman Catholic Church , acting alone through him , should have supreme authority , not only over individuals , but over nations , peoples , and sovereigns . The Constitution guarantees liberty of speech and of the press . The Pope says this is the liberty of perdition , and should not be tolerated . The Constitution requires all the people and all the churches to obey the laws of the United States . The Pope anathematizes this provision , because it requires the Roman Catholic Church to pay the same obedience to the law which is paid by the Protestant Churches . The Constitution subordinates all churches to the civil power , except in matters of faith and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because God has commanded all governments to be subordinate to the Roman Catholic Church . The Constitution repudiates royal powers . The Pope proclaims that the world must be governed by royal power , that it may protect the Roman Catholic Church to the exclusion of other Churches . The Constitution allows the free circulation of the Bible , and the right of private judgment in interpreting it . The Pope says that the Catholic Church is the only living authority which has the right to interpret it , and that its interpretation should be the only one allowed . . . . Given a continuance of the opportunities which now exist in consequence of our drowsiness and indifference , and who shall say that there may not come a time when the empire of ecclesiastical Rome shall flourish over the ruins of the fairest and most promising republic that ever existed ? " The first principle of the republic is that the majority of the whole country shall rule . If the Church of Rome can really convert a majority of the American people , either the principle will have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its right in ordering matters as it pleases . We know very little of the conditions of intellectual energy . In the past history of mankind it has been intermittent . Periods of activity and progress have alternated with // periods of rest , as if the mind was like the soil , which requires a respite of stagnation to recover from an exhausting crop . It is possible , it is even likely , that the appetite for change which has characterized the last century may be followed by a wave of spiritual and political conservatism , that science will pause for a while in its discoveries , and that our new knowledge may be allowed time to shape itself into a form with some humanity in it . Even then , however , it is hard to believe that conservatism anywhere in modern society can take the form of Romanism . Before Romanism can become dominant the question will have to be fought out with bullets instead of with balloting-papers ; and though the zeal of the converts is hot enough to build churches and monasteries , and produce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is of the sort that would figure respectably on a battle-field . If we are to lie quiet for a generation or two , it must be on some more substantial basis than a revived enthusiasm for the Virgin Mary . But that the alarm should have risen among our cousins in the United States-that among them , of all peoples , who are " The heirs of all the ages in the foremost files of time , " intelligent persons can be found who are really afraid of what may lie before them-is at least remarkable , and gives us a kind of melancholy satisfaction . The Americans , too , are but mortals after all , subject to the same diseases which afflict the worn-out races of the Old World , and they may draw closer to us in the common trial . To us , in Europe , the face of the enemy is only too familiar . We know what he is ; we know his nature , and that he is not to be exorcised by fine speeches . " Shrink to the clergy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lay their faults roundly to them and they be as sheep , and will lightly be reformed . " This is " the healthy sentiment , " " the intelligent firmness , " which needs revival . This is the tone in which Protestant energy would speak if it was really rekindled . But the rekindling is not so easy . The flame has died down and the new fuel is green . Protestantism once meant abhorrence of falsehood . It now means the right of every man to have his own opinion about religion , whether false or true , and enthusiasm for such a right as this will hardly blaze into a serious conflagration . False opinions about religion imply false opinions about human duty . If human duty is ill done , unpleasant consequences follow , and in time we shall come round again to the convictions of our fathers : we shall feel with them that it is better to // die than to take up with lies in such matters . But ages of hard experience lie ahead of us before we shall have learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we can not speak to the Catholic clergy as Cromwell spoke . They know what they mean ; we do not know what we mean ; and modern Protestantism will and must fight a losing battle against a communion which professes to value truth and claims to teach it , till it has some truth of its own to insist upon . The Catholic revival is a fact , and it will serve , among other purposes , to clear our minds on the real meaning of modern selfgovernment . We speak of self-government as if it was a discovery of an eternal principle , a grand triumph of political sagacity . It is in fact no principle at all , but a phenomenon , like other institutions , essentially temporary , which has grown out of a particular state of things , and is adapted to the prevailing condition of human society . We all admit that particular races , the Asiatics for instance , are not yet fit for it . We interpret their incapacity by assuming that they are not sufficiently advanced on the road to perfection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road , and have no need to advance . All men require to be governed , either by themselves or others . There is a baser nature in every one of us which must be restrained in some way , and self-government is only possible among nations who have been broken by long habit into respect for law and order . Republics have invariably risen only among races which have gone on for centuries under wise authority , the masses obeying their rulers , the rulers obeying , or recognizing and professing to obey , an invisible Master in heaven , to whom all sorts , governors and governed alike , look up as supreme . Gradually the iavisible Master becomes problematic . Kings , bishops , clergy , lords , magistrates , leading traders , and heads of guilds are demoralized by power and wealth . They abuse their authority for their own advantage . If the people have more faith than their masters , they shake them off as the first Protestants and Puritans shook off the bishops , and choose others in their places . If , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principle in all classes alike , then no one can be trusted with authority at all . Each individual , high or low , thinks only of his own interest . He will use every opportunity which is allowed him of benefiting himself to his inferiors ' disadvantage . Gradation and degree lose their meaning . The difference between man and man becomes a difference merely of strength or intelligence , and they are morally on the same // level . Authority , therefore , is reduced to a minimum . All men are declared to be equal , and to have equal rights iu the commonwealth , and no one is allowed to interfere with his neighbor beyond the narrow limits of the prevention of violence and fraud . Thus we arrive at the modern notion of liberty , and it will continue as long as the majority of people retain enough of the ancient respect for morality to be able to resist temptations , and , under certain conditions , would rather suffer loss and inconvenience than do what they know to be wrong . But liberty begets a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when there is no court , cit her in heaven or eartb , where a man is convinced in his heart that he will be called to answer for himself . Where each person is left to his own guidance , and the only object which he is taught to set before himself is the bettering of his own condition , a society so constituted becomes eaten into , necessarily , by a thousand forms of corruption . To make money becomes at best its highest aspiration . Those who fail to make money grow discontented , and those who make it find that it does not satisfy them . They remember that they have souls , and at once the foundations are threatened on which the existing state of things is built up . Let a creed arise taking possession of the masses-any strong spiritual conviction of new truth , or even an old superstition , which distaste for progress has brought to lifeand the right of every man to think and do as he pleases at once disappears . A real belief is necessarily intolerant . Let us feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinions false and destructive , and only want of power will prevent us from prohibiting them . If the majority is against us we shall resist the majority , we shall recognize no more sacredness in a majority than in an hereditary king . We shall fight , and lose our lives if necessary in the conflict , till the truth of which we are convinced is made supreme . Constitutional government , in England and America , implies that each individual is capable of thinking for himself , and ought to think for himself . When individuals combine for a sacred purpose , they cease to think for themselves . From their first beginning they are antagonistic to a mode of government which rests on compromise . When they become predominant they are fatal to it . This it is which makes the future of mankind so uncertain . So long as men are governed by material interests , their action may be calculated on . But the forces which rule the evolution of humanity // are not mechanical but vital . They are born of the spirit , coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whither . They seize hold of us , and subdue us , and model us , as the seed growing out of the soil seizes the surrounding air and fashions it by its own laws into stem and leaves , and flower and fruit . The Catholic religion is an organic force of this kind , which , after all that has passed , still retains some sparks of fire in its embers . Weary of running after mere dollars , weary of the misuse of the word which calls dollars wealth , finding their moral stature dwarfed , their art and poetry made sordid and vulgar , their religion a jargon of contending opinions , mankind are everywhere looking about them uneasily for something better . The Catholic Church stands ready with its code of duties and its formulas of faith-formulas which were once coextensive with Christendom . They wish to remain Christians . The Church says that it , and it alone , is Christianity . Protestantism has veiled its crest , and no longer even professes to interfere with conduct at all , and , wearied with its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take the Church at its word . That the Church has refused to fraternize with the modern spirit is no longer its crime but its credential ; and it can be encountered only by spiritual convictions of the same nature as itself which face it on its own ground . Better to believe in the Virgin Mary and the saints than in the almighty dollar on week-days , and on Sundays in a religion which has no rule of life to offer , and rattles in its old dress like a shriveled kernel of a nut in a shell too large for it . There is nothing to be surprised at in this . A man 's life does not consist in the abundance of the things which he possesses . He must set some higher ambition before himself if existence is to continue tolerable . This ambition Protestantism has failed to satisfy , and he turns back in despair to the old community which his fathers deserted . Protestantism has failed . It is a hard saying . Protestantism when it began was a revolt against lies . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe what in their hearts they did not and could not believe . In this sense Protestantism has not failed , and can never fail as long as there is an honest man left upon the globe . But we can not live upon negations ; we must have convictions of a positive sort , if our voyage through earthly existence is to be an honorable and successful one . And no Protestant community has ever succeeded in laying down a chart of human life with any definite sailing directions . In every corner of the world voI*. cxxlx. - No. 277. 36 // there is the same phenomenon of the decay of established religions . In Catholic countries as well as in Protestant , nay , among Mohammedans , Jews , Buddhists , Brahmans , traditionary creeds are losing their hold . An intellectual revolution is sweeping over the world , breaking down established opinions , dissolving the foundations on which historical faiths have been built up . Science , history , philosophy , have combined to create universal uncertainty , and Catholic France and Italy are no better off in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christianity retains a powerful hold , especially over the Anglo-Saxon race . When positive reasoning fails , a conclusion may be established by proving that the absurdity of its contradictory and destructive criticism has been pushed to a point where it issues in what our instincts reject . Modern skepticism has been arrived at by the application of those principles of reason which were appealed to at the Reformation to liberate us from Rome . If it leads to something which we feel to be incredible , the whole process is discredited from the beginning . The average Englishman and American is not philosophic , but he is constitutionally reverent . That Christianity in some shape is true , his innermost conscience assures him . He knows the weak points of the forms of it in which he has been brought up . With the weak points of Catholicism he has not the same acquaintance , and , when Rationalism tells him to abandon Christianity , he replies by falling back into the Roman communion . Among the men of the middle classes the movement has not gone far . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among them , and therefore few Romanists . The conversions in England have been chiefly among peers , women , and clergy ; and among them , perhaps , they would have been less heard of , and there might have been no conversion at all , had not political causes coi*perated with the intellectual ; and thus we come round again to the Irish question with which our article began .
