txt False impressions regarding the people and customs of this country are often ludicrously illustrated abroad by questions and comments duly reported and enjoyed . The Inquiry as to whether the promenaders in Broadway paint their faces and carry tomahawks ; whether New-York young la. dies of fifteen drive their mammas into the kitchen , while they sit in state in the drawing-room , and whether the boarders at om fashionable hotels divert themselves with shooting-matches in the corridors by way of preparation for dinner , are typical of thie species of pleasantry and are sufficiently familiar . Such things are looked for in the society frequented by cheap tourists , . and are apparently common to that which surrounds M. VICTORIEN SARDOU . We may be permitted to observe , however , that , let funny misrepresentation of this kind , and among certain classes , be as natural and pardonable as it may , we do not look for it in the writings of scientific thinkers , especially when they are of such a rank as has been attained by Mr. HERBERT SPENCER . The words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this country and elsewhere . with circumspection and deference . Whatever may be thought of his abstract opinions , his statements of fact have usually been found to be models of precision and accuracy . If . then , he should . happen to be led into error on a subject so important as to affect injuriously a whole community , or an entire group of political institutions , it is worth while , for his own sake as well as that of others , to try to set the matter right . Now , in Mr. SPENCER 'S article in the June number of the Popular Science Monthly he makes , among others , the following remarkable statements : " I do not refer only to such extreme illustrations of it as were at one time furnished in California ; where , along with that complete political freedom which some suppose to be the sole requisite for social welfare , most men lived in perpetual fear for their lives , while others prided themselves on the notches which marked , on the hilts of their pistols , the number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been betrayed here into grave error and mistaken assertion . There has been no time in California . not even in the most lawless periods of from 149 to 154 , that " most men lived in perpetual fear for their lives , " and if such cases as that of the notches on pistol-hilts ever occurred , we have never heard of it . No doubt there were instances of individual atrocity in the early days of California of singular and desperate character ; but to imply that these were characteristic of the whole community , or that the great mass of the people , whether in the cities or the mining-camps , were not free to pursue orderly and industrious lives , and did not , in truth , so pursue them , is distinctly erroneous . When society in California was in an unformed condition , receiving constantly heterogeneous and inflammable constituents , and . before thinking men had had time to work out the most available principles of organization , it is unquestionably true that there were unique disturbances . and , for a space , unique @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to argue from such premises that the vigilance committee is the legitimate offspring of democratic institutions . So far , indeed , is this from being true that we might almost venture to say that , had . the early population come from the United States alone , there would have been no need or incentive to the formation of a vigilance committee at all . It is a notorious fact that a very large fraction of the most turbulent and dangerous classes in California came thither , not from the United States , but from elsewhere . The Australian colonies , especially , furnished . many conspicuous criminals , and of the number sent away by the Vigilance Committee , not a few were escaped British convicts . In the mines , too , were numerous runaway sailors from ships of all nations , a class naturally including some of the most reckless and unscrupulous elements to be fo104 411310/QT0 in the world . NotwitEstanding these , and other critical social constituents , there was so much of the steadying element in the community , so much disposition to respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tolerant good . humor  --  which is typified in the character of ABRAHAM LINCOLN , and with which all who know the American frontiersman are familiar  --  that the mischievous classes were very early held in check in California , and kept so . It is to be inferred , thou , that , be the good or bad of democracy what it  --  may ; - we can not wisely or justly exemplify the latter by the Californian example . There was hardly ever such a motley company of enterprising spirits gathered together in the world as on the Pacsifie coast in the " early days ; " and that , in less than a generation , so extraordinary , and , to appearance , so incongruous a mass ' should have settled down into one of the most peaceful , thrifty , and well-organized communities to be found in Christendom , assuredly does not point a moral against the republican institutions under which snob a development has been possible .                    @
