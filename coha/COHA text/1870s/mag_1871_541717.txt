THE GIANT IN THE SPIKED HELMET . I THINK I saw the caricature first in Munich at the end of July , then in two or three Swiss cities , then in Paris at the end of August , then in Brussels and London ; for it was popular , and the print-shops had it everywhere . It was a map of Europe where the different countries were represented by comical figures , each meant to hit off the peculiarities of the nation it stood for , according to popular apprehension . For Prussia there was an immense giant , one of whose knees was on the stomach of Austria represented as a lank figure utterly prostrate , while the other foot threatened to crush Southwestern Germany . One hand menaced France , whose outline the designer had managed to give rudely in the figure of a Zouave in a fierce attitude ; and the other was thrust toward Russia , a huge colossus with Calmuck dress and features . The most conspicuous thing in the giant 's dress was a helmet with a spike projecting from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wearer , and therefore falling over his eyes until they were almost blinded by it . The style of the helmet was that of the usual head-dress of the Prussian soldier . The caricature generally was not bad , and I thought the hit at Prussia , half crushed and blinded under the big helmet , particularly good . Throughout her whole history Prussia is either at war , or getting ready for war , or lying exhausted through wounds and recovering strength . In Prussia you find things of pugnacious suggestion always , and in the most incongruous connections . Study the schools , and you will find something to call up the soldier . Study the church , and even there is a burly polemic quality which you can trace back from now to the time when the Prussian bishops were fighting knights . Study the people in their quietest moods , in their homes , among their recreations , indeed , among the graves of those they honor as the greatest heroes , and you will find the same overhanging shadow of war . This predominant martial quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes sublime . I visited Prussia at a time of entire peace , for at my departure I crossed the frontier ( or that of the North German Confederation , the whole of which , for convenience ' sake , we will call Prussia ) on the very day when King William was shouldering aside so roughly at Ems Benedetti and the famous French demands . The things to which I gave attention for the most part were the things which belong to peace ; yet as I arrange my recollections I find that something military runs through the whole of them . As one 's letters when he has read them are filed away on the pointed wire standing on the desk , so as regards my Prussian experiences everything seems to have been filed away on the spike of a helmet . Going out early one May morning to get my first sight of Berlin , I stood presently in a broad avenue . In the centre ran a wide promenade lined with tall , full-foliaged trees , with a crowded roadway on each side bordered by stately buildings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towered up till the head of the rider was on a level with the eaves of the houses . The rider was in cocked hat , booted and spurred , the eye turned sharp to the left as if reconnoitring , the attitude alert , life-like , as if he might dismount any moment if he chose . In the distance down the long perspective of trees was a lofty gate supported by columns , with a figure of Victory on the top in a chariot drawn by horses . Close at hand again , under the porch of a square strong structure , stood two straight sentinels . An officer passed in a carriage on the farther side of the 433 // avenue . Instantly the two sentinels stepped back in concert as if the same clock-work regulated their movements , brought their shining pieces with perfect precision to the " present , " stood for an instant as if hewn from stone , the spiked helmets above the blond faces inclining backward at the same angle , then precisely together fell into the old position . The street was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the memorial of Frederick the Great . The gate down the long vista was the Brandenhurger Thor , surmounted by the charioted Victory which Napoleon carried to Paris after Jena and which came back after Waterloo . The solid building was the palace of iron-gray old King William ; and when the clock-work sentinels went through their salute , I got my first sight of that famous Prussian discipline , against which before the summer was through supple France was to crush its teeth all to fragments , like a viper that has incautiously bitten at a file . There never was a place with aspect more military than Berlin even in peaceful times . In many quarters tower great barracks for the troops . The public memorials are almost exclusively in honor of great soldiers . There are tall columns , too , to commemorate victories or the crushing out of revolutionary spirit ; rarely , indeed , in comparison , a statue to a man of scientific or literary or artistic eminence . Frederick sits among the tree-tops of Unter den Linden , and about his pedestal are life-size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most worthy of honor . At the four corners ride the Duke of Brunswick and cunning Prince Heinrich , old Ziether and fiery Leydlitz . Between are a score or more of soldiers of lesser note , only soldiers , spurred and sabre-girt , - except at the very back ; and there , just where the tail of Frederick 's horse droops over , stand- whom think you ? - no other than Lessing , critic and poet , most gifted and famous ; and Kant , peer of Plato and Bacon , one of the most gifted brains of all time . Just April , standing room for them among the hoofs and uniforms at the tail of Frederick 's horse ! Every third man one meets in Berlin is a soldier off duty . Batteries of steel guns roll by at any time , obedient to their bugles . Squadrons of Uhlans in uniforms of green and red , the pennons fluttering from the ends of their lances , ride up to salute the king . Each day at noon , through the roar of the streets , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of trumpets , then a deafening roll from a score of brazen drums . A heavy detachment of infantry wheels out from some barracks , ranks of strong brown - haired men stretchin* young b from sidewalk to sidewalk , neat in every thread and accoutrement , with the German gift for music all , as the stride tells with which they beat out upon the pavement the rhythm of the march , dropping sections at intervals to do the unbroken guard duty at the various posts . Frequently whole army corps gather to manouvre at the vast parade ground by the Kreuzberg in the outskirts . On Unter den Linden is a strong square building , erected , after the model of a Roman fortress , to be the quarters of the main guard . The officers on duty at Berlin come here daily at noon to hear military music and for a half-hour 's talk . They come always in full uniform , a collection of the most brilliant colors , hussars in red , blue , green , and black , the king 's body-guard in white with braid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if made from burnished gold , crested with an eagle with outspread wings . The men themselves are the handsomest one can see ; figures of the finest symmetry and stature , trained by every athletic exercise , and the faces often so young and beautiful ! Counts and barons are there from Pomerania and old Brandenburg , where the Prussian spirit is most intense , and no nobility is nobler or prouder . They are blueeyed and fair-haired descendants perhaps of the chieftains that helped Herman overcome Varus , and whose names may be found five hundred years back Tue Gia ; z/ in the Spiked Hcimet. // among the Deutsch Ritters that conquered Northern Europe from heathendom , and thence all the way down to now , occurring in martial and princely connection . It is the acme of martial splendor . " But how do you bear it all ? " you say to your Prussian friend , with whom you stand looking on at the base of Billow 's statue . " Is not this enormous preparation for bloodshed something dreadful ? Then the tax on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a multitude from the employments of peace " Your friend , who has been a soldier himself ; answers " We bear it because we must . It is the price of our existence , and we have got used to it ; and , after all , with the hardship come great benefits . Every able-bodied young Prussian must serve as a soldier , be he noble or low-born , rich or poor . If he can not read or write , he must learn . He must be punctual , neat , temperate , and so gets valuable habits . His body is trained to be strong and supple . Shoemaker and banker 's son , count , tailor , and farmer , march together , and community of feeling comes about . The great traditions of Prussian history are the atmosphere they breathe , and they become patriotic . The soldier must put off marrying , perhaps half forget his trade , and come into life poor ; for who can save on nine cents a day , with board and clothes ? But it is a wonder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . " So talks your Prussian ; and however much of a peace-man you may be , you can not help owning there is some truth in it . If you buy a suit of clothes , the tailor jumps up from his cross-legged position , prompt and fullchested , with tan on his face he got in campaignin* and it is hard to say he has lost more than he gained in his army training . Go into a school ; the teacher , with a close-clipped beard and vigorous gait , who has a scar on his face from Kdniggrktz , seems none the worse for it , though he may have read a few books the less and lost his student pallor . At any rate , bad or good , so it is ; and so , says the Prussian , it must be . Eternal vigilance and preparation ! I went in one day to the arsenal . The flags which Prussian armies had taken from almost every nation in Europe were ranged against the *valls by the hundred ; shot-shattered rags of silk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue checker , above all the great Napoleonic symbol , the N surrounded by its wreath . This was the memorable tapestry that hung the walls , and opposite glittered the waiting barrels and bayonets till one could almost believe them conscious , and burning to do as much as the flint-locks that won the standards . There was a needlegun there or somewhere for every ablebodied man , and somewhere else uniform and equipments . When I landed in February on the bank of the Weser , the most prominent object was the redoubt with the North German flag . When in midsummer I crossed the Bavarian frontier among a softer people , the last marked object was the old stronghold of Coburg , batteredbysiege after siege for a thousand years . It was the spiked helmet at the entrance and again at the exit ; and from entrance to exit , few places or times were free from some martial suggestion . It is a nation that has come to power mainly through war , and been schooled into the belief that its mailed fists alone can guaranty its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys of six came all with knapsacks strapped to their backs for their books and dinners , instead of satchels . At the tap of a bell they formed themselves into column and marched like little veterans to the school-room door . I visited a school for boys of thirteen or fourteen . Casting my eyes into the yard , I saw the spiked helmet in the shape of the half-military manoeuvres of a class which the teacher of gymnastics was training for the severer drill of five or six years later . I visited the " prima , " or upper class of a gymnasium , and here was the spiked helmet in a connection that seemed at first 1871. 435 // rather irreverent . After all , however , it was only thoroughly Prussian , and deserved to be looked upon as a comical incongruity rather than gravely blamed . A row of cheap pictures hung side by side upon the wall . First Luther , the rougher characteristics of the well - known portrait somewhat exaggerated . The shoulders were even larger than common . The bony buttresses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they rose above the strong lower face , were emphasized , looking truly as though , if tongue and pen failed to make a way , the shoulders could push one , and , if worse came to worst , the head would butt one . Next to Luther was a head of Christ ; then in the same line , with nothing in the position or quality of the pictures to indicate that the subjects were any less esteemed , a row of royal personages , whose military trappings were made particularly plain . It was all characteristic enough . The Reformer 's figure stood for the stalwart Protestantism of the Prussian character , still living and militant in a way hard for us to imagine ; the portraits of the royal soldiers stood for its combative loyalty , ready to meet anything for king and fatherland ; and the head of Christ for its zealous faith , which , however it may have cooled away among some classes of the people , is still intense in the nation at large . I visited the best school for girls in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even to find the spiked helmet , and this time not hung upon the wall nor outside in the yard . The teacher of the most interesting class I visited - a class in German literature - was a man of forty-five , of straight , soldierly bearing , a gray , martial mustache , and energetic eye . He told me , as we walked together in the hall , waiting for the exercise to commence , that he had been a soldier , and it so happened that among the ballads in the lesson for that day was one in honor of the Prussian troops at Rossbach . Over this the old soldier broke out into an animated lecture , which grew more and more earnest as he went forward ; how the idea of faithfulness to duty had become obscured , but was enforced again by the philosopher Kant in his teaching , and then brought into practice by the great Frederick . The yeteran plainly thought there was no duty higher than that owed to the schwarzer Adler , the black eagle of Prussia . Then came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they rode out from Weimar , the troopers , before they went , ripping open the beds on which they had slept and scattering the feathers to the wind to plague the housewives , - a piece of ruthlessness that came home thoroughly to the young housekeepers ; then how der alter Fritz , lying in wait behind Janus Hill , with General Leydlitz and Field-marshal Keith , suddenly rushed out and put them all to rout . The soldier was in a fever of patriotism and rage against the French before his description was finished , and the faces of the girls kindled in response . " They will some time , " I thought , " be lovers , wives , mothers of Prussian soldiers themselves , and this training will keep alive in the home the national fire . " Admirable schools they all were , the presence of the spiked helmet notwithstanding , and crowning them in the great Prussian educational system come the famous universities . That at Berlin counts its students by thousands , its professors by hundreds . There is no branch of human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the Assyrian arrow-head inscriptions . A new pimple can hardly break out on the blotched face of the moon , without a lecture from a professor next day to explain the theory of its development . The poor earthquakes are hardly left to shake in peace an out-of-the-way strip of South American coast or Calabrian plain , but a German professor violates their privacy , undertakes to see whence they come and whither they go , and even tries to predict when they will go to shaking again . The vast building of the University stands on Unter der Linden , opposite the palace of the king . Large as it is , its halls are // crowded at the end of every hour by the thousand or two of young men , who presently disappear within the lecture rooms . Here in past years have been Hegel and Fichte , the brothers Grimm , the brothers Humboldt , Niebuhr , and Carl Ritter . Here now are Lepsius and Curtius , Virchow and Hoffman , Ranke and Mommsen , - the world 's first scholars in the past and present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by day through the semester to the plain lecture-rooms , taking notes diligently at benches which have been whittled well by his predecessors , and where he too most likely will carve his own autograph and perhaps the name of the dear girl he adores , - for Yankee boys have no monopoly of the jackknife . I met face to face some of the great scholars who give glory to the University to-day ,  --  Lepsius , one Sunday afternoon in his garden , a hale , straight man of sixty , with an abundance of white hair brushed away from a fine forehead , a ruddy , healthful , smooth-shaven face , and the keen eyes looking from behind spectacles that have learned so shrewdly to decipher the difficult record Sesostris and the Pharaohs have left on obelisk and pyramid ; Ranke , the great historian of the Popes , of the Reformation , of Prussia , still diligent in his seventy-fifth year . I saw in his study Theodor Mommsen , historian of Rome , a man great like Niebuhr , and in the front rank of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thin figure , from his books and manuscripts , to greet the stranger , hardly past fifty , and yet bent as if with the weight of great erudition ; a pale cheek , a dark eye , not quenched at all by study ; a profusion of black hair , which has in part turned gray , over a good head . His voice seemed thin and weak , though under excitement it becomes strong enough . The meagre form spoke of constant toil and seclusion , and one could see what it cost to be great in his direction . His manner was somewhat stiff , but polite . He paid a high tribute to the historian Bancroft , Minister at 437 Berlin , saying it was not often men so worthy and scholarly were found in diplomatic positions . He spoke with interest of the honor about to be done to Bancroft by the University of Gdttingen . Fifty years ago , the ambassador received there his degree of Doctor . A deputation of professors was to come to Berlin from Gdttingen , a grand festivity to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke cordially of America , in spite of the Catsarism expressed in his history ; and when I hinted at some of our shortcomings , said hopefully , the future belonged to us , and all would come right in time . In the midst of the talk three pretty children came laughing and dancing into the room to bid their father good night . They were plainly on the most familiar terms with him . He kissed them with pride and pleasure , the light in his fine eyes becoming playful . While the sunbeam was shining , I left the student 's dusty den , with its disordered piles of books , its heaps of manuscripts , its casts and plates of Roman antiques . XVhere can one find the spiked helmet in the midst of the scholastic quiet and diligence of a German university ? It is visible enough in more ways than one . Here is one manifestation- Run down the long list of professors and teachers in the Anzez*e , and you will find somewhere in the list the Fecktmeister instructor in fighting , master of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be one of the busiest men in the company . To most German students , a sword , or Sc/ddger , is as necessary as pipe or beer-mug ; not a slender fencing-foil , with a button on the point , and slight enough to snap with a vigorous thrust , but a stout blade of tempered steel , ground sharp . With these weapons the students perpetrate savageries , almost unrebuked , which strike an American with horror . Duels are of frequent occurrence , taking place sometimes at grounds and on days regularly set apart for the really bloody work . The fighters are partially protected by a // sort of armor , and the wounds inflicted are generally more ghastly than dangerous ; though a son of Bismarck 's is said to have been nearly killed at Bonn a few years ago , and there is sometimes serious maiming . Perhaps one may say it is nothing but very rough play , but it is the play of young savages , whose sport is nothing to them without a dash of cruel rage . The practice dates from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their woods . Perhaps the university authorities find it too inveterate a thing to be done away with perhaps , too , they feel , thinking as it were under their spiked helmets , that after all it has a value , making the young men cool in danger and accustoming them to weapons . We , after all , can not say too much . Often our young American students in Germany take to the schlager as gracefully and naturally as game-cocks to spurs . The most noted duellist at one of the universities last winter was a burly young Westerner , who had things at first all his own way . A still burlier Prussian from Tilbingen , however , appeared at last , and so carved our valiant borderer 's face , that hereafter with its crisscross scars it will look like a well-frequented skating-ground . To crown all , the schools and University at Berlin are magnificently supplemented in the great Museum , a vast collection where one may study the rise and progress of civilization in every race of past ages that has had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , civilized or wild , under the sun . In one great hall you are among the satin garments and lacquered furniture of China ; in another it is the seal-skin work of the Esquimaux stitched with sinew . Now you sit in a Tartar tent , now among the *var-clubs , the conch - shell trumpets , the drums covered with human skin of the Polynesians . Here it is the feathery finery of the Caribs , here the idols and trinkets of the negroes of Soudan . There too , in still other halls , is the history of our own race ; the maces April , the Teutons and Norsemen fought with , the torcs of twisted gold they wore about their necks , the sacrificial knives that slew the victims on the altars of Odin ; so , too , what our fathers have carved and spun , moulded , cast , and portrayed , until we took up the task of life . In another place you find the great collection made in Egypt by Lepsius . The visitor stands within the fac-simile of a temple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lotus-shaped columns are processions of dark figures at the loom , at the work of irrigation , marching as soldiers , or mourners at funerals , - exact copies of the original delineations . There are sphinx and obelisk , coffins of kings , mummies of priest and chieftain , the fabrics they wore , the gems they cut , the scrolls they engrossed , the tomb in which they were buried . Stepping into another section , you are in Assyria , with the alabaster lions and plumed genii of the men of Nineveh and Babylon . The walls again are brilliant , now with the splendor of the palaces of Nebuchadnezzar ; the captives building temples , the chivalry sacking cities , the princes on their thrones . Here too is Etruria revealed in her sculpture and painted vases ; and here too the whole story of Greece . Passing through these wonderful halls , you review a thousand years and more , almost from the epoch of Cadmus , through the vicissitudes of empire and servitude , until Constantinople is sacked by the Turks . The rude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down through the ages of decay to the ugly painting of the Byzantine monk in the Dark Ages . So too the whole history of Rome ; the long heave of the wave from Romulus until it becomes crested with the might and beauty of the Augustan age ; the sad subsidence from that summit to Goth and Hun . There is architecture which the eyes of the Tarquins saw , there are statues of the great consuls of the Republic , the luxury of the later Empire . You see it not only in models , but sometimes in The Giant in the *pik'ed He/met. // actual relics . One 's blood thrills when he stands before a statue of Julius C*esar , whose sculptor , it is reasonable to believe , wrought from the life . It is broken and discolored , as it came from the Italian ruin where it had lain since the barbarian raids . But the grace has not left the toga folded across the breast , nor is the fine Roman majesty gone from the head and face , - a head small , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nose with the true eagle curve , and thin , firm lips formed to command ; a statue most subduing in its simple dignity and pathetic in its partial ruin . And all this is free to the world as the air of heaven almost . No fee for admission ; the only requisitions , not to handle , orderly behavior , and decent neatness in attire . Here I saw too , when I ascended the steps between the great bronze groups of statuary as I entered , and again the last thing as I left , the spiked helmet on the head of the stiff sentinel always posted at the door . The German home is affectionate and genial . The American , properly introduced , is sure of a generous welcome , for it is hard to find a German who has not many relatives beyond the Atlantic . There are courteous observances which at first put one a little aback . Sneezing , for instance , is not a thing that can be done in a corner . If the family are a bit old-fashioned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ *rosits " and " GesundIteits " from the company , wishes that it may be for your advantage and health sonorously given , with much friendly nodding in your direction . As you rise from the table it is the oldfashioned way , too , to go through with a general hand-shaking , and a wish to every one that the supper may set well . The Germans are long-lived , and almost every domestic hearthstone supports the easy-chairs of grandparents . Grandfather is often fresh and cheerful , the oracle and comforter of the children , treated with deference by those grown up , and presented to the guest as the central figure of the home . As 439 the younger ones drop off to bed and things grow quieter , grandfather 's chair is apt to be the centre toward which all tend , and , of course , the old man talks about his youth . Here are the reminiscences I heard once at the end of a merry evening , and at other times I heard something not unlike : " Children and grandchildren and guest from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prussia was struggling with the first Napoleon ; and when I was eighteen I marched myself under Bliicher beyond the Rhine . Sometimes we went on the run , sometimes we got lifts in relays of wagons , and so I have known the infantry even to make now and then fifty miles a day . Matters were pressing , you see ( se/ie ; s Sie ma ? ) . At last we crossed at Coblentz , and got from there into Belgium the first days of June . We met the French at Ligny , - a close , bitter fight , - and half my battalion were left behind there where they had stood . We were a few paces off , posted in a graveyard , when the French cavalry rode over old Marshal Vorwkrts , lying under his horse . I saw the rush of the French , then the countercharge of the Prussian troopers , when they missed the General , and drove the enemy back till they found him again ; though what it all meant we never knew till it was over . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and far , with cannon-thunder in our ears in a constant mutter , always growing louder , until in the afternoon we came at a quickstep through a piece of woods out upon the plain by Waterloo , where they had been fighting all day . Our feet sucked in the damp ground , the wet grain brushed our knees , as our compact column spread out into more open order and went into fire . What a smoke there was about La Haye Sainte and Hogoumont , with now lines of red infantry , or a column in dark blue , or a mass of flashing cuirassiers , hidden for a moment , then reappearing ! It was take and give , hot and heavy , for an hour or so about Planchenoit . A ball grazed my elbow and an.other went through my cap ; but at sunset the The Giant in the Spiked He/met. // 440 French were broken , and we swept after the rout as well as we could through the litter , along the southward roads . We were at a halt for a minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a plume and a hooked nose underneath , trotted up , wrapped in a military cloak , and somebody said it was Wellington . " Grandfather will be sure to be at a white heat before he has finished , and so , too , his audience . The athletic student grandson , with a deep scar across his cheek from a schalger cut , will rise and pace the room . The Frdzilei*z , his sister , to whom the retired grenadier has told the story of the feather-beds at Weimar , will show in her eyes she remembers it all . " Yes , friend American ! " breaks in the father of the family , " and it all must be done over again . Sooner or later it must come , a great struggle with France ; the Latin race or the Teutonic , which shall be supreme in Europe ? We are ready now ; arsenals filled , horses waiting , equipments for everybody . Son Fritz there has his uniform ready , and somewhere there is one for me . Donnerwetter / If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old land-storm ! Only let Vater Wilhelm turn his hand , and to-morrow close upon a million trained and wellarmed troops could be stepping to the drum . " It was a long evening at the end of June . Napoleon was having the finishing touches put to the new Opera House at Paris , thinking , so far as the world could tell , of nothing more important than how many imperial eagles it would do to put along the cornice . King William was packing for Ems , designing to be back at the peaceful unveiling of his father 's statue the first week in August . Bismarck was at his Pomeranian estate , in poor health , it was said , plotting nothing but to circumvent his bodily trouble . In less than a month full-armed Prussia was on the march . I could understand the readiness , when I thought of the spiked helmet I had seen in the Prussian home that quiet summer night . The German Friedhof or buryingground , has never the extent or magnificence of some American cemeteries . Even near the cities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the wellkept mounds and stones there is no want of care . Every old church , too , is floored with the memorial tablets of those buried beneath , and bears upon walls and columns monuments in the taste of the various ages that have come and gone since the church was built . Graves of famous men , here as everywhere , are places of pilgrimage , and here as everywhere to see which are the most honored tombs , is no bad way of judging the character of the people . Among the scholars of Germany there have been no greater names than those of Jakob and Wilhelm Grimm , brothers not far apart in the cradle , not far apart in death , who lived and worked together their full threescore years and ten . They were two wonderful old men , with faces - as I saw them together in a photograph shown me by Hermann Grimm , the wellknown son of Wilhelm - full of intellectual strength , and yet with the sweetness and innocence of children . They lie now side by side in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a lovely rose-bush scattering petals impartially on the turf above both , and solid twin stones at their heads , meant to endure apparently as long as their fame . Hither come a large and various company of pilgrims , - children who love the brothers Grimm for their fairy-tales , young students who have been kindled by their example , and gray old scholars who respect their achievements as the most marvellous work of the marvellous German erudition . The little North German city , Weimar , is closely associated with the great literary men of the last hundred years . Here several of them accomplished their best work under the patronage of an enlightened duke , and finally found . their graves . An atmosphere of reverend quiet seemed to hang over it as I walked through its shaded streets , - streets where there // 44 ' is never bustle , and which appear to be always remembering the great men who have walked in them . In the burying-ground in the outskirts I found the mausoleum of the ruling house , a decorated hall of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The members of the Saxe - Weimar family for many generations are here ; the warlike ancestor with his armor rusting on the dusty lid , grand-duke and duchess , and the child that died before it attained the coronet . But far more interesting than any of these are two large plain caskets of oak , lying side by side at the foot of the staircase by which you descend . In these are the bones of Goethe and Schiller . The heap of wreaths , some of them still fresh , which lay on the tops , the number on the coffin of Schiller being noticeably the larger , showed how green their memory had been kept in the heart of the nation . I was only one of a great multitude of pilgrims who are coming always , their chief errand being to see the graves of these famous dead within the quiet town . In the side of the Schloss Kirche , in the city of Wittenberg , is an old archway , with pillars carved as if twisted and with figures of saints overhead , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away through time . It is the doorway which rang loud three hundred years ago to the sound of Luther 's hammer as he nailed up his ninety-five theses . Within the church , about midway toward the altar and near the wall , the guide lifts an oaken trap-door and shows you beneath the slab which covers Luther 's ashes . Just opposite , in a sepulchre precisely similar , lies Melanchthon , and in the chancel near by , in tombs rather more stately , the electors of Saxony that befriended the reformers . A spot worthy indeed to be a place of pilgrimage ! attracting not only those who bless the men , but those who curse them . Charles V. and Alva stood once on the pavement where the visitor now stands , and the Emperor commanded the stone to be removed from the grave of Luther . Did the body turn in its coffin at the violation ? It might well have been so , for never was there fiercer hate than went from them toward him and him toward them . For three centuries the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but sometimes through very hatred , a multitude too mighty to be numbered . But there is a grave in Prussia , where , if I mistake not , the pilgrims are more numerous and the interest , for the average Prussian , deeper than scholar or poet or reformer call out . The garrison church at Potsdam has a plain name and is a plain edifice , when one thinks of the sepulchre it holds . Hung upon the walls are dusty trophies ; there are few embellishments besides . You make your way through the aisles among the pews where the regiments sit at service , marching from their barracks close by , then through a door beneath the pulpit enter a vault lighted by tapers along the wall . Two heavy coffins stand on the stone floor , - the older one that of Frederick William I. , that despot , partially insane , perhaps , who yet accomplished great things for Prussia ; the other that of his famous son , Frederick the Great , whose sword cut the path by which Prussia advanced to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that sword , until the great Napoleon when he stood there , feeling a twinge of jealousy perhaps over the dead leader 's fame , carried it away with him . Father and son lie quietly enough now side by side , though their relations ' in life were stormy . About the great soldier 's sleep every hour rolls the drumbeat from the garrison close by . The tramp of the columns as they come in to worship jar the warrior 's ashes . The dusky standards captured in the Seven Years ' War droop about him . The hundred intervening years have blackened them , already singed in the fire of Zorndorf , Leuthen , and Torgau . The moth makes still larger the rent where the volleys passed . The spiked helmet is even here among the tombs ; and schooled as the Prussians are // among the din of trumpets and smoke of wars , no other among the mighty graves in their land holds dust , in their thought , so heroic . The Prussian church is a true church militant . There is an element @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from old times , which never drops away . Many a German church has on its walls marks of the rapine of the Thirty Years ' War . Many of the pulpits from which in the Reformation such hot resistance was preached are occupied by the ministers who give tone to the nation 's present religious life . As churches and pulpits are the same , so the words of the preachers have much of the ancient spirit . Over the result of the Romish council I heard again and again last summer outbursts of most energetic protest . It was the fierce polemic fire of the fathers of Geneva and Dort , which has not even begun to smoulder in the lapse of time . In the midst of the public square in the old city of XVorms , where Luther appeared at the famous diet , is the magnificent Luther memorial , one of the finest and most costly pieces of modern art , to erect which treasure was poured in from all Protestant Germany , in great part from Prussia . In the first place there is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are set colossal statues of princes and scholars , and allegorical figures of cities famous in the Reformation . Coming from the outside to the centre you have the great heart of the thing . Five statues of bronze are grouped together on a base of polished sienite . Four of these represent the great forerunners , Huss , Vyckliffe , Peter Waldus , and Savonarola , the latter figure being particularly startling in its lifelike presentment . In the midst of all , from among the princes whose power shielded him , the scholars who held up his hands , and the mighty martyrs who died that the fulness of time might come and he and his work live , towers the colossal Luther . The statue is ten feet and a half high . A scholar 's gown drapes it to the feet , one of which is advanced . His clenched right fist is on the cover of a Bible he holds in his left arm . The head is bare , the face upturned , the lips parted . That giant Luther face And beneath are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - the heroic shout , some tone of which may have been borne in the air as far as the spot where the memorial now stands : " Here I stand ; I can not do otherwise ; God help me . Amen . " It is very , very grand , commemorating gloriously a most manly and consecrated warfare . To erect it coincided thoroughly with the spirit of Protestantism in Germany to-day . Two or three years since , at its dedication , an immense multitude came together , one of the largest Protestant gatherings of modern times , who , as they stood before the group , seemed to recognize in the spirit that filled the faces the antagonistic fire that burned in themselves . The speeches were fulminations full of the old thunder that fell on willing ears . There stood the bronze which the best genius of the land had made almost to live , - the princes with their swords , the brows of the scholars grown spare with earnest controversy , the hand of Savonarola eloquent with denunciation , and towering highest the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lines ploughed by spiritual struggle , the rugged brows , the clenched fist resting on the Bible , the figure braced back for a mighty shock , as if he saw in the air before him the range on range of mighty prelates and helmeted rulers , and in the background the stake and fagots . The masculine , resolute hostility toward the old enemy embodied in the memorial the vast multitude recognized as something that belonged to itself to a degree unabated ; and so it is that one finds even the Prussian faith crowned with the spiked helmet . To see Prussian recreations one must visit the pleasure-gardens . Every village has one at least , and the cities abound with them . The German summer as compared with ours is cool and // wet , and with our in-door habits such an exposure as the Germans practise could not be safely encountered . Every day in summer , however , when the weather is at all tolerable , the German family is more likely than not to be for some hours , perhaps until late in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gardens in Prussia are at the little city of Potsdam , just out of Berlin . They belong to the royal family , and contain several palaces and villas , but seem to be held by the sovereign only in trust for the benefit of the people . There is no weed in the beds , no break in the smooth , solid box massed into glistening hedges . Even the thickets are trained to be graceful , without losing the charm of wildness . Every breath is perfume . Everywhere bees hum and birds sing . In the early summer there are deep , sweet , intermittent warblings , the notes of the nightingales with which the gardens are filled . Perfect taste , perfect luxuriance , princely lavishness hither throng the people , for all is freely thrown open . Nothing is required but orderly behavior , and a respect for such regulations as are necessary to keep the beauty unimpaired . Children play on the velvet lawns . Lovers sit in the arbors . The plain man of the people is there with his wife in company . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ youngster just learning to walk . The rest of the wholesome , whiteheaded brood troop after . On one side you hear mirth or music , on the other the gurgle of the beery flood in which all Germany is steeped to the ears , poured out almost as lavishly as the water of the fountains . In one of my visits to Potsdam I stood before the central door of the New Palace in these gardens . A cord supported on slight posts was drawn through a portion of the garden , running across green and thicket toward the palace , at the steps of which it finally ended ; the light barrier serving as a hint to the public , it was desired the space beyond should be kept private . Looking over the cord into the part re served , I saw a groom in livery leading a pony which drew a low easy vehicle along the walk toward a side door of the palace . There it stopped , and presently a lady rather short and stout , in a light summer dress and mantle , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took her seat in the vehicle . The appearance of the lady was so simple I did not think of her being a distinguished personage , until people near me said it was the Crown Princess . Just as the lady took her seat a group of pretty children came running from the trees near , accompanied by two or three ladies and a gentleman , their governesses and a tutor . One little princess in white ran to the carriage with a bouquet which she pressed upon her mother . The whole group bounded up , a prince running forward to pat the pony . The Crown Princess welcomed all with a most motherly smile on her good , not handsome face ; and I felt that all the creditable things I had heard of her might easily be true , - of her kindness to the poor , her interest in important reforms , her pursuit of difficult branches of study , with all her maternal cares . But now in the midst of the peace and beauty of the garden stood forth  - -  what but the spiked helmet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fullest vigor of his years , in an undress uniform of dark green set off with red ! His face was fair , the lower part covered with a thick brown beard , the eyes blue , the whole mien quiet , simple , manly . He wore on his head a plain red-banded cap , which he touched with soldierly dignity to the tutor and the governesses as they passed by him with the children into the palace . He stood erect and quiet a moment by the carriage ; then presently the pony moved forward , still led by the groom . The lady spread her parasol . The soldier walked at her side , keeping pace with the pony 's progress , until presently the party disappeared among the garden-walks . It was the Crown Prince Frederick William . Seven hundred years ago his ancestor Conrad , the younger son of a 443 // 444 family of some rank , but quite undistinguished , riding down from the little stronghold of Hohenzollern in Swabia , with nothing but a good head and arm , won favor with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I saw tbe old castle in which this Conrad lived and his line after him for several generations . It rises among fortifications the plan for which Albert Durer drew , with narrow windows in the thick masonry of the towers , the battlements worn by the pacing to and fro of sentinels in armor , and an ancient linden in the court-yard , planted by an empress a thousand years ago it is said , with as green a canopy to throw over the tourist to-day as it threw over those old Hohenzollerns . Conrad transmitted to his descendants his good head and strong arm , until at length becoming masters of Baireuth and Anspach , they were Margraves and ranked among important princes . Their seat now was at Culmbach , in the great castle of the Plessenburg . I saw one May morning the gray walls of the old nest high on its cliff at the junction of the red and white Main , threatening still , for it is now a Bavarian prison . The power of the house grew slowly . In one age it got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West Preussen ; now it was possessions in Silesia , now again territory on the Rhine . Power came sometimes through imperial gift , sometimes through marriage , sometimes through purchase or diplomacy or blows . From poor soldiers of fortune to counts , from counts to princes , from princes to electors , and at last kings . Sometimes they are unscrupulous , sometimes feeble , sometimes nobly heroic and faithful ; more often strong than weak in brain and hand . The Hohenzollern tortoise keeps creeping forward in its history , surpassing many a swift hare that once despised it in the race . I believe it is the oldest princely line in Europe . There is certainly none whose history on the whole is better . Margraf George of Anspach-Baireuth was perhaps the finest character among the Protestant princes of the Reformation , without whom the good fight could not have been fought . When Charles V. besieged Metz in the winter ( which , with Lorraine , had just been torn from Germany by the French ) , and was compelled by the cold to withdraw , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soldiers of the time , who led the rearguard over ground which another Hohenzollern , Prince Frederick Charles , has again made famous . Later , in Frederick the Great , the house furnished perhaps the firmest hand that ever held a royal sceptre . Standing on the University steps , looking across Unter den Linden , it is a common sight to see the gray head of old King William , as he rises from his table for a minute , and looks out good-naturedly on his subjects passing in the street . He is every inch a king in his look and bearing . His face has in it benevolence and force , and few men have a finer physique . He is of towering stature , the red facings of his uniform expanded by a most noble chest . He bows with stately courtesy to return the salute of his humblest subject . It is not his brain , to be sure , that is planning now such greatness for Prussia , nor his that has guided the enormous forces of his kingdom , as they fall in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is , moreover , too much of an autocrat to suit an American , perhaps a bit of a bigot ; but there is a sound heart in the king 's breast and a fair share of the soldierly energy of his ancestors . It is not yet time to say what the son will be . In the garden at Potsdam he seemed like a man full of reserved power . In those days he was so quiet and devoted as a father and husband , that he was in danger of ecoming unpopular , as too weakly domestic . But hardly a month from that time , the easy man I had seen keeping pace with the pony , sheltered by his wife 's parasol , at Wdrth and Weissembourg had applied nitro-glycerine to French prestige . Yet he is not a soldier through choice . // 445 " I do not like war , " he is reported to have said in the midst of his victories ; " and if I am ever king , I shall never make war . " He has other than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few words with and touch the hand of the great Greek scholar Curtius , who had the care of his education in his youth . The prince has the culture that comes from classic training , as well as the knowledge and discipline necessary to guide affairs . The morning after the news of the rupture with France I stood under an archway in the palace of the Austrian Emperor at Vienna . Through the archway passed a street of the city ; for the immense building occupies such a position that ways are broken through it to accommodate the public traffic . One of the brilliantly dressed guards always on duty came running and passed the word to a comrade that something was about to happen , I could not understand what . Immediately after , an open carriage , drawn by four fine gray horses , drove rapidly up . It passed so near me , that , as I stood in the archway , I was obliged to press close against the wall to save my feet from the wheels . Four men in uniform sat in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seat , I re*ognized at once , from his pictures , as the Emperor Francis Joseph II . He was wrapped in a military cloak , for the morning was rainy . His face was good , but refined rather than strong ; his figure rather slight . The impression made was of elegance , not vigor . The carriage rolled forward . I heard instantly after the roll of drums , and caught sight through the archway of a line of troops in uniform of blue and white , with the flag of Austria in the midst of them , drawn up to salute . The Emperor disappeared within the palace to arrange no doubt the terms of that neutrality which it was understood within the week he would observe during the struggle . A week later I had reached Munich , and went one evening to the royal opera house to hear the " Rheingold " of Wagner . The building is one of the most perfect of its kind in the world . The scene was brilliant , as the great decorated spaces were filled . Suddenly the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shouting " Hoch ! Hoch ! ' * the German cheer . It happened to be the evening of the day Bavaria decided to take part in the war . The king had just entered , and I was about to see an ovation rendered by the enthusiastic audience , who were carried away with German feeling . Looking upward from my place , I saw in the centre of the circle of seats the royal box , heavily draped with curtains , and in front , a slender , black-haired young man of twenty-five , in plain , dark attire , who bowed gracefully this side and that , acknowledging the homage . Presently the fine orchestra crashed in with the national hymn . I found it quite impossible to resist the contagion , and before I knew it fairly was shouting " Hoch ! " asiflwere the most loyal of subjects . The king 's appearance corresponded with what is said of his character . He was slender and graceful , but with no sign of force ; a patron of the fine arts , and taking more pleasure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rougher work of ruling . Compare these sovereigns of the two prominent states of Southern Germany with the stalwart figure at the window , in IJnter den Linden , and the masculine , self-contained soldier biding his time at Potsdam . They are all good types , perhaps , of the lands they rule ; and if so , Prussia is worthy of the leadership to which she is advancing . In the cathedral of Speyer stand the statues of the mighty German Kaisers , who six hundred years ago wore the purple , and , after their wild battle with the elements of disorder about them , were buried at last in its crypts . They are majestic figures for the most part , idealized by the sculptor , and yet probably not far beyond nature ; for the imperial dignity was not hereditary , but given to the man chosen for it , and the choice was often a worthy one . They were lead1871.1 // ers in character as well as station , and it is right to give their images the hearing of men strong in war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to be revived in our own day , and the sceptre of Barbarossa and Rudolph of Hapsburg to be extended again over a united Germany , there had been few princes more worthy to hold it than that stately Hohenzollern whom circumstances have forced into wearing the spiked helmet against his will . In speaking of this great people so as to give the best idea of them in a short space , I have seized on what has seemed to me the most salient thing , and described various phases of their life as pervaded by it . The fighting spirit is bred in their bones . They are a nation of warriors almost as much as the Spartans , and stand ready on the instant to obey what almost any instant they may hear , the tap of the drum calling to arms . Such constant suggestions of war are painful . The spiked helmet is never an amiable head-dress ; " but , " says the representative Prussian , " there is no help for it . We have been a weak people wedged in between powerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wage almost constantly with one or the other of these , or all at once . And in what way is our situation different now ? Is Russia less ambitious ? How many swords has France beaten into ploughsbares ? What pruning-hooks have been made from the spears of Austria ? Let us know on what conditions we can live other than wearing our spiked helmets , and we will embrace them . " It is not an easy matter to argue down your resolute Prussian when he turns to you warmly , after you have been crying peace to him , and talks in this way . Perhaps the best hit you can make at him is to say , " Your neighbors can make out as bad a case against you as you against them . " Perhaps it is a necessity , since the world is what it is , that Europe should still be a place of bloody discord . America , however , is practically one , not a jarring company of nations , repeating the protracted agony of the Old World . We have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in every generation , settled only to be unsettled amid devastation and slaughter . We can grow forward unhindered , with hardly more than a feather 's weight of energy taken for fighting from the employments of peace . America stands indeed a nation blessed of God ; and there is nothing better worth her while to pray for than that a happier time may come to her giant brother over the sea ; such a heart may not be forever crushed or brutalized in carnage that forever repeats itself ; that the noble head may some time exchange the spiked helmet for the olive chaplet of peace . 7 .
