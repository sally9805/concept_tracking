txt The following is a copy of an official telegram received at the War Department to-day from Lieut . Overton , commanding at Camp Thomas , Arizona , addressed to Gen. Sherman , and bearing date of July 23 , regarding the need of supplies at San Carlos Indian Agency : " Mr. Hart , agent at San Carlos , informs me fie is entirely out of supplies for his Indians  --  has not a pound of anything for issue on the ' 26th . He has just received authority to purchase beef only , and only to the amount of $3,000 , which is insufficient for one week 's supply . He has telegraphed the condition of affairs , and asked for authority to purchase necessary supplies , but to no avail . He appears apprehensive of serious trouble , unless wants are instantly supplied . From nay conversation with several other persons belonging to San Carlos I think his fears are well grounded , and.serious trouble is not improbable . I feel it incumbent on me to make this report . " Gen. makes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depleted Arizona for and on account of Indian hostilities in the north , that we are not in good condition to meet hostilities in Arizona , If the Indians on the San Carlos reservation have no food , they will not stay there 10 starve , but will assuredly leave and steal and rob in order to live , and even if we had an abundant force , this could not be prevented . It would ho in every way far cheaper to feed than to fight them , and on every account I recommend they be fed . Time presses . " A letter to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs received on the 20th inst. from Indian Inspector Watkins , sets forth the immediate necessity for beef at San Carlos Agency . On the same day Agent Hart was telegraphed authority to purchase to the extent of the legal limit of $3,000 , and told to call for more as wanted . A telegram from Agent Hart , dated San Carlos , July 22 , says : " I have purchased 220.770 pounds of beef at 4 cents per pound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ informed that $5,000 had been placed to his credit in San Francisco for the purchase of additional supplies , until the arrival of stores under the new contracts for the present decal year . The officials at the Indian Office say that flour is undoubtedly at the agency by this time , and other goods lately contracted for in New-York are en route and will he there in a few days . The price paid by Agent Hart for beef-4 cents per pound  --  as against the new contract price of $2 871g per 100 pounds , the Indian Bureau claims is another illustration of the losses incurred by the Government and the wasting of Indian funds as a result of delay in passing the appropriation bills . The bond which accompanied the contract for the delivery of beef at the San Carlos Agency had to be returned for correction . When received again from Arizona , if correct , it will be approved , and the contractor and Agent informed by telegraph to deliver and receive . As it would have been impossible under existing law to transact this business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be attached to the Indian Office .
