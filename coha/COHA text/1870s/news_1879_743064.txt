txt The tenement-house agitation of last Winter has been productive of more than temporary effects . The appeal to the conscience of the community reached many who joined in no public efforts for reform . Private builders and landlords have sought to construct their houses on approved sanitary principles , and there are numerous " model tenements " now in process of construction by individuals which afford to tenants light and air , separate halls , ashchutes , ventilated closets , and the like , in the same manner with the best improved dwellings . Some are even erected on 25-foot lots , where a corner or an alley-way has allowed side-lights and air . A number of owners are reconstructing and reforming old dwellings , and a well-known lady missionary is attempting to do the work in New-York which Miss HILL did in London , in reforming the houses and their tenants . The various associations have not as yet accomplished much except in raising funds for future work . The principal one , of which Mr.W . BAYARD CUTTING , Mr. D. WILLIS JAMES , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and will , no doubt , before long begin operations in erecting a model tenement . Some societies are proposing to purchase land far up-town and build their tenements there . Others are planning to put up working men 's villages on Long Island , in East New-York . Still others look toward the crowded eastern quarter , with the view of erecting their model tenements near the old and worst class of tenement-houses . Some of these associations are on a purely business basis , while others are charities , and will appropriate their profits to putting up other houses , after the Peabody plan . It can not be said that the large landlords are interesting themselves much in these benevolent ? schemes , and yet there never was such an opportunity for a great capitalist to transmit a name which would be preserved in the gratitude of many generations as this movement for the reform of our greatest social evil . The Legislature , too , have taken up the matter . An act to amend the . Tenement act of 1867 , " for the improvement and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Committee on Cities in the Assembly , with the omission of one seetion. ( sixth . ) The Senate committee retains that section , but omits sections 1 and 2 , and this important . bill , which has been passed in the Senate , thus hangs fire between the ? two houses . This proposed act amends the old law in regard to the proper ventilation of ' tenement-houses , by requiring every such house to have a sky-light in the roof or at the top of the hall such as shall be approved by the Board of Health . It also demands a greater distance'between ? the front and rear buildings on a lot , and an open space of not less than ten feet between any tenement-house and ' the rear line of the lot . Furthermore , no continuous building used as tenement or lodging house is permitted to occupy more than 65 per cent . of the space of the lot . Careful provisions are made , too , as to the height of the rooms in these buildings , and every room is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air , or a ventilator over the door connected with a hall where there . are cross-currents of air . And  --  the most important provision of all ? no tenementhouse is hereafter permitted to be built with those nuisances and fever-nests , " dark bed-chambers . " The air space for each tenant is required to be at the least an average of 600 cubic feet , and in no ease are a greater number of occupants permitted than at the rate of one to every thirty square feet of the lot , which would make about eighty the maximum number of lodgers in any single-lot tenement-house . There are other useful and practical provisions in the new law , which need not here be detailed . The law is sorely required in the City . If properly executed by the Board of Health , it will tend to remedy innumerable abuses , and will second admirably the efforts of private individuals in reforming our great evils . It would be a public calamity if it should fail to become a law by a disagreement on unimportant details between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Board of Health can have no excuse for not thoroughly carrying out its provisions . And with the law and the ' private associations working together , we should see the great reform fairly begun .
