txt Every one remembers how prolonged and intense was the cold of last Winter . Such weather bad not been known in this City for many years . The East and North Rivers were bridged over by the ice ; water-pipes were frozen in nearly every house in the City , and the clouds contracted a confirmed habit of snowing upon the slightest provocation , which they kept up until late in the Spring . The weather affected commerce , comfort , and the temper of the people . Men noted for their geniality looked gloomily at coal-dealers , and gentle women expressed fierce longings to kill a plumber . Many sanguine souls found consolation in predicting that the extreme cold would be made up to us by the excessive heat of the next Summer ; but they were signally disappointed . Rather less than the usual amount of solar beat was served out to us in July , while cold rains occurred with daily regularity all through the month of August . And now it is no longer possible to . ignore the probability that we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and at least as long as that of last year . The signs all point in that direction . September was cool , and October so far has been uncomfortably chilly . The Weather Bureau daily predicts , with depressing monotony , areas of low barometer , and cloudy weather with falling temperature . There is an air of satisfaction pervading the plumbers which is unquestionably due to a joyful looking for of bursting pipes and flooded bath-rooms , and a general hilarity might have been noticed at all the coal yards the other day when the telegraph announced that the streets of Montreal were white with snow . That our Winters are growing longer , and our Summers shorter and cooler , has been noticed for some years , and the change has had a marked influence upon animal and vegetable life . The white linen coat which was once so frequently seen in . July and August has become virtually extinct . The more hardy white trousers still survive the change in the climate , but their numbers have been in a good degree kept up by importations from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white trousers soon deteriorate , dwindle away , and ultimately vanish . On the other hand , ' strange varieties of coarse and vigorous clothing , belonging originally to high northern latitudes , have made their appearance here . The . Ulster coat was introduced among us only some two years ago , , and has since multiplied with a rapidity that reminds one of the history of the migration and increase of the Norway rat . The rough Scotch woolens , which were as unfamiliar to the last generation of New-Yorkers as were kangaroos and wombats , are now firmly domesticated here , and have in -a great measure taken the place of certain softer and less robust cloths which flourish iu mild latitudes . A gradual change of dogs has also been slowly going on . The Scotch and the Skye terriers have driven out the more delicate blackand-tan dogs ; and the wolfish Spitz , who is constantly sniffing imaginary polar bears under the sofa and . behind the flour-barrel , has become as common as was once the King Charles spaniel . If these steady changes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before very long find ourselves wearing fur coats in August , and driving reindeer in December . It is idle to speculate as to the causes of the climatic change which has brought about these results . Neither a supposed alteration in the direction of the Gulf Stream , nor the alleged machinations of President GRANT to secure a third term , will satisfactorily account for it . After all , if it is not carried tO the point of freezing up our harbor , the increased length of our Winters may prove rather an advantage than otherwise , and we may yet see Gov . TILDEN arraying himself in a seal-skin overcoat , and boldly assorting that the change in the climate is due entirely to his Canal Reforms . Very probably the early frosts of the present Autumn saved us from an epidemic of yellow fever . If so , that fact alone ought to reconcile us to the discomforts of a chilly October , and enable us to bear with fortitude the cold and plumbers of the approaching Winter .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
