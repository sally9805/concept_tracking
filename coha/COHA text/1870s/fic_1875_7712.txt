Trowbridge , J. T. ( John Townsend ) , 1827-1916 : MY BROTHER BEN . from The vagabonds ( 1875 ) From the door where I stand I can see his fair land Sloping up to a broad sunny height ; The meadows new-shorn , and the green wavy corn , The buckwheat all blossoming white : There a gay garden blooms , there are cedars like plumes , And a rill from the mountain leaps up in a fountain , And shakes its glad locks in the light . He dwells in the hall where the long shadows fall On the checkered and cool esplanade ; I live in a cottage secluded and small , By a gnarly old apple-tree 's shade : Side by side in the glen , I and my brother Ben ,  --  Just the river between us , with borders as green as The banks where in childhood we played . But now nevermore upon river or shore He runs or he rows by my side ; For I am still poor , like our father before , And he , full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show , there is no room , you know , In the very fine carriage he gained by his marriage For an old-fashioned brother to ride . His wife , with her gold , gives him friends , I am told , With whom she is rather too gay ,  --  The senator 's son , who is ready to run For her gloves and her fan , night or day , And to gallop beside , when she wishes to ride : O , no doubt ' t is an honor to see smile upon her Such world-famous fellows as they ! Ah , brother of mine , while you sport , while you dine , While you drink of your wine like a lord , You might curse , one would say , and grow jaundiced and gray , With such guests every day at your board ! But you sleek down your rage like a pard in its cage , And blink in meek fashion through the bars of your passion , As husbands like you can afford . For still you must think , as you eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dogs and your guns , How your pleasures are bought with the wealth that she brought , And you were once hunted by duns . O , I envy you not your more fortunate lot : I ' ve a wife all my own in my own little cot , And with happiness , which is far better than riches , The cup of our love overruns . We have bright , rosy girls , fair as ever an earl 's , And the wealth of their curls is our gold ; O , their lisp and their laugh , they are sweeter by half Than the wine that you quaff red and old ! We have love-lighted looks , we have work , we have books , Our boys have grown manly and bold , And they never shall blush , when their proud cousins brush From the walls of their college such cobwebs of knowledge As careless young fingers may hold . Keep your pride and your cheer , for we need them not here , And for me far too dear they would prove ; For gold is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is all loss , without love . Yon severing tide is not fordless or wide ,  --  The soul 's blue abysses our households divide : Down through the still river they deepen forever , Like the skies it reflects from above . Still my brother thou art , though our lives lie apart , Path from path , heart from heart , more and more . O , I have not forgot ,  --  O , remember you not Our room in the cot by the shore ? And a night soon will come , when the murmur and hum Of our days shall be dumb evermore , And again we shall lie side by side , you and I , Beneath the green cover you helped to lay over Our honest old father of yore . Trowbridge , J. T. ( John Townsend ) , 1827-1916 : BEYOND . from The vagabonds ( 1875 ) From her own fair dominions , Long since , with shorn pinions , My spirit was banished : But around her still hover , in vigils and dreams , Ethereal visitants , voices , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her Long vanished . Through the listening night , With mysterious flight , Pass those winged intimations : Like stars shot from heaven , their still voices fall to me ; Far and departing , they signal and call to me , Strangely beseeching me , Chiding , yet teaching me Patience Then at times , oh ! at times , To their luminous climes I pursue as a swallow ! To the river of Peace , and its solacing shades , To the haunts of my lost ones , in heavenly glades , With strong aspirations Their pinions ' vibrations I follow . O heart , be thou patient ! Though here I am stationed A season in durance , The chain of the world I will cheerfully wear ; For , spanning my soul like a rainbow , I bear , With the yoke of my lowly Condition , a holy Assurance ,  --  That never in vain Does the spirit maintain Her eternal allegiance : Through suffering and yearning , like Infancy learning Its lesson , we linger ; then , skyward returning , On plumes fully grown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ J. T. ( John Townsend ) , 1827-1916 : MIDWINTER. from The vagabonds ( 1875 ) The speckled sky is dim with snow , The light flakes falter and fall slow ; Athwart the hill-top , rapt and pale , Silently drops a silvery veil ; And all the valley is shut in By flickering curtains gray and thin . But cheerily the chickadee Singeth to me on fence and tree ; The snow sails round him , as he sings , White as the down of angels ' wings . I watch the slow flakes as they fall On bank and brier and broken wall ; Over the orchard , waste and brown , All noiselessly they settle down , Tipping the apple-boughs , and each Light quivering twig of plum and peach . On turf and curb and bower-roof The snow-storm spreads its ivory woof ; It paves with pearl the garden-walk ; And lovingly round tattered stalk And shivering stem its magic weaves A mantle fair as lily-leaves . The hooded beehive , small and low , Stands like a maiden in the snow ; And the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day it snows : the sheeted post Gleams in the dimness like a ghost ; All day the blasted oak has stood A muffled wizard of the wood ; Garland and airy cap adorn The sumach and the wayside thorn , And clustering spangles lodge and shine In the dark tresses of the pine . The ragged bramble , dwarfed and old , Shrinks like a beggar in the cold ; In surplice white the cedar stands , And blesses him with priestly hands . Still cheerily the chickadee Singeth to me on fence and tree : But in my inmost ear is heard The music of a holier bird ; And heavenly thoughts , as soft and white As snow-flakes , on my soul alight , Clothing with love my lonely heart , Healing with peace each bruisd part , Till all my being seems to be Transfigured by their purity .

Swiftly vanish the wild fleet tracks Before the rifle and woodman 's axe : But hark to the coming of unseen feet , Pattering by night through the city street ! Each wolf that dies in the woodland brown Lives a spectre and haunts the town . By square and market they slink and prowl , In lane and alley they leap and howl . All night they snuff and snarl before The poor patched window and broken door . They paw the clapboards and claw the latch , At every crevice they whine and scratch . Their tongues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the living blood within . Icy keen are the teeth that tear , Red as ruin the eyes that glare . Children crouched in corners cold Shiver in tattered garments old , And start from sleep with bitter pangs At the touch of the phantoms ' viewless fangs . Weary the mother and worn with strife , Still she watches and fights for life . But her hand is feeble , and weapon small : One little needle against them all ! In evil hour the daughter fled From her poor shelter and wretched bed . Through the city 's pitiless solitude To the door of sin the wolves pursued . Fierce the father and grim with want , His heart is gnawed by the spectres gaunt . Frenzied stealing forth by night , With whetted knife to the desperate fight , He thought to smite the spectres dead , But he smites his brother man instead . O you that listen to stories told , When hearths are cheery and nights are cold , Weep no more at the tales you hear , The danger is close , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name , Marvel not at the maiden 's shame . Pass not by with averted eye The door where the stricken children cry . But when the beat of the phantom feet Sounds by night through the stormy street , Follow thou where the spectres glide ; Stand like Hope by the mother 's side ; And be thyself the angel sent To shield the hapless and innocent . He giveth little who gives but tears , He giveth his best who aids and cheers . He does well in the forest wild Who slays the monster and saves the child ; But he does better , and merits more , Who drives the wolf from the poor man 's door . Trowbridge , J. T. ( John Townsend ) , 1827-1916 : THE MASKERS. from The vagabonds ( 1875 ) Yesternight , as late I strayed Through the orchard 's mottled shade ,  --  Coming to the moonlit alleys , Where the sweet south-wind , that dallies All day with the Queen of Roses , All night on her breast reposes ,  --  Drinking from the dewy blooms , Silences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Long , deep draughts of pure delight ,  --  Quick the shaken foliage parted , And from out its shadows darted Dwarf-like forms , with hideous faces , Cries , contortions , and grimaces . Still I stood beneath the lonely , Sighing lilacs , saying only ,  --  " Little friends , you ca n't alarm me ; Well I know you would not harm me ! " Straightway dropped each painted mask , Sword of lath , and paper casque , And a troop of rosy girls Ran and kissed me through their curls . Caught within their net of graces , I looked round on shining faces . Sweetly through the moonlit alleys Rang their laughter 's silver sallies . Then along the pathway , light With the white bloom of the night , I went peaceful , pacing slow , Captive held in arms of snow . Happy maids ! of you I learn Heavenly maskers to discern ! So , when seeming griefs and harms Fill life 's garden with alarms , Through its inner walks enchanted I will ever move undaunted . Love hath messengers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they come to do us kindness ,  --  And but for our tears and blindness , We should see , through each disguise , Cherub cheeks and angel eyes . Trowbridge , J. T. ( John Townsend ) , 1827-1916 : STRAWBERRIES from The vagabonds ( 1875 ) Little Pearl Honeydew , six years old , From her bright ear parted the curls of gold . And laid her head on the strawberry-bed , To hear what the red-cheeked berries said . Their cheeks were blushing , their breath was sweet , She could almost hear their little hearts beat ; And the tiniest lisping , whispering sound That ever you heard came up from the ground . " Little friends , " she said , " I wish I knew How it is you thrive on sun and dew ! " And this is the story the berries told To little Pearl Honeydew , six years old . " You wish you knew ? and so do we ! But we ca n't tell you , unless it be That the same kind Power that cares for you Takes care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and nestled below Our coverlid of wind-woven snow , We peep and listen , all winter long , For the first spring day and the bluebird 's song . " When the swallows fly home to the old brown shed And the robins build on the bough overhead , Then out from the mould , from the darkness and cold , Blossom and runner and leaf unfold . " Good children then , if they come near , And hearken a good long while , may hear A wonderful tramping of little feet ,  --  So fast we grow in the summer heat . " Our clocks are the flowers ; and they count the hours Till we can mellow in suns and showers , With warmth of the west-wind and heat of the south , A ripe red berry for a ripe red mouth . " Apple-blooms whiten , and peach-blooms fall , And roses are gay by the garden-wall , Ere the daisy 's dial gives the sign That we can invite little Pearl to dine . " The days are longest , the month is June , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is fine , and our feast is spread With a green cloth and berries red . " Just take us betwixt your finger and thumb  --  And quick , O quick ! for , see ! there come Tom on all-fours , and Martin the man , And Margaret , picking as fast as they can ! " O dear ! if you only knew how it shocks Nice berries like us to be sold by the box , And eaten by strangers , and paid for with pelf , You would surely take pity , and eat us yourself ! " And this is the story the small lips told To dear Pearl Honeydew , six years old , When she laid her head on the strawberry-bed To hear what the red-cheeked berries said . Trowbridge , J. T. ( John Townsend ) , 1827-1916 : THE SUMMER SQUALL. from The vagabonds ( 1875 ) " Goodness gracious ! what 's the matter ? What a clamor , what a clatter ! Gracious goodness ! was there ever Such a terrible  --  I never ! Run and shut the chamber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothes upon the line go dancing  --  Where ' s the basket ? Bring the pans in ! O dear ! " For now the rain is coming ; You hear the chimney swallows drumming , With a mighty fuss and flutter , While the chimneys moan and mutter ; And see ! the crumbled soot is flying All over the pork that Jane was frying . What a clamor , what a clatter ! The swift , slant rain begins to patter ; The geese they cackle , cow-bells rattle , The pelted and affrighted cattle , Across the pasture , helter-skelter , Run to the nearest trees for shelter ; The old hen calls her skulking chickens ; The fowls fly home ; the darkness thickens ; The roadside maples twist and swing , The barn-door flaps a broken wing ; The old well-pail sets out to travel , And drags the chain across the gravel ; In vain the farmer 's wife is trying To catch the clothes as they are flying ; Nine new tin pans are bruised and battered , And all about the door-yard scattered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Come tumult , tempest , and disaster . The wind has blown the haycocks over ; The rain has spoiled the unraked clover ; With half a load the horses hurry , And one half  --  flung on in the flurry , Invisible pitchforks tearing , tossing  --  Was blown into the creek in crossing ; And thicker , thicker , faster , faster , Come whirlwind , tempest , and disaster . Now , all without the storm is roaring , The house is shut , the rain is pouring ; Incessantly its fury lashes The roof , the clapboards , and the sashes ; The fowls have gone to roost at noon , We ' ll have the candles lighted soon . In flies the door ,  --  the farmer enters Dripping and drenching from his adventures ; Finds Jenny sighing , baby crying , The frightened children hushed , and lying Huddled upon the bed together ; Mother storming , like the weather ; With pans , and chairs , and baskets , which in Wet confusion crowd the kitchen . But Hugh is not the man to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleeve , And laughs , and jests , and wrings his blouse :  --  His very presence in the house Dispels like sunshine the bewildering And awful gloom that wrapped the children . Old Farmer Hugh ! the whole world through , I find no nobler soul than you ! A heart to welcome every comer , Alike the Winter and the Summer . When Fortune , with her fickle chances , Now smiles , now frowns , retreats , advances , To make poor mortals mourn the loss of her , You , trustful heart and true philosopher , Securely centred in your station , Yourself the pivot of gyration , Look forth serenely patient , seeing All things come round to your true being . O thus , like you , when sudden squalls Of angry fortune strike my walls , Spoil expectation 's unraked clover , And blow my hopes like haycocks over ,  --  When storm and darkness , wild , uncertain , Deluge my sky with their black curtain ,  --  O then , like you , brave Farmer Hugh ! May I , with vision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , The gleam and gladness of to-morrow . Trowbridge , J. T. ( John Townsend ) , 1827-1916 : THE WONDERFUL SACK . from The vagabonds ( 1875 ) The apple-boughs half hid the house Where lived the lonely widow ; Behind it stood the chestnut wood , Before it spread the meadow . She had no money in her till , She was too poor to borrow ; With her lame leg she could not beg ; And no one cheered her sorrow . Her best black gown was faded brown , Her shoes were all in tatters , With not a pair for Sunday wear : Said she , " It little matters ! " Nobody asks me now to ride , My garments are not fitting ; And with my crutch I care not much To hobble off to meeting . " I still preserve my Testament , And though the Acts are missing , And Luke is torn , and Hebrews worn , On Sunday ' t is a blessing . " And other days I open it Before me on the table , And there I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I am able . " One evening she had closed the book , But still she sat there knitting ; " Meow-meow ! " complained the old black cat ; " Mew-mew ! " the spotted kitten . And on the hearth , with sober mirth , " Chirp , chirp ! " replied the cricket . ' T was dark ,  --  but hark ! " Bow-ow ! " the bark Of Ranger at the wicket ! Is Ranger barking at the moon ? Or what can be the matter ? What trouble now ? " Bow-ow ! bow-ow ! "  --  She hears the old gate clatter . " It is the wind that bangs the gate , And I must knit my stocking ! " But hush !  --  what ' s that ? Rat-tat ! rat-tat ! Alas ! there ' s some one knocking ! " Dear me ! dear me ! who can it be ? Where , where is my crutch-handle ? " She rubs a match with hasty scratch ; She can not light the candle ! Rat-tat ! scratch , scratch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corner . Rat-tat ! scratch , scratch ! Up flies the latch ,  --  " Good evening , Mrs. Warner ! " Blue burns at last the tardy match , And dim the candle glimmers ; Along the floor beside the door The cold white moonlight shimmers . The old cat 's tail ruffs big and black , Loud barks the old dog Ranger ; The kitten spits and lifts her back , Her eyes glare on the stranger . His limbs are strong , his beard is long , His hair is dark and wavy ; Upon his back he bears a sack ; His staff is stout and heavy . " My way is lost , and with the frost I feel my fingers tingle . " Then from his back he slips the sack ,  --  Ho ! did you hear it jingle ? " Nay , keep your chair ! while you sit there , I ' ll take the other corner . " " I 'm sorry , sir , I have no fire . " " No matter , Mrs. Warner . " He shakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widow gazes : Ho , ho ! the chimney ' s full of wood ! Ha , ha ! the wood it blazes ! Ho , ho ! ha , ha ! the merry fire ! It sputters and it crackles ! Snap , snap ! flash , flash ! old oak and ash Send out a million sparkles . The stranger sits upon his sack Beside the chimney-corner , And rubs his hands before the brands , And smiles on Mrs. Warner . She feels her heart beat fast with fear , But what can be the danger ? " Can I do aught for you , kind sir ? " " I 'm hungry , " quoth the stranger . " Alas ! " she said , " I have no food For boiling or for baking ! " " I ' ve food , " quoth he , " for you and me " ; And gave his sack a shaking . Out rattled knives , and forks , and spoons , Twelve eggs , potatoes plenty , One large soup-dish , two plates of fish , And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprise , As well as she was able , Saw , following these , two roasted geese , A tea-urn , and a table . Strange , was it not ? each dish was hot , Not even a plate was broken ; The cloth was laid , and all arrayed , Before a word was spoken . " Sit up ! sit up ! and we will sup , Dear madam , while we 're able . " Said she , " The room is poor and small For such a famous table . " Again the stranger shakes the sack , The walls begin to rumble ; Another shake ! the rafters quake ! You ' d think the roof would tumble . Shake , shake ! the room grows high and large , The walls are painted over ; Shake , shake ! out fall four chairs , in all , A bureau , and a sofa . The stranger stops to wipe the drops That down his face are streaming . " Sit up ! sit up ! and we will sup , " Quoth he , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her crutch , He kindly sprang to aid her . " All this , " said she , " is too much for me ! " Quoth he , " We 'll have a waiter . " Shake , shake , once more ! and from the sack Out popped a little fellow , With elbows bare , bright eyes , sleek hair , And trousers striped with yellow . His legs were short , his body plump , His cheek was like a cherry ; He turned three times ; he gave a jump ; His laugh rang loud and merry . He placed his hand upon his heart , And scraped and bowed so handy ! " Your humble servant , sir , " he said , Like any little dandy . The widow laughed a long , loud laugh , And up she started , screaming ; When ho ! and lo ! the room was dark !  --  She ' d been asleep and dreaming ! The stranger and his magic sack , The dishes and the fishes , The geese and things , had taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all was gone ! She sat alone ; Her hands had dropped their knitting . " Meow-meow ! " the cat upon the mat ; " Mew-mew ! mew-mew ! " the kitten . The hearth is bleak ,  --  and hark ! the creak ,  --  " Chirp , chirp ! " the lonesome cricket . " Bow-ow ! " says Ranger to the moon ; The wind is at the wicket . And still she sits , and as she knits She ponders o'er the vision : " I saw it written on the sack ,  --  ' A Cheerful Disposition . ' " I know God sent the dream , and meant To teach this useful lesson , That out of peace and pure content Springs every earthly blessing . " Said she , " I 'll make the sack my own ! I 'll shake away all sorrow ! " She shook the sack for me to-day ; She 'll shake for you to-morrow . She shakes out hope ; and joy , and peace , And happiness come after ; She shakes out smiles for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For poor and rich ,  --  no matter which ,  --  For young folks or for old folks , For strong and weak , for proud and meek , For warm folks and for cold folks ; For children coming home from school , And sometimes for the teacher ; For white and black she shakes the sack ,  --  In short , for every creature . And everybody who has grief , The sufferer and the mourner , From far and near , come now to hear Kind words from Mrs. Warner . They go to her with heavy hearts , They come away with light ones ; They go to her with cloudy brows , They come away with bright ones . All love her well , and I could tell Of many a cheering present Of fruits and things their friendship brings , To make her fireside pleasant . She always keeps a cheery fire ; The house is painted over ; She has food in store , and chairs for four , A bureau , and a sofa . She says these seem just like her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw it written on the sack ,  --  ' A Cheerful Disposition ! ' "
