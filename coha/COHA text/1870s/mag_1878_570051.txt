ARTICLE VJ. - HOW TO DEAL WITH COMMUNISM . WE are confronted by a real , though not an immediate danger . Communism could formerly have taken no root in America . rphe industries of the country were once prominently agricultural , and manufactures and commerce were scattered among many small establishments . Capital and labor were then united in the same hands , and consequently were not disposed to quarrel ; every industrious man had or expected to have capital . The hill tops of New England were centres of commercial as well as of intellectual life , and were inhabited by a people too contented to dream of social changes , and too law-abiding to tolerate anything that threatened to disturb social order . At present these conditions are changed . The villages on the hill tops are deserted , and in the valleys , where stood , perhaps , in former times single grist-mills , there are manufacturing villages , owned by a few men and having a dense population of operatives . Conditions most favorable to order and harmony have thus yielded to conditions favorable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in like manner , given place to railroads , and scattered mercantile industries have largely been superseded by centralized establishments ; changes which are favorable to the quantitative increase of wealth , but which are not favorable to its equal distribution , nor to the national strength which it might have given to us . We live , moreover , under a government which , instead of uniformly repressing socialistic tendencies with a strong hand , sometimes finds it for its interest to flatter and ally to itself the classes among which such tendencies show themselves . How to deal with communism , under such circumstances , is a grave question of the present and for the future . Simple repression is not a method which promises success but this is the first step to be taken . The man who , driven by hunger , makes a murderous assault on some one for his money , must be disarmed before he is fed . If he be a real murderer he must be imprisoned or hanged ; but , if he be a well-meaning // man temporarily crazed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unj ust would it be to reduce him to starvation by the exercise of some power which chance had given us , to watch him indifferently during the process , and then , when despair had driven him to an overt action , to violently take his life . Among the adherents of communism there is a large element that is simply murderous , and this deserves only the murderer 's fate . This element is apt to be the more noisy and prominent . It is possible that an indefinitely large proportion of declared communists in this country may be of worthless or criminal character ; but this class can not constitute the permanent strength of the movement . Criminality is a source of weakness everywhere , and the existence of such an element in organizations of workingmen is the most fatal danger to the success of those organizations themselves . If our workingmen were wise they would beware of such alliances . It is in another and a better class of persons infected with communistic doctrines that the real strength of the movement lies ; and , in dealing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Simple repression is more difficult and less just ; and hence the necessity that the government , while arming itself for the instant suppression of attempts against the life of the State , and sternly rebuking all wavering on the part of its members , should , at the same time , possess some knowledge of the class with whom it is dealing , and of the causes which incite them to their dangerous course . If these movements have any basis in reason , we should know it , and remove the danger by removing its cause . It is what physicians call " deep acting remedies " that we need ; not remedies that act only on symptoms . If there are wrongs to be redressed , they should be redressed at once ; if there are evils to be remedied , they should be remedied promptly . It is no credit to us to do this solely when threatened by serious outbreaks ; but it is better to do it then than not at all . No social disturbances which we have as yet experienced compare in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are the causes of those disturbances , and which , whether they result in riotous outbreaks or not , can ultimately mean only death to the nation . To violently repress the outbreaks , while giving ourselves no concern // about the greater evils which are their cause would be murderous on our part ; it would be virtually erecting a wall of bayonets , and then driving our fellow citizens bare-breasted upon it . Let us avoid this responsibility . The candid man is sometimes the loser in a discussion . He can not always expect equal candor in his opponents ; his concessions are liable to be construed as an enforced surrendering of ground , and his cause to be weakened accordingly . This is a risk , however , which we must take in the present instance . Candor on the part of the friends of social order is the first requisite in dealing with communism . Until we can look at the social system with the eyes of those who snifer from its evils , we can not hope to oppose this movement with effect . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and some imaginary grievances . Because it is wild and lawless , it demands the powerful restraint of army and police . Because there is something of truth at its foundation , as there always is in the case of an error that obtains extensive currency , it demands a more permanent remedy . Real wrongs must be righted , and , to that end , must be seen and stated as frankly as they would be stated by communists themselves . The duty of candor is not an easy one . The man who would , without a mirror , obtain a view of himself from a distance of ten feet , would have scarcely more difficulty in gaining his object than the member of a social organism who would obtain a completely external view of its condition . Our modes of thinking are conventional ; we think as others think and as we have ourselves acquired the habit of thinking by intercourse with others . Everything is measured by standards fixed by habit and argeement . The child has a marked advantage , in this respect , in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current practices of society the child can teach the experienced man . Our best mode of procedure , in attempting to obtain an external and unbiased view of the society in which we live will be , first , by a mental effort , to free ourselves of conventional prejudice , and to obtain , as far as possible , the clear and natural impressions of the child and the uncorrupted man ; and , secondly , in this state of mind , to study earlier social // conditions , of which our view is actually an external one , and to ascertain the points of similarity between the practices of these societies and those of our own . By this method our social usages , which may seem , at first glance , to present little opportunity for a radical reform , may perhaps be shown to be as capable of improvement as the primitive societies which have preceded us . The same force which has been at work modifying social and economic practices for the better , will be seen , if we are successful , to be equally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marked practical effects . Individual conduct is the resultant of two opposing forces , selfishness , on the one hand , and the sense of right , on the other . When men are united in an organized society , there necessarily exist common ethical ideas , and a national code of right and wrong is the result . The general practices of the society are then determined by the same forces as those of the individual , namely , selfishness and the sense of right . The national code of right and wrong is influenced by economic conditions ; what is necessary , under the circumstances , is regarded as right . On the other hand , prevailing economic practices are largely determined by the national code . National ideas of right and wrong , thus , regularly produce economic effects , the most important of which is a restraint on unlimited competition . Individual consciences are in advance of the national code , and their influence changes it for the better as soon as the economic conditions permit . The code and the industrial system have both been progressive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the end . Startling results are produced by the nonrecognition of these truths . Primitive tribes obtain a precarious subsistence by the ap . propriation of natural products ; such tribes naturally crowd one another , as numbers increase , and wars of extermination result . Prisoners of war are killed under the system , and apparently from necessity . They can not be maintained , and if armed for hunting , will retaliate on their captors . Killing them is the only alternative , and is recognized as right . From killing prisoners , it is but a step to utilizing them as food ; and when cannibalism is once established , it is not likely to limit itself to the eating of those who have been necessarily // killed , but leads to the projecting of warlike expeditions for the simple purpose of capturing prisoners for food . With advancing intelligence , it may be supposed that the general conscience declared itself against such predatory incursions , Gradually the protest may have come to assert itself against the killing of prisoners at all ; but as long as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not likely that the protest was very effective . Here was , then , a system involving a wrong , a protest against the wrong , and a want of knowledge of the proper method of removing it . We shall find analogous conditions existing at the present time . There is now a system involving wrongs of scarcely less magnitude than those we have been considering ; there is a disposition to remove these wrongs , though not a sufficiently active one ; and there is a want of knowledge as to methods . The power of conscience was effective , in primitive times , in producing this important result ; it induced an inclination to abandon the practice of cannibalism , to search for means for its abolition , and to use such means as quickly as they might be presented . The desired opportunity offered itself in the transition from the primitive to the nomadic mode of living ; and in this condition the public sense of right proved effective in the more or less complete suppression both of the eating of prisoners and of the killing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men thus effected a social revolution , and produced an economic effect , which was of the nature of a restraint on unlimited competition . At first men competed with each other , in primitive fashion , for the possession of their own bodies , and he who bid highest , in the way of hard knocks , became the eventual possessor . The public conscience , in suppressing this particular mode of economic action , imposed on competition the first of a series of restraints , which series is by no means completed at the present time . Pure selfishness would produce such savage competition as we have noticed . Selfishness moderated by a public code of right produces competition of a milder sort . Selfishness completely subjected to an enlightened conscience would produce results of a different kind from any which political economy is accustomed to consider . It is a dangerous mistake to extol competition , as // such , too highly , and to regard all attacks upon it as revolutionary . The nomadic mode of life made it possible to maintain prisoners , but necessitated the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done without weapons and , hence , without great danger to the captors . Slavery , at its origin , appears to have been the most merciful of two possible modes of disposing of prisoners ; it must have received the enthusiastic approval of philanthropic men , and must have been fully j ustifled by conscience , public and private . From a humane institution slavery was liable rapidly to degenerate into a cruel one . It became pecuniarily profitable , and persons were sought in war for their services , as they were formerly sought for grosser uses . Tn more or less cruel forms it continued , as we know , to our own times . The tardiness with which the public conscience asserted itself against the system was due , in this case as in primitive times , to an apparent economic necessity . Society had become organized , and from this very organization sprung the need of continuing slavery . It was a part of an economic system . During the later Roman period , for instance , it seemed necessary to successful agriculture ; and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Competition prevented an individual from contending against the system , since the emancipation of slaves who were essential to his success would have reduced himself and family to poverty . Although a single individual was comparatively powerless to oppose the system as long as it lasted , the system itself was destined to yield to a greater force . The final abolition of slavery is traceable to the same influence which abolished the cannibalism of primitive times , and is another instance of moral force overcoming an apparent economic necessity , and changing an established mode of industry . The present industrial system is an improvement on the preceding , but is by no means ideally perfect ; and it is an unfortunate error to defend it , in all its particulars , in works on political economy . Communism is a protest against the evils of the system from those who suffer by them , and are careless as to the method by which they remedy them . The sufferers // under any system always make their protest against it in an irregular manner . Slaves rise in insurrection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ armed violence and general confiscation of property . These are not the classes of men , nor are these the methods , by which reforms are to be effected . Such attempts are almost always suppressed , and should be so . In order that the suppression may be permanent , however , the evils assailed must be remedied by the proper method . The characteristic of the present period is the high degree to which social organization is carried , and the consequently contracted limits open to the action of the individual will . iDivision of labor has superseded isolated production . A producer now finds a market for his products in society , and , to that end , must sell as cheaply as his competitors . If he has laborers in his employment , and if other employers reduce their laborers to the lowest possible wages , he will be compelled to adopt a similar course or lose his customers . The books tell us that " society buys where it can buy the cheapest ; " and our observation partly confirms the statement . A benevolent employer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starve them ; and the general effect of this necessity in practical life , and of the teaching of it , in scientific works , as an inevitable law of the system , is such that the reluctance which men feel to the process is largely removed . The system is hardening . While competition at present is more general and more grinding in its effects on men than at previous periods , it is more refined and orderly in its methods . Conscience , public and private , not only is more enlightened , but has , in part , received the confirmation of positive law , and it limits within narrower boundaries the action of selfish motives . The man who sees a purse in his neighbor 's hand does not compete with him for it , as the primitive man would havc done , by a contest of physical strength . The power of conscience , partly codified in law , partly uncodified , prescribes the modes in which this competition may take place ; though it still takes place by the legal method . The difference between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this moral force . The practical results of the present system present a much // less favorable contrast with those of past systems ; and this fact shows that conscience still has as m uch to do for the economic condition of the world as it has yet done . The wild barbarity of primitive times has given place to the more refined and systematic cruelty of organized society ; arid if the brutalizing influence of this system were not counteracted by a higher development of the force of conscience , the present would indeed be a fallen condition in comparison with the past . Slavery presented a competitive operation in which the strong obtained permanent command of the labor of the weak . The particular mode in which this was accomplished has been changed ; the identical forces which accomplished the effect are no longer employed for that object ; the change , however , is more in means and modes than in actual results . We do not enslave men now-a-days . The emancipation proclamation ended all that , did it not ? We offer a man a pittance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us from morning till night or starve ; but we do not coerce him . ft is at his option to choose whether he will work or not ; he is free , you observe ! We do not eat men-precisely . We consume the product of their labor , and they may have virtually worked body and soul into it ; but we do it by such indirect and refined methods that it does not generally occur to us that we are cannibals . We kill men , it is true ; but not with cudgels in open fight . We do it slowly , and frequently take the precaution to kill the soul first ; and we do it in an orderly and systematic manner . Indeed we have any number of books and learned professors to tell us precisely in accordance with what laws we may kill them , and indeed must kill them , if we will not break with the system of which we are a part . Is it a compliment to society that it looks upon these things with indifference until they threaten to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creditable to us that , when outbreaks occur , we are chiefly anxious that they should be suppressed and the former conditions restored ? Poverty , the ignorance which results from poverty , and the moral debasement which results from poverty and ignorance , are greater evils in themselves than communistic agitations , which result from all three . An intelligent policy , in dealing with communism , will strike at the greater evils which are its causes . // Of course we are somewhat in the dark as to the best methods of attacking these evils ; but our condition would be in advance of what it is now if ignorance of methods were the only difficulty . Indifference is worse than ignorance ; if that were removed , our want of knowledge would present no fatal obstacle . The sense of right is a silent and slow-acting force , but , when aroused , it is resistless . It makes a way where it can not find one . It overcame obstacles in removing cannibalism and slavery , and it will overcome obstacles in removing the abuses of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general force were fairly in operation ; if working men were shown , by practical demonstration , that the intelligence and the wealth of the country were on their side , and that they need not look to demagogues for leaders , nor to criminals for associates . Some light we do possess as to practical methods . There are measures for securing that union of labor and capital in the same hands , which would effectually prevent discord between them . There are measures for the securing of small landed properties by laboring men , which would give them the benefits of property ownership , and commit them to the maintenance of social order . There are plans for coöperative societies of different kinds , some of them in successful operation , which secure an identity of interest between employers and employed . There are projects for aiding emigration , and giving to it an intelligent direction . There are some voluntary organizations which acquire their property legitimately , and are attempting to test the practicability of a new mode of living . There are measures looking to the gradual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development of manufacturing industries , where class distinctions are most strongly marked , and check correspondingly the development of agricultural industry , in which capital and labor are united in the same hands , and in which class contentions are almost impossible . There are methods yet undiscovered , waiting for intelligent men to develop and test them . It will fare ill with our country if she can not repress such disturbances as the more wild and vicious adherents of communism have lately threatened ; but it will fare many times // worse with her if she trusts solely to coercion . Should she succeed in restoring order , as she doubtless would , there would be blood upon her hands , and greater evils would remain than the social disturbances which had been quelled . Communism , in its more lawless form , proposes to reform society by methods of violence ; if we are to deal with this movement successfully , we must first endeavor to accomplish the needed reformation by methods of peace . We need to lay aside prejudice , to obtain an impartial view of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as identical in substance with those with which earlier societies have contended . We need to recognize the moral force by which these earlier evils have been removed , and to know that that force is still equally powerfuL We need to put this general force into operation and show to those who suffer from social abuses that they are not obliged to depend for assistance on demagogues and criminals . We need to use such practical methods of remedying these abuses as are already at command , and to seek to discover methods as yet unknown . We need , above all , to avoid the responsibility of suppressing disturbances of social order , but leaving the greater evils which are the causes of those disturbances to accomplish their slow destruction unhindered .
