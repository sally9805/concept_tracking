txt The St. Louis papers , and many others published in the South-west , have lately been making a ' combined effort to advance the interests of Mr. Scorn 's Texas and Pacific job . : ? Their main argument is that it will " open up " an enormous extent of fertile agricultural and grazing land . ? In doing this it will " solve the Indian ' problem , " save a great deal of money now paid by the Government for transportation of troops , weld more closely the bonds of union with the South and West , " and require only a guarantee ofinterest , for which the road furnish ample security . So far as we have seen , the advocates of the scheme do not seem to have heard of the Credit Mobilier scandal or of the failure of the Government to enforce its claims against the present Pacific roads , or of the history Of file Pacific Mail subsidy , or of any other- among the numerous disgraceful . and Aujurious , consequences to this country of listening to such arguments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To read their glowing appeals , one would imagine that our Government bad . reapd nothing but glory and gain from its previous experiments in the subsidy business , and . that the first duty ot every patriotic citizen was to cry aloud and spare not until the United States had guaranteed Mr. ' Eon Scores bonds to the desired amount . - Nor do these gentlemen who are so anxious to see the tax-payers ' money turned into Mr. Scores capacious pocket undertake to point out in the Federal Constitution any warrant for the action they urge on Congress . It seems to us that the old notion of an indefinite power derived from the authorization of Congress " to establish post roads " is by this time pretty-well worn ; and if it were not , it will be noticed that none of the arguments for Mr. SCOTT 'S charming speculation have any reference to this clause of the Constitution . The general idea of the subsidy men-is , perhaps , very fairly ' stated by a Chicago paper , which says : " The most successful nations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unless we profit by the example , we shall certainly fall behind in the race for commercial equality or supremacy . " And it adds that " paternalism " will be a safe thing for us , because we shall administer it " by and fur ourselves . " But this is an error . We shall do nothing of the kind . We never have done so , and we never can . " Paternalism " has inevitably been administered for us in the past by such men as Mr. OAKES Amt:s and Mr. STOCKWELL , and it is in this particular case sought to be administered by Mr. Tom Stow . The theory that , in such matters as these , our Government is " of the people , by the people , and for the people , " is a very costly mistake . " Every man his own father " is a neat cry for Mr. Scorr , who wishes us to pay out money for him under the interesting notion that we are benefiting ourselves ; but the fact is that while we can lie " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is Mr. Scorr and his associates alone who will enjoy any practical advantages . It may be as well to see to what extent this particular bit of , paternalism " is likely to involve the country . Mr. Scorr himself , as we understand him , estimates the length of the roads for which ho asks a guarantee of interest at 3,080 miles . At $40,000 a mile , the bonds would . reach $123,200,000 ; five per cent . on this sum would be $6,160,000 a year , which for forty years would be $246,400,000 . It is one of the pleasing eccentricities of these subsidy railways that interest paid by the United States is not recoverable until the bond is due ; and unless the provisions in the bill for repayment are better than those in the Union Pacific law , we should probably have the whole of this amount to raise , and the privilege of taking what might be left of the road as security . So any of our Congressmen who are inclined to support this measure for the sake of the good the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ net cost to start with at about two hundred and fifty millions . Those who vote fur it for the good they will get from it , after the fashion of the Pacific Mail subsidy , will probably not trouble themselves at all about the cost to the country . But . we must also remember that Mr. Scorrs scheme is only one of many . There are a dozen like it besieging Congress . The Northern Pacific follows close at Mr. SCOTT 'S heels . Then there is the " double-track freight railway , from tide - water on the Atlantic to the Missouri River , " for which an indefinite guarantee of bonds is proposed . There is the " Washington , Cincinnati and St. Louis Railway Company , to construct a narrow-gauge railway from tide-water to the Cities of St. Louis and Chicago , " with a similar proposition pending ; there is the " Oregon Central Pacific Railway and . Telegraph Line , " asking also for a guarantee of interest ; and there are several others which we need . not here cum:aerate . And after Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " it will have to consider the various canals across the Alleghanies , together with the New-Orleans Ship Canal and the ship canal connecting the Hudson with the St. Lawrence , and the various projects for slackwater and other navigation on the Southern and Western rivers . When it has accepted these it can refund the cotton tax , pay the Southern State debts , and go home with the comfortable assurance that it has adopted the " paternal " theory and at least a few of its most immediate consequences . But even then it will have only made a beginning .
