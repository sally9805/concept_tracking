txt Several important financial measures were introduced in Congress to-day . In the Senate , Mr. Bayard presented a joint resolution which has attracted considerable attention . It provides that United States notes shall be receivable for all dues to the United States except duties on imports , and shall not be otherwise legal tender , and that all such notes reissued shall be so inscribed on their face . The purpose of this resolution is not to interfere with the legal-tender quality of United States notes now outstanding , but to deprive those which come into the possession of the Government of this quality . Senator Bayard is quite confident that a majority of the Committee of Finance will favor this measure , and that it will be passed by the Senate . It is understood that Messrs . Lamar , Gordon , Garland , Hampton , and several other Southern Senators have expressed themselves in favor of the measure . If it should receive the same amount of support from the Republican side as is promised from the Democratic side , its passage will be insured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yesterday in the House , by Messrs . Fort and Price . It is the negative of the proposition of Secretary Sheraton to deprive United States notes of their legal-tender quality . In the House , two refunding bills were introduced by Messrs . Fernando Wood and Garfield , both of which extend the provisions of the refunding acts of 1870 and 187.1 , and might properly be termed supplements to those acts . Mr. Garfield 's bill authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to issue 4 per cent . bonds for the refunding of those 5 and 6 per cent . bonds which will mature In 1880 and 1881 , while Mr. Wood 's bill limits the amount of bonds to be issued to about $200,000,000 , and fixes the rate of interest at 312 per cent . per annum . The amount of bonds authorized to be issued by the refunding acts of 1870 and 1871 was limited to $1,500,000,000 , and about $1,300,000,000 have been issued in refunding the 6 per cents . and 10-40s . Mr. Wood 's bill would not roach far enough to refund all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and is therefore imperfect . Tho Garfield bill was prepared at the Treasury Department , and is the bill which will pass if any measure of this kind is acted upon favorably at the present session .
