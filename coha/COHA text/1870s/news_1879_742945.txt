txt MR : TILDEN 'S PLEA OF IGNORANCE . Mr. TILDEN 'S nephew was on the stand yesterday , and told what ho was willing to tell regarding the attempts to purchase Electoral votes . Ho admitted all that WEED had said the day before touching the corrupt negotiations in South Carolina , and ho confessed to others sot on foot by MARBLE in Florida . He had received telegrams conveying the terms proposed , and ho had answered , substantially accepting them . Ho chose to say that ho did this on his own responsibility ; when compelled to admit that ho could not have carried out the bargains into which he had entered from any means of his own , he said that lie had intended to lay the matter . before the Democratic National Committee . Meanwhile , ho sought to commit the officials whom it was proposed to corrupt , and to gain time , which ho thought would be an advantage . As to Mr. TILDEN 'S knowledge of , and connection with , the dirty . business , ho was very cautious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the transactions in which WEED was engaged ; that it was on account of this knowledge that , on the occasion of his visit to Baltimore , ho was ordered home by his uncle ; that the day after his return Mr. TILDEN scolded him , and said , " in very emphatic language , " that he " had no business " to do what lie had boon doing . WEED , on his cross-examination Wednesday evening , gave very much the same account of his treatment by TILDEN . We have thus arrived . at certainty on a point which was left open to inference only by WEED 'S evidence . We know that on the 21st of November , 1876 , Mr. TILDEN knew of what had been done to corrupt the Returning Board of South Carolina by one of his intimate political friends and aids , in complicity with his nephew , who was also his confidential political agent and his immediate personal representative in the campaign . Two years later Mr.1 TILDEN saw fit , in'a card to the public , , to convoy the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not say in so many words that he knew nothing of them ; but he did say that lie had not seen the telegrams relating to them or had the contents communicated to him . Ho added , in an elaborate sentence , drawn with a lawyer 's skill to appear full , while evading an essential point , that no such plots could have come within the range of his power without that power being instantly exerted to crush them out . As ho did not say that ho had ever engaged in crushing plots of this character , every one supposed that they had never come to his knowledge . Mr. TILDEN meant that every one should suppose this . If he did not make the direct assertion , if he chose to leave his ignorance to an inference which every one would draw , and yet which was not a necessary inference from his language , that was in the hope that the matter would go no further . He thought that , if no investigation were made , he would remain sufficiently sheltered behind his apparently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter has gone further , and the evidence of his own agents proves that lie did know the existence of the shameful plots of which ho wished the public to believe him ignorant . These agents also testify , that when he learned of the scheme proposed by WEED , and ' accepted by his nephew , he put a stop to it . Unluckily for Mr : TILDEN , ho has put himself in a position where this testimony is not so creditable to him as it otherwise would have been . If , when called on to explain his conduct , he had frankly declared that he ' knew of this rascality , but that the moment he learned of it he set his foot on it , the public would have believed and , for the most part , have thought better of him than his pre- vious career had enabled them to think . Then , the testimony of WEED and of his ' nephew would have confirmed his own statements . Now , it contradicts them . It shows him , apparently denying knowledge of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He has only himself to blame if people suspect that he has not yet told the whole truth , and that what he so studiously and with such infinite pains essayed to ' conceal was not an act of indignant virtue , not a swift repudiation of the villainy of agents who had betrayed and compromised and threatened to disgrace him , but rather complicity with a scoundrels ' plot , as to which he dared not tell the whole truth . If we are to accept the theory which Mr. TILDEN 'S agents are trying to establish on the witness-stand , as they have already tried to establish it in the press and on the floor of Congress , we must believe that he was an unsuspecting and careless old man , who " put himself in the hands of his friends , " who left everything to them , who knew nothing of what was going on in his behalf , and who , when ho discovered their wickedness , reproved them with mild displeasure , and was too good-natured and too innocent to see that anything more was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. TILDEN 'S known character , and with all the facts of his political career . He is , and has always , been an active , keen , vigilant manager of his own affairs , in general and in detail . He has small confidence in any one , knows to a shade the responsibility of a public man , fully appreciates the value of public esteem , and has always closely regulated every step made by or for him in his political projects . Ho is the last man for whom any relative or friend would bind himself to pay $50,000 , $80,000 , $200 , - 000 , trusting to the result to justify the bargain and secure reimbursement . In order to have been the innocent , dull , " goody " sort of person he is represented as being throughout this game for the purchase of the Presidential office , Mr. TILDEN must have changed every fibre of his character , every , impulse , habit , and purpose of his . mind . That he had not done so as late as the 16th of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that date , in which it was evident that he had lost none of his ancient cunning , and had gained not a whit of the ingenuousness which the theory of his friends now attributes to him ,
