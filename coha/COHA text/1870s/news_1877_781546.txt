txt There is a villainous smell of gunpowder in the air . With two feet of snow on the ground , frost in the breeze . and the mercury hovering just above zero , one would think that moo 's passions might be cooled . But nut even during the heated term of 1876 was there any such indication of febrile excitement . To paraphrase one of dolls G. SAXE 'S figures of speech , Mars comes up as Mercury goes down . Rumors of hostile meetings drift lazily through the clubs , and the gilded youth , with the usual spirit of adventure , bet heavily on the chances of a duel in the snow . In our Vanity Fair there are always odds to be given and taken in favor of somebody 's doing a thing utterly ridiculous and fantastic . It is even possible for a man to call a meeting of his friends , a sort of board of experts , to decide whether or no lie has been iusulted . So high &; wu is the popular notion of honor that it requires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is merged into a deadly insult , which can only be washed out in blood . Or , to put it more accurately , it is necessary to say whether a Police Justice or a hostile meeting shall readjust the disturbed social balance . Nay , more , a man 's life , or the risk of it , may hang on the construction of a Word . If he used the Puritanic " damn . " he may pass as a jester . If he used the blunt Anglo-Saxon damn , " he may no : hold his life at a pin 's fee . It is melancholy to think that one 's chances for existence in this crowded and struggling worked should ever hang upon one of four letters in a single word . But when Roor wrote to Bantow , in reply to a curt demand for a certain kg ml document , that he , BARLOW , should 1105 make a ? fool of him self , there was a world of peradventure in thiit wont We represent it by a dash because there i3 a horrible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illustrious person will has contemplated recourse to " the code , " the aggrieved gentleman referred the mat ter to his friends . The word , which began and ended with a d , was voted to be " an offensive epithet . " Some of the board of experts who acted as referees were of the opinion that " darned , " as adjectively applied to " fool , " was not strictly a fighting word . But if the adjective were spelled with an 711 instead of an r , the insult was studied , grave , and only eradicable by a deadly combat , or , what is quite to the same purpose , a show of deadly combat . The world ought to be grateful co these eminent legal lights for drawing this nice distinction . A man may be called a fool , or even a " darned- fool , with comparative impunity . That epithet is innocuous . But when the tool is described a : : " damued " ? that is to say , condemned  --  a sensitive honor demands bloody reparation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experts , he demanded two of Roar : First , he mast explicitly . awl in intelligible characters , state exactly what the suspicious word really was ; second , if it was " damned , " and all that the word implies , he mast withdraw it with a handsome apology . Failing to meet the. , e two requisitions , he must go to Canada . And it . is very well understood that people do not go to Canada at this time of veer except to fight du31s . Tim b:dligerent BARLOW further added , that if his wellnigh nuixtel ! igible correapoadent remained inert and evasive , he must be prepared to be shot on sight . It is probable that a mediteval knight would have considered Mr. ROO ? ' S rejainder to this as being an avoidance , if not an abject piece of shuffling . The high-toned terms of BARLOW were characterized us " dictation , " end the proposition to lay him low on the floe : of the referee 's polls was stigmatized as a threat of assassination . Has it cemne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Canada and shoot at each other . in a perfectly friendly manner , without reihreuce to manslaughter and homicide ? The painful part of this wade business , however , is that the original cau ; e of hostilities has bcea lost sight of . la their eagerness to know just the proportions BARLOW ' S sanguinary joke , and the depth . of ROOT 'S terror , the public have forgotten to ask if it was a " darued " or a more strongly described fool in the case . It is evident that there will be no fight . The District Attorney has interfered in behalf of a despised Criminal Code . But it is due to the cause of public morals that Mr. R ) or shall formally declare whether he spelled the suspected adjective with an r or an m . If he were now looking down the barrel of the pistol of his learned brother ( in the law ) in the snows of Canada , instead of reading Tun TIMES by his peaceful hot-air register , this morning , he would doubtless resolve that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nor write the harmless " darned " so that a wayfaring man , though a fool , should not read it at sight . Meantime , ler the sake of precedent , so dear to all lawyers , it is necessary that there be a clear legal opinion as to the responsibility in this vexed case . If dueling is to be the fashionable amusement this winter , let us lanow if the rawhide and the " darn " are to be causes of war .
