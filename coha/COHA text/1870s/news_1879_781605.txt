txt The handful of distinctive Greenbackers in the House of Representatives do not assume the air of " we , the people , " quite so plainly as they did , but they are noisy , nevertheless , and exceedingly frank . Mr. WEAVER , of Iowa , would , of course , proceed first to " pay off " the bonds with notes , believing that " a man is a public plunderer who wants better money for his bonds than he gave , particularly ' when he has already received in gold more than double what the bonds originally cost him . " He would have the Government stop collecting anything from the people for a time , supplying its own wants by running the printingpress , of course , not forgetting to substitute Government notes for those of the banks . And for the benefit of labor , he would enter upon a grand system of internal improvement , to be paid for in the same delightfully-easy manner  --  by promising to pay . Mr. GILLETTE , of Iowa , Sees that the trouble is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . The money is now.too good ? " the people have so much confidence in money that they hoard it , and that 's why it 's so scarce . " Money is dear and property is cheap . He would reverse this , making money " not worthless , but cheap . " ? During the war , when things were booming , if a man had a hundred dollars he could n't rest over night with it ; lie would go right out and buy a horse or something . Did anybody ever see better times in this country than we had then ? In the Academy of Lagoda was found a philosopher intent upon extracting sunbeams from cucumbers ; failure had no effect upon him  --  he knew that the sunbeams had gone into the cucumbers , and so they must be there . Other philosophers may arise who shall bottle up cold air from the Arctics , hot air froui the Tropics , and , light from the noon-day sun , to carry them into the warm , cold , or dark places where needed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how shall we obtain patience and skill to deal with these academists of finance , from whom folly would not depart though they were brayed in the mortar of experience with the pestle of misery ? To apply serious argument is like striking a fog with a sledge-hammer . Academist WEAVER would have no more internal revenue collected  --  print $110 , - 000,000 of notes annually instead . Academist STEPHENS has told us that Virginia pays the tobacco ? tax ; ergo , the importers , and not the consumers , pay the $130,000 , - 000 of Customs dues ; but as nobody cares for the importers , it will not be necessary to forego collecting the latter , like the other . Government is to hand out bits of paper for all its wants . This plan is as simple and easy as that of the man who propelled his sail-boat by a breeze from a huge bellows placed in the stern , or as perpetual motion . There is only one fault : If men gave labor for the notes , it would be because they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their scarcity . But this scarcity is itself a grievous wrong , which the Academists are sworn to remedy . Hence , the plan should be like this : First , give the people all the notes they want ; then , although under no constraint to do so , let them dig out canals and heap up embankments cheerfully , because they are happy and this work is good to be done . Moreover , how can a Government note , which is but one of an interminable series , and is not redeemable except in another exactly like it , be any better than an individual note , say Of Mr. DENIS KEARNEY Any loafer can draw a chock as well as Mr. VANDERBILT can , and if neither check is to be paid except by drawing another , where is the difference ? We are all able to owe and to give our " note , " and Mr. B. F. BUTLER will observe that this plan would effectually end all distress about " interest . " It is plain that the invention of the Academists can never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall be stuffed full with all he wants of every gratification , physical and mental . There will be no paying then . Everybody will give his note , from the Government down to the day laborer , bank-cheeks having been abolished with banks ; we shall all be equal , rich , and happy ; and , although everybody will be stuffed full of every desirable thing imaginable , we shall perform the necessary work of life out of sheer goodness . Or , will not the Academists carry their benevolent plenty into the machinery of the universe , and make everything which is needful to be done just do itself ?
