txt Alderman Mounts makes no more raids against the dogs , but the spirit of hostility to the canine race still survives in the Board of Aldermen . That body has adopted an ordinance declaring it unlawful for any person to keep or maintain upon his promises any dog , or other animal , " whose barking , howling , or any offensive noise , in any out-house , yard , or in the street , may be annoying , disagreeable , or injurious to any person or persons residing in the vicinity . " There is some confusion of language in this decree which suggests a loophole through which a barking and howling nuisance might escape . But the intention is admi , rable , and many persons whose nights have been made sleepless by the pets of thoughtless neighbors will hail this as a promise of relief . Hereafter , the man ( or boy ) who keeps a noisy dog iu town must choose between paying five dollars for each and every complaint brought against him , or giving up said dog to the official @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is providled that the fining of the owner , or the execution of the dog , shall depend ou the word of at least two citizens , who , however , must be " reputable .

It is not certain that " other animal " can be held to include parrots . Certainly it could not be made to apply to pianos , although some witty sage has spoken of the last-named instrument of torture as " a bow-legged megatherium .

Tray , Blanche , or Sweetheart bark and bowl without in , urring the slightest moral responsibility . But the man or woman who arises in the middle of the night , or in the gray dawn of a Summer morning to pound a piano , or roar through a brazen trombone , is more than a nuisance . They sin against humanity with their eyes and ears open : It is true that the barking of dogs is , to all human appearances , wholly purposeless , and the thrumming of a piano may , if intelligently persevered in , be of benefit to the player . But this inordinate or untimely " practicing " on any musical instrument , to the annoyance of neighbors , is a nuisance that ought to be abated . And a parrot 's fiendish squall is certainly more terrifying , and consequently more depressing iu its effects , than either of these noises . It is clear that we have yet a great deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Aldermen have made a good beginning in this direction .
