txt What is the actual feeling of the South ? What are the prospects of its material prosperity I These were the questions to which my attention was directed in the progress of a trip to this region of Northern Alabama , through Virginia , East Tennessee . and Nortlewestera Georgia , and during my stay of two or three weeks in this portion of the State , covenng a range of three or four counties . When it is considered that the causes of the alienation and bitterness which are generally supposed to exist are chiefly political , and arise in opposition to the national Administration , we would think it bat  --  atural that political topics should occasionally rise to the =Moe in discussion , where men " most do congregate , " even though it is not the political year and no exciting campaign is in progress . From Washington to Birmingham I sought the vicinity of groups engaged in conversation , in drawing-room cars , sleeping-cars , common passenger-ears , smoking-cars , and negrocars ? in which latter . by the way . it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stations , at eating-houses , at hotels ? hi short . in all places wnieli the limits of travel opened opportunity for , and I have yet to hear the first allusion to any political topic , I noted this more particularly as indicative of preoccupation with ordinary topics of interest to the exclusion of politics , and as pointing to hopeful conclusions concerning the direction of the energy of the South toward legitimate fields of action in recovering from her prostrate condition . The tone and spirit of the people whom I encountered were Indicative of anything rather than of morose , brooding , discontent . Their manner toward Northern men , when introduced to them , either in due form or casually , in the way traveling accniaintances are formed , is frank , open , cordial . Certainly no one in traveling through this country would imagine for a moment that there was a latent and irreconcilable bitterness in the hearts of the people so powerful as to stand m the way of the most cordial co-operation for the advancement of their material interests . That the Sontherapeople @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the methods of reconstruction . it would be folly to affirm ; to demand such a state of feeling would be most unreasonable on our part . But I Lave used my powers of observation to very little purpose , and been most grossly deceived by appearances , it many of the intelligent Southern people do not see that the new order of things opens up possibllittes in the way of material development , of which they bad never dreamed under the old r6gline . This , if it does not make them satisfied with the result of their venture , goes far to make them reconciled to it . I did expect . in case I should chance to fall upon topics connected with the war , in company of those who had taken part in it , to find some manifestation of the spirit of bitterness which characterized that period . Judge , then , of my surprise when , a few nights ago , at the supper-table of a farmer whose hospitality I bad craved in the absence of public accommodations , the conversation around the board between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiences in the war , in which both had been engaged . Their stories were sufficiently amusing , and were told with such good nature , though often at the expense of the heroes themselves , that I tried in vain to conjure up the spirit of evil and bate which I had once thought possessed the heart of every " Johnny Reb . " An officer in the rebel army , a civilian now of no little distinction an the State , also with the utmost good nature spoke of his fate being to ran away from invading armies . as , after the close of the war , he went to Europe , and remained in Paris until the " invading " Prussians made retreat expedient , and after they were gone he returned only to be driven oat by the more terrible Commune 1 And thus it was that all allusions to the war were tempered with the kindly and genial humanities . I have been specially observant daring my journey , and since my arrival , of the relation and bearing of the white and negro races @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the negroes themselves . I can detect in the intercourse of the races nothing that distinguishes it from that prevailing in oar Northern States . True , the blacks are not permitted to occupy the same cars upon railroads with whites , except where they appear as servants , nurses or attendants ; but how long is it since in our own City of New-York colored ears were an institution I In the ordinary intercourse I could see nothing that was dietingMe or noticeable . Wren I recall how short is the time glace the relation between these races was that of master and slave , absolute domination on the one hand and abject subjugation on the other . and reflect further upon the violence with which these relations have been severed , and of all that this severance implies , I marvel more and more each hour as I behold how natural and common-place the new and changed order of things has become . Bus it the adaptation of the whites to the situation escapes all censure , that of the b/aokt certainly merits high award of praise . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a race tnat can pass the trying ordeal from slavery to freedom and from freedom to citizenship in two quickly succeeding crises and stand the test so bravely , so modestly , and , on the whole , so worthily , as this despised race has done . As I see these people busy in their avocations , contented , happy . prosperous in various degrees , as are other people about them , l find is hard to realize that only a few short years age they were slaves . What a strange , wonderful transition it is I And not the least wonder of all is the mutual forbearance which characterizes the old parties in their new relations . I speak only of what I have seen . I can easily believe the negro does not like work for work 's flake any better than the white man , and very possibly he requires a stronger stimulus to exert himself with all his might ; but I have noticed that here at the South , almost uniformly , where there is the very perfection of lazy , aimless , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gaunt , slab-sided white man to do it ? at least such an one is invariably found doing that- sort of service . As a rule , along the lines of the railroad , the negroes seem to have employment , and to attend to it with at least ordinary diligence.
