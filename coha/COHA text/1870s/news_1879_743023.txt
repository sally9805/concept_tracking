txt It is evident that Mr. BRAGG , of Wisconsin , does not regard his appointment as Chairman of the Committee of the House on War Claims as an empty one . He has made haste to manifest his interest in the matter confided to his charge in a manner which , according to our reports , " startled " the House . Unlike most Chairmen , who are generally anxious to get as much of the business of the House as possible into their hands , Mr. BRAGG proposes , if we understand him correctly , to close absolutely the . source from which most of his committee business now comes . On Saturday , the Legislative Appropriation bill being under discussion , he moved to strike out the appropriation for the Southern Claims Commission , and to add a clause repealing the law authorizing that commission and regulating its powers and proceedings . " The amendment which I have proposed , " he said , " strikes directly at the root of the whole Southern Claims Commission . ? It proposes to repeal all the machinery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4540,000 , 00 , to start a manufactory for the purpose of keeping up this vexed question of Southern claims . " And , when suggesting that he should require more time than was allowed under the fiveminute rule , he added : " My purpose is to show to the committee that , contrary to the laws of nations and the laws of war , we have been paying a class of claims that we ought not to have paid , which have no legal title for payment , and whose payment has been a mere gratuity . I shall then desire to consider whether we are in a condition to be bestowing gratuities , and whether , if we do bestow gratuities , it would not be better to bestow what belongs to us , rather than as legislators to give away money that belongs to somebody else . " This has the air of determination , and it is evident that the discussion , which is expected to take place to-day , will be a very animated one , and . possibly very bitter . It will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Republicans need have very little to do . The system which Mr. BRAGG proposes to abolish was established by a Republican Congress : nearly six years after the close of the war , for the purpose of securing a sifting of the " loyal " claims for property taken by our armies , which at that time were flooding Congress . The effort was made in good faith to submit these claims to examination by Commissioners who should have some *of the general powers of a court . It was provided that no claim not presented to the Commissioners should be entertained by any department of the Government without further authority of Congress . Practically , therefore , the Board of Commissioners was a device to secure justice in regard to the Southern claims . Its verdict was expected , though not specifically declared , to be final . It must be confessed that the scheme has worked very badly . The powers of the board were by no means sufficient to accomplish the task assigned to it . Its investigations were necessarily partial and incomplete . , Doubtless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by it , but a host of very doubtful ones were admitted . The sifting which it was expected would be done was worse than useless , for it relieved Congress of responsibility , while it was not itself adequate . Now , Mr. BRAGG comes on the scene , and not only proposes to wipe out the Board of Commissioners , but to demonstrate that the claims which it was created to examine have no.validity in law or . equity , and that n their payment is in its nature a gratuity . This is a very radical proposition , but it is also a very strong one . It involves the only sensible and practical disposition of this vexed question , and , as . it comes from a Democrat just appointed to the Chairmanship of the committee having charge of the ' matter , there is no reason why it should not be sustained by the Republicans . As a party , they have done all and more than all that could fairly be required of them to mitigate the injuries and losses inflicted by the Union armies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of generosity , and having already cost the country uselessly a vast amount of money , they can abandon them , on the suggestion of a Democrat like Mr. BRAGG , with very good grace . But it should be borne : in : mind that Mr. Bancia 's motion does not , in fact , do what he says , and undoubtedly ? thinks , that it will do . It does not " strike at the root " of the Southern claims . On the contrary , if adopted , it would only reopen the doors of Congress and of the departments to the crowd of claimants which formerly besieged them . Bad as the Board of Commissioners has been , it has been a bar to the action of Congress , which might have been , and probably would now be , much worse . The repeal of the law authorizing the board carries with it the repeal of the restriction on the presentment of the claims to the departments , and also deprives Congress of the benefit of any ' preliminary examination . If Mr. BRAGG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which be has brought forward , let him try to obtain from his party a constitutional amendment forbidding the payment of any claim for damage done by the Union armies . That would be a practical application of what he regards as the " laws of nations and the laws of war . "
