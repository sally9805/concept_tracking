ENGLISH MANNERS . WHEN I took my passage for Liverpool I naturally inquired what kind of man he was in whose charge and under whose command I was to be for some ten days upon the ocean . I was told that he was an excellent seaman and a good shipmaster , but that he . was unsociable and surly , in fact positively disagreeable , had English . manners , and was in brief a perfect John Bull . I took all this // with some grains of allowance , and was content to he in the hands of a good seaman and commander . For as to unsociability on the part of a man who had upon his mind the responsibility for a great steamship and her cargo , and a thousand or twelve hundred souls upon the storm-vexed , fog- shrouded Atlantic , I could not only make allowance for it , but respect it , having some knowledge , although at second hand , of the way in which " the captain " is often pestered by the he and she *adflies among his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the skies were bright , and we went smoothly and swiftly on under steam and sails , I did not for several days speak to any officer of the vessel , except the purser and the surgeon . When I passed the captain I merely bowed silently in acknowledgment of his position , and of mine as his subordinate and dependent . I should have been better pleased if he had made some acknowledgment , however slight , of my salute , of which he took not the least notice . But even this indifference , although it was quite new to me , even in not been that I observed that he made himself deferentially agreeable to a passenger who was connected in some manner with the British embassy , and who seemed to have no superior claim to exceptional attention . Other passengers complained outright of the surly indifference of his manner even to ladies ; and one of the latter , a very gracious and agreeable woman , of such social position that she could have safely snubbed the whole British embassy , and of such spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told me that he had replied to a civil and simple question of hers so rudely that she did not mean to pass over the offense unnoticed . One day , as we were just passing out of the Gulf Stream , I saw him standing near me , and stepping up to him and raising my hat I said , " I beg pardon for interrupting you , captain he was doing nothing , but will you be kind enough to tell me how wide the Gulf Stream is where we cross it ? " He replied very curtly and gruffly , " Indeed , I do n't know . It s a matter I ye never thought about , - do n't know anything at all about it . " The manner was more than the words . It was not insulting ; I could not complain of it ; but it was insolent , and insolent in a waywbich showed that the speaker was an ill conditioned person who did not know how to behave himself . And if the reply was true , it was amazing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ navigation ; and here was an accomplished seaman who for years had been crossing it twenty times and more in a year , and yet he had , as he said , not even thought how many miles of it he had to pass over . If what he said was true , it was an astonishing exposition of Philistinism , or something worse . For as to the information for which I asked , I soon got at that easily by an examination of a chart and a brief and simple calculation . The reply was , however , probably a simple exposition of personal character . But the feeling aroused among the passengers by our commander 's behavior ( although most of them were his countrymen ) was such that there was some talk of sending to the owners a formal complaint against it ; and although this project was abandoned , the lady whom I have mentioned did not forget her determination . She got up one of those little entertainments by which the tedium of a voyage is not unfrequently relieved , making herself hostess , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passenger with whom she or any one of her party had exchanged a word , and by special note every officer of the ship , except the captain , who was pointedly omitte ( l . The slight was extreme , and I am not prepared to say that it was quite defensible , for , whatever his manners , he was the commanding officer of the vessel ; but it was generally regarded as fully justified by his conduct , and as permissible on the part of a woman . His captainship , surly sea-dog as he was , felt the cut very deeply , and was furious ; and in the midst of our little festival , at which 1879. 775 // all the officers not on duty were present , he sent in orders for them to appear on deck . Of course they were ob1iged to go ; but none the less the lady had accomplished her purpose . Some years before my voyage to England , I had an experience of this sort of English manners , the story of which is not here inapp2ropriate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pleasantest terms with an English gentleman of a very different sort from Captain - , a man whom I had respected , liked , and even admired . He was a man of intelligence , of wide information , and of remarkably good-breeding , - a man distinguished in person and in manner . When he applied to me to perform a cer* tam responsible duty for him ( luring his absence , I was pleased at such a mark of his confidence , and I accepted his proposal . While he was away a gentleman connected with him in business thought that he had reason to be dissatisfied with some of my arrangements , and on my declining to admit any interference with my discharge of the duties which I had undertaken , he took the responsibility of breaking the agreement , to which , for peace ' sake , I assented , on the understanding that my rights in the matter were to he held in aheyance until the return of my friend from England . When he did return we met in the pleasantest way ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the matter to his attention briefly by letter , and asked his decision . *fo my surprise , and I may almost say to my grief , I received a very curt reply , in which he said that he did not propose to trouble himself at all about the past . The purpose of his response was so plain , and its utter lack of consideration was so manifest and so insufferable , that in sorrow and without a disrespectful word I wrote to him that our acquaintance must cease immediately . I determined , of course , that the matter should not drop there ; but on looking for the letters in which his proposals were made and the terms of our agreement settled , I could not find them . They were carefully preserved , but had December , been mislaid , and many months passed before they were discovered . During this time his partner became convinced that , however correct his judgment might have been , I was right in the position which I had taken ; and in a courteous note he inclosed me a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the agreement . This check I returned to him , telling him , with thanks , that the question on my part was not one of money . When I found the letters I wrote to my former friend , bringing the matter again to his attention , and asking his consideration of it . He took no notice of my letter . I then brought a suit against him , which he defended . I was very sorry for the whole affair , and just before the trial was coming on I went to a common acquaintance , and , showing him the whole matter , said , " This case ought not to be tried . I do n't want to pay me a dollar . Go to him from me and say so , and see if you ca n't induce him to behave differently . " lie agreed with me , an ( l did what I asked . But his intercession was in vain ; Sir John Bull refused to hear a word about the matter . The trial came on ; and after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case to the jnry without argument , but the ot.her side refused . The judge charged briefly , and the jury , after a minute 's consultation without leaving their seats , gave a verdict in my favor for the full amount claimed , to which the judge added the largest permissible " allowance . " And thus ended the only suit in which I , although bred to the bar , and the loser of not a little muchneeded money , was ever plaintiff . If my former friend had treated me with the consideration which one man - I shall not say one gentleman - owes to another ; if lie had merely said to me , oven at the last moment , " My position in this matter is such that I can not without great inconvenience interfere in anything that passed during my absence ; I am sorry that it is so , " that would have been an end of the affair . His arrogance and his ignorance of me except as a man of letters led him to take a position which proved untenable and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps by most persons who were not born and bred in England , his conduct will be regarded as thoroughly English , and as a typical example of English manners . To a certain extent it was typical of English manners , but only of one narrow strongly marked phase of them ; and although I had had other opportunities , in some of which I was , but in others of which I was not , directly interested , of 9bservinO ' similar conduct on the part of Englishmen , I had refused to accept these as evidence against a whole people , and a people in whom , apart from all considerations of kindred , which to me were great and abiding , I felt an interest which I had felt in no other . It will be seen , however , that when I stepped from the deck of my steamer upon soil which my forefather had left two hundrcd and fifty years before , I did so with sufficient reason for some prejutlice against the manners of my British kinsmen . I found , however , good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not red me into a foregone conclusion against a nation . Those who have rea ( l what I have written heretofore about England will not be surprised at my saying now that I found the manners of the people there in most respects pleasing and admirable . And by manners I mean not merely the attitude and the action and the speech which appear upon the mere surface of social intercourse , but the motive feeling which underlies this surface , and which influences the actual conduct , as well as the bearing of man toward man . Moreover , the distinction between manners and manner must be constantly kept in mind . It is a trite remark that the English manner lacks warmth and grace . Indeed , as a people , the English have no manner . I would not say , as Malvolio says of Viola in her page 's dress , that their manner is " a very ill manner . " There is simply the absence of pleasing 1 To most of my readers I need hardly say that in my parenthetical censure I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their own times . Out all they whose social experience hegan like mine in railway times , and who yet had youthful outward demonstration , a reserve so absolute and yet so unconscious ( unconscious , perhaps , through long habit and continued practice ) that it seems to be indifference . But even to this judgment there must be made many exceptions , - exceptions so numerous that sometimes it seems as if , like the exceptions to the conjugation of French verbs , they almost invalidate the rule . Certainly , I have never seen , nor could I desire to see , more show of heartiness and warmth than I have met in Englishmen . And even as to polish of manner I could hardly deny that the finest examples of it that I have met with were afforded by Englishmen , although these were few in number . It would seem as if the hard , tough material had , like some agates , under its natural rough coating the possibility of a smoothness and transparency of surface which shows all the beauty of the structure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardest steel . You can not polish soft things so . On the other hand it is not often that you find that union of simplicity and courtesy , that lack of self-assertion and that thoughtfulness for others ' feelings , which was not uncommon among New England folk of the best breeding in the last generation ( for , alas , we have lost it , rubbed rudely down as it has been by the rush of railway trains , and war , and the flood of wealth and emigration ) , and which seemed to be the outward manifestation of a gentle , kindly , fine-fibred nature.1 But of well-purposed good-breeding , accompanied by a manifest consciousness of superior position and of its duties , it is hard to imagine finer examples than may he found among the higher classes in England . English people impress you first of all by a sense of the genuineness of their actions and of their speech . Warm or cold they may he , gracious or ungracious , arrogant or considerate , but you feel that they are real . Englishmen adulterate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the fading charm of old New England manners among those whose eons have since gone West or.South , will agree with me in my admiring and reverential memorisa 1879. 777 // an Englishman makes you welcome , you feel at home ; and you know that , within reason , and often out of reason , he will look after your comfort , - that for your well-bein* , while you are under his roof he considers himself responsible . And yet he does not thrust himself upon you , and you may do almost what you ehoose , and go almost whither you will . If he wants you to come to him , he will take more trouble to bring you than you will to go , an ( l yet make no fuss about it any more than he does about the sun 's rising , without which he would be in darkness . If he meets you and gives you two fingers , it means only two fingers ; if his whole hand grasps yours , you have his hand , and you have it most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action . His social word is his social bond ; you may trust him for all that it promises , and commonly for more . If you do not understand him well , you may suppose at first that he is indifferent and careless , until something is done for you , or suggested to you , that shows you that his friend and his friend 's welfare has been upon his mind . There are , indeed , people in English society , and not a few of them , to whom social intercourse is a matter of calculation , a means to an end . But such people are in all societies , and of them in particular I do not speak . It seems to me that there are comparatively fewer of such people in England than there are elsewhere ; and indeed it is better for society that there should be fewer , for they do this business rather awkwardly . Social finesse is not the forte of the English people , although it is the foible of some Englishwomen . Society as an art comes naturally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and , as I believe from what I have heard , to the Viennese ; but the art of society does not flourish in England . English efforts in that way are stiff and heavy , and remind one of those of the German who practiced jumping over chairs that he might learn to be lively . One does sometimes wish that there was a little less stiffness in the social joints of England ; but after all , in the long run stippleness is a poor substitute for solid strength . In the society of Englishmen you at least fed safe . It is remarkable , in connection with this view of our subject , that although the English manner in real life is quiet and undemonstrative almost to affectation , English acting is rude and extravagant ; and that , on the other hand , while the French manner in daily intercourse is nervous and demonstrative , French actin* is distinguished by delicacy , calm , and reserve . Each seems to seek upon the sta5e the coml ) lemnent of its daily acted life , as people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poverty like to read descriptions of romantic adventure and of the splendor and magnificence attainable by the lavish use of fabulous wealth . The god of Euglish social life next in dignity to mammon is propriety . Now propriety rightly worshiped is a very good god ; his very rites are sweetness , order , decency , and in their practice they involve that consideration for others which is the highest form of morality , and even of piety . But the British Philistine ( and all Er*gland is more or kss given over to Philistinism , which invades the very social regions in which it is most dreaded and decried ) makes propriety a Moloch , before whom he prostrates himself , and before whom he often makes his very children sacrifice some of the beauty of their youthful lives . The highest social aim , the greatest social law , to this sort of Englishman is to do the correct thing . Having attained this , he feels that he has absolved himself of every social duty , and clothed his soul in panoply of proof . XVhether the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , does not seek to know . That so it has been and that so it is are for him both logic and religion . In his mouth the greatest reproach is " unprecedented ; " the mere statement of the fact that an act has not been done before , that a word has not been spoken before , being to him its condemnation . Wherefore he lives his life surrounded by dead , shriveled forms , eyeless , brainless , bloodless , whose only voice is from the grave of a dead past . // If he breaks away from this oppression , he is likely to run into extremes which violate all decency , all decorum , all propriety . Freed from his accustomed restraint , he is apt to add a grossness to vice which makes it more hideous , if not more harmful . This general consideration of our subject , however , is likely to be of less interest and perhaps of less real instructiveness than some report of particular external manners among Englishmen . In this respect I was impressed at once , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good behavior of the English people , from the lowest to the highest . I found them to he kindly , respectful , considerate , showing , with rare exceptions , that union of deference to others and selfrespect which I have spoken of before . The custom-house officers , with three of whom I was brought into contact before 1 went on shore , seemed to me to have in perfection the manners fit for their position . They were quiet , civil , pleasant , consi ( lerate , and firm . They seemed to wish to do their duty as agreeably as possible , and they did not even give me a chance to offer a " tip . " Such was their manner in general ; but having reason to suspect one passenger , they searched one of his trunks thoroughly , and then , finding that he had several hundreds more of cigars than they thought a private gentleman should carry , they " went through him without pity , yet with politeness . Just so pleasant and so worthy of respect I found the London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and unoflicious readiness brought me to look upon them as friends . Wherever and whenever I saw them in my wanderings over the great city , it was with pleasure and with personal interest . Their honest , cheery English faces and their English speech were grateful to mae ; and the more so because of their unlikeness to Misther John Kelly 's constituents who , excepting those big , goodnatured dandies , the Broadway squad , fill the ranks of the New York force . I had been in England more than a month , going about everywhere in city and in country alone , and doing this , it should be remembered , as an Englishman , for I found it always assumed as a matter of course that I was English born and bred , and there was no occasion that I should wear a ticket on my hat telling that I was a Yankee , - for some weeks , then , I went about thus before I had one uncivil or even one unpleasant word spoken to me ; and when the word caine it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fault . Wishing to go to hyde Park near Prince 's Gate , I hailed a bus that was driving rapidly through Regent Street with " Hyde Park " upon its panels . Just as I was mounting to the top it occurred to me to ask the conductor if he passed Prince 's Gate . " No , I do n't , " he replied , somewhat snappishly , " and a gentleman like you hought to know there s two sides to Yde Park , an ' that they re a mile apart . " I did know that as well as he did , and therefore asked my question . What I had not learned was how to distinguish the buses that ran on one side from those that ran on the other . I remembered that I had stopped him for nothing in full career , and when he was perhaps behind time , and I thought his fretfulness very excusable . Now this piece of mild incivility was not only my first but my only experience of the kind in England , where I found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only general civility and a deferential demeanor , but a cheerfulness of manner and a pleasant alacrity to which an American is unaccustomed . Not in omnibuses nor in any other public vehicles are you subjected to the incivility of being summoned to pay your fare as soon as you enter . There is no thumping upon windows or jangling of bells to call your attention to this duty . You pay just as you go out ; or after a reasonable time a conductor comes and civilly takes your money . Nor does he then turn a crank and clang a great gong , or touch a sprin0 and kling a little one , to announce to the world that you have paid and that he has received your twopence or threepence . The standing passenger rubbing against your knees and treading upon your toes is not the 1879. 779 // only familiar annoyance from which you will find yourself freed . Do not the companies lose some fares by this simple method of procedure ? Perhaps they do . But the saving of money to the proprietors is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The convenience and comfort of the passenger is the first consideration , and for that he pays . But to put him to inconvenience , or to subject him to unpleasantness , that he may thereby correct the consequences of the possible dishonesty of the company 's servants , after the New York fashion , is an imposition unthought of . Englishmen would not submit to it for a ( lay . It is pleasant , too , to be able to make a purchase at a shop and to pay for it on the spot to the person who sells it to you , and to go away , if you choose to do so , immediately . The system of checks by which , if you take a glass of soda-water or buy a paper of pins , you receive an Or ( ler to pay five cents at some desk more or less remote is unknown in England . So is the waiting for some trifle until a salesman makes three entries , and a cash boy makes as many , and a cashier as many , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and " entered " there and numbered and what not , and then brought solemnly to you . At the very eating - houses you pay the waiter who serves you , and he , if necessary , makes change for you out of his own pocket . For his general civility I will answer freely , but for his cleanliness I can say little . He is even in the morning discovered in a dresscoat and an untidy , dingy white tie , which makes him look as if he had been up all night . In his hand he carries a napkin , which even early in the day is so limp and smutched and unctuous that you dread lest he should wipe your plate or your knife and fork with it . He is very attentive , however , and at breakfast hustles about to find you a newspaper before he takes your order . And in so trifling a matter as a newspaper your minutest&gt;omfort is looked after . I remarked that in the coffee-rooms of hotels and in good restaurants the newspapers December , had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle fold ; by this the annoying little wrinkle which otherwise is apt to form there and to prevent the paper from opening and shutting easily is avoided . The papers on the news-stands , too , are cut open . And all this is done not by a folding-machine or a cutting-machine at the newspaper offices , but personally by the people who serve you , and who ( 10 all that they can do to please you . The fashion recently adopted here of folding newspapers by machinery , as they are printed , in such a way that the reader is obli ; ed to unfold and then refold them , is an example of a system of life and of manners the exact reverse of that which is practiced in England . But what matter to what inconvenience the American newspaper publisher puts the public , if by so doing he can save ten cents on a thousand copies ! Does not the public in America exist for the benefit of railway companies and other corporations , of innchine politicians , and of publishers of newspapers ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was first brought to my attention at the Birmingham Musical Festival . As we went out after the morning performance , we found at each door a nicely-dressed and pleasant-looking young woman holding in her hand a plate such as those in which collections of money are taken up in churches . This was to receive gifts for some favorite charitable institution of the town , and as we passed the girls they rattled the money in their plates to attract attention . it was a new way to me of asking and receiving alms ; but what I chiefly remarked was that these young ladies for every a ( l ( hition made to the money in their plates said pointedly , " Thank you . " Afterwamfs in London , on a certain saint 's day , I found girls ensconce ( l in chairs , and if it rained with umbrellas spread , in very public places , having plates before them to receive the alms of wayfarers for certain public charities ; and these also , I observed , for every gift said , " Thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say personally " Thank you " for English Mianners. // a benefit conferred ; and this is the more easily and constantly done because there is in general a more direct personal contact than there is among us between all persons concerned in charitable works , whether as principals or as intermediaries . Not only , however , in return for alms , but for favor shown in any way , in making a purchase , or even in giving an order , this acknowledgment is made . It seemed to me that " Thank you " must be heard a th6usand times a day in England for once that it is heard in America . I was thanked for my very cab-toll every time I crossed Waterloo bridge . Notwithstanding this trait of civility and considerateness in English manners , and notwithstanding the genuineness and , beneath its artificial surface , the heartiness of the English character , it has without doubt its repellent side . Englishmen themselves will hardly deny that too many of them are arrogant , insolent , and overbearing . And yet , as I write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remembering what I never can forget , and would grieve and shame to forget , the kindness , the gentleness , the sweetness of nature , the almost tender thou*htfulness for others , that I have seen in so many En*lishmen , not only in England , but here before I ever met them on their native soil . It has been my good fortune to render some of them some very trifling services , and these were not only accepted in a way that enhanced greatly the pleasure of rendering them , but were ever afterward remembered and acknowledged in a way so frank and simple and charming that I was both delighted and ashamed at such a recognition . I therefore do protest with all my heart against the Duke of Green Erin as a type of his race , or ( although I have known no dukes ) as a fair representative of his rank . And yet , without doubt , he is a very possible Englishman , and a possible duke . His insolence does not pertain to his rank ; it may be found in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by nature insolent may and will insult with greater freedom and impunity than is possible to a person of inferior position . Indeed , this trait of English manners manifests itself most readily and strongly in persons of rank and in authority . That it should do so is only to be expected . Such persons have more temptations than others have , as well as better opportunities , for the exhibition of an overbearing nature . This disre , ard of others does by no means always accompany a coarse and brutal organization . My captain was a coarse man ; . but my English friend who compelled me to bring him to book was one of the most refined and courteous of gentlemen . He merely took advantage of his position to rid himself of some trouble by setting quietly aside a man of whom he in fact knew very little . Perhaps this is not really an English trait . Not improbably there are just such men in France , in Germany , or in Japan . From what we know of Prince Bismarck , I am inclined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the same way . Mr. Trollope has admirably illustrated this unpleasant side of English character in the Duke of Gmnium and the Marquis of Brotherton . It is not that these men were bad , but that they were deliberately insolent in their manner , so that in the case of the marquis we are all inclined to cheer when Dean Lovelace flings him into the grate . The influence of aristocracy and of the constant pressure upward of the inferior ranks is the cause of much of the forbidding manner of English gentlemen . They show this manner more among themselves than they do to others . The Marquis of Brotherton , because he was marquis and the head of his family , was insolent to his younger brother . And for this same reason Englishmen are suspicious of each other when they are not in the same rank of life . The meeting of two En , , lislimen who are strangers , knowing little or nothinc , of each other , and who have occasion to make acquaintance , - the doubt , the coldness , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheering sight . But if they find each other " all right , " they will in a few days be mutually us*879. 781 // ing their surnames without the Mr. , or their titles without the " handle , " and their intercourse will be much more hearty and informal than if they were Americans under the same circumstances . The daily intercourse of families and friends in England is hearty and warm , although not effusive . They are not ready to give the hand to strangers ; but very commonly all of a family , including the guests , shake hands on partiag for the night ; and on meeting in the morning the same greeting is hardly less common . It was charming to see two middle-aged men , who lived in the same house , meet in the breakfast room , and , shaking hands warmly , say , " Goodmorning , brother . " When I saw all this and was admitted to be a part of it , I wondered where the English coldness was of which we hear so much . Salutation is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in towns , that I was reminded of the manners of 1*ew England in my early boyhood . Men on leaving a railway car , either first class or second class , will say " Good morning * or " Good evenino- " although they have exchanged hardly a word with you on the route , - which , however , is rare ; and this habit , which has come down from stage-coach times , and has been preserved on the railway by the small carriages , is one of the reliefs and pleasures of that unnatural mode of travel . The porter or guard who puts you into your carriage and hands you your bag , hurried , yet finds time to say , " Good morning , sir . " If you are walking on a country road , . those whom you meet salute you . The country folk , old and young , male and female , do so always . In Essex the rustic boys have a pretty way of waving their hands in the air by way of salutation as you pass . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very c harming . One day , as I was walking in Sussex through a beautiful lane sunk deep between its green sides , where wild flowers grew at the feet of hollies with polished leaves and of other little trees that stood so thick that they reduced noonday to twilight , I met a woman of the lower class , almost of the lowesL She was very handsome , in the prime of life , with a grand figure , and ( lark , bright , melancholy eyes . She looked more like a Roman than like an English woman ; and I do believe that her dark , noble face had come straight down to her from some Roman soldier , perhaps in Cmsar 's legions . She had a child in her arms , and another walked by her side , holding her hand . As I passed her she pause ( l in her walk , and courtesying , said , " Good morning , sir ; " and her sweet voice was English , although her face was not . I returned her salutation , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who never saw me before , stop and courtesy to me because I am a " gentleman " ? For unmistakably there was deference in her salutation , and a recognition of the difference of our conditions . I was ashamed that I had not stopped and given her something that might have added a little to her comfort . Perhaps she expected the gentleman to do so . But she was too noble in mien and carriage , she impressed me too much , for me to offer her a trifling almus , lowly as her condition was . I turned my head , and if I had found that she was looking after inc I should have gone back to give her more , perhaps , than I could afford . But I saw only her back , as she walked erectly and slowly on , with a grace which her burden and her condition could not repress , and which her poor garments rather revealed ; and at a turn in the lane she disappeared into its cool , clear twilight , and I only wished her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dress of English gentlemen is very plain and simple . For although Macaulay bought many embroidered waistcoats , in which he arrayed himself with great delight , this personal trait must be regarded as one of the eccentricities of genius . In its simplicity the Englishman 's dress is not unlike that of gentlemen of corresponding condition in this country , but in his manner of wearing it there is a difference . Tidiness seems to be the most important point of dress in the eyes // of a well-cared-for Englishman . Everything about him is snug . He is like a horse well groomed and harnessed . His morning coat , be it frock or cutaway , ' ' is never flying loose , but is buttoned closely . This tidiness and completeness of apparel is a sort of religion . I remember being in a railway carriage with a young man who was very correct at all points . The day , which had opened gloomily , had suddenly cleared and becomae very warm . He was dressed in a heavy brown tweed suit , and every button of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Another gentleman and myself relieved ourselves by unbuttoning our coats , and I , as there was no lady there , opened my waistcoat ; for the air was damp as well as warm , and we were sweltering . But he would plainly have endured martyrdom rather than be guilty of such looseness , and he sat impassible , bolt upright and tightly buttoned. lie suffered and was strong . I wished that he had been less true to his religion . The Englishman comes down in the morning completely dressed in this tight , tidy way . He does not even indulge himself in the great luxury of easy life , a slippered breakfast , but comes wearing , in addition to his buttoned coat , strong , brightly-polished shoes . While I was in England I did not see one gentleman in slippers outside of his bedroom . This strait-lacedness has its merits . English gentlemen at all times , unless they are recognized slovens , look trim , well set up , presentable , and ready for service , whether business or pleasure . Nor do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothes were all bought , ready-made , at one " establishment , " and as if they had slept in them the night before in a " palace-car . " The same praise can not be given to Englishwomnen , who , although they dress elaborately for the evening , go about in the morning , too many of them , with hair and dress the reverse of snug and tidy . Dinner is the great fact of English daily life . " Dine with me ' * is the Englishman 's first request , if he likes you , or if he wishes to show you any atten tion . A letter of introduction is honored by an invitation to dinner , and that given nothing more is regarded as necessary ; anything else depends on kindness and personal liking . To some Americans this dining , which is always formal , becomes oppressive . A Yankee friend of mine , a man of intelligence and charming manners , who looks much more like time commonly entertained idea of a handsome Englishman than most of the Englishmen I. met , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was soon so wearied with these inevitable invitations to formal dinners that he stopped the presentation of his credentials , and kept himself to himself . " I was bored to death , " he said to me , with the constant recurrence of the regular routine , and the dull succession of eating and drinking in full dress . I did n't want their dinners ; I wanted to see them at their houses , in an easy , informal way . As I could n't do that , I cut the matter short , and depended upon my own resources . " As for myself , having taken no letters , I escaped these obligation dinners from atrangers ; and in the half dozen dinner parties at which I was present , I was more fortunate than he . Yet I saw enough of the heavy formality of these entertainments to he in some sympathy with him . Dinner talking is a much more formidable affair in England than it is with us . It is an " institution . " Men prepare themselves for it as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arran*e what subjects shall be started to briHg out certain guests ; and the table is hushed while this or that clever man discourses , in sentences sometimes rather too carefully constructed , upon a subject which is as slyly but as deliberately dragged before him as a cork and string before a kitten , and which lie jumps at much as his feline prototype does at the mimic mouse . There is something of this kind with us among dinner givers of the more cultivated sort , but nothing to be compared with the formidable colloquies of the formal English dinner . There is found , moreover , the dinner soliloquist , whom I can not but regard 1879. 783 // as a dreadful form of the social bore . I remember one such man at a dinner party of some twenty people . He began to talk after he had spooned his soup for a moment or two , and as he talked very pleasantly his sonorous voice , going forth to the whole table , was a welcome help over the threshold of our entertainment . But he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At each fall of his voice I supposed that he would stop ; but he managed to link one sentence upon another until he bound us all up in an endless chain of words . Although not aged , he was too old a man to snub , and also too oood natured and too well informed . And he was tyrannical in asserting himself ; the sonority of his voice and the weight of his manner bore down all opposition and thrust aside all auxiliaries . There was no conversation possible except little fragmentary t*te-*-t*tes with one 's next neighbor . Straight through dinner and through dessert did that dreadful man hold forth . how he managed to eat , how to breathe , was a mystery . When the ladies had retired , he resumed his seat with a sentence beginning with an and , ' that connected it with what he was saying when our hostess rose ; and he ceased not to pour down his flood of words upon us until we found refuge in the drawing-room . Such men are tolerated in England , perhaps , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tedious and oppressive of all social solemnities , a formal dinner party . I was about to say that such talkers would not be tolerated here ; but do we not listen to after-dinner speeches ? What , then , is the limit of our endurance ? Dinner , even daily family dinner , is such a religious rite in England that above a certain condition of life a special dress for it is absolutely required . Full evening dress at dinner is in England the mark of gentry . I once made a mistake in this respect . Being invited to a country house , some thirty miles from London , where I had time to stay but one day , and being a traveler , I thought that I might venture to go with only a small hand bag , and to appear at dinner in a dark frock and white waistcoat . English lllianners . December , But I found that I might better have brought my portmanteau , my dressin*-case , and my valet , if I had had one . It would be impossible for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in a way that could not be mistaken . The very flames of the wax candles in the great silver candelabra seemed to look askance at me , as I dared to sit there in my plebeian costume . The feeling amused me ; for I have little real respect for mere social conventionalities , least of all for those which concern dress . That a gentleman should be scrupulously nice in his person at all times , and that it is well for him to dress becomingly and appropriately , need not be said ; but that he , as well as the butler and the waiters , should put on such a queer garment as a black swallow - tailed dress-coat and a white neck-tie , and that a lady should make herself uncomfortable by her full dress ( for , ladies , it does make you u*-comfortable ; you know it does ) , because they are going to eat and drink together , . as they eat and drink every day , is not with me an article of saving faith . Such is the social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an unregenerate creature like me to see them at any time violate any one of their unwritten commandments ; and I took great comfort , one day , at seeing a belated honorable ( that is , the son of a peer ) come hastily in and sit down to dinner , like a profane mortal , in his tweed cutaway coat . I also could not avoid observing that men who were , very scrupulous about evening dress were less fastidious upon other points of manners which could hardly be called conventional . I have seen a peer , who would almost as soon dine in his shirt and trousers as in a morning coat , sit after dinner in the drawing-room talking with a lady , and , taking his foot upon his knee to nurse , gradually run his hand half-way up his trousers that he might scratch his leg ; and his was not a solitary instance of performan*es somewhat of this kind . To me , a " salvage man " as I am , born and bred in the wilderness of New York , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ haunts over the waste places of New England , there did nevertheless seem to be some incon ruitv in the code of manners which prescribed swallow-tails , but permitted . scratching , and which required buttoned coats and laced-up boots at breakfast tables at which flrere were no napkins . Once more I must leave a subject but half exhausted . Richard Grant White .
