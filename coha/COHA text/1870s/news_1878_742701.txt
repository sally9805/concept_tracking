txt Great uneasiness , about the future of the anthracite coal ; rade is manifesting itself both here and in Philadelphia . The trade is reported dull , prices weak , the market inactive , and the announced decision of the Board of Control to force 1,750.000 tons during June on a market which , it is estimated , would be well supplied with half that amount , has had an alarming effect on the trade . The Board of Control , in taking this action , has adopted the more hopeful of the two antagonistic views in which the coal trade is regarded just now -- -this is , that the supply of last year 's coal which the mild Winter enabled consumers to carry over is now exhausted , and its . Dlnce must be filled by a fresh supply ; also , that buyers who have been withholding orders in the hope of breaking the combination of the coal companies and thus securing lower prices must now abandon that idea and lay in their Fall and Winter supply , lest in the rush of business toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bins , especially if cold weather happens to set in early and put a premature embargo on navigation . This theory is entertained by those who expect the best ; by it they explain the dull business rand frequent suspensions during the first half of the year ; by it they account for the shipment of only 7,000,000 tons in the six months to end with June ; to it they pin their faith that from 11,000,000 to 1 ' 2,000,000 tons can be marketed in the six months beginning with July . The other view is less sanguine . It sees in the small sales of coal the result of an economy on the part of consumers practiced until it has become a habit . It looks for a continuance of the resistance of buyers to the combination at ' least until August , because the former combination was broken in August . And it predicts bard times , inability to meet obligations , failures , and perhaps worse evils to arise from the inability of producers to turn their coal into money at the proper time . Ten days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the majority ; but the region started from its two weeks ' idleness last Monday with a great rush of coal to the shipping ports , and as it piled up in accumulating heaps on the wharves for want of orders to clear it away . the hopes of its owners were commensurately depressed . Mr. Gowen announced that the miners would be kept at work for nearly or quite four weeks in this month ; but though the first one is only half gone many complaints are heard , and a general desire expressed ' that the Schuylkill region shall work only two weeks in June instead of four , and , indeed , that a general suspension be had until the trade can recover from its depression . Not only are the private operators making this demand , but at least one of the companies in the combination is seconding it , as the only way to equalize the demand and supply . The key to this disturbed condition of things is to be found in the chronic poverty of the Reading Railroad Company . It is making every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 . It is to the company 's interest to get as much coal to market in June as possible , for the more coal sold the more money received , and the more coal carried , whether sold or stocked , the more freights and tolls collected . It has been openly stated for several weeks that the company was borrowing heavily on short time , not only from banks but from private individuals , and especially from coal shippers end dealers . A method much practiced is to estimate the amount of indebtedness for freight and tolls to be incurred by a certain shipper in 30 , 60 , and 90 days , and induce him to give notes for the several amounts , the notes to bear no interest . These notes are then discounted , and so turned into cash . Similarly , contracts are made with buyers who , in consideration of giving their notes , are given the privilege of taking coal in payment , at the price then ruling , whenever they want it , without regard to the prices that may prevail when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as discounting the future too heavily Mr. Gowen replies that a large coal trade , with good prices , may be looked for in the Fall , and that he will then be able to place his company on a comparatively independent footing , and makeup all the losses it is suffering now .
