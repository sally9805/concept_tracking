Dorr , Julia C. R. ( Julia Caroline Ripley ) , 1825-1913 : I. When I awake at morn , refreshed , renewed from Friar Anselmo and other poems ( 1879 ) When I awake at morn , refreshed , renewed , Glad with the gladness of the jocund day And jubilant with all the birds of May , My spirit shrinks from Night 's dull quietude . With it and Sleep I have a deadly feud . I hear the young winds in the maples play , The river singing on its happy way , The swallows twittering to their callow brood . The fresh , fair earth is full of joyous life ; The tree-tops toss in billowy unrest ; The very mountain shadows are astir ! With eager heart I thrill to join the strife ; Doing , not dreaming , to my soul seems best , And I am lordly Day 's true worshiper ! Dorr , Julia C. R. ( Julia Caroline Ripley ) , 1825-1913 : II . But when with Day 's long weariness oppressed , from Friar Anselmo and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weariness oppressed , With folded hands I watch the sun go down , Lighting far torches in the steepled town , And kindling all the glowing , reddening west ; When every sleepy bird has sought its nest ; When the long shadows from the hills are thrown , And Night 's soft airs about the world are blown , Thou heart of mine , how sweet it is to rest ! O , Israfil ! Thou of the tuneful voice ! It will be night-fall when thy voice I hear , Summoning me to slumber soft and low ! Day will be done . Then will I not rejoice That all my tasks are o'er and rest is near , And , like a tired child , be glad to go ?
