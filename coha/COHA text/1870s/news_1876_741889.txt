txt The evil in New-York , which is the source of so Many , of our ills , both sanitary and criminal , is , as everyone knows , the overcrowding of our tenement-houses . In twenty-two of our wards a population of 365,000 are housed in 17,110 dwellings , or with an average of 21% persons to each dwelling . In certain of our lowest wards the average is much greater . No permanent improvement of ' our laboring class can ever take place while young and old , male and female , and different families are thus crowded and packed together . The ' great and striking Contrast between the working classes of New-York and Philadelphia , is due especially to the difference in the way in which the poor is housed in the two cities , the average to the house in the " Quaker City " being only six . Each Winter our poorest laboring class is reduced to the verge of starvation ; they save little or nothing in the working months ; their children are vagrants on the street , and great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In Philadelphia , on the other hand , suffering seems to be mainly confined to the helpless and the unfortunate . The general average of the laboring classes are comparatively well off . We have often called attention to this remarkable contrast , as we believe it is due to certain practical causes which can be remedied . Our own position , as regards locality and breadth of land occupied by the City , is certainly inferior to that of Philadelphia . That city can spread in every direction from one nucleus . We are essentially confined to one . But even this inferiority is being remedied . We ? are having now " rapid transit " to the Hudson River and Westchester towns , and shall soon , no doubt , see cheap workmen 's trains running at convenient hours to and from these localities . Real estate , too , is falling in value , and it will perhaps be easier in the future to build cheap houses on cheap lots than it has been . But the great superiority of Philadelphia has been in the happy thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started " Building Associations " and trained up a generation of working men to manage their own money matters , to husband their savings ; turn over their . investments , and thus ' become foe-holders and landlords instead of tenants . It is not creditable to the leaders ' of the working class of New-York that they have never been able to plant this most useful institution on any large scale in this City . It will take many years now for New-York to equal her sister city in this most ingenious device for improving the condition of the laboring classes . For this help must not come from above ; from philanthropists or reformers of the fortunate classes ; it must originate from , and be carried on by the working classes themselves to be of any use . The lesson of saving and . investing money in land , of borrowing and lending , must be learned from hard . experience .. Now hundreds of thousands of the hard-earned savings of the laboring classes are to be seen in splendid buildings in this City where they return no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be seen in thousands of modest cottages , owned by the laborers and mechanics themselves . We have before us the second annual report of a new building and loan association  --  the " Republic " of Philadelphia . It differs , so far as we know , in nothing from the other six hundred associations , except that it has been started in these hard years . And yet Its business during its ? second year amounts to $28,726 ; it has 248 stockholders , owning 1,626 shares ; its premiums , during the year averaged 3034 per cent. , and its capital amounts to $50,090 . Each of the members expects in less than nine years to be the owner of his little house ou which the association are lending him , and paying no more than he would in rent to an ordinary landlord . The remarkable thing about this " working men 's bank " is that the total cost of turning over and managing this capital of $50,000 was only $427 55 for the year . It is this wonderful economy of management which has enabled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred , with a membership of 55,000 and the control of millions of capital . When will New-York imitate this most important movement for the industrial classes ?
