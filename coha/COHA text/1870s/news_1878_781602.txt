txt The case of Mr. POPKIN , dealer in ' clothing , which was duly reported in the Police Court trials yesterday , very admirably illustrates the fate which sooner or later over " - takes those men who are popularly described as " too smart for anything . " Mr. POPKIN , it is said , met three men who were dealers in counterfeit currency . Tho dull monotony of trade and the light returns of honest business did not satisfy the ambitious mind of POPKIN . Ho wanted larger profits and quicker returns . It did not satisfy him that he sold to-day for $4 75 a pair of trousers which cost him $2 17 day before yesterday . Ho wanted to sell ten pairs of trousers per day , instead of four - pairs . The dealers in counterfeit money showed him very conclusively that if ho gave in exchange for a $5 note a pair of trousers which cost $2 17 , and an imitation greenback which cost 10 cents , he would make a clear profit of $2 73 . And if he should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would clear about $7 on the entire operation . To a man who has been struggling to make both ends meet , and with indifferent success , this suggestion would be captivating . POPKIN bit eagerly at the proffered bait . It was agreed , according to POPKIN , that he should pay $300 in good notes for an amount of " the queer " which should represent $1,000 . This was a high price , to bo sure , but the counterfeit money was represented as being so very superior to any in the market that it eouldnot be distinguished from the genuine . It could be passed off upon customers with absolute impunity . Of course , oven the lay reader will understand that a really good counterfeit bank-note , as a work of art , has a certain value which an inferior article does not possess . And $300 for a bundle of counterfeit notes professing to represent $1,000 , in various degrees of perfection , was not too high a price . The real object , as will bo seen , was to induce POPKIN to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was possible . POPKIN , accordingly , took $300 , and , accompanied by a superior and intelligent brother-in-law , went to the rendezvous appointed by the dealers in " the queer . " . Appropriately enough , it was in a rum-shop that the transaction was to be carried out . Affairs of this sort are more at home in a rum-shop than anywhere else . Mr. POPKIN , the honest clothier , was to receive counterfeit notes purporting to represent $1,000 in exchange for $300 , lawful money . It would have been a good joke on POPKIN7S part if he had proffered $300 in counterfeit notes for $1,000 in other counterfeits . But being an honest man , POPKIN attempted no such nefarious scheme . The alleged dealers in the counterfeits professed that they were afraid of the Police . The rum-shop was too public . They proposed to go into a dark hallway adjoining the shop , where the transfer could be made without attracting the attention of impertinent outsiders , while the obliging brother-h  --  law kept watch at the outer door . So , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man who was willing to buy and disburse counterfeit notes , and three men who professed to be willing to manufacture and sell the same . It was an irregular transaction . It was not a case of diamond cut diamond . Rather , it was a case of three diamonds cutting one diamond .
