ART . V. - The Lawyer and his Clients . Correspondence of Messrs . DAVID DUDLEY and DUDLEY FIELD , of the New York Bar , with Mr. SAMUEL BOWLES , of the Springfield Republican . Springfield . 1871 . BOSWELL gives this account of a conversation with Dr. Johnson - " I asked him whether , as a moralist , he did not think that the practice of the law in some degree hurt the nice feeling of honesty . " . Joknson . Why , no , Si ! . , if you act properly . You are not to deceive your clients with false representations of your opinion ; you are not to tell lies to a judge . " Boswell . But what do you think of supporting a cause which you know to be bad ? " Johnson . Sir , you do not know it to be good or bad till the judge determines it . I have said that you are to state facts fairly ; so that your thinking , or what you call knowing , a cause to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposing your arguments to be weak and inconclusive . But , sir , that is not enough . An argument which does not convince yourself may convince the judge to whom you urge it ; and if it does convince him , why then , sir , you are wrong and he is right . It is his business to judge ; and you are not to be confident in your own opinion that a cause is bad , but to say all you can for your client , and then hear the judge 's opinion . " Boswell . But , sir , does not affecting a warmth when you have no warmth , and appearing to be clearly of one opinion when you are in reality of another opinion , - does not such dissimulation impair one 's honesty ? Is there not some danger that a lawyer rnny put on the same mask in common life , in the intercourse with his friends ? " Johnson . Why , no , sir . Everybody knows you are paid for affecting warmth for your client ; and it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bar you resume your usual behavior . " And it is continually said : " One side of a case is right and the other side is wrong . Counsel , then , on one side or the other in a cause , is always arguing against the right and in favor of the wrong . " The question of the duties of counsel has recently had a special interest given it by the correspondence between Mr. // David Dudley Field and Mr. Samuel Bowles . No one , at this day , will claim for counsel the latitude allowed them , by Dr. Johnson , in the extract just given . But what is all this talk of affecting warmth when you do not feel it , of supporting the wrong side of a cause , of arguing against your belief , of the insincerity or dishonesty of the advocate ? Where is the blame to be placed of prosecuting bad causes ? What do counsel commonly do ? What can counsel rightly do ? And what have counsel , in fact , of late years been doing ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argue a cause without a client , how he can argue a point of fact without having witnesses , how he can argue a point of law without citing cases . Perhaps , even if counsel go into court with a bad cause , there is as much guilt on the client 's shoulders , who brought the cause to the counsel , as on the counsel 's shoulders , who took the cause from the client . Moreover , it is one of the commonest things in the world for judges to differ in their views of the law of the same case , for jurymen to differ in their views of the facts of the same case , for clients to differ in their views of the justice of the same case , and for witnesses to differ in their stories of the same case , all being equally honest . If , then , judges , jurymen , clients , arid witnesses can honestly err , why are the counsel deprived of the same very reasonable privilege ? For , be it remembered , a counsel goes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ client , and judges and jury are often in doubt and utterly unable to agree , after hearing from both clients both sides . It may , then , be possible for counsel to be on what is finally adjudged to be the wrong side of a cause , and still have been honest in his advocacy of it . And what does the counsel , in conducting the trial of an ordinary cause in a court really do ? For , of course , the abnormal knaves of the profession , as in any general discussion , are here to be thrown out of consideration . In the case of Ryves v. The Attorney-General , which attracted so much notice a few years since , where Mrs. Ryves attempted to establish her claim to royal lineage , this occurrence is reported : - // " Dr. Smith then proceeded to address the jury for the petitioner , and was beginning to say that on his honor he believed his client 's case to be well founded , ' when the Lord Chief Justice interfered , and peremptorily said he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own belief . To do so were a violation of* the rules of the profession , and a dishonor to counsel . ' Dr. Smith apologized . " And this same thing would be done in any rightly ordered court . It is understood , that counsel , in arguing cases , do not make statements of matters of fact on their own authority . They comment on what witnesses have sworn to . They are not allowed to do more than that . And as to arguments on points of law , generally , if counsel have no points of law in their case that deserve a hearing , they do not get a hearing . And few intelligent counsel will take up the time of a heedless judge by talking nonsense . Moreover , there remains , behind all these points , the one fact , that counsel , who often argue losing causes , very soon argue no causes at all . And as to the question what counsel can rightly do , it is plain in the beginning that , on many points , the duties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is wrong for a client to take away another man 's property , or keep him out of his rights . It is wrong for counsel to help his client do either of these things by the use or abuse of the process of the court . And , as to the mere argument of causes in court , if a counsel never knowingly misstate facts or law , he can have a very clear conscience . There remains one other point . If it be considered settled what a counsel has a right to do for his clients , there still remains the point in some minds to be decided , what clients counsel has a right to have . And , on this point , the choice of the lawyer must be absolutely unlimited , and for his choice he can be blamed by no one . A lawyer has the right to take any clients he chooses . Sinners do have rights and must have justice . They can not have justice without counsel . In a criminal proceeding no lawyer has a right to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for lack of counsel to protect him . In a civil cause ev.ry lawyer does , as a matter of fact , and does rightly , consult his own wishes as to accepting or rejecting particular cases or particular clients . The want // of a sufficiently large retainer is a ground which will appeal at once to the reason of any professional man , and very rightly . Men of reputation can not be asked to give the power they have gained after long years of toil and study without being paid for it . Any lawyer is at perfect liberty to take any client that lie chooses , with blame from no one . But what he may do for his client , after he takes him , is not matter to be unquestioned by others . This brings us to the correspondence between Mr. David Dudley Field and Mr. Bowles . In December , 1870 , in the New York correspondence of the Springfield Republican am peared some very severe remarks in relation to Mr. Field 's professional conduct and reputation . Mr. Field wrote to Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disavowal of the offensive matter . Thereupon ensued a long correspondence . It is here possible only to give a very brief statement of the points made or attempted to be made on either side . Mr. Bowles makes two charges against Mr. Field : first , that Mr. Field has , in Mr.* Fisk and Mr. Gould , clients notoriously bad men , who have robbed and are now robbing other men of their property ; and second , that Mr. Field , as their counsel , has aided them in so doing . This is the substance . To this Mr. Field replies that he is not responsible to any one for his choice of clients , and that , assuming his clients to be bad men , it is not only his , Mr. Field 's , right , but his bounden duty , to defend them in their rights , and that he never has done anything but defend them in their rights . He says : - " To give this as a reason for not defending them , is equivalent to saying that the saints @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sues a sinner , the sinner shall not be defended . If it should happen that a saint wrongs a sinner , the sinner shall not sue the saint In this state of things I know no better general rule than this : that the lawyer , being intrusted by government with the exclusive function of representing litigants before the courts , is bound to represent any person who has any rights to be asserted or defended . If a person has no rights , the lawyer is not bound to assist . If he has any rights , the lawyer is bound to see them respected , if he can I do not assent to the theory of Brougham , that the lawyer should know nobody but his client . I insist that he should defend his client per fas and not per nefas . By this rule I am willing to be judged . // I am quite willing to leave to time the foimation of a just public opinion . When that time comes , it will be known that , whatever may be the faults of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for whom I speak with knowledge , has been governed by nothing but a sense of duty You have ventured to arraign my professional conduct . I repel your charge , and challenge you to specify an instance . You fail to specify any , but say public opinion is against me. hat will not do ; you must go further or submit to be branded as a libeller I have never been consulted beforehand about the management of the Erie Railway , or the issue of any of its stock or bonds , or the payment of any dividend to any stockholder or class of stockholders , or about what is known as the Erie classification bill , or about the gold operations of 1869 , or any of the private transactions of Messrs . Gould and Fisk , or either of them , or about any transaction whatever of this company or these gentlemen , to which , so far as I now recollect , any exception has been taken . " And , finally , Mr. Bowles goes so far as to admit : - " I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that you are acting sincerely , if not intelligently . . " You have sinned against no statute ; I will not undertake to say , even , that you have violated any prescript of the code professional . Within those lines you are wiser than I , and I shall not follow you " Thus I dismiss the most of your argument as purely technical , and not pertinent to my view of the subject . " It has been here attempted to give with fairness , in the words of the disputants themselves , the main points of this correspondence . And it must , it would seem , be admitted that Mr. Bowles does not make a very strong case . Mr. Field is a very cunning master of fence . Mr. Bowles had not the knowledge necessary for him on these points to cope with his opponent ; and , as far as this controversy with Mr. Bowles is concerned , Mr. Field is undoubtedly right . Neither Mr. Bowles nor any one else has the slightest right to question Mr. Field 's choice of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as he did , this statement about Mr. Field , that " his connection with Fisk and Gould secures him the favor of Barnard and the other ring judges , though it has destroyed his reputation as a high-toned lawyer with the public , " unless he can , when called on , come forward with the facts to prove his statements . // 1811 . Lawyer and Client . This dispute has drawn to itself great attention , and rightly . Mr. Field has as nearly a cosmopolitan reputation as any member of the bar in this country . He is a man of great acuteness of mind , a very thoroughly read lawyer , has a muscular strong grasp of legal principles , and he well deserves the highest opinions that have ever been held of his ability . Moreover , he was educated in a day when the purity of the bench in New York was never for an instant questioned , when the most honorable traditions of the profession were taught and practised . He continually shows in court his thorough acquaintance with these traditions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Field belongs to the time when , as Mr. Evarts said in his address at the meeting called for the organization of the Bar Association of New York , " for a lawyer to come out from the chambers of a judge with an cx parte writ that he could not defend before the public , would have occasioned the same sentiment towards him as if he came out with a stolen pocket-book . " Beyond a doubt , Mr. Field knows very well what the honor of his profession demands of him . If there have been professional sins on his part , they surely have not been sins of ignorance . If such a man as Mr. Field has been guilty of the outrages with which Mr. Bowles and other men continually charge him , the public should know it , and should well ponder on it . For it shows something " rotten in the state of Denmark . " It is proposed , then , here to briefly examine some of the legal features of one of Mr. Fisk 's " raids , " as he calls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Albany &amp; Susquehanna Railroad . This litigation , in its activity , lasted only about two months . But in this space of time there was a perfect meteoric shower of suits , injunctions , and receiverships , that has not been surpassed in any of the Erie wars . It is not intended here to give a history of them , or even any mention of more than three or four of these suits , but simply to examine , at no great length , the character of a very few of the legal proceedings taken by counsel on Mr. Fisk 's side of this controversy , and then to examine Mr. David Dudley Field 's part in some of these proceedings . And it will be necessary , for the right understanding of the // legal proceedings here mentioned , to give a very short statement of some of the cardinal unquestioned principles of the law in relation to the granting of injunctions and receiverships , which , under the New York code , are both called provisional remedies . But these principles here ' to be stated are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ layman . Under the New York code the pleading made by the plaintiff is called the complaint , and in its form it is somewhat like the old bill in chancery ; and it has ordinarily a verification on the part of the plaintiff , to the effect that " it is true except as to the matters therein stated on information and belief , and as to those matters he believes it to be true . " This complaint proves nothing . It is merely the plaintiff 's statement , for the purposes of the trial , of what he conceives to be the facts constituting his cause of action . And they must be proved by him on the trial , before he can have his judgment or decree . The writ of injunction , or injunction order , as it is termed in the practice under the New York code , is an order enjoining or forbidding , pending the suit , some act on the part of the defendant which would be specially injurious to the plaintiff , and against which the plaintiff has no other protection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this injunction order is continually granted , and rightly granted , ex pane , or on the application of one party without hearing the other . Of course , however , in such cases , the court , under the decisions , and in accordance with every principle ' of law and justice , requires the clearest proof , on the part of the plaintiff , of his rights , and of the damage to his rights , which would ensue without the injunction . This proof , too , must be by affidavit . The affidavit , too , must show facts . It must be , too , the affidavit of a party testifying of his own knowledge , and not of hearsay . The necessity of an affidavit no one would ever question ; but , under the circumstances , it may be well to cite one New York authority . Mr. Justice Ingraham says , in the case of ilecker V. The Mayor , &amp;c. , 18 Abbott Rep. 371 : " I have repeatedly held , that an injunction should not be granted on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rule . And such rule has been adhered to // since the adoption of the code . " These points are law and common sense . And it is even questionable whether a judge has any jurisdiction to grant an injunction without an affidavit , and whether , if he does so , the injunction is not absolutely void . And in granting receiverships of property , the plaintiff , both under the old equity practice and under the New York code , is required clearly to establish two points , - first , that he himself has some right in the property which is the subject of the action ; and , second , that the property is in danger of being lost or materially injured , pending the suit , if left in the possession of the defendant . And this is very reasonable . For no plaintiff can , with reason , ask a court to take possession of property for him , unless he has himself some right in the property . Nor can he ask a court to take such property from the possession of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the property stays where it is . And in the case of a i'eceivership as well as of an injunction , these points , required to be proved , must be proved by affidavit . The affidavit , too , must show facts . It must be , too , the affidavit of a person testifying of his own knowledge , and not of hearsay . These points being stated , some parts of the Albany &amp; Susquehanna litigation may be considered . The contest was between the Fisk party and the Ramsey party for the control of the road , and the main point , finally , was to carry the election for directors , on the 7th September , 1869 . It was decided , in the case of The People v. The Albany &amp; Susquehanna Railroad Company and Others , that , out of about thirty thousand shares of stock of the company , Mr. Fisk and his friends controlled only about six thousand five hundred shares . The court , too , further decides that Mr. Fisk and his associates , owning only about one fifth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road on the day of the election , " took possession of one of the rooms of the office of the company , and filled the same , and made an unlawful organization of themselves , as a pretended stockholders ' meeting ; that the holding thereof was in pursuance of a previous conspiracy and fraudulent design between said associates , made for the purpose of interfering with and hindering a lawful election , and procuring an // unlawful and sham election ; that in pursuance of said conspiracy they brought from the city of New York a large number of men , who were not stockholders of the company , and who were rough , rude , and dangerous persons , and placed them in said room , with the intent and design that they should participate in said meeting , and prevent lawful stockholders from attending said meeting ; that in further execution of said conspiracy , and with intent to hinder the defendant , Ramsey , the president of said company , and William L. M. Phelps , the secretary and treasurer of said company , and henry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their duties at said annual election , and with intent thereby to hinder a lawful stockholders ' meeting , they did , on the 6th day of September , 1869 , fraudulently procure an order for the arrest of said Ramsey , Phelps , and Smith at or about the time of the organization of the said pretended stockholders ' meeting . " The foregoing statement is condensed , by simply leaving out from the decision of the court words and phrases here useless , but there . necessary , which do not in the least vary the meaning . But general statements are not enough , nor do they , at all , by themselves , concern Mr. David Dudley Field . Three or four of these proceedings will themselves be examined . The first proceeding , worthy of notice , was the suit of Mr. Joseph Bush . Mr. David Groesbeck and some other gentlemen held three thousand shares of this Susquehanna stock , which they had purchased of the company . In his complaint , Bush stated that , " as he is informed and believes , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have a receiver of this stock appointed by the court . Now in this suit of Mr. Bush , brought by Messrs . Field and Shearman , there were three peculiarities : first , there was no affidavit as to any point ; second , the plaintiff did not pretend to have any interest whatever in this stock ; third , the plaintiff did not pretend that there was any danger whatever of injury to the stock . However , on the 14th August , 1869 , an order was granted , without a hearing , by Mr. Justice Barnard , appointing William J. A. Fuller receiver of these three thousand shares of stock . Mr. Fuller had been a clerk in Mr. Field 's office . He took possession of the stock , under // this order , for the purpose and with the intent , as Mr. Justice Smith says in his decision , of voting on it in the Fisk interest , in opposition to the wishes of the rightful owners ; and he did so vote . Now , even if it had been clearly proved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issued , the most that any one could by possibility have claimed , was that an injunction should issue restraining any one from voting on it . But such an injunction would only have hindered Mr. Groesbeck from voting on the stock . The receivership allowed Mr. Bush , through his receiver , to vote on it himself . And the result of this manoeuvre was , that three thousand votes were taken from the Ramsey interest and given to the Fisk interest , and were used in the Fisk interest , by an order obtained , on no proof whatever , by any person whatever , of any fact whatever . Mr. Ramsey was himself , however , the head and front of the opposition to Mr. Fisk 's plans . He was the president and a director of the company . A suit was commenced in the name of David Wilbur , who lived in Otsego County . There are courts and counsel in Otsego County quite able to give Mr. Wilbur justice , if he wished justice . Mr. Wilbur , however , , begins his suit in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his attorneys . Mr. Wilbur , in his complaint , alleges that , " as he is informed and believes , " Mr. Ramsey has done certain things and has not done certain other things . No affidavit of any person to any fact is offered . And on the 4th of August an injunction order is obtained ex parte from Mr. Justice Barnard , ordering " that the defendant , Joseph II . Ramsey , refrain from exercising the offices of president and director , or either of them , and from issuing any stock of said company , or in any way interfering in its affairs , until the further order of this court . " Now if it had been clearly proved , by affidavit , of some person , that some party defendant had done or was about to do something which would injure the plaintiff , a court of equity might have enjoined such defendant from doing some particular wrong . No proof whatever was given , by any party , of any wrong , and Mr. Ramsey was enjoined from doing any act . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four members of the board of directors from acting as such , on the allegations that these four directors had fraudulently entered into a conspiracy to transfer the property and control of the railroad to the Erie Railway Company . The four enjoined Fisk directors , as they were called , were Leonard , Herrick , North , and Wilbur . The injunction is served on them , on the morning of the 6th August , in Albany . Leonard and Herrick live in Albany . They wish justice speedily from the nearest source . They go at once to New York City . They go to Mr. Fisk 's Grand Opera House . They find there Mr. Fisk , Mr. Gould , and Mr. Shearman . As to what follows , Mr. Thomas G. Shearman ' s version of the events will first be given , with the assumption that it is true . A complaint is prepared , the plaintiff this time being Azro Chase . Mr. Chase also lives in Otsego County , where there are courts and counsel quite able to give him justice if he wishes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shearman , appear for Mr. Chase , and his suit is brought in New York City . On his complaint an order is obtained from Mr. Justice Barnard , appointing Charles Courter and James Fisk , Jr . receivers " of all the property of the Albany &amp; Susquehanna Railroad Company . " Messrs . Field and Shearman obtained this order that took away one hundred and forty-two miles of railroad and the entire property of a large corporation , amounting to several millions of dollars , from a judge , at chambers , without notice and without a hearing . The order suspending Mr. Ramsey was served on him on the morning of the 5th of August . The order suspending Leonard and his three co-directors was served on the morning of the 6th of August . The order for the Fisk receivership was granted about half past ten o'clock on the evening of the 6th . The receivers at once started from the Grand Opera House to take the night train for Albany . But on the arrival of these receivers in Albany on the morning of the 7th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pruyn , a receiver appointed in an action commenced the day before in the Supreme Court at Albany , where the property was . And here came , on the part of the Fisk party , what is , // so far as the writer is aware , the most extraordinary proceeding recorded in the history of English or American law . And to make clear the nature of the proceeding , it will be necessary to explain briefly what is a writ of assistance . Where an order directing the delivery of certain property to a receiver has been properly served , and the receiver is still unable to get possession of the property , in certain cases a writ of assistance issues , directing the sheriff to put the receiver in possession of that property . To warrant the issuing of the writ , two points must be established : first , that the order ap .. pointing the receiver has been duly served ; and , second , that the delivery of the property has been refused after such service . Moreover , as in the other cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the affidavit of a person swearing to them positively of his own knowledge . In this Chase suit Mr. Fisk was unable to get possession of the property of the railroad . He and his counsel were in Albany . The property was in Albany . Mr. Chase , the plaintiff , was in Albany . If they had not their rights , and speed were necessary in getting them their rights , the nearest court was , of course , to be found . But application , in this case , for the writ of assistance , is made by Mr. Thomas G. Shearman in New York City , on this same 7th of August , to Mr. Justice Barnard . So Mr. Shearman testifies . Of course he has him self 110 knowledge of what has been doing in Albany an hour before . But this Prospero , in his lonely cell at the Grand Opera House , hath a weird potency . Mr. Shearman makes an affidavit . He does not swear that the order appointing the receivers has ever been served on any one . He does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Shearman makes his affidavit that he has received a telegram from Albany , and that he " is informed " that opposition is made to the receivers by certain persons ; that attempts have been made to eject the receivers from the office of the company by force . And on no other affidavit than this , Mr. Shearman testifies that he obtained a writ of assistance from Mr. Justice Barnard , directed to the sheriff of Albany County , and all other counties where the company had property , directing them to put Mr. Fisk and Mr ; Courter in possession of that property . // This is not quite enough , however . Mr. Shearman , by a supplemental complaint , brings in new parties . And then appears , with the writ of assistance , on no affidavit but the one before mentioned of Mr. Shearman that he is " informed " of something by a telegram , what purports to be an injunction , of which the terms are so singular that two clauses of it will be given verbatim . The order enjoins the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the receiver appointed in another action , the plaintiff in that other action , the sheriff , and the Police Commissioners of Albany " from disturbing or interfering with Charles Courter and James Fisk , Jr. , receivers appointed in this action , in the performance of their duties as such receivers ; from interfering with the possession of such receivers ; from hindering or delaying them in taking possession of any property or effects of the above-named railroad company , or held in trust for it ; from refusing or neglecting to deliver to the said receivers all and every the property and effects of the said company , or that may be held in trust for the same , of any name and nature , real or personal ; and from inciting or encouraging any opposition , or permitting any opposition to be made to the said receivers in the discharge of their duties as such . " " That all the defendants refrain from commencing or prosecuting any action for the purpose of obtaining an injunction against said company , or its officers , agents , or servants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appointed herein , and also from commencing or prosecuting any action for the appointment of a receiver or receivers of said company , or from making any application therefor , except to this court , in this action . " As has been stated , the Police Commissioners of the city of Albany were made parties defendant by this supplemental complaint . The only allegation in this complaint which even mentions or refers to these commissioners is as follows : " That , as the plaintiff is informed and believes . . . . , the said . . . , have attempted to eject the said receivers by force and violence , and are still attempting so to do . " Not one word of evidence was laid before Mr. Justice Barnard when he granted this injunction . The papers which were laid before him showed clearly that there could be no evidence . // 1871 . Lawyer and Client . It must be admitted to have a kind of grim grotesque humor . Armed with two or three injunctions of this kind , one might with safety say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I survey . " But , after all , this injunction is partial , incomplete . It is applicable to only one particular case . It is better to find at once a formula for an injunction for all cases . And , none being found in the books , the writer takes the liberty of suggesting the following , which is doubtless capable of great improvement . Have in the beginning the ordinary complaint , that , " as the plaintiff is informed and believes , " some one , no matter who , has done something , no matter what . Leave out altogether the names of parties defendant , to be inserted as need arises . Let the injunction read , " it is ordered that the defendants , and each of them , refrain from refusing or neglecting to do anything that the plaintiff may request . " Or , in order to have definiteness of evidence in case of a proceeding for contempt , it might be well to amend the last clause thus : " that the plaintiff may request in writing . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provision , " that the defendants bring no suit , and make no application for relief , except to this court in this action . " Add a receivership of the defendants ' property . And if injunctions of this kind are adopted , it will at once do away with the necessity of any examination as to the limits of the powers of a court of equity . And the terms of such an injunction are no broader than those of the one already cited . But the manner of serving this new Chase injunction , and of executing this writ of assistance , is another novelty . Most persons know that an injunction order can not be served without producing the original order . Nor can a writ be executed by the sheriff until he has it in his possession . The injunction was to be served and the writ executed in Albany . Both writ and injunction , as a matter of fact , were in New York . Inconvenient it was , surely . The inconvenience might , perhaps , have been avoided , had application been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and writ had been obtained by telegraph ; why not serve and execute them by telegraph ? About nine o'clock in the morning Mr. Fisk has his misadventure in not getting possession of the property of the road . // About three o'clock in the afternoon the sheriff in Albany has in his hands what purports to be the writ of assistance , issued in New York City ; and the counsel of Mr. Gould is with him , urging him to execi*te it . The counsel of the railroad company calls the attention of the sheriff to the fact that the ink is not dry on the writ , signed in New York by a New York justice , reciting on its face matters that had taken place in Albany only five or six hours before . And the sheriff very wisely concluded that , on such process , it would be dangerous to try to take away the entire property of a large railroad corporation . The words of the writ had been sent by telegraph , by Mr. Shearman , from New York . The original writ was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at four o'clock , P. M. , and reached Albany about ten o'clock in the evening . So Mr. Shearman testifies . This is , perhaps , the nearest approach yet made , on the part of the ordinary human being of the period , to omniscience and omnipotence . But how far is this to go ? You can obtain your writ , with the evidence at one end of the telegraph and the writ at the other end . You can execute your writ with the original at one end and the sheriff with the copy at the other end . Why not do away altogether with the two useless elements , the evidence and the original writ , and get on with copies alone ? Or may we make our own originals ? Or may we have our writs and orders signed in blank ? Among the glorious inventions of the nineteenth century will be recorded that of obtaining process of court without evidence , and executing proces* of court without having it . The name of the inventor is unknown ; but the glory of the invention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thomas G. Shearman and Mr. David Dudley Field . " Non nostrum inter vos tantas coinponere lites . " Who will say , hereafter , that law is merely a science of prece-dents ? But were these orders and writs ever signed in New York ? And were they signed anywhere on the days of their date ? Testimony was , during this litigation , taken in regard to the circumstances under which these orders , which were served in // 80 extraordinary a manner , were obtained . The testimony was very peculiar . It was substantially as follows . Mr. Shearman , during these proceedings , gave his testimony in relation to the obtaining the first order , of the 6th August , which appointed the receivers . According to this testimony , the fir*st thing done , to his knowledge , as to the appointment of Fisk and Courter as receivers , was done in the treasurer 's office at Mr. Fisk 's Grand Opera House , on the evening of the 6th of August , about eight , i. in . The order was taken by his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ procure Mr. Justice Barnard 's signature , and this partner was not absent from his ( Mr. Shearman 's ) presence longer than from 10.20 to 10.35 i. ia. ; and this partner returned with what purported to be Mr. Justice Barnard 's signature at the foot of the order . Mr. Shearman also stated that he was then informed by Mr. Fisk that Judge Barnard was at the house of a friend in the neighborhood . Neither this partner , who is stated to have obtained Judge Barnard 's signature , nor Mr. James Fisk , who is stated to have given Mr. Shearman information as to Judge Barnard 's whereabouts , were at any time produced as witnesses . Mr. Courter , too , one of the receivers , testified that on the morning of the 7th , when they reached Albany , he had no paper relating to the receivership in his possession ; nor could he swear that Fisk had the original order at the railroad office on that morning . Nor can this order , the place of which in space and time it is so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or records of the court . It did not appear in evidence that Judge Barnard was in New York at all on the 6th August . It did appear in evidence that he was in Ponghkeepsie as late as seven , i . M. , on the evening of that day . The distance from Poughkeepsie to New York is about seventy-five miles by rail . The injunction order of the 7th August , even Mr. Shearman swears , was not in Albany when it was pretended to serve it there . The writ of assistance of the same day , Mr. Shearman swears , was not in Albany when it was pretended to execute it there . // This writ of assistance , Mr. Shearman swears , " purports to have been granted by Judge Barnard , sitting at special term in the court-house , and such was my information and belief . " The order for leave to file a supplemental complaint , Mr. Shearman swears , was made on the same day . And he says , " I drew the papers and sent them to the court-house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the court-house " for the 7th August show that this " special term " was held , not by Mr. Justice Barnard , but by Mr. Justice Ingraham . When and where were this writ and . this order granted ? Of another order , bearing date the 10th August , Mr. Shearman swears : " It was granted by a special term of the Supreme Court , held by Judge Barnard . I can not remember on what day , but it was between eleven , A. **i. , and one , * . i*i. , at the court-house in New York City . " The minutes of the " special term of the Supreme Court , " held on this 10th August , " at the court-house in New York City , " show that this " special term " on that day was held , not by Mr. Justice Barnard , but by Mr. Justice Ingraham . On Friday , the 6th August , Judge Barnard was in Poughkeepsie , where his mother was dangerously ill . She died on Sunday , the 8th , and her funeral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the 10th August granted by Mr. Justice Barnard ? And if so , when and where was it granted ? It has not been here attempted to give an account of every step in these legal proceedings , so called . Merely those which are most pertinent to the matter in hand are here related . And the only remaining occurrences that call for notice here are the proceedings connected with the election on the 7th September , 1869 . These proceedings , on the part of the Fisk party , embraced several points . The inspectors for the election had been chosen , as they always were , at the preceding an*nual meeting of stockholders , and the facts making their appointment regular or irregular had been long known to the Fisk party and their counsel . An injunction was obtained enjoining these inspectors from acting as inspectors at the election . This injunction , with printed copies ready for service , was in Albany on the 6th , the day before the election . Of this injunction Mr. Justice Smith // says : " It seems to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was made of this injunction is , I think , the more serious ground of objection to it . " This would dispose of the inspectors , who were supposed to be unfriendly to the Church-Fisk interest , and friendly to the Ramsey intere*t . But further " legal process " was necessary . A suit was commenced in the name of the Albany &amp; Susquehanna Railroad Company , as plaintifi , against Mr. Ramsey , the president , Mr. Phelps , the secretary and treasurer , Mr. Henry Smith , the counsel of the company , and Mr. Pruyn , the receiver , who was also a stockholder in the Ramsey interest . Messrs . Field and Shearman commenced this action , as attorneys for the plaintiff , although there was regular counsel of the railroad company , regularly appointed , and they must have known it . It was stated in the complaint , which no one , either attorney or client , ventured to swear to , that these defendants had , " with intent to cheat and defraud the plaintiff , clandestinely and without authority removed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company 's books . As matter of fact , these books had , on the night of the 5th August , been removed for the purpose of securing them from Mr. Fisk , whether unnecessarily or not needs no discussion here . This action was not brought to recover the books ; nor was there any pretence that it was brought for that purpose . It was brought to recover damages , laid at the sum of fifty thousand dollars , for the removal of these books , which were , as matter of fact , returned uninjured before service of process on either of the defendants . And in this suit an order of arrest was granted by Mr. Justice Barnard , holding each of the defendants to bail in the sum of twenty-five thousand dollars . The authority of Messrs* Field and Shearman to bring this action , and the purpose in bringing it , will more fully appear hereafter . Mr. Justice Smith says of it : " The order of arrest was unauthorized . But assuming it to be otherwise , the order to hold to bail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and exorbitant , and must have been procured to be used , as it was used , on the day of election , in aid of the fraudulent purposes of Mr. Fisk and his associates . " // These election proceedings are the ones that specially concern Mr. David Dudley Field . The election was announced for twelve o'clock , noon , of the 7th September . On that day Mr. Fuller , the receiver of the Groesbeck stock , an impartial officer of the court , meets Mr. Fisk and Mr. Shearman at breakfast , receives his Fisk ballots from Mr. Shearman , and rides to the company 's offices with him , about half past eleven o'clock . So Mr. Fuller testifies . On their way they see the injunction served on one or two of the inspectors , and it was about the same time served on all three of them , within less than half an hour of the time of the election . At half past eleven o'clock , Mr. James Fisk , Jr . and Mr. David Dudley Field enter the railroad company 's office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of " rough , rude , and dangerous " men , to the number of forty or fifty ; Mr. Fisk saying to them , as one witness testifies , " Come on , boys , follow me . " According to the testimony , the appearance of these men was much like that of Sir John Falstaff 's levies , of whom the Knight said , " No eye hath seen such scarecrows . . . . There s but a shirt and a half in all my company . " And Sir John 's final determination , as given in the play , " I 11 not march through Coventry with them , " might have been a safe precedent , for both client and counsel , in the case in question . These men nearly filled the directors ' room , where the stockholders ' meeting had been appointed . They had just come from New York , and each of them had received his proxy on one or two shares of stock . Mr. Field and Mr. Shearman were both there , advising as counsel through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Church , one of Mr. Fisk 's proposed co-directors , was chosen chairman of this stockholders ' meeting . Immediately thereafter the first set of resolutions was passed . One of them was to the effect that , " Whereas , Samuel Hand , Ralph Lathrop , and William Haskell were declared inspectors at the last annual meeting , and whereas they have not been and are not now stockholders , and have been enjoined from acting as inspectors , Resolved , that . . . . the offices of inspectors of election be and the same are hereby declared vacant . " // And another resolution was then passed , appointing , as inspectors , three of Mr. Fisk 's friends , one of them being Mr. Gould 's counsel throughout this whole contest , and another being Mr. Bush , the plaintiff in the receiver suit . This was the first set of resolutions . A second set was offered and passed , at twelve o'clock , or a few seconds after , to the effect " that this meeting proceed with the annual election of directors and inspectors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treasurer 's room immediately after their election , ready to begin receiving votes , precisely at twelve o'clock , and they did so begin to receive votes . Mr. Field and Mr. Shearman were at their side to advise them , and these " rough " men , according to the testimony , voted under the eyes of Messrs . Shearman and David Dudley Field , until Mr. Fisk said , " Let them boys go back . There is enough of them voted . Drive them back . " Just at this time the sheriff appeared , arrested the president , the secretary , and the counsel of the company , under ( as the court say ) an " unauthorized " order , holding them to bail in the " extraordinary and exorbitant " sum of twenty-five thousand dollars , in pursuance of this " fraudulent conspiracy . " Surely there was an artistic completeness to this plan , by whomsoever it may have been arranged . Saith my Lord Bacon , in his Essay " Of Cunning , " " There be , that can pack the cards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Groesbeck and his friends seemed to think that they had some rights in relation to their three thousand shares of stock . They had consequently begun a suit , in which they set forth that they were the owners of these three thousand shares of stock ( as the court say they undoubtedly were ) ; that through a fraudulent conspiracy on the part of Mr. Fisk and his associates a receiver had been illegally appointed , who had taken possession of their shares ( as the court decided was the case ) ; and that this receiver intended to vote thereon ( which was also the case , for he did so vote ) . They thereupon asked and obtained an injunction order , enjoining the holding of any election , unless they , the plaintiffs , were first allowed to vote on their three thousand shares of stock " free from injunction , " and this injunction was duly served on the newly made inspectors , // before they had received a single vote . Mr. Bush , one of these inspectors , testifies that he did not read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and proceeded with the election . A moment 's delay seems to have been all the result . A copy of the injunction was handed to Mr. Shearman , who was standing next the inspectors . He examined it , simply said to Receiver Fuller that an election was enjoined unless the votes on the three thousand shares were first received , and IMr . Fuller , who had been waiting to deposit his votes , at once voted , as he himself testifies , on stock which was by him claimed to be void , in opposition to what he knew to be the wishes of its owners . And Mr. Bush , the plaintiff in the suit where the receiver was appointed , made inspector at a sham election , by the votes of rough men , who were not stockholders , brought from New York by Mr. James Fisk , in pursuance of a conspiracy to prevent the true stockholders from electing the directors of their own corporation , received votes , in disobedience of an injunction of the Supreme Court , on stock which lie had sworn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he himself claimed no interest , in direct opposition to the wishes , as he knew , of the owners of the stock , who were there with their hands tied by injunctions which they obeyed . This was done under the advice of Mr. Thomas G. Shearman , given at the time , as Mr. Shearman himself testifies , in ' the presence of Mr. David Dudley Field . The voting then went on at the Fisk poll . But Mr. Ramsey had wealthy friends present . Bail was immediately given for himself , the secretary , and the counsel , a meeting of the legal stockholders was . then organized , a new poli opened , the election there went on , in ( as the court held ) a perfectly regular manner , the Ramsey ticket , as the court decides , was elected , and Mr. Fisk defeated . And Mr. Justice Smith says in his opinion : " Upon the whole evidence upon this branch of the case , I think I am bound to find , as matter of fact , that there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the election of directors appointed to be held at the time and place aforesaid , by the use and abuse of legal process and proceedings . " " A conspiracy , " the court say , " to carry the election by the use and abuse of legal process and proceedings . " // The judgment of the court in this cause may pessibly be reversed . Be that as it may . For the first time , so far as the writer is aware , in the history of English or American law , a court has decided that there was a " conspiracy and fraudulent design . . . . for the purpose of interfering with and hindering a lawful election , and procuring an unlawful and sham election " of the directors of a corporation ; that in the " execution of said conspiracy " parties did " fraudulently procure an order for the arrest " of the officers and counsel of the company ; and that there was a " fraudulent conspiracy to carry the election of directors by the abuse of legal process . " Grave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would seem to deeply concern counsel . Any court would naturally require very clear evidence before ever giving such a decision . The evidence in this case was very clear . And a slight examination of some points of this evidence will give the means of deciding whether or not the opinion of the court was well founded , and what share Mr. David Dudley Field had in these matters . In all these suits and proceedings which were taken , in the names of different parties , in the interest of Mr. Fisk , the plaintiff 's attorneys were Messrs . Field and Shearman . In this firm Mr. David Dudley Field is a partner , according to the sworn testimony of Mr. Shearman . It does not appear by the evidence that Mr. David Dudley Field personally advised or directed every one of these proceedings . He did personally advise and direct some of them , some of the earliest and some of the latest . But in order to hold him personally responsible for the character of these proceedings , whatever they were , it needs not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ procuring , all the obnoxious orders . No sane man supposes for an instant that any counsel of ordinary shrewdness engages in a litigation like the Susquehanna contest without advising continually at each successive stage of the affair , without being carefully and minutely informed of the contents of every single paper , without thoroughly examining every single fact . Mr. Field is one of the most acute practitioners that has ever been known at the New York bar . Any person who has heard him try a cause in court is well aware how exactly he knows and remembers the slightest particulars // of the most unimportant testimony connected with his case , how his unceasing watchfulness never loses a single point of fact or law . Mr. Field assuredly would consider it an insult to his shrewdness it ' any one should suppose that he was engaged for one day in this Susquehanna litigation , without thoroughly knowing every the least point in it , from the beginning to the end . Now , even if Mr. Field had not himself examined an order or process of court before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did examine it , if it had been wrongly obtained , he was bound neither to use it himself nor to allow any one else to use it . And if it had been rightly obtained , he was bound neither to " abuse " it himself nor to allow any one else to " abuse " it . In such cases it is not enough for him to say that he is not the whole of the firm of Field and Shearman , and that he did not in person procure the obnoxious order or process . Perhaps any ordinary layman can see that , if the order of arrest for Mr. Ramsey and his counsel , after it was signed , had been quietly laid away in a drawer , no one would have been greatly injured . Probably Mr. Ramsey and his counsel would have been quite content for Messrs . Field and Shearman to obtain orders without number , of all kinds , if they were never used . Mr. Field did himself use these orders . As to some , at least , of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consulted beforehand , " and himself advised and directed them . On the evening of the 6th of August , when the Fisk directors , who had been suspended , came to New York , it will be remembered they went at once to the Grand Opera House , and reached there about six o'clock , P. M. They did not come to hear the witching strains of Offenbach . They were seeking the halls of justice . This order of the 6th Mr. Field says he did not procure . But did any one procure it ? Mr. Field did , in his own person , go to Albany on the 9th , to help get possession , under this order , of this railroad . Mr. Field did , in his own person , for the very same purpose , drag his adversaries before Mr. Justice Barnard , on the 12th , on an order , granted or not granted , " at the court-house in New York City " or ekewhere , by Mr. // Justice Barnard , on the 10th , the day of his mother 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper the election proceedings have the most interest . On the evening of the 6th of September , the day before the election , there was a meeting at the Delavan House . There were present , with others , Mr. James Fisk , Jr. , Mr. Thomas G. Shearman , and Mr. David Dudley Field . The whole plan of operations for the election was there discussed and arranged . The enjoining of the inspectors was mentioned . The injunction was already there , with the printed copies ready for service . It was then also mentioned that the officers were to be arrested . The order of arrest was then on its way to Albany , and . had on that day been obtained in New York on papers drawn days before in the office of Messrs . Field and Shearman . It was , on this evening , too , arranged that a meeting was to be organized at a quarter before twelve , twelve being the hour regularly appointed . " It was part of the programme , " says Mr. Shearman . It was also mentioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The first set of resolutions , reciting that the inspectors " have been enjoined , " were drawn long before the injunction was served , and copied by Mr. Samuel North , who it was arranged should offer them ; and that there might be no mistake , this first set of resolutions was indorsed immediate , " signifying that they were to be offered " immediately " after the meeting was organized . The draft of these resolutions IMr . North swears he received from the hands of Mr. David Dudley Field . The resolutions to the effect that the meeting proceed with the election were drawn hours before the meeting was organized , and copied by the same Mr. North , and he received them at the same place and at the same time . It was arranged who should be nominated for new inspectors at the early meeting . Mr. Hamilton Harris was one of these proposed inspectors . And he testifies that he was asked to be such candidate , " beforehand , " by Mr. David Dudley Field . This elaborate mechanism , this " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspectors , this arresting of officers and counsel , this filling the room where the meeting was to be held with " rough , rude , and dangerous persons , " this device of // what the court calls a " sham " meeting before the hour , this preparation of resolutions , this selection of officers , - in whose brain was it begotten , that of client or counsel ? And in the brain of which counsel ? And the manner in which this cunningly devised plan was carried out deserves admiration . These " persons " left New York together the day before , and reached Albany in the morning ; they breakfasted together , received their proxies together ; they were kept together until about half past eleven o'clock , when they marched together to the Susquehanna offices , and together followed Mr. Fisk and Mr. David Dudley Field to the directors ' room , which they filled . They voted together at that so-called stockholders ' meeting , under Mr. Field 's eyes ; they voted together in the treasurer 's room for directors , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They had been brought from New York that they might so vote , as Mr. Field very well knew . And as to the arrest suit , the facts are peculiar . Mr. Dudley Field , the son , testified as follows , when examined as to the authority of his firm to bring this action : - " I have in my possession a resolution of the executive committee of this company requesting our firm to bring this action . I do n't know of anything else except a letter received from Mr. Hamilton Harris , which accompanied this resolution , which referred to the bringing of the suit , the contents of which I do not further recollect . " Question . Was the receiving this resolution and letter of Mr. Harris the first information you had of the bringing of the suit ? " Answer . No ; I had discussed it repeatedly with my father , who is my senior partner , for days before that time , and the bringing the suit was only delayed until we received a formal authorization from the company . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's letter , or that portion relating to this suit , and the resolution ? " A. I will give you a copy of that portion ; it is dated September 3 , 1869 , and is addressed to Field and Shearman , and commences with the following words : Gentlemen , - Enclosed I send you the resolution of the executive committee of the Albany &amp; Susquehanna Railroad Company , directing proceedings to be instituted for the recovery of the books of the company . ' I think that is the - letter referred to , but if not , the letter is not in my possession . I will annex to my affidavit a copy of the resolution referred to . " // The portion of the resolution referred to reads - " Resolved , That Field and Shearman be employed to take all legal means for the recovery and restoration of the said books , and for the arrest and punishment of the persons abstracting them . " Mr. Hamilton Harris , who is thus stated to have sent this resolution to Messrs . Field and Shearman , authorizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as follows : " Question . When did you first know of the order of arrest which was issued against Joseph H. Ramsey , * William L. M. Phelps , Robert H. Pruyn , and Henry Smith , or either of them ? " Answer . Soon after the poll was closed I heard that Mr. Ramsey and Mr. Smith had been arrested under some process , which I afterwards learned from Mr. Smith himself was an order of arrest . That is all I know about it . " Q. Was that the first knowledge or information you had of such an order , or that such an one was to be applied for ? " A. It was . " The defendants against whom this order of arrest was obtained were all well-known citizens of Albany , who had lived there for years . Mr. Henry Smith is one of the first advocates in the State of New York , and one of the leaders of the Albany bar . These defendants were the president , secretary , receiver , and the counsel of a railroad company , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the 7th September , and these four defendants were the head and front of the opposition to the election of the Church or Fisk board , for whom Messrs . Field and Shearman had been counsel through this whole contest . The papers on which this order was obtained were completely ready in Messrs . Field and Shearman 's office before the 2d September . Mr. David Dudley Field had already " discussed it repeatedly " with his son and partner . Messrs . Field and Shearman " delayed " the bringing the suit until the resolution of the 3d . Messrs . Field and Shearman " delayed " obtaining the order of arrest until the 6th . Some one or other " delayed " arresting these gentlemen until after the coveted books had actually been returned to the company 's office , and until precisely twelve o'clock on the 7th of September , when the loss of one single minute.might ruin the labors of a lifetime . Mr. Henry Smith , in his closing argument in the case // already mentioned , said , speaking of Mr. Ramsey 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sheriff , and held there as a prisoner , just as this election was to be proceeded with , and at the same time saw t*avid Dudley Field coming in and standing in the doorway , with his fingers in his vest , tauntingly laughing and sneering at him . " Mr. David Dudley Field , in his closing argument in this same case , speaking of the same arrest , says : " It is clear that nobody in the Church party had anything to do with that arrest at that particular time. ** This arrest suit was afterwards dismissed by the court , after hearing Mr. David Dudley Field in opposition thereto , and after reading his partner 's affidavit , on the ground that it had been brought without any authority . And this is , according to Mr. David Dudley Field , practice of the law . Is there not danger lest , if such practice obtain , the delicate courtesies and gentle sentiments of the profession be lost ? Mr. David Dudley Field has seen the palmy days of the New York bar . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traditions of a past age , are to him the fresh memories of a present life . Mr. Field is a legacy to the present generation at the bar from the golden age when , as we are told , counsel showed one another the knightly courtesy of a Bayard . He was taught in the days of Chancellor Kent . He is one of the most eloquent apostles of legal reform . He is , even now , urging an amendment to the New York code , providing that no receiverships shall be granted on the cx parte order of a judge . To him , probably more than to any other one man , the people of New York are indebted for the code of procedure . To him , of course , one of the oldest , ablest , and most cultivated members of the bar , the younger men are to look for an example of professional conduct . And they are to look for this example , doubtless , in Mr. Field 's management of these Fisk litigations . For it is of them that Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could not with honor retire from these suits has kept me in them . Being in them , I shall do my whole duty to my clients . " And this " whole duty to the clients " consists , we are to infer , in the devising and carrying out a transaction like the following . // Mr. James Fisk and his associates , all of them , in this matter , clients of Mr. David Dudley Field , acting under his advice , endeavor to get control of a railroad and elect its board of directors . As the court has decided , they o ' *vn not more than a fifth of its stock . This is their procedure . They suspend the president , who is opposed to them , by an order of Mr. Justice Barnard , granted , as they themselves show , without a hearing , on not one word of evidence . They tie their opponents hand and foot with injunctions restraining any application for relief , " except to this court in this action , " " this court " being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting with " rough " men from New York , Mr. David Dudley Field himself being at their head , to hinder the stockholders of the company from meeting in their own office to protect their own property . To bar the possibility of these stockholders meeting anywhere else , Messrs . Field and Shearman , at the very moment of the election , when an hour 's delay costs millions of property , have the sheriff arrest the officers and counsel of this company , in a suit commenced , without authority , under the advice and direction of Mr. David Dudley Field ; and the arrest is made under his eyes to his complete satisfaction . They pretend to elect a board of directors by votes cast on stolen stock , in defiance of an injunction of the Supreme Court . And , after all , they commit the unpardonable sin of failure . All this is done in pursuance of a cunningly devised plan . The court call it a " fraudulent conspiracy . " Mr. Shearman calls it a " programme . " Mr. Fisk calls it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are no accessories . All are principals . This particular " conspiracy " did not spring , Minervalike , from the brain of Mr. James Fisk . Mr. David Dudley Field , for one , helped devise it . Mr. David Dudley Field , for one , did execute it . Other lights of the bar , doubtless , had their share in it . Do they wish to claim it ? And this is , it is to be presumed , the " whole duty to clients . " These are , it is to be presumed , the proceedings in which Mr. David Dudley Field is kept by " nothing but a profound conviction that he can not with honor retire ' * from them . This is , it is to be presumed , Mr. Field 's lesson to us from the days of Chancellor Kent . // And is the order of arrest henceforth to be one page of the advocate 's brief ? It may be said , perhaps , that , after all , this decision of Mr. Justic* Smith is merely the decision of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , may be reversed on appeal ; that it is , as yet , too early to judge Mr. ' Field . The matters here stated in relation to Mr. Field do not in the least degree depend on the correctness or incorrectness of the decision of Mr. Justice Smith . To be sure , the language of that decision has been here sometimes borrowed , but merely for the purpose of showing that very respectable authority has already given a name to some of these proceedings taken on the part of Mr. Field 's office . But the point of that decision is , Which board of directors was or was not legally elected ? With that point we have here nothing whatever to do . It has been attempted here to make clear the character of some of those legal proceedings , by statements which are true , and which remain true whether Mr. Justice Smith 's decision be reversed or not . And as to the direct share of Mr. David Dudley Field in these proceedings , no word of comment is here given , nor do any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any degree upon the decision of Mr. Justice Smith . These statements are made solely on the sworn testimony of Mr. Field 's clients and his associate counsel . Mr. Field , assuredly , will not question the veracity of these witnesses . Nor has Mr. Field been unheard in these matters . If guilty of anything , he is guilty of the same charges on which judgment has already gone against his clients in the case already mentioned . In that case Mr. Field and his associate counsel , with consummate ability , produced their witnesses , and argued the law and the facts before an able and impartial judge . He did his utmost there to clear his clients and failed . The issues and evidence here are precisely the same as in that case . No one can ask of Mr. Field a higher standard of professional conduct than he himself lays down in this correspondence with Mr. Bowles . He says , " The lawyer is responsible , not for his clients , nor for their causes , but for the manner in which he conducts their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theory of Brougham , that the lawyer should know nobody but his client . // I insist that he should defend his client per fas and not per nefas . By this rule I am willing to be judged . " And Mr. Field says : " I have never been consulted beforehand . . . . about any transaction whatever of this company or these gentlemen , to which , so far as I now recollect , any exception has been taken . " Does Mr. Field " recollect " this ' Susquehanna litigation ? And Mr. Bowles admits that Mr. Field " believes himself right " ; that Mr. Field has " sinned against no statute , " and has not " violated any prescript of the code professional . " In the New York Revised Statutes , Vol . II . p. 691 , are certain definitions and certain penalties of certain conspiracies . A portion of the statute reads as follows : " If two or more persons conspire . . . . falsely and maliciously to indict another for any offence , or to procure another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or falsely to move or maintain any suit , or for the perversion or obstruction of justice , or the due administration of the laws , they shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor . " Whether or not any of the matters here related fall within the definitions here cited , or either of them , need not here be discussed . Mr. Warren , in his work on Law Studies , Vol . I. p. 423 , after relating a case of professional misconduct on the part of a member of the English bar , adds : " This case has been presented to the reader because of the singularity of its circumstances . It appears to be the only instance recorded in the books of misconduct by a member of the bar , judicially cognizable , and punished , because of his being such .
