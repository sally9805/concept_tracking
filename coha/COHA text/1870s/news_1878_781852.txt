txt The social ventriloquist is by far the most dangerous and devastating of all social pests . The man who plays the cornet or the accordeon , or even the unspeakable wretch who performs on the banjo. can be detected and shunned . He carries his instrument of torture with him , and , like the rattle of the rattlesnake , it gives timely warning of his presence . But the social ventriloquist resembles the silent and stealthy copperhead . You may sit close beside him for an hour without the idightest apprehension of . danger , and al ; the end of that time he may rear his . awful crest and disclose his true character . No place is safe from his inroads . While he particularly affects evening parties , whether of a tea , dinner , or dancing character , he has been known to penetrate into prayermeetings , and to hold a conversation with a hypothetical and hardened : : inner concealed in the chimney . An irreproachable theological student was on one occasion undergoing marriage with a young lady in a crowded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stolen into the building , made him apparently i  --  eply to the question whether he would love , cherish , and protect his bride , " If I do n't gel darn me . " Whereupon the ceremony was indignantly cut short by the officiating clergyman , who left the bewildered pair only partially married , and refused to listen to any explanation . We all know by sad experience the gloom which falls upon an unprotected assembly when the social ventriloquist leaves his chair , and , proceeding to the side-board , knocks thereon and asks loudly , " Are you there , Uncle Peter ? " There is no escape from the wretch . For the next half hour he will take to himself seven or more imaginary idiots more idiotic than himself , and converse with them in tones that would loosen the back teeth and palsy the hind legs of an army mule . " Uncle Peter " in the sideboard will be followed by " John " in the chimney , by " Mrs. O'Flanagan " in the cellar , by " Little Jimmy " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the garret . Then will come the conversation with the policeman in the garden , whom the social ventriloquist will address through the open window , and who , with a maddening disregard cs ! probability , will be made - to arrest two noisy Irish burglars . After the final negro in the book-case has ended his complaints that he is stifling and his protests against being poked with the ventriloquist 's cane , a series of objectionable boasts and insects are brought out . There is the pretended fly that buzzes on the window , the imaginary mosquito that bites  --  also only in imag , - iration  --  the ventriloquist 's nose , the libelous dog , that disgraces his kind by barking outside of the window as no decent dog ever barked , and the preposterous and impossible cat , who mewstrom her alleged confinement in the coal-scuttle . All this time the unhappy audience sits and suffers .

Unfortunately , it is only in imagination that justice thus overtakes the ventriloquist . A stupid and heartless law protects him from summary vengeance , and there is little doubt that rero a man to shoot a ventriloquist , even in the very act , he would be indicted and subjected to a good deal of annoyance before securing a formal acquittal . No one can read without feeling stronger , purer , and better , the story of the social ventriloquist of a California town upon whom unexpected retribution recently fell . This monster had a pectliarly atrocious way of varying the order of his programme , so that " Uncle Peter " would sometimes howl from the distant garret , or " Mrs. O'Flanagan " would express her views on Chinamen. from the recesses of the uiano . This added an element of uncertainty to the performance which intensified horror . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a teaparty , having duly exploited " Uncle Peter " and most of his dramatis persona , announced that he would now . see about that burglar in the closet , and , stepping up to the closet door , propounded , the familiar question , " What are you doing in there ? Come out of that this minute . " According to all precedent , a squeaking voice ought to have replied , begging for mercy and assigning some ridiculous excuse for its presumed owner 's presence on the premises . Instead of the regulation reply , the door of the closet flew suddenly open , a stalwart thief sprang forth , knocked down the ventriloquist  --  whose head struck the table-leg with a delicious crash  --  and rushed for the door . Tho local Methodist minister , who was present , and who was exceptionally " spry with his weepons , " instantly " pulled " on the burglar and " got the drop on him . " These wellIknown theological terms scarcely need any explanation , and nearly every one will comprehend that the burglar acted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not a man present dreamed of delivering the prisoner to the Police . On the contrary , a subscription was instantly taken up for him , and . he was presented with $35 70 . Even women hastened to shake its hand in gratitude , and the Methodist minister kindly withdrew for a few moments to the kitchen , while a bottle of champagne was opened for the astonished ' felon . He lepauted loaded with benefits , and it was lot until two hours afterward that a ' doctor was reluctantly sent for to proscribe for the Still insensible ventriloquist . Of course , there are people who will believe that this burglar was hired to conceal Himself in the closet , and to bring the ventriloquist 's performance to a happy close . Phis , however , is irreconcilable with . the let that no one knew certainly that the ventriloquist would pretend that there wits a burglar or any one else in the closet . The affair was a beautiful illustration of poetic ustice . Materialists and skeptics may say Ina the presence of the burglar was due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scout so narrow and chilling an interpretation of a great and glorious event .
