txt For several Summers we have been looking for the approach of cholera from Europe . On one or two occasions , ships infected with the disease have reached this port , but the strict enforcement of quarantine rules has prevented the introduction of the epidemic Undue reliance has thus oven Naomi upon the emcacy of quarantine , and we have delayed to make proper preparations against a visitor against whom we have fancied that we could at any time shut the door . But now comes a rumor that the cholera has appeared in New-Orleans , and that it is making its way up the Mississippi . Very probably this rumor is untrue , and if it is not , there is no reason why it should create a cholera panic among us . It should , however , remind us that while quarantine regulations may prevent the introduction of cholera directly from Europe , these regulations can not prevent it from reaching us from the Mississippi . To bar the door of Sandy Hook is of little use , while the gates are left open through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ railway routes from the South and West . Now , in view of the possibility of the introduction of the epidemic by the ways just pointed out , we should not lose a day in preparing to meet it . The condition of the streets and of the more crowded localities of the City is admirably adapted to invite the pestilence . The streets must be cleaned at once , and kept clean . The tenement house and the cellars of the Sixth and Fourth Wards must be disinfected , so far as it is possible to do so . Will the Board of Health look to the matter without delay I The people of this City have borne much at the hands of unprincipled and ignorant oilicials . If , however , they are smitten by the cholera because of the neglect of duty on the part of those who are paid to keep the City clean and healthy . there will be a fearful reckoning for unfaithful officers .
