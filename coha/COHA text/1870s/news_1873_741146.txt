txt Two correspondents have written to us with reference to our late discussions of life assurance , the one sustaining our positions from the point of view of " one who pays , " and- the other criticising them from evidently that of a life assurance agent . Dealing with the latter first , we have only to say that wo have no quarrel to make with the class he seems to represent , and which ho certainly befriends . We can not , however , agree with him in the view that the agent , with his large commission , charged of course against the insured , and not against the life assurance company , is a necessary evil  --  or good , as he might put it . His employment is a makeshift , and is rather a witness to the weakness of the system , as at Present practiced , than of its strength . If a mutual life assurance coulsany was a selfish , money-making ** the existence and imporlemity of the soliciting agent might be pardoned . But it is not . Such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a combination of persons for their common benefit , and it is supposed that their agents , the officers whom they employ , will conduct its business solely for their , the insured 's , benefit , and not for their own . Yet our correspondent seems unable to deny the tact as alleged . by us that life assurance officers do , in some way or other , get very rich in the ? course of few years , and that , too , when their nominal salaries , as compared with their observed expenses , are relatively small . For ourselves , we do not believe that life assurance agents are either a necessary good or a necessary evil . They may be of service to the company in the start , and be then indispensable to it , but once established , the society , like society in general , may well part with them . Moreover , our complaint was and still is that the whole scheme of compelling the insured , whether he wishes it or no , to pay a large yearly commission to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leading company in , the United States announced its intention to reduce its rate of premiums . Its actuary , an eminent mathematician , outside of the atmosphere and influences which surround those who are broughtup in the life assurance interest , declared that the society could safely , by reason of its great strength , large experi- ence , and extensive average , with entire justice to them , offer this advantage to its policy-holders . What wasithe result T The whole army , of agents and office-holders of rival compauies was immediately aroused and engaged in a struggle which , unfortunately for the public , proved successful to defeat the reduction . Their tone and manner of conducting the opposition certainly impressed us as those of men who looked on life assurance as a money-making business for the people " inside , " and not an institution for the common good , No mm can deny that if this company had dismissed its agents and retained its business , it could easily have made the reduction in premiums , and . rt very likely was the fear that that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the terror inspired in rival companies whose business . conducted at higher ratos , was in peril , that stirred up the opposition of the " life assurance interest " - that is , of the agents and officers of life companies . We are aware that a mutual life assurance company is not a oharitable  --  institutiou ? as , : by the way , many an agent like our =corm- .. epondent , who talks about , his class confersang " a benefit on society ; " indirectly claims '  --  but neither is it an institution for the support of agents and officers . It steeds on a , base with say . trust companies and . . satings banks , and is removed in theory from the ordinary selfish and business undertaking , wherein a few principals engage for individual profit at the expense of others , and in return for services rendered . We fail to agree with our correspondent in thinking that , any more than one 's tailor or shoemaker , he " confers a benefit on society " when ho solicits and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compels the assured to pay him is an ample reward for his trouble , and about it , and not any " benefit to society , " is he thinking while he pursues his importunity . Perhaps the agent may be an honest and industrious Person , but be can not exact our sympathy or inspire our admiration as a missionary working in his neighbors ' behalf . The point made by our other correspondent , in favor of holding life assurance officers to a strict accountability , is a good one . One does not need . to be very much of a cynic to say that people are apt to use more liberality with other people 's money than with their own . Apropos of which one has only to walk down town , in the neighborhood of Wall-street , where tin the one hand ho may - see great private bankinghouses conducting their business in plain and substantial buildings , and on the other ; large assurance companies reveling in magnificent structures , furnished by MARCOTTE . What the policy-holders in these mutual companies have a right to demand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What are the salaries of their officers ? Do they , in addition to salary . receive commissions ? If so , what is their total income from their companies ? What do the agents each receive ? To questions like these the policy-holders , who pay the money that supports the institution , should certainly have definite answers . At present they do not get them .
