txt It was well said by Mr. MILL , in his pain-fully-interesting autobiography , that there are in human history " organic periods ; " when beliefs and creeds are in process of forniation , and therefore convictions are earnest ; and , on the other band , " critical periods , " when all the results of human thought and speculation are submittedIo. analysis , and few opinions cre held profoundly or with enthusiasm . It need not be said that he conceives the present century to be pre-eminently a " critical period . " In his view , it is only a phase of thought , and must disappear , to give place to some newer and higher organic period , when a new faith or new mode of belief shall animate and inspire man as did the old beliefs . If this conception be true , we can only say that it is a peculiarly unfortunate period for one important class in the community , on whom all the future depends  --  the children . Mr. Mauls own childhood , though passed under moral circumstances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what childhood will be under the future positive millennium , when COMTE 'S L'Humani1J or STRAUSS ' Univeram shall be worshiped , by a race of philanthropic philosophers and philosophic radicals  --  a Childhood without a ray of the ideal upon it , without sympathy or ex-pressed affection , never beautified by reverence or going out in unselfish devotion , clear , logical , intellectual , devoting all its faculties to its own " highest happiness ; " a. " utilitarian " youth , ending in a melancholy and unsatisfied manhood . If this be the best childhood and youth - which the purest positive philosophy , under the most favorable conditions , can offer us , Heaven help the great masses of mankind who have not the capacity of being in= fluenced by ' an " ideal Perfect Being " which Mr. Mu.a had , or the refuge he possessed in philosophy , or the self-control he obtained in intellectual pursuits , or the hopes he cherished for an imaginary future of mankind , or the consolation he found in metaphysics and science . Even with all his great advantages , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ verge of insanity and suicide . . But that a wotld will that be in the positive era , when all children shall grow up living alone for their own " highest happiness , " without reverence , - without motive for heroic self-sacrifice , without God , or hope of intmortality ! It . will indeed then seem a world such as Mr. Mine 's father conceived it , one which it is " difficult to believe created by a benevolent Being . " Already families brought up under the pure positive conceptions snow the ominous signs of - this coming period . The character is not ennobled by high ideals ; self-restraint is not continually taught ; the most beautiful quality of childhood , its reverence , is left uncultivated- There is no litine- for distant and unselfish ends ; and the control which religion gives over appetites and passions is never implanted . The natures thus produced . are hard , cold , critical , fault-finding , and selfish . Then , worst of all , the darkness of a hopeless future is thrown over the sunny days of childhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is blotted out . Death is an impenetrable shadow . The departure of childish friends and companions is a total and inconsolable loss , and life soon becomes , as it did to the MILLS under similar skepticism , a thing hardly worth possessing , and full of dark mysteries and unanswerable problems . Maturity is entered upon by such children in " a shadow of thick darkness . " This life of Mr. MILL Is a sad instance of sneh parental influence . The elder Mina , growing up under an extreme form of Calvinism in Scotland , which revolted his intellect , came at length into utter skepticism , not merely of future life , or of Christianity , but of the existence of God himself . The younger MILL grew up as the child of a Greek philosopher might have done . Indeed , his education was much more of entire hopelessness and no-belief than that of : SOCR &TES; or of CICERO . And remarkable as STUA.RT Mint 's candor and power , of seeing the truth in opposite views are , he never recovered from this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could look at Christianity as he did at Platonism or Stoicism . He saw the wonderful morality of SOCRATES ; he admired the ideal benevolence of PLATO and the purity of MARCUS Aearcatterus , but he never could appreciate the purity , or the morality , or the benevolence of the Christian system . He had not one hundredth part of the hope for a future life which SocaevrEs felt , or the sense of Divinity of EPICTETT:S . The prejudiced skepticism ofthe father blinded the eyes of the son , and threw a shadow over his life which terminated only in death . The responsibility of every father who rejects the great hope of all ages for the darkness east over the whole life of a child by his teachings , is something that no thoughtful man , of whatever belief , can contemplate without a shudder . In this world sorrow falls soon enough on the young  --  it is at least the duty of parents to teach them how sorrow may be borne with patience and hope , and to early lead them to understand that there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
