ART . II . - THE PLATFORM OF THE NEW PARTY . " A FREQUENT recurrence to the fundamental principles of the Constitution . . . . is absolutely necessary to preserve the advantages of liberty and to maintain a free government . The people ought , consequently , to have a particular attention to all those principles in the choice of their officers and representatives ; and they have a right to require of their lawgivers and magistrates an exact and constant observance of them , in // the formation and execution of the laws necessary for the good administration of the Common wealth . " This precept of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights has been forgotten amid the tumult of civil commotion , until now , unless the country return to a study of those principles which lie at the foundation of government , the dangers against which these words are a warning are at hand .

Attention is at once fixed upon the fact that only when society seemed on the verge of dissolution the people as a last resort were driven to contemplate some sacrifice of local mdcpendence , // and to call the convention which framed the Constitution . Even then resistance was not overcome ; the struggle over adoption was violent in the extreme , and iii the Virginia convention , on which all was supposed to depend , the vote was only carried by a majority of ten . Under these circumstances different interpretations of the Constitution were inevitable : one section of thinkers wished to give it a liberal construction , and to augment the central power ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be from the principles of the old confederacy . General Washington 's first Cabinet - perhaps the most remarkable ever formed - was an effort to unite all divisions of opinion . Mr. Jefferson was Secretary of State , Mr. Hamilton Secretary of the Treasury , and Mr. Randolph Attorney-General . Harmony was impossible among such antagonistic elements : even the authority of the President failed to preserve peace , and the furious dissensions which broke out between Hamilton and Jefferson ended in the retirement of both ministers at the close of the first term . So opened the one great controversy in American politics ,  - -  the relation which the general government should bear to the governments of the several States ; in other words , the question of centralization . Under constantly shifting popular issues this stern problem is always found embedded , and sooner or later the struggle has invariably narrowed itself to this point . It was so . in 1801 , in 1812 , in 1828 over internal improvements , in 1832 over nullification , in 1860 over secession ; and it is so now . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century , foreign relations were the exciting cause . War raged over Europe , and General Washington adopted his policy of neutrality . So long as he remained in office , the respect inspired by his name held parties within some bounds ; but on the inauguration of his successor the floodgates were opened . Mr. Adams wished to follow the course already marked out , but he found it no easy task . Mr. Jefferson and the Republicans were in furious opposition ; they were in sympatby with the French Revolution , while the North was hostile to it and looked on its progress with alarm . In the midst of this excitement the X Y Z papers were sent to Congress , and // their publication was followed by a burst of indignation . War seemed inevitable . In this crisis the Alien and Sedition Acts were passed , and in an instant the South was in a blaze . The legislatures of Virginia and Kentucky led the attack on the administration by passing the famous resolutions of 98 . The third Virginia resolve is as follows : - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it views the powers of the federal government , as resulting from the compact to which the States are parties , as limited by the plain sense and intention of the instrument constituting that compact , as no further valid than they are authorized by the grants enumerated in that compact ; and that in case of a deliberate , palpable , and dangerous exercise of other powers , not granted by the said compact , the States , who are parties thereto , have the right and are in duty bound to interpose , for arresting the progress of the evil , and for maintaining within their respective limits the authorities , rights , and liberties appertaining to them . " The Kentucky resolutions were even stronger . Thus , within ten years after the government went into operation , was that great dispute begun which only terminated sixty years later in the war of the rebellion . Was this government a league , a compact between the States ; or was it national , based on the consent of the people , and deriving its power directly from them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deductions drawn from it were logically just . If the States had only entered into a compact with one another , and still remained to all purposes sovereign republics , then they were equals with each other and with the general government . As such , each one could be the only judge of what constituted an infringement of its sovereignty . Therefore , to allow Congress to pass laws , and to concede to the Supreme Court the final right of judging of their constitutionality , would have been monstrous , for it would have made the central power the judge of its own acts , and would have placed it at once in the position of a superior ruling inferiors . Admitting , however , that a State , as well as the Supreme Court , had a right to pass upon statutes , it necessarily followed that in case of an adverse decision the dissenting government was in duty bound to interfere and pre // serve its citizeiis from oppression under the execution of an unjust law . Clearly , the establishment of such a doctrine would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ v. Virginia , Chief Justice Marshall said : " America has chosen to be , in many respects , and to many purposes , a nation ; and for all these purposes her government is complete ; to all these objects it is competent . The people have declared , that in the exercise of all powers given for these o1z*jects , it is supreme . It can , then , in effecting these objects , legitimately control all individuals or governments within the American territory These States are constituent parts of the United States . They are members of one great empire , - for some purposes sovereign , for some purposes subordinate . In a government so constituted , is it unreasonable that the judicial power should be competent to give efficacy to the constitutional laws of the legislature ? We think it is not Thirteen independent courts , ' says a very celebrated statesman ( and we have now more than twenty such courts ) , ' of final jurisdiction over the same causes , arising upon the same laws , is a hydra in government , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This case was not decided until 1821 ; but the principle there laid down is that which moderate Federalists have always maintained . Had that party in 1801 been true to itself , had it been able to unite its whole strength on an effort to establish a great fundamental truth , it would probably have carried the election , and the history of the country might have been changed ; but it was capable of no such effort ; it was torn by internal dissensions , and Mr. Adams was defeated . Among American statesmen Mr. Jefferson stands foremost as the champion of decentralization . He has always , in spite of his denials , been credited with the authorship of the Kentucky resolutions . He comprehended more fully , perhaps , than any man of that period the tremendous importance of the question . For years he had been developing his principles . He had finally , at his own time and in his own words , made a bold appeal to the people , and they had sustained him . Clearly , he was pledged to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undoing of the federal fabric of government . And ye* he never even attempted it . On the contrary , his administration seemed every whit as capable of straining authority as its predecessors , and he did in fact so use his power as to stir up something very like rebellion . He is the best illustration of the general law . From the moment when he first faced the responsibilities of office , he seems to have abandoned his dream , and to have resigned himself to the inevitable . He felt there was but one path open . And so has it ever been ; no President , despite his principles in opposition , has been able to resist the pressure which the current of events has always brought upon him . Throughout Mr. Jefferson 's term of service a foreign war was imminent , and , beyond an abortive attempt by Mr. Giles to undermine the judiciary , no retrograde step was taken . The most memorable measure of this administration was the embargo . That measure precipitated Massachusetts , the old Federal stronghold , into a movement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headed at the South , in his protest against the sedition law . But the story of the Hartford Convention , and of the opinion given by the judges on the power of calling out the militia ( 5 Mass. , 545 ) , is too familiar to be retold . The whole proceeding would have graced the bench and the people of South Carolina . Peace came in 1815 , and with it the end of these troubles ; and thus the practical result of fourteen years of republican rule had been to confirm the work which the Federalists had begun . With the close of war the era of good feeling opened , which lasted without interruption , save for personal quarrels among public men , until 1828 . The admission of Missouri at one moment seemed likely to precipitate the slavery qu*stion , but the compromise was peacefully arranged , and the struggle for a time postponed . Mr. Madison and Mr. Monroe , though perhaps in theory disagreeing with the Chief Justicc , were practically in perfect accord with him , and on the whole this may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constitutional goveminent in America . Not that the old Virginia doctrines were forgotten . On the contrary , they gave signs of life in the Missouri discussion , while the case of Martin v. Hunter 's Lessee , argued in 1816 , was a fiat deiiial of the appellate jurisdiction // of the Supreme Court by the Virginia Court of Appeals . Mr. Justice Roane , too , of that bench , attacked the decisions of Marshall with fury in the newspapers , and Mr. Jefferson again and again commended Roane in his letters , and spoke in strong terms of the usurpations of the judiciary . Nevertheless , all went smoothly until the controversy on the right of government to lay duties for protection was opened by the adoption of the tariff of 1828 . This led to the nullification movement , made so famous by the genius of Webster and Calhoun . Mr. Webster , in his reply to Hayne , thus sums up the position taken by Calhoun and his followers - " I understand the honorable gentleman from South Carolina to maintain , that it is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their judgment , this government transcends its constitutional limits , and to arrest the progress of its laws . " I understand him to maintain this right as a right existing UNDER the Constitution , not as a right to overthrow it , on the ground of extreme necessity , such as would justify violent revolution . " I understand him to maintain an authority , on the part of the States , thus to interfere , for the purpose of correcting the exercise of power by the general government , of checking it , and of compelling it to conform to their opinion of the extent of its powers . " I understand him to maintain , that the ultimate power of judging of the constitutional extent of its own authority is not lodged exclusively in the general government , or any branch of it ; but that , on the contrary , the States may lawfully decide for themselves , and each State for itself , whether , in a given case , the act of the general government transcends its power . " I understand him to insist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the opinion of any State government , require it , such State government may , by its own sovereign authority , annul an act of the general government which it deems plainly and palpably unconstitutional . " Little can be said here of the debates which were held on this question , though they are among the most remarkable of this or any other nation . But to Calhoun in particular there is now scant justice paid . It was easy for Webster to trample on the weakness of Hayne ; but it is impossible to read the works of Calhoun and not to feel that only too many of his forebodings have come true . As a reasoner , he was not inferior // to his adversary ; and the compass of his mind , the force of his logic , and the power of his argument stamp him as one of the most extraordinary men who ever spoke in the Senate of the United States . No extract from his works can do him justice ; they must be studied as a whole . He boldly followed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only yielded to overwhelming force . General Jackson was President . He , like Jefferson , had been avowedly elected on the constitutional issue of centralization , as presented by the question of internal improvements . He too , like Jefferson , had broken down an administration which was thought to favor that dangerous policy ; and yet he was the man who , of all others , dealt the heaviest and most decisive blow at the party which carried what should have been his own principles to their legitimate conclusion . His prompt action strangled the incipient rebellion in South Carolina . But already it was clear that nothing was needed to bring about a violent collision save a moving cause of sufficient power to stir the passions of these antagoiiistic forces . Such a cause was found in slavery . This is not the place for entering into the history of that terrible struggle . All its issues save one - the great and final constitutional issue of the right to secede - lie beyond the present discussion . That right was asserted , and was debated on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national armies put this long controversy of sixty years at rest forever . The Virginia doctrines are dead . The government has proved by force of arms that it has not the right alone , but also the power , to judge its own acts and to enforce its own decrees . That right will not again be lightly questioned . But although it would be out of place to dwell upon the antislavery movement , there is much in the years between 1833 and 1860 which can by no means be omitted ; for it was during this period that the seeds were sown from which has sprung the harvest the country is reaping now . General Jackson was the last of the strong Presidents . After the close of his administration the question of slavery began slowly to loom above the horizon . More urgently , day by day , one problem pressed on Southern leaders for solution . The Democratic party , which represented their interests , had to be // kept in power , and yet it represented a minority . Without Northern support , the South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sacrifice its principles to obtain this support . Thus nothing remained to them but a policy of corruption . John Adams , in commenting on the Constitution , wrote : " Corruption in almost all free governments has begun and been first introduced in the legislature . When any portion of executive power has been lodged in popular or aristocratical assemblies , it has seldom , if ever , failed to introduce intrigue . The executive powers lodged in the Senate are the most dangerous to the Constitution and to liberty of all the powers in it . " And so the result has proved . The Southern leaders deliberately adopted the policy of securing Northern votes by an appeal to local prejudice . They hit on the expedient of nominating for President some weak man from a free State , who , when elected , became a tool in the hands of his Cabinet or , still Worse , in the hands of Congressmen , who dictated a policy to the executive . Party organization now became more and more necessary . It had to be relied on in default @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office and the caucus were gradually introduced . The value of rotation is evident . By offering places in the civil service as a prize for efficient party workers , a body of men were trained by degrees in all the methods by which local elections could be controlled . Of all these methods the most efficient is the caucus . This institution was not unknown at a much earlier period , for Mr. Madison was nominated by a caucus of the members of Congress in 1809 ; but the popular caucus , as it now exists , was introduced by the Democrats . Soon it became throughout the North the only method of presenting candidates to the people . Of course , in theory , it is a meeting of the members of a party in the district where the election is to be held , to select some man on whom they can unite ; and in order to secure united action , the minority is considered pledged to abide by the choice of the majority . But the practical working of the caucus by no means corresponds to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of persons who seldom meet , who are mostly unknown to // one another , and who are , as a rule , profoundly ignorant of parliamentary procedure . Under such circumstances it is easy for a comparatively small number of trained men , who have laid a plan beforehand , to effect their object even when the meeting is full . But the meeting seldom is full . The ordinary citizen can not be induced to leave his home and his family , and pass long evenings in town-halls or ward-rooms , unless on very exceptional occasions ; and when the attendance is scanty , managers have their own way without a show of opposition . Office-holders , it is true , did not immediately begin to manipulate caucuses . The perfection to which the system is now brought has been a work of time ; but the foundation was laid when the doctrine of " spoils " was proclaimed . Yet politicians were not slow to strike the scent . Party nominations can be controlled by controlling primary meetings . These meetings can be manipulated with much certainty and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are willing to devote their lives to the calling ; and places under government offered much too tempting a pension-roll for such managers , to be long overlooked . More thorough machinery for breeding corruption can scarcely be imagined . Under party organization thus consolidated , a nomination means election , if the party is in the majority . Ordinarily no second candidate can compete with the regular nominee . Everything conspires to render a concentration of independent voters impossible . The strange fear of breaking from old ties , the printed ballot , the want of machinery for calling a caucus , without which long custom has made it almost impossible to move , all unite to exclude competitors , and to place voters in the dilemma of accepting " the ticket " or throwing away their votes . Granting , then , the caucus as it exists , together with the singular American loyalty to party , as materials on which to work , all that politicians needed to give them nearly absolute power was to wrest the prerogative of appointment from the President . How federal patronage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chapter in history . The original machinery provided by the Constitution for electing the President has been // supplanted by the caucus and convention system ; and at this day it hardly needs to be proved that the intrigues of conventions usually render the nomination of any man with a " record " impossible , or , in other words , throw out every man of large experience and tried ability . The weakness of Presidents chosen with a view to their pliability in the grasp of the power behind the throne , the exigency of party needs , and the confirming functions of the Senate , all have combined to change into an established right that which at first was accorded as an indulgence , and to support the legislature in its usurpation . Clearly , this tended directly toward consolidation . An engine was nearly perfected which would give the central government a great - perhaps even a predominating - influence in local politics . This was the danger feared by the opponents of the Constitution , though it arose in a different form from that which they apprehended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the very party which most dreaded its effects , - by the old Democratic States-rights party , the party of decentralization . Thus at the outbreak of the war , rotation in office and the caucus were established facts . The Republican organization was tainted with corruption from its very birth . The descendants of the old centralizing Federalists came into power armed with the terrible weapon of their opponents . Henceforward two evils were united . The centralization of the Federalists was grafted upon the corruption of the Democrats . During Mr. Lincoln 's administration one ill at least was remedied . No one could complain of executive weakness . Congress was restrained within bounds , and the balance of the government was restored . Could the work of reconstruction after the war have been left to those sagacious statesmen who were then in office , the country might never have fallen into its present disastrous condition ; but the murder of the President raised Mr. Johnson to power , whose influence was an unmixed evil . From the very outset he involved himself in personal collisions , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furious opposition . A more unhappy moment for entering on the delicate legislation which was to fix the // relations between Southern whites and freedmen , could not have been chosen . The result was a sweeping enfranchisement of the blacks , and a wholesale creation of the most ignorant mass of voters to be found in the civilIzed world . Congress , too , was on the watch , and with that selfish greed so characteristic of legislative assemblies , it seized on the popular excitement as a pretext for pushing into law the series of measures which finally left the executive helpless and at its mercy . IDown to this time , the great body of simple common-sense voters at the North had steadily supported the national government in its struggle to assert its powers . Hitherto it had required their every effort to prevent discontented States from carrying the Virginia doctrines into practice , or even from throwing off their allegiance altogether . They wanted the true federal government as expounded by Marshall : a central power limited strictly as to its purposes , but supreme within its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to regulate their own affairs . Federal dictation or federal interference had always been hateful , and now the idea began to dawn among them that the States were in danger of being overwhelmed . Nor was this fear without foundation . The influence of the national government had been vastly increased during the war . A great revenue had become necessary , and the number of civil offices had been proportionately augmented . This enormous patronage had fallen into the clutches of members of Congress , and it promised to be peculiarly effective in manipulating the colored vote of the South . Already adventurers used it on a large scale throughout the country , and their operations even then had begun to shape themselves into systematic assaults on the independence of States . A senator with patronage in his hands could pack the national offices in his State with his adherents ; this done , he could hope to control the caucuses which sent delegates to the convention which nominated the governor . He might take the nomination himself , or he might give it to a trusted friend ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Success at the election placed the State offices at his disposal ; and , what was of much more consequence , it gave him the management of elections , - the // decision in contested returns , the making up of returns and the counting of votes , the construction of votiiig-lists , besides the regulation of every detail at the polls . In 1868 the people began dimly to see these things . The desperate condition of the South alarmed them ; they distrusted politicians of all sorts ; and they turned to the one man in whom they placed perfect confidence , - to General Grant . Never since the inauguration of Washington has a President had a more splendid opportunity ; the whole nation was with him ; it would have snpported him in any attack he might have made on the usurpation of the Senate and the corruption among politicians , and lie must have won . But General Grant failed to comprehend the emergency . He made a stand for a time , in his own peculiar fashion , against members of Congress whom he disliked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ match for them upon their own ground ; he soon fell under their influence , and has since proved himself , among the many feeble men who have filled the office of President , the most passive instrument in furthering their schemes . Here is the turning-point in the history . All the evils which had hitherto been gathering and slowly drawing nearer , now started into terrible life . Before the war , however much office-holders might have secretly used their influence it was under a decent disguise ; they seldom openly interfered with caucuses or elections . Under Johnson , the executive and Congress had been too hostile to act in unison for a common end . But henceforward the two interests were united , - a popular President was in sympathy with a great majority in Congress , and both powers worked together toward consolidation . Federal interference was recognized as an avowed system . In North and South impartially , the dominant party used the government as its chief support . Custom , each day deeper rooted , developed an unwritten law stronger than any statute or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declared is , that the will of the majority shall be supreme , the Constitution to the contrary notwithstanding . A constitutional federal government means a series of checks imposed upon the will of the majority for the protection of the // minority . A consolidated government , in America , means that the will of the majority is absolute . The first proposition will hardly be disputed . The truth of the second is capable of demonstration . When , under the policy of the present administration , a State is , to use a cant term , " captured , " it ceases to be an independent organization , and becomes an appendage to the general government . This must be so , because its elections are controlled by national office-holders , and its governor is practically appointed at Washington . It is , in all respects save one , simply a province . Its courts alone remain , and the fate of the courts must now be considered . In the United States the courts are a semi-political institution . They are endowed with extraordinary power , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of deciding upon the constitutionality of legislative acts . So long , therefore , as they could be maintained in purity , the triumph of centralization , based as it is upon corrupt and unlawful principles , could never be complete . Hence it might be inferred that , at an early period , they would become a principal object of attack . And this inference is correct . That the judiciary can never be a real safe*uard is evident ; because , if elective , it is subject to the same influences which control all elections ; if appointed , the power to appoint lies with the men who have the most direct interest in the character of the bench . Thus , according to circumstances , the judiciary will vary with the creative power ; when that is corrupt , it will also be corrupt ; when pure , it will be pure . Moreover , it is possible for the legislature to reorganize the courts at its pleasure , so that by creating new judges the political departments of the government may always have that declared to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , has been done . In short , in many States , by any or all these means , the judiciary , whether elected or appointed , has been made the mere tool of party . The courts have been disgraced , and the name of justice has fallen into contempt , because , in order to secure unhesitating support , politicians have crowded the bench with judges who might be bought with money . When the legislative , the executive , and the judicial func // tions of States are thus grasped by a single hand , with the directing power seated , as it is , at Washington , consolidation is complete , and the government has ceased to be " a government of laws and not of men . " Had the Convention of 1787 followed the advice of Hamilton , consolidation , indeed , might have come , but it would have been of a very different kind . He advocated a strong central government , the President appointing the governors of the States , and the whole fabric supported by a standing army . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but , at least , it would have been the despotism of a legitimate government , sustained by open and acknowledged means , - one capable of making itself respected , and of being obeyed by a people who respected themselves . The fate to which the country seems drifting presents no such redeeming trait . The spectacle offered is that of an executive reduced to impotence by the legislature ; of certain members in the more powerful body of that legislature , responsible to no one for their action , forming a junto which controls the policy of the nation ; of the various members of that junto striving each to " capture " his own State by systematic corruption ; and , finally , of Congress stretching out its arm to drag down the Supreme Court , making its own will law . This is reducing government to its simplest form , though still preserving the cloak of ancient names . The usurpation of the legislature means the naked rule of numbers . Under some circumstances even such a result might be accepted , if not with complacency , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ majorities are manufactured by demagogues craftily manipulating the least intelligent portion of society . The facts on which these conclusions are based have occurred within a few years , and are still fresh in the memory of all . Indeed , many of the most startling developments date no further back than a few months . Yet , in order to place clearly in view the sequence of events , a short sketch of portions of General Grant 's administration will be useful , not only as illustrative of the past , but as significant of the future . The President , at the beginning of his career , apparently intended to place his reliance on men of common-sense , as he // understood it , and to discard the ordinary politician . With this purpose in his mind , he named Mr. Stewart for his Secretary of the Treasury ; but when his ineligibility was discovered , the President was left with no second candidate of his own choice . In this dilemma , he yielded to Congressional solicitation , and sent Mr. Boutwell 's name to the Senate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to dwell on the qualifications of that gentleman , as a financier , for the office , Mr. Boutwell had been bred in the school of local Democratic politics . The training received in such an atmosphere had produced its natural result , and the new Secretary regarded statesmanship as a mastery of the arts of manipulation . Instead of sustaining General Grant in the stand he had taken , he threw his whole influence into the opposite scale . His idea was to strengthen the party ; he neither understood nor desired reform ; and he lent the vast power of his department to men far worse than himself , whose designs he failed to fathom . Mr. Hoar was Attorney-General . The first great question that arose regarded the constitutionality of the Legal Tender Acts . As the events which followed struck at the independence of the Supreme Court , they must ever remain a matter of the deepest interest . In Hepburn v. Griswold " the majority of the court as then constituted , five judges out of eight , felt obliged to conclude that an act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ payment of debts previously contracted is not a means appropriate , plainly adapted , really calculated to carry into effect any express power vested in Congress , is inconsistent with the spirit of the Constitution , and is prohibited by the Constitution . " This decision was not declared from the bench until February 7 , 1870 , but it had been generally understood that it would be unfavorable for a considerable period before it was made public , and abstracts from it had appeared in the newspapers at least a week previously . In commenting on it Mr. Justice Field says : " That judgment was reached only after repeated arguments were heard from able and eminent counsel , and after every point raised on either side had been the subject of extended deliberation . The questions presented in that case were also involved in several other cases , and had been elaborately ar // gued in them . It is not extravagant to say that no case has ever been decided by this court since its organization , in which the questions presented were more maturely considered . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lightly disturbed . " The President , the Attorney-General , and the majority of Congress were , however , bitterly opposed to the principles of this decision , and how that judgment came to be overturned is thus detailed in a note to the Legal Tender Cases ( 8 Wallace , 528 ) : - " By act of March 3 , 1863 , the court was ordered to consist of ten members ; a new member being then added . By act of July 23 , 1866 , to fix the number of Judges of the Supreme Court of the United States , ' etc. , it was enacted that no vacancy in the office of Associate Justice shall be filled by appointment until the number of Associates shall be reduced to six , and thereafter the Supreme Court shall consist of a Chief Justice and six Associate Justices . ' By an act of 10th April , 1869 , to take effect from the first Monday of December , 1869 , it was enacted that the court should consist of a Chief-Justice and eight Associates , and that for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ additional Judge . ' Hepburn v. Griswold , it is stated in the opinion of the court in the case , was decided in conference November 27 , 1869 ( 8 Wallace , 626 ) , there being then eight Judges ( the Chief Justice and seven Associates ) on the bench , the lowest number to which the court had been reduced . One of them , Justice Grier , resigned February 1 , 1870 . The judgment in Hepburn v. Griswold was announced from the hench and entered February 7 , 1870 . Mr. Justice Strong was appointed Fehruary 18 , 1870 , and Mr. Justice Bradley , March 21 , 1870 ; and the order for the present argument was made by , and the argument itself heard before , the court of nine as constituted by act of 10th April , 1869 . " That argument was the argument made in the Legal Tender Cases . Judgment was rendered in the following December term , reversing the decision in Hepburn v. Griswold by a majority of one , both of the new judges voting for reversal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It should be remembered that this court , at the very term in which , and within a few weeks after , the decision in Hepburn v. Griswold was delivered , when the vacancies on the bench were filled , determined // to hear the question re-argued " on the motion of the AttorneyGeneral . No better example could be found of the impotence of the courts before a popular majority . It was the first time in American history that the constitution of the Supreme Court of the United States had been changed with the effect of influencing its decision on a vital question of constitutional law , but it is to be feared that it will not be the last . The precedent is one that is only too likely to be followed . This single act has done more to shake public confidence in the judiciary , and to engender a distrust in the stability of the law , than even the famous decision in the Fred Scott case . It is nothing to the purpose that all parties acted in the best faith , from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The stubborn fact remains that a solemn judgment of the highest national court , rendered only after exhaustive arguments and on the most mature consideration , was reversed within a few months by the votes of new judges raised to the bench within two or three weeks after the delivery of that judgment ; and a second decision made in unison with the loudly expressed desires of the predominant political party . A wrong decision by the Supreme Court on an important subject is doubtless a public misfortune ; but to attempt to rectify such a decision by fresh appointments to the bench is destruction to constitutional government . It furnishes a precedent for all following politicians to adopt the same means to accomplish their ends . It destroys the respect of the community for law , and it annihilates the confidence which the people repose in the wisdom , integrity , and power of that tribunal on which their liberty and their happiness so utterly depend . Enough has been said of this remarkable violation of judicial sanctity to make obvious the conclusion to be drawn therefrom . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which accorded with their views . The two combined must ever hold the courts at their mercy . When public opinion has reached the point of tolerating such proceedings , paper constitutions may well be consigned to oblivion before they fall into contempt . It would be better frankly to admit the law of numbers , to withdraw political power from the courts , and thus to preserve their dignity and integrity even at the // sacrifice of those exalted functions which the people fail to appreciate and to uphold . The system of federal interference with the independence of States is the next subject which requires notice . There is hardly a State in the Union on which an assault more or less violent has not been perpetrated , but two examples alone can be considered . They are those cases which have perhaps attracted the largest share of public attention , - the cases of Louisiana and of Massachusetts . A general election was held in Louisiana in November , 1872 , for governor , lieutenant-governor , members of the assembly , and other officers . W. P. Kellogg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposed by John McEnery . Returns of the election were made in pursuance of a State statute to a returning board composed of the Governor , Warmouth , the Lieutenant-Governor , Pinchback , the Secretary of State , ilerron , - members ex officio , - John Lynch , and T. C. Anderson . The returns were sent under seal to the Governor , to be opened in the presence of the board . On the meeting of the board it was decided that Pinchback and Anderson , who had been candidates at the election , were on that account disqualified to serve . The previous Secretary of State , Boyce , had been removed on a charge of corruption , and Herron had been appointed in his place . The legality of this removal was then before the courts . Warmouth , however , became distrustful of ilerron ( who was charged with designs of falsifying the returns in concert with Lynch ) , removed him , and made J. Wharton Secretary of State in his stead . The Governor and Wharton then proceeded to fill the vacancies occasioned by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ilerron , pretending to be the true board , elected members to complete their number . Thus there were two bodies existing at the same time , each assuming to be the true board . The Governor had exclusive possession of all documents and returns . In December the Supreme Court of the State decided that Herron was an intruder into office . Therefore it clearly appeared that he had no right to sit in either body , for his claim to sit depended on his being a member ex officio , as Secretary of State . // Kellogg , the Republican candidate , was undoubtedly defeated by a large majority . As soon as this result had become apparent , - but before a canvass of the returns had been completed , - on the 16th of November , Kellogg filed a bill in the Circuit Court of Louisiana , averring that the Lynch board was the true board ; that he , Kellogg , had been elected ; that the returns had not been properly counted ; and praying an injunction against the Warmouth board and McEnery , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is at least very questionable whether this bill on its face presented a case within the jurisdiction of the federal court . Nevertheless , Justice Durell at once issued an injunction on an ex parte hearing , enjoining the Warmouth board from acting except in presence of the Lynch board , and McEnery from setting up any claim to an election under its returns . In the mean time , while these and other legal proceedings were slowly advancing , Warmouth signed an act , previously passed by the legislature , abolishing both boards and constituting a new one . He then organized another and different body in conformity with its provisions ; the returns were duly canvassed and McEnery declared to be elected Governor . The names of the persons found to be chosen for the legislature were also published by the new canvassers , together with those of the other State officers . The prospects of Kellogg now seemed desperate . Mr. Justice Durell , however , was master of the situation . On the night of the 5th December , in his own chambers , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order : - " It is hereby ordered , that the Marshal of the United States for the District of Louisiana shall forthwith take possession of the building known as the Mechanics ' Institute and occupied as the State House , for the assembling of the legislature therein , in the city of New Orleans , and hold the same subject to the further order of this court ; and meanwhile to prevent all unlawful assemblage therein under the guise or pretext of authority claimed by virtue of pretended canvass and returns made by said pretended returning officers in contempt and violation of said restraining order ; but the Marshal is directed to allow the ingress and egress to and from the public offices in said building , of persons entitled to the same . " E. H. DURELL. " // Of course , so far as legality went , this order had precisely the same validity as if made by any other citizen . The order was , nevertheless , delivered to Packard , the Marshal , who called in the aid of the federal army to assist him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Captain Jackson , U. S. A. , took possession of the State House and occupied it for more than six weeks . On the same day , Collector Casey telegraphed to the President : " Marshal Packard took possession of State House this morning , at an early hour , with military posse , in obedience to a mandate of Circuit Court , to prevent illegal assemblage of persons under guise of authority of Warmouth 's returning board , in violation of injunction of Circuit Court l7te decree was sweeping in its provisions , AND IF ENFORCED WILL SAVE THE REPUBLICAN MAJORITY AND GIVE LouisiANA A REPUBLICAN LEGISLATURE AND STATE GOVERNMENT . " The real legislature thus was swept aside ; it only remained to organize a new one . On December 6th the Lynch bbard certified that Kellogg was elected Governor , and also certified a list of persons whom they declared elected to the legislature . There is nothing in all the tragedy of blunders and frauds under consideration , more indefensible than the pretended canvass of this board . It was testified by Mr. Bovee himself that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their canvass to that end . No returns were before the board . The following question by Mr. Carpenter and answer by Lynch tell the whole story : - By Mr. Carpenter . Q. You estimated it , then , upon the basis of what you thought the vote ought to have been * By Lynch . A. Yes , sir . That was just the fact , and I think , on the whole , we were pretty correct . Antoine ( the defeated candidate for lieutenant-governor and deputy-collector at Shreveport ) now filed his bill ; he prayed , like Kellogg , that no one whose name was not on the Lynch list should be allowed to lay claim to any office , and also that Warmouth should be restrained from interfering with the organization of the legislature elected by Lynch . Motion for this injunction was made on December 7th , and a restraining order was at once granted , couched in the broadest terms . // The legislature thus fraudulently chosen was duly organized . Resistance was useless . It had been installed by the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States Judge . Pinchback took the presidency of the Senate ; Warmouth was immediately impeached ( it is unnecessary to say that the proceedings at the impeachment trial were utterly irregular and illegal ) ; Pinchback assumed the office of Governor . On the 11th of December , 18Th , Pinchback telegraphed to Attorney-General Williams - " May I suggest that the commanding general be authorized to furnish troops upon my requisition upon him for the protection of the legislature and the gubernatorial office l The moral effect would be great , and in my judgment tend greatly to allay any trouble likely to grow out of the recent inflammatory proclamation of Warmouth . " Mr. Kellogg telegraphed : - " If the President in some way indicates recognition , Governor Pinchback and legislature would settle everything . " And Mr. Casey sent a message saying : - The delay in placing troops at disposal of Governor Pinchback , in accordance with joint resolution , is disheartening our friends and cheering our enemies . If requisition of legislature is complied with , all difficulty will be dissipated , the party saved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favor . . . . . This history may be fitly closed with the three following telegrams : - DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE , December 12 , 1872 . ACTING-GOVERNOR PINCHBACK , New Orleans , Louls'wua - Let it be understood that you are recognized by the President as the lawful executive of Louisiana , and that the body assembled at Mechanics ' Institute as the lawful legislature of the State ; and it is suggcsted that you make proclamation to that effect , and also that all necessary assistance will be given to you and the legislature herein recognized to protect the State from disorder and violence . GEo . H. WILLIAMS , Attorney-General . On the 12th , McEnery telegraphed , begging that action might be postponed until a committee of citizens could go to Washington and lay the facts before the executive . He received the following reply to his respectful appeal : - // DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE , December 13 , 18*2 . HON. JOHN MCENERY , New Orleans - Your visit with a hundred citizens will be unavailing , so far as the President is concerned . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the sooner it is acquiesced in the sooner good order and peace will be restored . GRO . H. WILLIAMS , Attorney-General . Then came the last resort of arbitrary power - WASHINGTON , December 14 , 1872 . GENERAL W. H. EMORY , U. S. A. , Commanding New Orleans , Loulstana . You may use all necessary force to preserve the peace , and will recognize the authority of Governor Pinchback . By order of the President : E. D. TOWNSEND , Adjutant-General . Thus did a constitutional federal Government deal with a sovereign State ! Thus was that government established under which such terrible misfortunes have befallen that unhappy people ! The best commentary upon the whole matter is the remark of the committee of investigation : " The saddest chapter in this melancholy business was the interference of federal authority with the affairs of Louisiana . " The second example is that of Massachusetts . In that commonwealth the Republican majority is very large , very compact , and remarkably steadfast . Throughout New England the people are peculiarly docile to party discipline . Long habit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be burst asunder without an absolute convulsion . The few persons who do throw off their allegiance are looked upon with suspicion by peaceable citizens as untrustworthy men , without balance , and of dangerous tendencies . An adventurer , therefore , who can secure a nomination , even by the worst means , probably stands less danger of defeat by defection than would elsewhere be the case . What is known as the Essex district is the heart of the manufacturing interest of the State . It was there that the organization was formed which first secured the election of the present representative , and has since enabled him to make good his seat against all opposition . The Congressional history of the member from Essex is not a little puzzling . Certainly when he first went to Washington no man seemed less in favor with General Grant , and yet shortly after the advent of this admin // istration he seemed to have gained great influence with th' President and his Cabinet . He now addressed himself to the task of " capturing " Massachusetts . To this end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ federal offices wherever an opportunity occurred . Patronage was liberally accorded him . A personal party was formed on the most approved pattern , and in 1871 he apparently thought the work far enough advanced to justify a decisive step . In the autumn of that year he announced himself as a candidate , and attempted to seize on the Republican convention which nominated the governor . Probably no man could have been named within the Commonwealth more offensive to the body of respectable and intelligent citizens , nor one who could have presented the issue of federal interference more squarely to the people . Without national support his design would have been impracticable , - with that support , not only was it practicable , but it even promised success . In every town and village a circle was formed round the postmaster , the collector , or some other government officer , who was moved by the hope of personal gain . Not a man who wished for place or had a job on hand but added to their numbers . The now too common spectacle was displayed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by greedy lust for spoil . Notwithstanding all , the attempt failed , though the success with which caucuses had been manipulated was proved by the number of delegates who supported the new aspirant . Thenceforward a portion of the State central committee , who hold the whole party organization in their hands , was secured to him . Two years more were passed in perfecting the machinery of corruption . The government denied nothing to its favorite , and in 1873 he again renewed the contest . Once more he failed , and was driven to ask still further aid from Washington , - nor did he ask in vain . Mr. Simmons , who , in a subordinate position , had particularly distinguished himself in the management of the last canvass , was promoted by the President to the collectorship of Boston , in the hope that the most important national office in New England might offer a fitting sphere of action for his peculiar abilities . The struggle in // Massachusetts , it is true , lacks those startling incidents and dramatic effects which lend so great an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ melodramatic elements are as yet wanting in the North : the corrupt judges , the soldiers , and the blacks . In their absence the coloring takes more sober hues , and the terribly striking contrasts are lost . But making allowance for altered circumstances , and looking exclusively at the principles involved and the intention of the actors , the same conclusion is arrived at . No distinction can be drawn between the attitude of the government toward the two States , - or between Mr. Kellogg and Mr. Butler . These two cases are only illustrative of a great system which pervades all parts of the Union alike , - the system of corrupt consolidation . A third campaign against Massachusetts has already been announced ; how it will tern*inate is uncertain . Should the Commonwealth fall , it will sink into the mire of ring government in which so many States already lie , and its wealth and strength will be used to drag down others to its low condition ; for as State after State bows before this mighty power it becomes more difficult for the remnant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a passing ill , but on the contrary an evil which probably will grow with time . In a country so large as the United States , sectional questions are pretty certain to be those which fix popular attention and stir popular passion . Whichever section happens to be in the majority must control the government , but it is observable that not only a majority of the people , but also a majority of the States , is necessary to secure a predominaiice in all its branches . The temptation , therefore , for the party in power to manipulate State elections in the opposing section is almost irresistible . As in Hepburn v. Griswold , it will be argued that the end justifies the means . The respectable majority in Massachusetts never flinched in its support of the administration , notwithstanding and in the face of the Louisiana atrocities . And so it will ever be : so long as the power exists its abuse is certain . The hardship of the situation is great , because while under a simply centralized government reform is comparatively easy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any such // principle is difficult . A spasmodic effort is indeed possible , which may sweep away one nest of vermin , but in the mean time a new sectional issue will arise , a new party will be formed , and new demagogues bestriding the new organization will seek to subvert the States in the opposing section by national influence , and to lead them captive to Washington . When passions are stirred , the people forget that the machinery they permit their leaders to use for foreign conquest will next be turned against their own liberties . The organization by States , though in certain respects a protection to minorities , in certain others is a tremendous engine for concentrating power in a few hands . It matters not by how slender a vote a State 's election is carried , its weight is thrown as though its citizens were a unit . In case of " capture , " its organization is added to the national organization , and by the union of the two a government of astonishing strength is formed ,  --  one quite as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The condition of many Southern States proves this fact convincingly . When this combination between the dual systems becomes general , that is to say , when men who have succeeded in corrupting the executive , the legislative , and the judicial departments of a sufficient number of States have also secured seats 4 ' the Senate and wield the power filched from feeble Presidents , the utter overthrow of the Supreme Court will be at hand . Already it is staggering under a recent blow . Consolidation then will be complete , the conduct of public affairs , both local and national , will be concentrated in an irresponsible senatorial junto , legal restraint will be removed by the subjugation of the courts , and constitutional government will be replaced by the shifting despotism of naked majority rule . Comment is useless . Recent developments have but too clearly demonstrated that the men who climb into office by illegitimate means understand how to create seeming majorities where none exist ; how to stuff the ballot-box as well as how to pack the caucus . Viewed as a consolidated empire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The ordinary State is not too large to be controlled by a few audacious , unprincipled men , backed by the wealth and weight of the general government . Once secured , it affords him a firm foothold at Washington ; // while its compact shape enables him to use it as a potent weapon in his war on the executive . To say that the combined votes of the delegates from two or three large States would sway most Presidential conventions is no exaggerated statement . The men who thus grasp power are absolute in the purest sense , for they hold in their hands executive , legislative , and judicial functions . They are also irresponsible , for they are screened by ancient forms of government whose vitality they have sapped ; and their influence is based on an appeal to the worst passions of the most unprincipled and the least intelligent portion of society , for their strength lies in the caucus packed with voters whom their creatures can control , - by their creatures who themselves are bribed . No such system can be permanent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and education . A government by a standing army is expensive ; but a government by a corrupt civil service , with demagogues manipulating caucuses , is ruin . If there be any justice in the foregoing reasoning , the following propositions may be considered established . I. The situation of the United States to- day is in nothing anomalous or extraordinary . It is the legitimate result of a combination of circumstances which have influenced the people since they first formed themselves into a nation , and it is only one phase in the advance toward consolidation . Whether or not consolidation in some form would prove a benefit , remains in doubt ; but that the advance in that direction has of late been rapid is a settled fact . The only point in debate , then , is , how long can the final catastrophe be postponed , and by what means can its approach be regulated . II . Granting , for the sake of argument , that some form of consolidation must come , the shape which it seems assuming is the worst possible , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now developing falls little short of placing absolute power in the hands of demagogues who use corruption as a means of controlling ignorant votes , since their fixed policy is to exclude integrity and intelligence- from politics , and to rule by an appeal to folly and to fraud . IlL SuTh being the facts , clearly no spasmodic effort by the wople to free themselves from intolerable burdens can produce permanent good . Momentary relief might in all likelihood // follow , but when new issues arise and new organizations are built upon the old basis to meet them , the old malady will surely break out with redoubled violence . IV . No real reform is therefore possible which does not cut the evil at the root . Demagogues arrive at power by means of a feeble executive , a corrupt civil service , and the caucus system . First , then , a strong President must be chosen , who will curb the Senate , confine Congress to its proper functions , and who will be able to conceive and to execute a broad constitutional policy , - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the courts . Second , rotation in office must be stopped by legislation ; place must in future be held during good behavior , and place-men must be forbidden to mingle in politics . Third , something must be done to free minorities from their thraldom . How this shall be accomplished is of little consequence , whether by independent movements , like that of Governor Booth in California , by regular representation as in England , or by reviving the old custom which prevailed in the South down to the war , of candidates presenting themselves to the people without previous nomination . Any or all these methods are good , so far as they tend to produce the result . But , be the remedy what it may , some means must be devised of loosening the garrote of the caucus . That institution is now strangling the nation by permitting those - too often unworthy - men who handle party machinery to break down opposition , and to drive from the field all who will not stoop to peddle in their low arts . Finally , nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Declaration of Rights . Unless the press and the country will rise to the level of the emergency , and will seriously turn to the discussion of those fundamental principles on which all government depends , the tale is well nigh told . To a generation bred up in a knowledge of those great truths no future is threatening , for their wisdom would render tolerable the worst of systems . Ignorant or forgetful of them , disaster is certain . America has been wildly drifting for the past ten years , - a little longer and it will be too late . Nothing but a penetrating sense of their danger can save the people from having a dire choice thrust upon them , - the choice between anarchy and disintegration , or force .
