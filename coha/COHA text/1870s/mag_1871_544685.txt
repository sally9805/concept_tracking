OUR WHISPERING GALLERY . Ix . BEFORE we begin this morning to read a few more of Dickens 's letters , let me dispose of the question , often asked me by correspondents , and lately renewed in many epistles , " Was Charks Dickens a belitver in our Sayjour 's life and teachings * ? " Persons addressing to the writer of these papers such inquiries must be profoundly ignorant of the works of the great author , whom they endeavor by implication to place among the " Unbelievers . " If anywhere , out of the Bible , God 's goodness and mercy are solemnly commended to the world 's attention , it is in the pages of Dickens . I had supposed that these solemn words of his which have been so extensively copied both in Europe and America , from his last will and testament , dated the 12th of May , 1869 , would forever remain an emphatic testimony to his Christian faith - " I commit my soul to the mercy of God , through our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guide themselves by the teachings of the New Testament . " I wish it were in my power to bring to the knowledge of all who doubt the Christian character of Charles Dickens certain other memorable words of his , written years ago with reference to // Christmas . They are riot as familiar as many beautiful things from the same pen on the same subject , for the paper , which enshrines them , has not as yet been collected among his authorized works . Listen to these loving words in which the Christian writer has embodied the life of his Saviour : - " Hark ! the Waits are playing , and they break my childish sleep ! What images do I associate with the Christmas music as I see them set forth on the Christmas tree ? Known before all others , keeping far apart from all the others , they gather round my little bed . An angel , speaking to a group of shepherds in a field ; some travellers , with eyes uplifted , following a star ; a baby in a manger ; a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; a solemn figure with a mild and beautiful face , raising a dead girl by the hand ; again , near a city gate , calling back the son of a widow , on his bier , to life ; a crowd of people looking through the opened roof of a chamber where he sits , and letting down a sick person on a bed , with ropes ; the same in a tempest , walking o* the water to a ship ; again , on a sea-shore , teaching a great multitude ; again , with a child upon his knee , and other children round ; again , restoring sight to the blind , speech to the dumb , hearing to the deaf , health to the sick , strength to the lame , knowledge to the ignorant ; again , dying upon a cross , watched by armed soldiers , a thick darkness coming on , the earth beginning to shake , and only one voice heard , - Forgive them , for they know not what they do ! The writer of these pages begs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not feel himself bound in future to reply to any inquiries , from however well-meaning correspondents , as to whether Charles Dickens was an " Unbeliever , " or a " Unitarian , " or an " Episcopalian , " or whether " he ever went to church in his life , " or " used improper language , ' or " drank enough to hurt him . " He was human , very human , but he was no scoffer or doubter . His religion was of the heart , and his faith beyond questioning . He taught the world , said Dean Stanley over his new-made grave in Westminster Abbey , great lessons of " the eternal value of generosity , of purity , of kindness , and of unselfishness , " and by his fruits he shall be known of all men . Let me commend to the attention of my numerous nameless correspondents , who have attempted to soil the moral character of Dickens , the following little incident , related to me by himself during a summer-evening walk among the Kentish meadows , a few months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story , if possible , as simply and naturallyas he told it to me . " I chanced to be travelling some years ago , " he said , " in a railroad carriage between Liverpool and London . Beside myself there were two ladies and a gentleman occupying the carriage . We happened to be all strangers to each other , but I noticed at once that a clergyman was of the party . I was occupied with a ponderous article in the Times , ' when the sound of my own name drew my attention to the fact that a conversation was going forward among the three other persons in the carriage with reference to myself and my books . One of the ladies was perusing Bleak House , ' then lately published , and the clergyman had commenced a conversation with the ladies by asking what book they were reading . On being told the author 's name and the title of the book , he expressed himself greatly grieved that any lady in England should be willing to take up the writings of so vile a character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the low estimate the clergyman put upon an author whom they had been accustomed to read , to say the least , with a certain degree of pleasure . They were evidently much shocked at what the man said of the immoral tendency of these books , which they seemed never before to have suspected ; but // when he attacked the author 's private character , and told monstrous stories of his immoralities in every direction , the volume was shut up and consigned to the dark pockets of a travellingbag . I listened in wonder and astonishment , behind my newspaper , to stories of myself , which if they had been true would have consigned any man to a prison for life . After my fictitious biographer had occupied himself for nearly an hour with the eloquent recital of my delinquencies and crimes , I very quietly joined in the conversation . Of course I began by modestly doubting some statements which I had just heard , touching the author of Bleak House , ' and other unimportant works of a similar character . The man stared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversational stage an intrusion and an impertinence . You seem to speak , ' I said , from personal knowledge of M.r. Dickens . Are you acquainted with him ? ' He rather evaded the question , but , following him up closely , I compelled him to say that he had been talking , not from his own knowledge of the author in question ; but he said he knew for a certainty that every statement he had made was a true one . I then became more earnest in my inquiries for proofs , which he arrogantly declined giving . The ladies sat by in silence , listening intently to what was going forward . An author they had been accustomed to read for amusement had been traduced for the first time in their hearing , and they were waiting to learn what I had to say in refutation of the clergyman 's charges . I was taking up his vile stories , one by one , and stamping them as false in every particular , when the man grew furious , and asked me if I knew Dickens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows him better than I do ; and all your stories about him from beginning to end , to these ladies , are unmitigated lies . ' The man became livid with rage , and asked for my card . You shall have it , ' I said , and coolly taking out one , I presented it to him without bowing . We were just then nearing the station in London , so that I was spared a longer interview with my truthful companion ; but , if I were to live a hundred years , I should not forget the abject condition into which the narratQr of my crimes was instantly plunged . His face turned white as his cravat , and his lips refused to utter words . He seemed like a wilted vegetable , and as if his legs belonged to somebody else . The ladies became aware of the situation at once , and bidding them good day , ' I stepped smilingly out of the carriage . Before I could get away from the station the man had mustered up strength sufficient to follow me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I pitied him from my soul . I left him with this caution , Before you make charges against the character of any man again , about whom you know nothing , and of whose works you are utterly ignorant , study to be a seeker after Truth , and avoid Lying as you would eternal perdition. * " I never ceased to wonder at Dickens s indomitable cheerfulness , evea when he was suffering from ill health , and could not sleep more than two or three hours out of the twenty-four . He made it a point never to inflict on another what he might be painfully enduring himself , and I have seen him , with what must have been a great effort , arrange a merry meeting for some friends , when I knew that almost any one else under similar circumstances would have sought relief in bed . One evening at a little dinner given by himself to half a dozen friends in Boston , he came out very strong . His influenza lifted a little , as he said afterwards , and he took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibly give an idea of that hilarious night , and I will merely attempt a brief reference to it . As soon as we wez*e seated at the table , I read in his lustrous eye , and heard in his jovial voice , that all solemn forms were to be dis // pensed with on that occasion , and that merriment might be confidently expected . To the end of the feast there was no let up to his magnificent cheerfulness and humor . J- B- , exminister plenipotentiary as he was , went in for nonsense , and he , I am sure , will not soon forget how undignified we all were , and what screams of laughter went up from his own uncontrollable throat . Among other tomfooleries , we had an imitation of scenes at an English hustings , Dickens bringing on his candidate ( his friend D- ) , and I opposing him with mine ( the ex - minister ) . Of course there was nothing spoken in the speeches worth remembering , but it was Dickens 's manner that carried off the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parted in the middle , that only two little capillary scraps are left , just over his ears , to show what kind of thatch once covered his jolly cranium . Dickens pretended that his candidate was superior to the other , because he had no hair ; and that mine , being profusely supplied with that article , was in consequence disqualified in a marked degree for an election . His speech , for volubility and nonsense , was nearly fatal to us all . We roared and writhed in agonies of laughter , and the candidates themselves were literally choking and crying with the humor of the thing . But the fun culminated when I tried to get a hearing in behalf of my man , and Dickens drowned all my attempts to be heard with imitative jeers of a boisterous election mob . He seemed to have as many voices that night as the human throat is capable of , and the repeated interrupting shouts , among others , of a pretended husky old man bawling out at intervals , " Three cheers for the bald un ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Up vith the little shiny chap on top ! " and other similar outbursts I can never forget . At last , in sheer exhaustion , we all gave in , and agreed to break up and thus save our lives , if it were not already too late to make the attempt . The extent and variety of Dickens 's tones were wonderful . Once he described to me in an inimitable way a scene he witnessed many years ago at a London theatre , and I am certain no professional ventriloquist could have reproduced it better . I could never persuade him to repeat the description in presence of others ; but he did it for me several times during our walks into the country , where he was , of course , unobserved . His recital of the incident was irresistibly droll , and no words of mine can give the situation even , as he gave it . He said he was once sitting in the pit of a London theatre , when two men came in and took places directly in front of him . Both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ familiar with the stage . One of them was stone deaf , and relied entirely upon his friend to keep him informed of the dialogue a nd story of the play as it went on , by having bawled into his ear , word for word , as near as possible what the actors and actresses were saying . The man who could hear became intensely interested in the play , and kept close watch of the stage . The deaf man also shared in the progressive action of the drama , and rated his friend soundly , in a loud voice , if a stitch in the story of the play were inadvertently dropped . Dickens gave the two voices of these two spectators with his best comic and dramatic power . Notwithstanding the roars of the audience , for the scene in the pit grew immensely funny to them as it went on , the deaf man and his friend were too much interested in the main business of the evening to observe that they were noticed . One bawled louder , and the other , with his elevated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scene culminated in a most unexpected manner . " Now , " screamed the hearing man to the deaf one , " they are going to elope ! " " Who is going to elope ? " asked the deaf man , in a loud , vehement tone . " Why , them two , the young man in the red coat and the girl in a white gown , that s a talking together now , and just going off the // stage ! " " Well , then , you must have missed telling me something they ye said before , " roared the other in an enraged and stentorian voice ; " for there was nothing in their conduct all the evening , as you have been representing it to me , that would warrant them in such a proceeding ! " At which the audience could not bear it any longer , and screamed their delight till the curtain fell . Dickens was always planning something to interest and amuse his friends , and when in America he taught us several games arranged by himself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as our instructor . While he was travelling from point to point he was cogitating fresh charades to be acted when we should again meet . It was at Baltimore that he first conceived the idea of a walking-match , which should take place on his return to Boston , and he drew up a set of humorous " articles , " which he sent to me with this injunction , " Keep them in a place of profound safety , for attested execution , until my arrival in Boston . " He went into this matter of the walking-match with as much earnest directness as if he were planning a new novel . The articles , as prepared by himself , are thus drawn up - " Articles of agreement entered into at Baltimore , in the United States of America , this third day of February in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-eight , between - - British subject , alias the Man of Ross , and  --  - , American citizen , alias the Boston Bantam . " Whereas , some Bounce having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pedestrianism and agility , they have agreed to settle their differences and prove who is the better man , by means of a walking-match for two hats a side and the glory of their respective countries ; and whereas they agree that the said match shall come off , whatsoever the weather , on the Mill Dam Road outside Boston , on Saturday , the 29th day of this present September , month ; and whereas , they agree that the personal attendants on themselves during the whole walk , and also the umpires and starters and declarers of victory in the match shall be - of Boston , known in sporting circles as Massachusetts Jemmy , and Charles Dickens of Falstaff 's Gad 's Hill , whose surprising performances ( without the least variation ) on that truly national instrument , the American catarrh , have won for him the well-merited title of the Gad 's Hill Gasper : - " z . The men are to be started , on the day appointed , by Massachusetts Jemmy and The Gasper. " 2 . Jemmy and The Gasper are , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate of not less than four miles an hour by the Gasper 's watch , for one hour and a half . At the expiration of that one hour and a half they are to carefully note the place at which they halt . On the match 's coming off they are to station themselves in the middle of the road , at that precise point , and the men ( keeping clear of them and of each other ) are to turn round them , right shoulder inward , and walk back to the starting-point . The man declared by them to pass the starting-point first is to be the victor and the winner of the match . 3 . No jostling or fouling allowed . " 4 . All cautions or orders issued to the men by the umpires , starters , and declarers of victory to be considered final and admitting of no appeal . " 5 . A sporting narrative of the match to be written by The Gasper within one week after its coming off and the same to be duly printed ( at the expense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The said broadside to be framed and glazed , and one copy of the same to be carefully preserved by each of the subscribers to these articles . " 6 .

The Gasper to occupy the chair , faced by Massachu Our Whi*periig Gagt , 7. // setts Jemmy . The latter promptly and formally to invite , as soon as may be after the date of these presents , the following guests to honor the said dinner with their presence ; that is to say here follow the names of a few of his friends , whom he wished to be invited . " Now , lastly . In token of their accepting the trusts and offices by these articles conferred upon them , these articles are solemnly and formally signed by Massachusetts Jemmy and by the Gad 's Hill Gasper , as well as by the men themselves .

" Witness to the signatures , - - . When he returned to Boston from Baltimore he proposed that I should accompany him over the walkingground " at the rate of not less than four miles an hour , for one hour and a half . " I shall not soon forget the tremendous pace at which he travelled that day . I have seen a great many walkers , but never one with whom I found it such hard work to keep up . Of course his object was to stretch out the space as far as possible for our friends to travel on the appointed day . With watch in hand , Dickens strode on over the Mill Dam toward Newton Centre . When we reached the turning-point , and had established the extreme limit , we both felt that we had given the men who were to walk in the match excellent good measure . All along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I suppose , why two men on such a blustering day should be pegging away in the middle of the road as if life depended on the speed they were getting over the ground . We had walked together many a mile before this , but never at such a rate as on this day . I had never seen his full power tested before , and I could not but feel great admira/-tion for his walking pluck . We were both greatly heated , and , seeing a little shop by the roadside , we went in for refreshments . A few sickly looking oranges were all we could obtain to quench our thirst , and we seized those and sat down on the shop door-steps , tired and panting . After a few minutes ' rest we started again and walked back to town . Thirteen miles ' stretch on a brisk winter day did neither of us any harm , and Dickens was in great spirits over the match that was so soon to come off . We agreed to walk over the ground again on the appointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the account that Dickens himself drew up , of that day 's achievement , for the broadside . " THE SPORTING NARRATIVE . " THE MEN . " The Boston Bantam ( alias l3right Chanticleer ) is a young bird , though too old to be caught with chaff . He comes of a thorough game breed , and has a clear though modest crow . He pulls down the scale at ten stone and a half and add a pound or two . His previous performances in the pedestrian line have not been numerous . He once achieved a neat little match against time in two left boots at Philadelphia ; but this must be considered as a pedestrian eccentricity , and can not be accepted by the rigid chronicler as high art . The old mower with the scythe and hour-glass has not yet laid his mauley heavily on the Bantam 's frontispiece , but he has had a grip at the Bantam 's top feathers , and in plucking dut a handful was very near making him like the great Napoleon Bonaparte ( with the exception of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself too much occupied to carry out the idea , and gave it up . The Man of Ross ( alias old Alick Pope , alias **27;355;TOOLONG , etc. ) is a thought and a half too fleshy , and , if he accidentally sat down 1871. 363 // upon his baby , would do it to the tune of fourteen stone . This popular codger is of the rubicund and jovial sort , and has long been known as a piscatorial pedestrian on the banks of the Wye . But Izaak Walton had n't pace , - look at his book and you 11 find it slow , and when that article comes in question , the fishing-rod may prove to some of his disciples a rod in pickle . Howbeit , the Man of Ross is a lively ambler , and has a smart stride of his own . " THE TRAINING . " If vigorous attention to diet could have brought both men up to the post in tip-top feather , their condition would have left nothing to be desired . But both might have had more daily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confined to an occasional Baltimore burst under the guidance of The Gasper , and to an amicable toddle between themselves at Washington . " THE COURSE . " Six miles and a half , good measure , from the first , tree on the Mill Dam Road , lies the little village ( with no refreshments in it but five oranges and a bottle of blacking ) of Newton Centre . Here Massachusetts Jemmy and The Gasper had established the turning-point . The road comprehended every variety of inconvenience to test the mettle of the men , and nearly the whole of it was covered with snow . " THE START was effected beautifully . The men taking their stand in exact line at the starting-post , the first tree aforesaid , received from The Gasper the warning , " Are you ready ? " and then the signal , " One , two , three . Go ! ** They got away exactly together , and at a spinning speed , waited on by Massachusetts Jemmy and The Gasper . " THE RAcE " In the teeth of an intensely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast and . furious across the road from right to left , the Bantam slightly led . But the Man responded to the challenge , and soon breasted , him . For the first three miles each led by a yard or so alternately ; but the walking was very even .. On four miles being called by The Gasper the men were side by side ; and then ensued one of the best periods of the race , the same splitting pace being held by both through a heavy snow-wreath and up a dragging hill . At this point it was anybody 's game , a dollar on Rossius and two half- dollars on the member of the feathery tribe . When five miles were called , the men were still shoulder to shoulder . At about six miles The Gasper put on a tremendous spirit to leave the men behind and establish himself as the turning-point at the entrance of the village . He afterwards declared that he received a mental knock-downer on taking his station and facing about , to find Bright Chanticleer close in upon him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rounded first ; Rossius rounded wide ; and from that moment the Bantam steadily shot ahead . Though both were breathed at the town , the Bantam quickly got his bellows into obedient condition , and blew away like an orderly blacksmith in full work . The forcing - pumps of Rossius likewise proved themselves tough and true , and warranted first-rate , but he fell off in pace ; whereas the Bantam pegged away with his little drumsticks , as if he saw his wives and a peck of barley waiting for him at the family perch . Continually gaining upon him of Ross , Chanticleer gradually drew ahead within a very few yards of half a mile , finally doing the whole distance in two hours and forty-eight minutes . Ross had ceased to compete three miles short of the winning-post , but bravely walked it out and came in seven minutes later . " REMARKS . " The difficulties under which this plucky match was walked can only be appreciated by those who were on the // ground . To the excessive rigor of the icy blast and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the constant scattering of the latter into the air and into the eyes of the men , while heads of hair , beards , eyelashes , and eyebrows were frozen into icicles . To breathe at all , in such a rarefied and disturbed atmosphere , was not easy ; but to breathe up to the required mark was genuine , slogging , ding-dong , hard labor . That both competitors were game to the backbone , doing what they did under such conditions , was evident to all ; but to his gameness the courageous Bantam added unexpected endurance and ( like the sailor 's watch that did three hours to the cathedral clock 's one ) unexpected powers of going when wound up . The knowing eye could not fail to detect considerable disparity between the lads ; Chanticleer being , as Mrs. Cratchit said of Tiny Tim , " very light to carry , " and Rossius promising fair to attain the rotundity of the Anonymous Cove in the Epigram : - And when he walks the streets the paviors cry , " God blessyou , sir I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The dinner at the Parker House , after the fatigues of the day , was a brilliant success . The Great International XValking - Match was over ; America had won , and England was nowhere . The victor and the vanquished were the heroes of the occasion , for both had shown great powers of endurance and done their work in capital time . We had no set speeches at the table , for we had voted eloquence a bore before we sat dQwn . David Copperfield , Hyperion , Hosea Biglow , the Autocrat , and the Bad Boy were present , and there was no need of set speeches . The ladies present , being all daughters of America , smiled upon the champion , and we had a great , good time . The banquet provided by Dickens was profusely decorated with flowers , arranged by himself . The master of the feast was in his best mood , albeit his country had lost ; and we all declared , when we bade him good 365 night , that none of us had ever enjoyed a festival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travels again , and I received frequent letters from him from various parts of the country . On the 8th of March , i868 , he writes from a Western city : - Sundsy , 8th March , a868 .

Its hotel is likewise a dreary institution . But I have an impression that we must be in the wrong one , and buoy myself up with a devout belief in the other , over the way . The awakening to consciousness this morning on a lop-sided bedstead facing nowhere , in a room holding nothing but sour dust , was more terrible than the being afraid to go to bed last night .

After creeping through water for miles upon miles , our train gave it up as a bad job between Rochester and this place , and stranded us , early on Tuesday afternoon , at Utica . There we remained all night , and at six o'clock yesterday morning were ordered up to get ready for starting again . Then we were countermanded . Then we were once more told to get ready . Then we were told to stay where we were . At last we got off at eight o'clock , and after paddling through the hood until half past three , got landed here , - to the great relief of our minds as well as bodies , for the tickets were all sold out for last night . We had all sorts of adventures by the way , among which two of the most notable were : - i . Picking up two trains out of the water , in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relief should arrive . 2 . Unpacking and releasing into the open country a great train of cattle and sheep that had been in the water I do n't know how long , and that had begun in their imprisonment to eat each other . I never could have realized the strong and dismal expressions of which the faces of sheep are capable , had I not seen the haggard countenances of this unfortunate flock as they were tumbled out of their dens and picked themselves up and made off , leaping wildly ( many with broken legs ) over a great mound of thawing snow , and over the worried body of a deceased companion . Their misery was so very human that I was sorry to recognize several inti mate acquaintances conducting themselves in this forlornly gymnastic manner . As there is no question that our friendship began in some previous state of existence many ages ago , I am now going to make bold to mention September , a discovery we have made concerning Springfield .

Lowell 's delightful note enclosed with thanks . Do make a trial for Springfield . We saw Professor White at Syracuse , and went out for a ride with him . Queer quarters at Utica , and nothing particular to eat ; but the people so very anxious to please , that it was better than the best cuisine . I made a jug of punch ( in the bedroom pitcher ) , and we drank our love to you and Fields . Dolby had more than his share , under pretence of devoted enth usiasm .

I regretted extremely that he felt obliged to give up visiting the West . Invitations which greatly pleased him came day after day from the principal cities and towns , but his friends soon discovered that his health would not allow him to extend his travels beyond Washington . He sailed for home on the 19th of April , : 868 , and we shook hands with him on the deck of the Russia as the good ship turned her prow toward England . He was in great spirits at the thought of so soon again seeing Gad 's Hill , and the prospect of a rest after all his toilsome days and nights Our Whispering Gallery . // in America . While at sea he wrote the following letter to me - ABOARD THE RUSSIA , BOUND FOR LIVERPOOL , Sunday , 26th April , i868 .

We are already past the Banks of Newfoundland , although our course was seventy miles to the south , with the view of avoiding ice seen by Judkins in the Scotia on his passage out to New York . The Russia is a magnificent ship , and has dashed along bravely . We had made more than thirteen hundred and odd miles at noon to-day . The wind , after being a little capricious , rather threatens at the present time to turn against us , but our run is already eighty miles ahead of the Russia 's last run in this direction ,  --  a very fast one To all whom it may concern , report the Russia in the highest terms . She rolls more easily than the other Cunard Screws , is kept in perfect order , and is most carefully looked after in all departments . We have had nothing approaching to heavy weather ; still , one can speak to the trim of the ship- Her captain , a gentleman ; bright , polite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am greatly better , I hope . I have got on my right boot to-day for the first time ; the " true American " seems to be turning faithless at last ; and I made a Gad 's Hill breakfast this morning , as a further advance on having otherwise eaten and drunk all day ever since Wednesday . You will see Anthony Trollope , I dare say . What was my amazement to see him with these eyes come aboard in the mail tender just before we started ! He had come out in the Scotia just in time to dash off again in said tender to shake hands with me , knowing me to be aboard here . It was most heartily done . He is on a special mission of convention with the United States post-office . We have been picturing your movements , and have duly checked off your journey home , and have talked about you continually . But I have thought about you both , even much , much more . You will never know how I love you both ; or what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be to me everywhere ; or how fervently I thank you . All the working of the ship seems to be done on my forehead .. It is scrubbed and holystoned ( my head - not the deck ) at three every morning . It is scraped and swabbed all day . Eight pairs of heavy boots are now clattering on it , getting the ship under sail again . Legions of ropes ' - ends are flopped upon it as I write , and I must leave off with Dolby 's love . Thursday , 3oth . Soon after I left off as above we had a gale of wind , which blew all night . For a few hours on the evening side of midnight there was no getting from this cabin of mine to the saloon , or vice versa , so heavily did the sea break over the decks . The ship , however , made nothing of it , and we were all right again by Monday afternoon . Except for a few hours yesterday ( when we had a very light head wind ) , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bowling away at a great rate , with a fresh breeze filling all our sails . We expect to be at Queenstown between midnight and three in the morning . I hope , my dear Fields , you may find this legible , but I rather doubt it ; for there is motion enough on the ship to render writing to a landsman , however accustomed to pen and ink , rather a difficult achievement . Besides which , I slide away gracefully from the paper , whenever I want to be particularly expressive - , sitting opposite to me at breakfast , always has the following items : A large dish of porridge , into which he casts slices of butter and a quantity of sugar . Two cups of tea . A steak . Irish stew . Chutnee , and marmalade . Another deputation of two has solicited // a reading to-night . Illustrious novelist has unconditionally and absolutely declined . More love , and more to that , from your ever affectionate friend , C. D. His first letter from home gave us all great pleasure , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had fastened itself upon him so many months before . Among his earliest notes I find these paragraphs : - " I have found it so extremely difficult to write about America ( though never so briefly ) without appearing to blow trumpets on the one hand , or to be inconsistent with my avowed determination not to write about it on the other , that I have taken the simple course enclosed . The number will be published on the 6th of June . It appears to me to be the most modest and manly course , and to derive some graceful significance from its title ..... " Thank my dear - from me for her delightful letter received on the i6th . I will write to her very soon , and tell her about the dogs . I would write by this post , but that Wills 's absence ( in Sussex , and getting no better there as yet ) so overwhelms me with business that I can scarcely get through it . " Miss me ? Ah my dear fellow , but how do I miss you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every day of our lives . And I never see the place looking very pretty indeed , or hear the birds sing all day long and the nightingales all night , without restlessly wishing that you were both there . " With best most enduring Fields , " Your most affectionate , ? * C. * I hope you will receive by Saturday 's Cunard a case containing : " x .

If it should be delayed for the knibs ( or nibs ) promised to-morrow , and should be too late for the Cunard packet , it will in that case come by the next following Inman steamer .

It is , however , a great success in the country , and is now getting up with great force in Paris . Fechter is ill , and was ordered off to Brighton yesterday . Wills is ill too , and banished into Sussex for perfect rest . Otherwise , thank God , I find everything well and thriving . You and my dear Mrs. Fare constantly in my mind . Procter greatly better On the 25th of May he sent off the following from Gad 's Hill : - Mv DEAR - : As you ask me about the dogs , I begin with them . When I came down first , I came to Gravesend , five miles off . The two Newfoundland dogs coming to meet me , with the usual carriage and the usual driver , and beholding me coming in my usual dress out at the usual door , it struck me that their recollection of my having been absent for any unusual time was at once cancelled . They behaved ( they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; coming behind the basket phaeton as we trotted along , and lifting their heads to have their ears pulled , - a special attention which they receive from no one else . But when I drove into the stable-yard , Linda ( the St. Bernard ) was greatly excited ; weeping profusely , and throwing herself on her back that she might caress my foot with her great fore-paws . M- 's little dog too , Mrs. Bouncer , barked in the greatest agitation on being called down and asked by M- , " Who is this ? " // and tore round and round me , like the dog in the Faust outlines . You must know that all the farmers turned out on the road in their market-chaises to say , " Welcome home , sir ! " that all the houses along the road were dressed with flags ; and that our servants , to cut out the rest , had dressed this house so , that every brick of it was hidden . They had asked M s permission to " ring the alarm-bell ( ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having some slight idea that that compliment might awaken master 's sense of the ludicrous , had recommended bell abstinence . But on Sunday , the village choir ( which includes the bell-ringers ) made amends . After some unusually brief pious reflection in the crowns of their hats at the end of the sermon , the ringers bolted out and rang like mad until I got home . ( There had been a conspiracy among the villagers to take the horse out , if I had come to our own station , and draw me here . M- and G- had got wind of it and warned me . ) Divers birds sing here all day , and the nightingales all night . The place is lovely , and in perfect order . I have put five mirrors in the Swiss Chalet ( where I write ) , and they reflect and refract in all kinds of ways the leaves that are quivering at the windows , and the great fields of waving corn , and the sail-dotted river . My room is up among the branches of the trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the green branches shoot in , at the open windows , and the lights and shadows of the clouds come and go with the rest of the company . The scent of the flowers , and indeed of everything that is growing for miles and miles , is most delicious . Dolby ( who sends a world of messages ) found his wife much better than he expected , and the children ( wonderful to relate ! ) perfect . The little girl winds up her prayers every night , with a special commendation to Heaven of me and the pony , - as if I must mount him to get there ! I dine with Dolby ( I was going to write " him , " but found von . xxviii. - NO. 167. 24 369 it would look as if I were going to dine with the pony ) at Greenwich this very day , and if your ears do not burn from six to nine this evening , then the Atlantic is a non-conductor .

It is really wonderful what those fine days at sea did for me ! My doctor was quite broken down in spirits when he saw me , for the first time since my return , last Saturday . " Good Lord ! " he said , recoiling . " Seven years younger ! " It is time I should explain the otherwise inexplicable enclosure . Will you tell Fields , with my love , ( I suppose he has n't used all the pens yet ? ) that I think there is in Tremont Street a set of my books , sent out by Chapman , not arrived when I departed . Such set of the immortal works of our illustrious , etc. , is designed for the gentleman to whom the enclosure is addressed . If T. , F. , &amp; Co. will kindly forward the set ( carriage paid ) with the enclosure to -s address , I will invoke new blessings on their heads , and will get Dolby 's little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is very shortly coming out in Paris , where it is now in active rehearsal . It is still playing here , but without Fechter , who has been very ill . The doctor 's dismissal of him to Paris , however , and his getting better there , enables him to get up the play there . He and Wilkie missed so many pieces of stage effect here , that , unless I am quite satisfied with his report , I shall go over and try my stage-managerial hand at the Vaudeville Theatre . I particularly want the drugging and attempted robbing in the bedroom scene at the Swiss inn to be done to the sound of a waterfall rising and falling with the wind . Although in the very opening of that scene they speak of the waterfall and listen to it , nobody thought of its mysterious music . I could make it , with a Our Whispering GalZe7y. // 370 good stage carpenter , in an hour . Is it not a curious thing that they want to make me a governor of the Foundling Hospital , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such an amazing access of visitors and money ? My dear love to Fields once again . Same to you and him from M- and G- . I can not tell you both how I miss you , or how overjoyed I should be to see you here . Ever , my dear - , Your most affectionate friend , C. D. Excellent accounts of his health and spirits continued to come from Gad 's Hill , and his letters were full of plans for the future . On the 7th of July he writes from Gad 's Hill as usual - GAn 's HILL PLACE , Tuesday , 7sh July , s868 . Mv DEAR FIELDS : I have delayed writing to you ( and - , to whom my love ) until I should have seen Longfellow . When he was in London the first time he came and went without reporting himself , and left me in a state of unspeakable discomfiture . Indeed , I should not have believed in his having been here at all , if Mrs. Procter had not told me of his calling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote to me from the Langham Hotel , and I went up to town to see him , and to make an appointment for his coming here . He , the girls , and - came down last Saturday night , and stayed until Monday forenoon . I showed them all of the neighboring country that could be shown in so short a time , and they finished off with a tour of inspection of the kitchens , pantry , wine-cellar , pickles , sauces , servants ' sitting-room , general household stores , and even the Cellar Book , of this illustrious establishment . Forster and Kent ( the latter wrote certain verses to Longfellow , which have been published in the " Times , " and which I sent to D- ) came down for a day , and I hope we all had a really " good time . " I turned out a couple of postilions in the old red jacket of the old red royal Dover road , for our ride ; and it was like a holiday ride in England fifty years ago . Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rochester , and the old cathedral , and the old castle , and the house for the six poor travellers who , " not being rogues or proctors , shall have lodging , entertainment , and four pence each . " Nothing can surpass the respect paid to Longfellow here , from the Queen downward . He is everywhere received and courted , and finds ( as I told him he would , when we talked of it in Boston ) the workingmen at least as well acquainted with his books as the classes socially above them Last Thursday I attended , as sponsor , the christening of Dolby 's son and heir , - a most jolly baby , who held on tight by the rector 's left whisker while the service was performed . What time , too , his little sister , connecting me with the pony , trotted up and down the centre aisle , noisily driving herself as that celebrated animal , so that it went very hard with the sponsorial dignity . - is not yet recovered from that concussion of the brain , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account for my not being able to devise a Christmas number , but I seem to have left my invention in America . In case you should find it , please send it over . I am going up to town to-day to dine with Longfellow . And now , my dear Fields , you know all about me and mine . You are enjoying your holiday ? and are still thinking sometimes of our Boston days , as I do ? and are maturing schemes for coming here next summer ? A satisfactory reply to the last question is particularly entreated . I am delighted to find you both so well pleased with the Blind Book scheme . I said nothing of it to you when we were together , though I had made up my mind , because I wanted to come upon you with that little burst from a distance . It seemed something like meeting again when I remitted the money and thought of your talking of it . // 37 ' The dryness of the weather is amazing . All the ponds and surface wells about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The people of this village have only one spring to resort to , and it is a couple of miles from many cottages . I do not let the great dogs swim in the canal , because the people have to drink of it . But when they get into the Medway , it is hard to get them out again . The other day Bumble ( the son , Newfoundland dog ) got into difficulties among some floating timber , and became frightened . Don ( the father ) was standing by me , shaking off the wet and looking on carelessly , when all of a sudden he perceived something amiss , and went in with a bound and brought Bumble out by the ear . The scientific way in which he towed him along was charming . Ever your loving C. D.
