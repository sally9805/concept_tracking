ART . VIII . - CRITICAL NOTICES . 1 . - Autobiography of AMOS KENDALL . Edited by his son-in-law , WILLIAM STICKNEY . Boston : Lee and Shepard . New York : Lee , Shepard , and Dillingham. 1872 . IN 1834 , Miss Harriet Martineau , then in Washington , wrote , " I was fortunate enough once to catch a glimpse of the invincible Amos Kendall , one of the most remarkable men in America . He is supposed to be the moving spring of the administration ; the thinker , planner , and doer ; but it is all in the dark . Documents are issued , the excellence of which prevents their being attributed to the persons who take the responsibility of them ; a correspondence is kept up all over the country , for which no one seems answerable ; work is done of goblin extent and with goblin speed , which makes men look about them with superstitious wonder ; and the invisible Amos Kendall has the credit of it all . President Jackson 's letters to his Cabinet are said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is attributed to Kendall ; the letters sent from Washington to remote country newspapers , whence they are collected and published in the Globe , ' as demonstrations of public opinion , are pronounced to be written by Kendall . Every mysterious paragraph in opposition newspapers relates to Kendall , and it is some relief that his now having the office of Postmaster- General affords opportunity for open attack upon this twilight personage , who is proved by the faults in the post.office administration not to be able to do quite // everything well . But he is undoubtedly a great genius . " This is no exaggerated statement . For ten years his name was on every one 's lips ; a contemporary of Webster , Clay , and Calhoun , he occupied a share of public attention scarcely less than theirs ; and yet to-day , though he has been dead barely three years , even among educated men , to not one in ten of those who are under fifty does his name convey any definite impression . Who lie was , to what he owed his temporary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trace upon the memories of his countrymen , are questions to the first and last of which this Autobiography affords an answer . Born about six months after the first inauguration of Washington , he passed his youth under the administration of Jefferson , and his early manhood amid the excitements preceding and attending the war of 1812 ; as the editor of a newspaper in Kentucky from the close of that war till he took office under General Jackson , he was of necessity conversant with the political struggles which marked that interesting period of our national development ; while during the scenes of Jackson 's administration , when in the contest over the removal of the government deposits from the Bank of the United States , Webster , Clay , and Calhoun were all arrayed against the President amid a political commotion such as this generation can hardly understand , he stood as the righthand man of " Old Hickory , " and shared with Benton and Woodbury the attacks of the Whigs . After he resigned the office of PostmasterGeneral and returned to his profession , his acquaintance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years in Washington , should have made him familiar with the varying phases of the antislavery agitation , and have enabled him to enlarge our knowledge of its secret annals . The history of such a life , if properly told , could not fail to be valuable , but if the reader turns to this Autobiography in the hope of finding such a history he will be disappointed . The editor has endeavored rather to show Mr. Kendall 's character as a man , than to describe his career or his connection with the public affairs of his day . This is the more to be regretted , since the subject of his memoir was a person whose life is interesting solely for what he did and not for what he was . Mr. Stickney , however , as is not unnatural in one closely related to the man of whom he writes , overrates the interest which the public takes in the private character of Mr. Kendall , and , assuming a curiosity which does not exist , seeks to gratify it by the publication of matters so entirely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of confidence , and is often guilty of a breach of good taste in disclosing them . There is in the biography an entire lack of perspective . The most // trifling incidents of Kendall 's childhood are treated as if equally important with the most striking events of his public life . This perhaps arises from the effort of the editor to let Mr. Kendall give his career in his own words . Till he was twenty-eight years old he kept a journal ; and as lie had nothing very important to *vrite about , his daily record dealt with trifles which concerned only himself and perhaps his personal friends . Afterwards , being fairly launched in active life , he had no time for a journal , and the editor , to supply the deficiency , r.esorts to his newspaper articles and to his private correspondence , which , while it exhibits his relations with his family , contains almost nothing of value to the public . Concerning the really important periods of his life , he seems to have written comparatively little ; and hence , in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what Mr. Stickney has given us , they make but a small figure . His boyhood was not different from that of most country boys brought up under the Puritan dispensation ; he received the usual education , and had the ordinary recreations . That Mr. Kendall hunted foxes arid got very tired , that he found a nest of young mice , or that once , in a severe storm , " the snow blown among his hair under the rim of his hat melted there , and then running down from the hair froze , and formed dangling icicles over the ear , " are not incidents which acquire a special interest from the fact that he was the hero of them ; yet his journal and his correspondence are filled with such trivialities , and they are far too largely used in making up this biography . His experiences as a student at Dartmouth College , where he was graduated in 1811 , are narrated with great fulness , and the picture presented of college manners and college discipline sixty years ago would make the hair of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ villagers , arising from efforts on the l ) art of the latter to free their cattle shut up in the college cellars , seem to have been no unusual pastime . A temperance agitation in his Sophomore year led some young men into disgraceful excesses , which Mr. Kendall 's journal describes with great minuteness , giving the names of the perpetrators . We can not but think that the editor would have done wisel*r , if lie f%lt it necessary to preserve the recollection of these scenes , at least to suppress the names , for their grandchildren will hardly read with pleasure accounts of their ancestors ' follies from the pen of one who certainly did " nothing extenuate . " At this time , Mr. Kendall received an anonymous letter of abuse , which he suspected came from one of his classmates who left the college on account of his participation in some anti-temperance outrage . lie // carefully preserved it till he heard , some years after , that the supposed writer was settled as a minister in a country town , when he sent it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you the only memorial of your former folly and meanness in my possession That you are reformed and that *OU may be useful and finally happy is the sincere hope of Amos Kendall . " The editor , after telling us that the postage on this note was prepaid , in order , perhaps , to make more pointed the contrast between the sheep and the goat , continues : " It was believed that if Mi ' . B. had become a better man , this note would elicit an apology from him , but no reply was ever received . " Mr. B. 's moderation in not replying hardly seems to justify Mr. Stickney 's obvious inference , but the whole iucident is thoroughly characteristic of his hero . After his graduation he studied law ; and , in 1814 , concluding that his chance of speedy advancement would be better in the West , he went to Lexington , Kentucky , where he became a tutor in the family of Henry Clay . Mr. Clay was absent in Europe at the time as one of the commissioners to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journal tells us nothing of him . Of details as to his family and the society of Lexington , in which he seems to have moved freely , his journal is singularly barren . A lively interest in himself is conspicuous throughout . Thus we find , under the date of June 17 , 1814 , " arrived the news of the dethronement and abdication of Bonaparte We are now left to contend single- handed against the whole power of Great Britain But we must breast the shock and pray God to unite us and bring us off with honor . Young mea are already talking here of going into the army , but it will be my last resort . " July 22d , " a requisition is made on this State for fifty-five hundred militia , to be held in readiness to march at a moment 's warning . It is said they are destined for Ne*v Orleans . if they have enrolled me , as was their duty , I shall be liable to a draft , and I care but little if the lot should fall upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it would give me a reputation which would be useful . " We miss in such utterances the orthodox glow of patriotism . Occasionally , however , we find some hint as to the state of Kentucky society . The law-abiding spirit of the community is illustrated by the proposal of a militia captain to remunerate a gentleman who had been fined for selling whiskey to his company without a license . Perhaps Mr. Kendall 's patriotic sentiments were simply a reflection of those entertained by his neighbors . The Kentucky militia , at least , were hardly alive to the possibilities of the war ; for he tells us that , at one training , where about two thirds of the comnpany appeared , some with useless muskets , some with none , all without bayonets , uniform , or // cartridge-boxes , the captain drew his men up in a hollow square , after calling the roll , and introduced a candidate for the legislature , who made them a stump speech ; when he had finished , the company was marched to the whiskey-table , where they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or six other candidates might privately urge their respective claims . These important duties having been performed , a slight drill followed . Again , he describes a regimental muster , where there was not a carto*uch-box or bayonet in the regiment , and where the exercises consisted in marching half a mile , forming en echelon three times , and marching back again , - manoeuvres which thoroughly exhausted the command , as they had to be learned by officers and men alike . Yet when this warlike community received the news of the peace of Ghent , which rescued us from the most serious embarrassments , they refused to rejoice , because they feared the terms were dishonorable . An illumination was recommended by the more judicious , whereupon the violent young warriors of Lexington threatened to break every window that was lighted up . It is unnecessary to add that though a third of the houses in town were illuminated , not a window was injured . Mr. Kendall evidently understood the spirit of the people , for he says : " I have , I think , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not as yet put it in practice . Drink whiskey and talk loud with the fullest confidence , and you will hardly fail of being called a clever fellow . " Becoming discouraged by his first experience , or rather the want of it , as a lawyer , he soon drifted into journalism , which became thenceforth his profession . His diary gives us a very accurate picture of a Kentucky editor 's life , though possibly no exaggeratcd idea of its dignity . In spite of a friend 's warning , he became interested in a newspaper which had already ruined two men , his part being to edit , read the proofs , keep the accounts , collect them when his travels brought him within reach of the debtors , and labor an hour a day in folding papers . He soon shared the fate of his predecessors ; but not dismayed by this failure , he forthwith issued the prospectus of a new sheet , which was shortly afterwards established . Whatever he may have been in after life , at this period he was clearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subscribers , since the existence of his paper depended upon the support of all parties , he hit upon the brilliant plan of inserting the writings of neither side , but of printing them as hand-bills to be folded in the paper , if desired ; for he remarks , " My wish is to steer as clear as possible of censure on either side , for I wish not to give offence for another 's benefit . " Apparently this plan did not fulfil his fond expectations , for shortly after we find him complaining : " I have the most // difficult task as editor . There has been much grumbling by one and another , but none are decisively angry . I shall endeavor to keep them in this state of half mad and half pleased . " The mad half seems to have been preserved most easily , for the journal soon records that his position on the questions in dispute has been mistaken , and some subscribers have threatened to discontinue . Later we learn , that unreasonable spirits , who insist on his taking a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while some have even stopped their papers . Whereupon , says Mr. Kendall , " Let them go , and every other man who will quarrel with an editor , if he be honest " ; an observation instantly followed by , " I commenced an attack on the ' Western Monitor ' some time ago , and Mr. Hunt has twice answered it , and now we have it regularly . But having great respect for each other , we find ourselves very much restricted . " This attack he afterwards proposes to continue , " as well for amusement , as for the support of the Republican party " ; and soon we find that it ended in personal invective and the termination of the friendship between the combatants which had hampered them so much . As Mr. Kendall grew more used to the editorial chair , these newspaper contests grew more common , and he became engaged in several handto-hand encounters , but always came off well . In one , his assailant was overpowered by numbers and roughly handled , having his shoulder broken , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partner , which last result is full of pleasing suggestions as to the rules of war among Kentucky editors of the day . " While Mr. Kendall was thus wielding his vigorous pen in the support of measures he deemed so essential to the prosperity of his adopted State , " says his biographer , he was " evidently seeking one whom he could love , and whose love in return would satisfy the natural longing of his heart . " A large space is accordingly devoted to extracts from his journal , relating to his " affairs of the heart . " Mr. Stickney would perhaps say that no life of Mr. Kendall could give an adequate idea of his character , which should fail to point out his extreme susceptibility , but whose biography would not be voluminous were his private meditations on all his successive loves given to the world ! They are highly entertaining , but there is a common prejudice which leads us to deem the particulars of love-affairs , including ante-nuptial correspondence , strictly private ; and as there is nothing in Mr. Kendall 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ student of psychology , there seems no adequate reason for breaking the well-established canon . However , as Mr. Stickney says , his " was not an unreasoning love , " and much of his correspondence , therefore , does not fall within the rule which makes love-letters sacred ; at least , there can have been no // unreasoning " passion in the offer of his hand and perhaps his heart , which elicited a response with such a beginning as this : " Mr. Kendall , I have perused the contents of your paper , and hope you will forgive me for having the boldness to write to you . " Mr. Kendall 's journal ceases about the time that he was fairly launched as an editor . From 1816 to 1829 he continued to conduct the " Argus of Western America , " at Frankfort , and the portion of his Autobiography which describes his career during that period is composed mainly of extracts from that paper . His articles against the decision of the Supreme Court in MeCulloch v. The State of Maryland are given at length @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make the discussion interesting at the present day . Contributions to the science of political economy , taken from the same source , and " Sunday reflections , " are interspersed with bits of newspaper controversy which would indicate that the amenities of New York journalism are not without a parallel in the so-called golden age of the Republic . But by what steps he commended himself to the notice of General Jackson , or of what were his relations with the public men of his day , the reader is left in ignorance . We may infer , indeed , that he owed his promotion to zealous advocacy of Jackson , in the " Argus , " but it is a great defect in Mr. Stickney 's work that he tells us in fact nothing about this important part of Mr. Kendall 's life . His course in office was marked by a sincere disposition to correct the abuses which had grown up in the departments , and lie discharged his duties with firmness and an honesty even in small matters which is too rare in the government service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precedents at the risk of seeming too particular , and of disobliging friends who profit by the usage so sanctioned . C*ornmunzs error facd jus is a fundamental principle in government offices . His reputation as an administrative officer rests principally upon his success as Postmaster-General . He was called into the department when the mismanagement of his predecessor , Major Barry , had brought it into a very bad condition . He found it much in debt , its affairs in great confusion , its credit at the lowest ebb . In less than a year it was free from debt , and before he resigned the office the whole system was reformed , and the service raised to a high degree of efficiency . This result was not attained without encountering much opposition , and Mr Kendall 's inflexible honesty in putting an end to the system by which contractors plundered the government , and in resisting dishonest claims , incurred for him the unrelenting hostility of those who suffered by it . To his credit be it said , that when he was compelled by ill health to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he left it poor and // in debt ; nor was he relieved from the pressure of poverty till an interest which he acquired in Professor Morse 's patents amassed for him , towar ( l the close of ' his life , a comfortable fortune . lie has left a full account of the way in which the daily business of his offices was done ; but of ' anything beside , - of the general policy of ' the administration , of contemporary history , or of ' personal reminiscences , - almost nothing . It is almost inconceivable ( or would be to one who had not read General Scott 's Autobiography ) , that a man should live as long as he did in the midst of politics , occupying a prominent office , in the confidence of the President , and in a position to know all that there was to be known in Washington , and yet leave behind no recollections of the eminent men with whom he was in constant contact , nothing which would help us to understand the time ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be sure , a chapter on the removal of ' the deposits , giving Mr. Kendall 's connection with it , and the history of his negotiations with the State banks , but it adds little to our knowledge of ' the question , being largely made up of extracts from " Niles 's Register , " from the 51 ) eeches in Congress and the newspapers . We , who have not grown up to regard the Bank of the United States as a part of ' the Constitution itself can hni'dly understand why the removal of ' the deposits excited such a universal turmoil ; hut if ' the reader is curious enough to look at the printed official journal of the Senate of ' the United States , he will find volume after volume filled with nothing but names signed to petitions for or against this measure , - names , it was said , copied from gravestones in many cases , and amounting in all to nearly one hundred and seventy-five thousand . It is interesting , now that the whole matter is forgotten , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prophecies of the press in the light of subsequent events . As a specimen of ' gloomy prognostication , take this from Mr. Clay : " We behold the usual incidents of approaching tyranny . The land is filled with spies and informers ; and detraction and denunciation are the order of the day . People , especially official incumbents in this place , no longer dare speak in the fearless tones of manly freemen , but in the cautious whispers of ' trembling slaves . The premonitory symptoms of ' despotism are upon us ; and if ' Congress do not apply an instantaneous and effective remedy , the fatal collapse will soon come on , and we shall die , - ignobly die , base , mean , and abject slaves , - the scorn and contempt of mankind , unpitied , unwept , unmourned . " Or this from Mi ' . Webster : " The present is a moment of ' spasm and agony . The whole social and poljtical system is violently convulsed . This , if no relief ' come , must be succeeded by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and labor of the community . This , sir , I think , is the real // prospect before us . " When we read these speeches and the alarming articles in the newspapers which followed them , we are forcibly reminded of the terrible consequences which were to follow the failure of impeachment . Congress did not apply the remedy demanded by Mr. Clay , just as in later times the earth refused in Mr. Boutwell 's favor to forget the laws ' of gravitation , and by a motion which only that savant could imagine , project our second despot into the famous " Hole in the Sky . " And yet the country seems almost as prosperous under the few fragments of the Constitution which yet survive , as it did when that instrument was fresh from the hands of its authors , before the first act of Congress was passed . The alarmists of to-day would do well to compare their prophecies with those of their predecessors , and they who despair of the Republic will perhaps find some consolation in the fact that despair has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government was established , while thus far , certainly , there has been nothing to justify it . We may sit down contentedly , therefore , under the military despotism which our countrymen , with such surprising unanimity , have elected to suffer under for the next four years , in the confident expectation that we shall not , in our time at least , see our country less powerful and happy than it is to-day . It is encouraging , also , to find that while civil-service reform is a comparatively new idea among us , it is not because the service never needed reforming before , but because the people never appreciated the necessity . Thus , in 1815 , we find in Mr. Kendall 's journal , " This day I closed a bargain with Mr. Miller , the postmaster , on the conditions which I had before offered . In consideration of his procuring me to be made his successor immediately , and the use of the small back building called the shop , back of his house , I engage to give him $ 180 for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the office , and to resign in his favor if he shall want the office again for his own use within six years . These terms , I am convinced , would be regarded as degrading , and we mutually agreed that they should be kept secret . I , however , feel , conscious of no moral wrong , and see a prospect of some profit and many conveniences , counterbalanced , perhaps , by the inconveniences attending it . " When these were the sentiments of a reformer , the idea that office is not a property but a trust had obviously small hold among the people . This office , so obtained , he sold for two hundred dollars , and the purchaser sold it for five hundred . These transfers were all effected through the agency of a member of Congress , Colonel R. M. Johnson , afterwards Vice-President , who secured from the President the appointment of the purchasers . In justice to Mr. Kendall , it should be said that he afterwards changed his views in reference to such bargains . // In fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our rogues . Mr. Kendall found the same system of " straw bids " in full operation when he became Postmaster-General that we are told exists to-day . It struck him as remarkable , that while the law required the letting of contracts to the lowest responsible bidder , the important contracts were always obtained by the same men . his eyes were soon opened by a contractor who called upon him and asked whether he intended to secure the contracts to the old and faithful contractors , as his predecessors had done ; and on his saying that he could not see how it was to be done if they were underbid , explained that it was done jby private understandings between the contractors and the department . The modus operandi being explained , he promptly put an end to the system . Even the " Chorpenning claim " is but a servile imitation , and finds its precedent in the case of Stockton and Stokes , mail contractors , to whose credit Mr. Kendall 's predecessor placed one hundred and tw2nty thousand dollars shortly before he resigned . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the extent of one hundred thousand dollars , not including this last allowance , Mr. Kendall suspended it , and , after examination , made the suspension permanent . Pending the investigation , Mrs. Kendall was offered a carriage and pair by Mrs. Stockton , if she would induce her husband to allow the claim , but this argument had no weight with him . The contractors , nothing daunted , induced Congress , without calling for explanation or information from Mr. Kendall , to refer their claims to the Solicitor of the Treasury , who , also without asking for any evidence from the department , allowed , not only all the contractors claimed , but forty thousand dollars more . The original claim Mr. Kendall thereupon paid , but the additional award he refused to pay , until after failing to get a resolution through Congress , the contractors applied to the courts for a mandamus , which was issued , and Mr. Kendall thus forced to pay the balance . Not content with this , the contractors brought a suit against him for damages , and a judgment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pending an appeal to the Supreme Court , he was kept confined for a year to the jail limits of the District of Columbia , under this judgment , where he remained very munch straitened by poverty . Finally Congress interfered for his relief and amended the law relating to imprisonment ; and , public attention being aroused , passed a bill allowing his expenses and counsel fees . The decision of the Supreme Court in Imis favor finally terminated the persecution , but a lesson had bcen taught to honest government officers which apparently they have been slow to forget . // It is comforting to find that , in reference to such matters , public opinion has changed for the better since the days of Jackson . We have forborne to criticise severely the literary merits of Mr. Stickney 's book , for in his Preface he deprecates criticism , and speaks of it as a labor of love . It is not , however , in any proper sense , an autobiography ; but , as we have said , merely a compilation of Mr. Kendall 's writings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correspondence . The editor has not , it seems to us , used his materials with judgment , but has erred both in selection and arrangement . He has given us , perhaps , what we did not want , an accurate idea of Kendall as a man ; but he has not given us what we did want , and what we should naturally expect , such a picture of Kendall 's time as would be a contribution to history ; but for this failure , Mr. Kendall himself is perhaps responsible . The book is very amusing , but if much shorter would have been more valuable .
