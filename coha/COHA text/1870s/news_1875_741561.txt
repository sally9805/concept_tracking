txt It is said by those best informed in regard to the possibilities of legislation , that the only chance for the passage of the Texas and Pacific Railroad bill lies in attaching it to one of the regular appropriation bills as a Senate amendment .. The bill in the : louse is now before the Committee on Pacific Railroads , and not yet agreed to , although the friends of the bill claim that the vote in the committee will be 7 to 5 in its favor . It is rot likely that the committee will have an opportamty to make any report this session , sines. its turn to be called will not probably be reached If the committee should be called and should make a favorable retort as the bill , as it . proposes to appropriate the credit of the Government a single objection will carry it to the Committee of the Whole . It will there lie at the bottom of a great pile of hills carried to the committee on the . same point . and it could not during this session @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a two-thirds vote of the House , which even Mr. Scott can hardly have the confidence to expect . ' I he Senate , then , must be held responsible for the enactment of the bill , should it be enacted , and for the irregular and improper manner of its passage . If the Senate should take up the bill as an independent measure ' and pass it , and send it to the House , a point of order would still take it to the Committee of the Whole , where it would be in the same position as if reported by the House Committee on Railroads . The opponents of the bill , after examining all the grounds carefully ' , are convinced that no possible means can secure the enactment of the bill without its passage by the Senate as an amendment to an appropriation hill . Such action will be a vere grave proeoedMg for the Republican majority , and it seems incredible to suppose that a discussion of it will ever be tolerated . If it should be moved as an amendment , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order , and the Senate can kill it immediately and absolutely , without a word of comment or discussion . They ought to know enough about it to do this , without taking any time for debate . But if the bill should fairly get before the Senate for discussion , the earnest and courageous opposition of two or three Senators , or even one Senator , would force the majority to vote it out or to accept the responsibility for an extra session . would certainly require some courage for one Senator alone , and less courage for several Senatom together , to pursue this course , but in the end they would probably find that the country would stand by them and applaud and reward their action . WHY THE BILL SIMULD BE KILLED AT ONCE . A former statement of what Mr. Thomas A. Scott wishes Congress to grant to secure the construction of the Texas route to the Paoiflo may not have been exactly correct in all its details , but it made the Southern Railroad TfiN5 ( as his admirers call him ) show his hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the National Treasury responsible for . He did not , however , explain why he has undertaken to have this road constructed by a company , on the Credit Mobilier plan . for about one-fourth more than should be paid . Nor has he , in any of his statements that have met the eye of your correspondent . shown who  --  in Congress and out of Congress  --  are members of his " construction company , " which he admits is entitled to certain bonds and stock , and to which the bonds which he asks the United States to indorse would probably be handed when issued . Mr. Scott has stated that a part of the bonds to which this construction company is " entitled ' have been already " pledged as security . " Security for ' what ? Simply for part of the money expended by the company in constructing and equipping the road in Texas , or for money to pay for certain shares in the company . which was borrowed of national banks in the Scott-Cameron interest . These shares , thus paid for , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do the most rood . " as Oakes Ames would have said , and if they were , their holders are now in position to realize lissom ' as the interest on the bonds can be guaranteed . A list of those who hold stock in this " construction company " should be at once called for by those before whom Mr. Scott is pleading , that Senators and Representatives may know who they are asked to legislate for the relief of . It may be sail that this " construction company " is a private association . But if it should appear that its members organized it as the Credit Mobilier was organized , receiving from Mr. Scott land-grant bonds where Mr. Ames paid dividends , the public and Congress have a right to know who were the lucky recipients . Then there are the remnants of Fremout 's Memphis end El Paso Railroad securities , which were lavishly distributed here , and which are now nominally worthless . But it is understood that there are certain bargains and contracts on record which will enable some of the holders of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their share of the Scott guaranteed bonds . It would be pleasant for the public to ktiow what foundation there is for this rumor , and , if it be true , who are the favored ones . Could not Mr. Scott% leading agent , Gen. Dodge , enlighten us on Ors missing corporation , and tell us who holds its bonds ? Another rumor concerning Mr. Scott 's application is that the ostensible opposition of the Central Pacific Railroad of California is only a ' Maid , and that rentents cordials exists between King Huntington of the Pacific Coast and King Scott of the South . Each is fizhting it oat on his own line , and when the proper time arrives there will be union to secure victory . An exhibit of what the owners of the Central Peale Road have actually made , directly and indirectly . upon their investments in its stock , would add to the desired information . And it might also be well to ascertain whether there have been any bargains concerning a division of future apo:ls between the Texas Pacific and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?
