txt One subject , at least . which has engaged the attention of Congress and disturbed the entire country since the that of last DeeeMber , is now settled until the opening of another session . The President has signed the Finance bill , and it has become a law . The feature of most importance in the new law is the definition of the legal amount of greenbacks at ? 3a2,00000 , and the absolute prohibition of what Messrs . R/CHARDSON and BOUTWELL used curiously enough to call a " reserve . " The country now knows how much the legal-tender currency is , and that it can not be made more or less by any action of the Treasury Department until further legislation . Tiiis is , so far , good , since it removes an element of very great micertainty from business calculations , and takes out of the hands of the Secretary of the Treasury a power that no official ought ever to have enjoyed . The . legislation abolishing reserves of national banks against circulation , and touching the redemption of bank notes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say with any confidence what its effect will be . At present , however , the effect must be comparatively slight , and the country will experience . an immediate sense of relief that at last the finances are out of the hands of Congress . The prompt advance in the price of stocks yesterday indicates this fact . We look forward to a revival of business , which , if it does not make itself felt during the Summer , may reasonably be expected to do eo early in the Autumn . The situation is not , however , without uncertainties , and while prudent energy iu all legitimate business is likely to have its reward , speculative ventures will be attended with more than usual dangers . Another matter , concerning which newspaper readers have heard a good deal , and which is of much national importance , has received partial settlement . The Conference Committee on the Geneva Award bill yesterday made a report to the House , which was adopted without a division . It was alleged by Gen. BUTLER that it provided for the immediate disposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies and the owners of claims for war premiums to apply for further legislation at the next session of Congress . What the bill actually does , and what the country may well be rejoiced at , is this : It provides for the speedy payment of a certain ntunber of extremely urgent claims , concerning which there is no doubt , and it rules out for the present the absurd notion that all losses , from all cruisers , ' whether or not Great Britain Was held responsible for their operations , may be paid out of the award . But so far as it denies to the insurance companies , and especially to the mutual companies , a hearing for the entire amount of their claims and a proportionate share in the award for such claims as are allowed , it is grossly unjust and oppressive . So far , also , as it leaves in the hands of Congress a fund from which to feed the war-premium ring , of which Mr. BUTLER is the Special champion , it is indefensible , and we shall only have , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have already witnessed . It is alleged , moreover , by so good lawyers as Judge POLAND and Mr. TRRMAIN , that the bill is a trick to bar the claims of insurers altogether , except as they are provided for in the bill . As that provision is entirely unfair and inadequate , this allegation is a serious one . It is opposed only by the word of Mr. BUTLER , which , we need hardly say , is worthless . Both Houses of Congress are still in- session as we write , awaiting reports from the Conference Committees on four important bills the Sundry Civil Appropriation bill , ( generally known as " the Omnibus , " ) the Post Office Appropriation bill , the Tariff Bill , and the River and Harbor Appropriation Tho tedium of this interval was relieved in the Senate by the submission of au historical essay by Mr. CARPENTER on the curiosities of the contingent fund , embodied in a report on the important question whether correspondents in the Senate Gallery should be allowed V ) worth of stationery per annum . The report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that the Senate in 1809 paid for zuadeira and cognac with which to offer proper respect to the memory of a dead Senator . One might suppose that the Senate appointed a committee to hold a " wake " over the remains , and these items of funeral libations appear very curious to the critics of our day . On the Post Office bill , the bone of contention was not so much the left-handed resumption of the franking privilege , put in by the Senate , and rejected by a close vote in the House , but the action of the House in fixing reasonable rates fur newspaper postage . Both branches of Congress seem tolerably willing to furnish the community , at its own expense , the valuable publicat ma known as the . Congressional Record , made up in great part of reporte of speeches never delivered , and they are willing to lot the country weeklies go through the mails for nothing ; but Senators especially are dreadfully sensitive about the revenues when it is a question of carrying daily newspapers to regular subscribers.at moderate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we take it , that amendments to it shall not include the absurd tax on the sales of securities and gold . This the Senate voted down without discussion , and tile House will hardly insist upon it , since it was thrown into the bill in the first instance with almost no discussion . Our grain growers and grain dealers will be glad to know that the bags their grain is sent out in , are not to pay a Customs duty before they can be brought back . The Senate insists on low duties on still wines ; refuses to increase the duty on hops , and agrees to put quicksilver on the free list . It is just to Congress to call attention to the testimony of our correspondent that the closing hours of the session have been remarkably ? almost wholly , in fact  --  free feeni jobbery . And we do this the more readily because we have felt it our duty to criticise with severity sonic of its acts .               @ @ @ @ @ @
