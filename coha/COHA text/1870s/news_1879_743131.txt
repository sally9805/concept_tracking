txt When the court at Owenton , Ky. , was notified this morn ? iug that the jury in the Buford case were ready to make their report , the bell was rung , and the Court-house was speedily filled with people . Buford was brought into the court-room , and took his seat without betraying the least interest in the proceedings . In response to the usual question from Judge , Foreman Steel said that the jury had reached an agreement and handed the clerk a paper , on which was written : " We , the jury , find the defendant , Thomas Buford , guilty of willful murder as charged in the indictment , and fix his punishment at imprisonment for life in the State Prison at Frankfort . " The jury was polled , each man agreeing to the verdict as read . There was no demonstration in the audience , and the prisoner was as impassive as ever . Not a muscle quivered or feature changed as the report was read . His counsel moved an arrest of judgment and a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overruled . This takes the case to the Court of Appeals , the court to which Buford 's victim , Judge Elliott , belonged . It is said that the Judges of that court will refuse to sit in the case , and the Governor will have to appoint a court pro tem. to hear the appeal . The court will not meet until September . The effort to procure anew trial will be a strong one , and there is some probability that it may be granted on the ground that the Special Term at which Buford was indicted was called for and begun within a term fixed by law for another county , although the court in that county had adjourned . The verdict meets with general approval , but those familiar with the criminal law system of Kentucky do not apprehend that Buford will spend his life in the Penitentiary.
