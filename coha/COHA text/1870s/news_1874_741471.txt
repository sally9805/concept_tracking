txt An interesting article in the latest number of Old and . New deals with the much agitated questions of the independence of the voter , " party treason " and " civic duty . " The writer takes the leaders of the dominant political parties to task . for the military discipline which they exercise over voters , and expresses his belief that the principal means of political-reform is the assertion by every citizen of his absolute independence of his own party . He sums up the whole duty of the citizen something in this wise : 1 . Join yourself to that one of the two parties which seems to hold more nearly your views upon pressing questions than the other , and support its men and its measures . 2 . In any case vote . The writer insists upon this as the ? . citizen 's highest duty , whatever happens . 3 : Make a personal scrutiny of all candidates " as if upon you rested the ultimate responsibility for their election or rejection . " He considers scratching a ticket one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practice , which he asserts is common , of the use at the polls of printed tickets , containing the names of a party 's candidates , so arranged as to prevent alteration by any voter who thinks for himself . 4 . When the candidates of both parties are unworthy , cast an independent vote for a worthy man . This is good advice , although it is not particularly new , and has been given hundreds of times by " political editors , " who are , nevertheless , denounced as a class by the whiter of the article as the most vigorous supporters of the odious features of party discipline . The independence of the bettet kind of newspapers is already a well-established fact , and there is no occasion for the remark that their editors would stand aghast at the proposition that " there is not , nor of right ought there to be , such a thing as allegiance to any party . " No intelligent observer of politics believes that there should be blind and unwavering allegiance to party measures , whether they be wise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he feel cause for alarm in the fact that party leaders are allowed regularly to make organized effort for a fair discipline of forces with which to fight the enemy . No one can doubt that there is necessity for some kind of discipline ; neither can any one disbelieve that if that discipline be harsh , arbitrary , and bigoted , the results will be bad . A party is something more than the writer in Old and i'Vew would have it appear that it should he , namely ? " A momentary association of individuals who agree upon a transient political purpose . " Tho great parties in this country have been founded for something . more definite than the accomplishment of transient purposes , and they have not been in any sense momentary associations . They have sometimes been corrupt ; they have been guilty of intolerance ; their leaders have perverted the proper uses of discipline , and the tyrannical authority of conventions and caucuses has often proved mischievous . But it is idle to deny that discipline is necessary , eimply because it has now and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finds that there is nothing to justify the close ' analogy ( which it is customary to insist upon ) between political and military campaigns . He objects to what ho considers the compelling " of thousands of intelligent citizens into the unconscious belief that they are , in some proper sense , mere privates in a great army . " He forgets that they are not called upon to enlist under a banner without knowing what that banner represents ; and that they have their own moral cowardice to blame , if , having voluntarily enlisted with the understanding that their leaders shall carry out the plans of campaign which they make for them , they do not insist upon holding those leaders to their promise . He is so intent upon having each voter preserve his independence , that he is anxious to have him ? - fight " on his own hook , " totally disregarding all the good effects of that organization which is quite as necessary in combats with ballots and opinion as with bullets and artillery . The writer points out as " the essence and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " of a candidate or the scratching of a ticket , acts which , he says , " are denounced ' by politicians as the most heinous of crimes . " There is no doubt that they are occasionally so denounced ; but the denunciation usually proceeds from some corrupt candidates who have been scratched , or from a few of their friends , and is not dangerous . The mere bolting from an improper candidate does not destroy allegiance to party , nor render the necessity of future allegiance , in a , proper sense , any less desirable and necessary than before . Community of opinion , the writer states , constitutes a party ; and hence he concludes that in a true party , there can be nothing but amicable consultation and . co-operation . But the moment such measures as compulsory cooperation , and the punishment of dissent are resorted to , they " tend , " to quote his words , " at once to dissolve the bond of chemical affinity which has hitherto combined the individuals , and to substitute for it a mechanical control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vital breath of a party .
