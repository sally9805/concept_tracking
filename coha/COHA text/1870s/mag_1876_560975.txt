OLD WOMAN 'S GOSSIP . XIV . JAMES STREET , BUCKINGRAM GATE , May 2d. $ M* DEAREST H- : I received your kind letter the other night ( that is , morning ) on my return from a ball , and read your reflections on dissipation with an attention heightened by the appropriate comment of a bad headache and abject weariness from top to toe with dancing . The way in which people prosecute their pleasures in this good town of London is certainly amaEing ; and we are ( perforce ) models of moderation , compared with most of our acquaintance . I met at that very ball persons who had been to one and two parties previously , and were leaving that dance to hurry to another . Independently of the great fatigue of such a life , it seems to me so strange that when people are enjoying themselves to their hearts ' content in one place , they can not be satisfied to remain there until they wish to return home , but spend half the night in the streets , running from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and wasting the precious time when they might be DANCING . You see my folly is not so great but that I have philosophy to spare for my neighbors . Let me tell you again , dear H- , how truly I rejoice in your niece s restored health . I can not conceive anything more interesting than the sources of enjoyment which must at every moment present themselves in a young existence whose powers of pleasure have been suspended for so long a time . The spring , too , is the very time for such a resurrection , when every day and every hour , every cloud and every flower , offer inexhaustible matter for the capabilities of delight thus regained . Indeed , " the drops on the trees are the most beautiful of all ! " E- T- 's exclamation during one of her first drives after the long imprisonment of her nervous maladyg A wonderful feeling of renewed hope seems to fill the heart of all created things in the spring , and even here in this smoky town it finds its way to us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streets , and all things unlovely and unnatural . I stood yesterday in the little court behind our house , where two unhappy poplars and a sycamore-tree were shaking their leaves as if in surprise at the acquisition and to make sure they had them , and looked up to the small bit of blue sky above them with pleasurable spring tears in my eyes . How I wish I were rich and could afford to be out of town now ! I always dislike London , and this lovely weather gives me a sort of mal du pays for the country . My dearest H- , you must not dream of leaving Ardgillan just when lam coming to see you ; that would be indeed a disappointment . My father is not at home at this moment , but I shall ask him before I close this letter the exact time when we shall be in Dublin . 1 look forward with much pleasure to making my aunt Dall known to you . She is , I am happy to say , coming with me , for indeed she is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often heard me speak of her , but it is difficult for words to do justice to one whose whole life is an uninterrupted stream of usefulness , goodness , and patient devotion to others . I know but one term that , as the old writers say , " delivers * her fully , and though it is not unfrequently applied , I think she is the only person I know who really deserves it ; she is absolutely unselfish . Old maids are vulgarly taxed with sourness and discontent . I know nothing of the justice of such a charge . It may be founded in more general observation than mine , but if it were true as a rule ( of which I have only seen the exception ) , something of it must surely be attributed to a forlorn and isolated position ; and the consciousness of the stigma absurdly affixed to their condition in itself must tend to make them 330 September , // techy and nervously sensitive to the undeserved ridicule attaching to them . I wonder if this contempt for old maids is of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bearing children as a woman 's reproach being taken from her ; and the ladies who have children are invariably so impertinent to those who have not . The importance of the tribe depending upon its numbers , I suppose the mother of men was naturally held in honor ; but among many nations vowed virginity has been honored above maternity . In any case , I do not see why we English are always to speak of old maids with a sneer ; and when to the disconsolate prospect of an uncompanioned life and solitary age is added the melancholy retrospect of a disastrous early attachlnent ( as is often the case ) , there is something in the name of " old maid " which seems to me to command both respect and commiseration . Perhaps it is a sort of presentiment that I shall one day be hailed by the title myself that inclines me to be civil to it ; but my experience of the species , instead of suggesting the usual train of worries , fid0ets , fusses , and unatniable peculiarities generally conjured up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ image of the kindest soul and cheerfulest good human being that ever dedicated her life to the comfort and happiness of those around her . I am sure , dear H- , you will excuse this panegyric , though you do not know how well it is deserved ; the proof of its being so is that there is not one of us but would say the same of aunt Dall . My father 's benefit took place last Wednesday , when I acted Isabella ; the house was crowded and the play very successful ; I think I played it well , and I take credit to myself for so doing , for I dislike both play and part extremely . The worst thing I do in it is the soliloquy when I am about to stab Biron , and the best , my death . My dresses were very beautiful , and I am exceedingly glad the whole thing is over . I suppose it will be my last new part this season . I am reading with great pleasure a purified edition , just published , of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my ignorance of the original plays will enable me to judge , seems very well executed , and I owe the editor many thanks for some happy hours spent with his book . I have just heard something which annoys me not a little : I am to prepare to act Mrs. Haller . I know very well that nobody was ever at liberty in this world to do what they liked and that only ; but when I know with what task-like feeling I set about most of my work , I am both amused and provoked when people ask mc if I do not delight in acting . I have not an idea what to do with that part ; however , I must apply myself to it , and try ; such mawkish sentiment and such prosaic , commonplace language seem to me alike difficult to feel and to deliver . My dear H- , I shall be in Ireland the whole month of July . I am coming first to Dublin , and shall afterwards go to Cork . You really must not be away when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come , which is good Irish , is n't it ? I do not feel as you do , at all , about the sea . Instead of depressing my spirits , it always raises them ; it seems to inc as if the vast power of the great element communicated itself to me . I feel strong , as I run by the side of the big waves , with something of their strength , and the *ame species of wild excitement which thunder and lightning produce in me always affects me by the sea-shore . I never saw the sea but once violently a& itated , and then I was so well pleased with its appearance that I took a boat and went out into the bustle , singin * with all my might , which was the only vent I could find for my high spirits ; it is true that I returned in much humiliation , very seasick , after a very short " triumph of Galatea , " indeed . You ask me in one of your last why I do not send you verses any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I still write any . So here I send you some which I improvised the other day in your honor , and which , written hurriedly as they were , will not , I think , stand the test of any very severe criticism : - Wheneer I recollect the happy time When you and I held converse sweet together , 1816. 331 // There come a thousand thoughts of sunny weather , Of early hiossoms , and the young year 's prime . Your memory lives forever in my mind , With all the fragrant freshness of the spring , With odorous lime and silver hawthorn twined , And mossy rest and woodland wandering . There s not a thought of you but brings along Some sunny glimpse of river , field , and sky ; Your voice sets words to the sweet blackhird 's song , And many a snatch of wild old melody And as I date it still our love arose Twixt the last violet and the earliest rose . I never go anywhere without a book wherein I may scratch my valuable ideas , and therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I take great delight in writing , and write less incorrectly than I used to do . I have not time now to go on with this letter , and as I am anxious you should know when to expect us , I shall not defer it in the hope of making it more amusing , though I fear it is rather dull . But you will not mind that , and will believe me ever your affectionate FANNY KEMBLE . The arrangement of Massinger for the family library by my friend the Reverend Alexander Dyce , the learned Shakespearean editor and commentator , was my first introduction to that mine of dramatic wealth which enriched the literature of England in the reigns of Elizabeth and Jalnes the First , and culminated in the genius of Shakespeare . It is by comparison with them , his contemporaries , that we arrive at a just estimate of his supremacy ; the extraordinary vigor and force and almost total absence of grace and beauty of their writings , viewed with reference to his , suggest the idea of the hu0e Titanic Torso @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some years ago , there appeared in the Revue des Deux Mondes ( I rather think from the pen of M. Montegut ) a very poetical and ingenious paper on the subject of Shakespeare , his predecessors and contemporaries . The whole article , more like a German than a French one in the thorough acquaintance it displayed with the early literature of the English stage , was full of fine and just discrimination and appreciation of the particular genius of the several members of the remarkable company of playwrights of which September , Shakespeare was the preeminent head , and ended with a comparison of them all to the dramatis personce of his Tempest and of himself to Prospero , which was full of critical jud0ment , taste , and imagination . I was so enchanted with these plays of Massinger 's , but more especially with the one called The Maid of Honor , that I never rested till I had obtained from the management its revival on the stage . The part of Camiola is the only one tllat I ever selected for myself . The Maid of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attract audiences . Though less defective than most of the contemporaneous dramatic compositions , the play was still too deficient in interest to retain the favor of the public . The character of Camiola is extremely noble and striking , but , that of her lover so unworthy of her that the interest she excites personally fails to inspire one with sympathy for her passion for him . The piece in this respect has a sort of moral incoherency , which appears to me , indeed , not an infrequent defect in the compositions of these great dramatic pre-Shakespearites . There is a want of psychical verisimilitude , a disjointed abruptness , in their conceptions , which , in spite of their grand treatment of separate characters and the striking force of particular passages , renders almost every one of their plays inharmonious as a whole , however flue and powerful in detached parts . Their selection of abnormal and detestable subjects is a distinct indication of intellectual weakness instead of vigor ; supreme genius alone perceives the beauty and dignity of human nature and human life in their common conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every-day existence the hidden glory that lies beneath it . The strictures contained in these girlish letters on the various plays in which I was called to perform the heroines , of course partake of the uncompromising nature of all youthful verdicts . Hard , sharp , and shallow , they never went lower than the obvious surface of things , and dealt easily , after the undoubtiun youthful fashion , with a main result , without Old Woman 's Gossip . // any misgiving as to conflicting causes or painful anxiety about contradictory component parts . At the beginning of life , the ignorant moral and intellectual standard alike have definite form and decided color ; time , as it goes on , dissolves the outline into vague indistinctness , and reveals lights and shades so various and innumerable , that towards the end of life criticism grows diffident , opinion difficult , and positive judgment almost impossible . My first London season was now drawing to an end , and preparations were begun for a summer tour in the provinces . There had been some talk of my beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell through . I do not suppose the fact of my father 's hearing that Captain C had made interest with the manager to be allowed to act with me had anything to do with his decision not to go there , as of course no such arrangement could have been fulfilled without our agreement to it , which was impossible ; so I am afraid the gentleman amateur was disappointed and annoyed . Captain C- , of my acquaintance with whom I have spoken elsewhere , was passionately fond of the theatre , and one of the best amateur actors I have ever seen . He was at one time attached to the English embassy in Florence , while Lord N- was our ambassador there , and the diplomatic duties of these gentlemen , in those good , easy , unpolitical times , were quite secondary in importance with them , I imagine , to the theatrical representations which were the principal occupation and interest of the British representative and his staff . Of one of these amateur performances I remember Captain C- giving me a most ludicrous account . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ N ( the diplomatists were heroic in their games ) , and during their final deadly encounter in the last scene , his excellency kept calling to him in a frenzied half-whisper , " Fight round ! fight round , will you ! that they the audience may see my face ! " That was very like the real thing for an amateur . I used to think that my friend C- had occasionally the tone of a disappointed man , who attributed his want of success to want of zeal on the part of his friends or active disservice on that of his enemies ; I wonder if he ever attributed his not achieving an ambassadorship to the grudge of Lord N- and his underhand influence , in consequence of his not having " fought round* ' and allowed him to " show his face* ' properly to his Florentine spectators . BATH , May 31 , 1830 . M* DEAR H- : I have owed you an answer , and a most grateful one , for some time past , for your kindness in writing me so long a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , what with leavetaking , trying on dresses , making purchases , etc. , etc. , and all the preparations for our summer tour , this is the first moment in which I have been able to draw a long breath for the last month , I am sure you will forgive me , and believe , notwithstanding my long silence , that I was made very happy indeed by your letter . Do you know , when first I opened it I was so surprised and pleased at seeing another sheet within the first , that after my first movement of delight a second thought crossed my mind , that it must be an extract or a copy from something ; not that I thought you incapable of inditing so much original matter , but it was so long since I had received such a full-grown epistle from you that I imagined it was " too good to be true . " All this tumbled into my head while I opened your letter , and may serve as some confirmation of what I often tell you , that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dear London audience farewell on Friday last , when I acted Lady Towaley for the first time . The house was crammed , and as the proprietors had fixed that night for a second benefit which they gave me , I was very glad that it was so . I was very nicely dressed , and to my own fancy acted well , though I dare say my performance was a little fiat occasionally . But considering my own physical powers , and the immense size of the theatre , I do not think I should have done better on the whole by acting more broadly ; 1876. 333 // though I suppose it would have been more effective , I should have had to sacrifice something of repose and refinement to make it so . I was very sorry to leave my London audience ; they welcomed my first appearance , they knew the history of our shipwrecked fortunes , and though perhaps not one individual amongst them would go a mile out of his way to serve us , there exists in them , taken collectively , a kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good-will towards me , which I do not hope to find elsewhere . I like Bath very much ; I have not been here since I was six years old , when I spent a year here in hopes of being bettered by my aunt , Mrs. Twiss . A most forlorn hope it was . I suppose in human annals there never existed a more troublesome little brat than I was for the few years after my first appearance on this earthly sta* , e . This town reminds me a little of Edinburgh ; it has the same broad , fine streets and stone houses , and occasional glimpses through them of charming country , but it has not the mountains nor the glorious sea . How glad I shall be to see Edinburgh once more ! I expect much pleasure , too , from the pleasure of my aunt Dali , who some years ago spent some very happy time in Edinburgh , and who loves it from association . And then , dear H , I am looking forward to seeing you once more ; I shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 have had my first rehearsal here this morning , Romeo and Juliet ; the theatre is much smaller than Covent Garden , which rather inconveniences me , as a novelty , but the audience will certainly benefit by it . My fellow - laborers amuse me a good deal ; their versions of Shakespeare are very droll . I wonder what your Irish ones will be . I am fortunate in my Romeo , inasmuch as he is one of my cousins ; he has the family voice and manner very strongly , and at any rate does not murder the text of Shakespeare . I have no more time to spare now , for I must get my tea and go to the theatre . I must tell you , though , of an instance of provincial prudery ( delicacy , I suppose I ought to call iQ which edified us not a little at rehearsal this morning : the Mercutio , on seeing the nurse and Peter , called out , " A sail , a sail ! ** and terminated the speech in a significant whisper , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with me on the stage , very innocently asked , " Oh , does the gentleman leave out the shirt and the smock ? " upon which we were informed that " body linen " was not so much as to be hinted at before a truly refined Bath audience . How particular we are growing - in word ! I am much afraid my father will shock them with the speech of that scamp Mercutio in all its pristine purity and precision . Good-by dear H- . Ever your affectionate F. A. K. P. 5 . My mother desires to be particularly remembered to you . I want to revive Massinger 's Maid of Honor ; I want to act Camiola . The necessity for carrying with us into the provinces a sufficient number of various parts , and especially of plays in which my father and myself could fill the principal characters , and so be tolerably independent of incompetent coadjutors , was the reason of my coming out in the play of The Provoked Husband , before leaving London . The passage in this letter about Lady Towuley sufficiently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and how absolutely in the dark I was with regard to the real style in which the part should be played . The fine lady of my day , with the unruffled insipidity of her low spirits ( high spirits never came near her ) and the imperturbable composure of her smooth insolence , was as unlike the rantipole , racketing high - bred woman of fashion of Sir John Vaubrugh 's play as the flimsy elegance of my silver - embroidered , rose - colored tulle dress was unlike the elaborate splendor of her hooped and feathered and high-l**eled , patched - and - powdered magnificence , with its falling laces and standing brocades . The part of Lady Townlcy was not only beyond my powers , but has never been seen on the EnglLh stage since the days of Mrs. Abigdon and Miss // Farren , the latter elegant and spirited actress being held by those who had seen both less like the original great lady than her predecessor ; while even the Th&amp; fltre Fran*ais , where consummate study and reverend tradition of elder art still prevail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grande manure in a gradual descent from the grande dame of Mademoiselle Contat to the pretty , graceful femme comme ii faut of Mademoiselle Plessis ; for even the exquisite C*limbne of Mademoiselle Mars was but a " pale reflex " of Moli*re 's brilliant coquette , as played by her great instructress , Contat . The truth is , that society no lon0-er possesses or produces that creature , and a good deal of reading , not of a usual or agreeable kind , would alone make one familiar enough with Lady Townley and her like to enable an actress of the present day to represent her with any verisimilitude . The absurd practice , too , of dressing all the serious characters of the piece in modern costume , and all the comic ones in that of the time at which it was written , renders the whole ridiculously incoherent and manifestly impossible , and destroys it as a picture of the manners of any time ; for even stripped of her hoop and powder , and her more flagrant coarsenesses of speech , Lady Townlcy is still as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any modern lady , as she is unlike the woman of fashion of Hogarth 's time , whose costume she has discarded . The event fully justified my expectation of far less friendly audiences out of London than those I had hitherto made my appeals to . None of the personal interest that was felt for me there existed elsewhere , and I had to encounter the usual opposition , always prepared to cavil , in the provinces , at the metropolitan verdict of merit , as a mere exhibition of independent judgment , and tomake good to the expectations of the country critics the highly laudatory reports of the London press , by which the provincial judges scorned to have a decision imposed upon them . Not unnaturally , therefore , I found a much less fervid enthusiasm in my audiences - who were , I dare say , quite justified in their disappointment - and a far less eulogistic tone in the provincial press with regard to my performances . Our houses , however , were always very crowded , which was the essential point , and for my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applause which were bestoWed on me . My cousin , John Mason , was the Romeo to whom I have referred in this letter . He was my father 's sister 's son , and , like so many members of our family , he and one of his brothers and his sister had made the stage their profession . He had some favorable physical qualifications for it a rather striking face , handsome figure , good voice , and plenty of fire and energy ; he was tolerably clever and well-informed , but without either imagination or refinement . My father , who thought there was the making of a good actor in him , was extremely kind to him , and for several years he was on terms of friendly familiarity with us , and we saw him constantly both on and off the stage . GLASGOW , Monday , June 28 , 1830 . M* DEAR MRS . JAMESON , - I believe that you will have felt too well convinced that I had not had a moment to spare , to be surprised at my not having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incessant occupation of my time would so long have prevented me from doing so , but I embrace the opportunity which the king 's death affords me of telling you how much obliged to you I was for writing to me , and writing as you did . I have little news to return you but what concerns myself , but I shall make no coquettish excuses about that , for I really believe t is the subject that will interest you most of any I could find . First , then , I am very well , rather tired , and sitting at an inn window , in a dull , dark , handsome square in Glas* , ow . My fortnight in Edinburgh is over , and a short fortnight it has been , what with rehearsals , riding , sitting for my bust , and acting . The few hurried glimpses I have caught of my friends have been like dreams , and now that I have parted from them , no more to meet them there certainly , 1876. 335 // the whole seems to me like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughts , hardly believing it , that the next time that I visit Edinburgh I shall not find the dear companionship of my cousins nor the fond affection of Mrs. Henry Siddons . This will be a severe loss tome ; Edinbutgh will , I fear , be without its greatest charm , and it will remain to be proved whether these lovely scenes that I have so admired and delighted in owed all their incomparable fascination to their intrinsic beauty , or to that most pleasurable frame of mind I enjoyed at the same time , the consciousness of the kind regard of the excellent human beings among whom I lived . You will naturally expect me to say something of my theatrical experiences in the modern Athens . Our houses have been very fine , our audiences ( as is their national nature ) very cold ; but upon the whole I believe they were well pleased with us , notwithstanding the damping influence of the newspapers , which have one and all becn unfavorable to me . The death-like stillness of the audience , as it afforded me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; which , I think I need not tell you , the newspaper criticisms did not . I was surprised , in reading them , to find how very generally their strictures were confined to my external disadvantages , - my diminutive stature and defective features ; and that these far-famed northern critics discussed these rather than what I should have expected them to bestow their consideration upon , the dramatic artist 's conception of character , and his ( or her ) execution of that conception . But had their verdicts been still more severe , I have a sufficient consolation in two notes of Sir Walter Scott 's , written to the editor of one of the papers , Ballantyne , his own particular friend , which the latter sent me , and where he hears such testimony to my exertions as I do not care to transcribe , for fear my cheeks should reflect a lasting blush on my paper , but which I keep as a treasure and shall certainly show you with pride and pleasure when we meet . Among the delightful occurrences of September , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scott . I was wonderfully happy . To whom , since Shakespeare , does the reading world owe so many hours of perfect , peaceful pleasure , of blessed forgetfulness of all things miserable and mean in its daily life ? The party was a small but interesting one : Sir Walter and his daughter Anne , his old friend Sir Adam Fergusson and Lady Fer , , usson , and Miss Ferrier , the authoress of Marriage , and Inheritance , with both which capital books I hope , for your own sake , you are acquainted . Sir Walter was most delightful , and I even forgot all awful sense of his celebrity in his kind , cordial , and almost affectionate manner towards me . He is exceedingly like all the engravings , pictures , and busts of him with which one is familiar , and it seems stran , , e that so varied and noble an intellect should be expressed in the features of a shrewd , kindly , but not otherwise striking countenance . He told me several things that interested me very much ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after much searching , the regalia of Scotland was found locked up in a room in Edinburgh Castle , where , as he said , the dust of centuries had accumulated upon it , and where the ashes of fires lit more than two hundred years before were still lying in the grate . He told me a story that made me cry , of a poor old lady upwards of eighty years of age , who belonged to one of the great Jacobite families , - she was a Maxwell , - sending to him at the time the Scottish crown was found , to implore permission to see it but for one instant ; which ( although in every other case the same petition had been refused ) was granted to her in consideration of her great age and the vital importance she seemed to attach to it . I never shall forget his describing her when first she saw it , appearin* , for a moment petrified at sight of it , and then tottering forward and falling down on her knees , and weeping and wailing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if it had been the dead body of her child . Sir Adam Fergusson is a delightful Old Woman 's Gossip . // person , whose quick , bustlin0 manner forms a striking contrast to Walter Scott 's quiet tone of voice and deliberate enunciation . I have also made acquaintance with Jeffrey , who came and called upon us the other morning , and , I hear , like other of his fellow-townsmen , complains piteously that I am not prettier . Indeed , I am very sorry for it , and I heartily wish I were ; but I did not think him handsome either , and I wonder why he is not handsomer ? though I do n't care so much about his want of beauty as he seems to do about mine . But I am running on at a tremendous rate , and quite forget that I have traveled upwards of forty miles to-day , and that I promised my mother , whenever I could , to go to bed early . Good-by , my dear Mrs. Jameson . I hope you will be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am yours affectionately , F. A. KEMBLE . Of the proverbial frigidity of the Edinburgh public I had been forewarned , and of its probably disheartening effect upon myself . Mrs. Harry Siddons had often told me of the intolerable sense of depression with which it affected Mrs. Siddons , who , she said , after some of her grandest outbursts of passion , to which not a single expression of applause or sympathy had responded , exhausted and breathless with the effort she had made , would pant out in despair , under her breath , " Stupid people , stupid people ! * ' Stupid , however , they undoubtedly were not , though , as undoubtedly , their want of excitability and demonstrativeness diminished their own pleasure by communicating itself to the great actress and partially paralyzing her powers . The story was often told me by my Edinburgh friends , when I complained of their distressing coldness as an audience , how one night , after one of Mrs. Siddons 's greatest exhibitions of power and pathos , the dead silence of the house was broken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a single voice oracularly pronouncing , " That 's no bad ! " which , like the string of a shower-bath , pulled down at once a perfect tempest of ap plause from the apparently insensible public . That this habitual reserve sometimes gave way to very violent exhibitions of enthusiasm , the more fervent from its general repression , there is no doubt ; and I think it was in Edinburgh that my friend , Mr. Harness , told me the whole of the sleep-walking scene in Macbeth had once been so vehemently encored that my aunt was literally obliged to go over it a second time , before the piece was allowed to proceed . Scott 's opinion of my acting , which would , of course , have been very valuable to me , let it have been what it would , was written to his friend and editor ( elieu ! ) , Ballantyne , who was also the editor of one of the principal Edinburgh papers , in which unfavorable criticisms of my performances had appeared , and in opposition to which Sir Walter Scott told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his part he had seen nothing so good since Mrs. Siddons . This encouraging verdict was courteously forwarded to me by Mr. Ballantyne himself , who said he was sure I would like to possess it . The first time I ever saw Walter Scott , my father and myself were riding slowly down Princes Street , up which Scott was walking ; he stopped my father 's horse , which was near the pavement , and desired to be introduced to me . Then followed a string of cordial invitations which previous engagemeats and our work at the theatre forbade our accepting , all but the pressing one with which he wound up , that we would at least come and breakfast with him . The first words he addressed to me as I entered the room were , " You appear to be a very good horsewoman , which is a great merit in the eyes of an old border-man . " Every r in which sentence was rolled into a combination of double u and double r by his border burr , which made it memorable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ previous acquaintance with Miss Ferrier 's admirable novels would have made me very glad of the opportunity of meeting her , and I should have thought Sir Adam Fergusson delightfully entertaining , but that I could not bear 1876. 33T // to lose , while listening to any one else , a single word spoken by Walter Scott . I never can forget , however , the description Sir Adam Fergusson gave me of a morning he had passed with Scott at Abbotsford , which at that time was still unfinished , and , swarming with carpenters , painters , masons , and bricklayers , was surrounded with all the dirt and disorderly discomfort inseparable from the process of house-building . The room they sat in was in the roughest condition which admitted of their occupying it at all ; the raw , new chimney smoked intolerably . Out-of-doors the whole place was still one chaos of bricks , mortar , scaffolding , tiles , and slates . A heavy mist shrouded the whole landscape of lovely Tweed side , and distilled in a cold , persistent , dumb drizzle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the room , Walter Scott every five minutes exclaiming , " Eb , Adam ! the puir brute s just wearying to get out ; " or , " Eh , Adam ! the puir creature s just crying to come in , when Sir Adam would open the door to thc raw , chilly air for the wet , muddy hound 's exit or entrance , while Scott , with his face swollen with a grievous toothache , and one hand pressed hard to his chcek , with the other was writing the inimitably humorous opening chapters of The Antiquary , which he passed across the table , sheet by sheet , to his friend , saying , " Now , Adam , d ye think that 11 do ? " Such a picture of mental triumph over outward circumstance has surely seldom been surpassed ; house - builders , smoky chimney , damp drau* , hts , restless , dripping dog , and toothache , form what our friend , Miss Masson , called a " concatenation of exteriorities " little favorable to literary composition of any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delightfully comical beginning of The Antiquary , they are all but incredible . To my theatrical avocation I have been indebted for many social pleasures and privileges ; among others , for Sir Walter Scott 's notice and acquaintance ; but among the things it has deprived Old Woman 's aoss*p . September , me of was the opportunity of enjoying more of his honorable and delightful intercourse . A visit to Abbotsford , urgcd upon us most kindly , is one of the lost opportunities of my life that I think of always with bitter regret . Sir Walter wanted us to go down and spend a week with him in the country , and our professional engagements rendered it impossible for us to do so ; and there are few things in my whole life that I count greater loss than the seven days I might have passed with that admirable genius and excellent , kind man , and had to forego . I never saw Abbotsford until after its master had departed from all earthly dwelling-places . I was staying in the neighborhood , at the house of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went thither with her and my youngest daughter . The house was inhabited only by servants ; and the housekeeper , whose charge it was to show it , waited till a sufficient number of tourists and sight-seers had collected , and tben drove us all together from room to room of the house in a body , calling back those who outstripped her , and the laggers who would fain have fallen a few paces out of the sound of the dreary parrotry of her inventory of the contents of each apartment . There was his writing , - table and chair , his dreadnaught suit and thick walking shoes and staff there in the drawing-room ; the table , fitted like a jeweler 's counter , with a glass cover , protecting and exhibiting all the royal and precious tokens of honor and admiration , in the shape of orders , boxes , miniatures , etc. , bestowed on him by the most exalted worshipers of his genius , hardly to be distinguished under the thick coat of dust with which the glass was darkened . Poor Anne Scott 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , and , a glass door being open to the garden , Mrs. M- and myself stepped out for a moment to recover from the miserable impression of sadness and desecration the whole thing produced on us ; but the inexorable voice of the housekeeper peremptorily ordered us to return , as it would be she said ( and very truly ) , quite // impossible for her to do her duty in describing the " curiosities " of the house , if visitors took upon themselves to stray about in every direction instead of keeping together and listening to what she was saying . How glad we were to escape from the sort of ni*htmare of the affair ! I returned there on another occasion , one of a large and merry party who had obtained permission to picnic in the grounds , but who , deterred by the threatening aspect of the skies from gypsying ( as had originally been proposed ) by the side of the Tweed , were allowed , by Sir Adam Fergusson*s interest with the housekeeper , to assemble round the table in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was so present with me as to destroy all enjoyment , and , thinking how I might have had the great good fortune to sit there with the man who had made the whole place illustrious , I felt ashamed and grieved at being there then , though my companions were all kind , merry , good-hearted people , bent upon their own and each other 's enjoyment . Sir Adam Fergusson had grown very old , and told no more the vivid anecdotes of former days ; and to complete my mental discomfort , on the wall immediately opposite to me hung a strange picture of Mary Stuart 's head , severed from the trunk and lying on a white cloth on a table , as one sees the head of John the Baptist in the charger , in pictures of Herodias 's daughter . It was a ghastly presentation of the guillotined head of a pretty but rather common - looking French woman , - a fancy picture which it certainly would not have been my fancy to have presiding over my dinnertable . Only once after this dreary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to Abbotsford . I was alone , and the tourist season was over , and , the sad autumnal afternoon offering little prospect of my being joined by other sightseers , I prevailed with the housekeeper , who admitted me , to let me wander about the place , without entering the house ; and I spent a most melancholy hour in the garden and in pacing up and down the terrace overlooking the Tweed side . The place was no longer inhabited at all ; my ringing at the gate had brought , after much delay , a servant from Mr. Hope 's new residence , built at some distance from Scott 's house , and from her I learned that the proprietor of Abbotsford had withdrawn to the house he had erected for himself , leaving the poet 's dwelling exclusively as a place of pilgrimage for travelers and strangers , with not even a servant resi ( ling under its roof . The house abandoned to curious wayfarers ; the sons and daughters , the grandson and granddaughter , every member of the founder 's family dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Arundel , and living in a semi-monastic seclusion in a house walled off from the tourist-haunted shrine of the great man whose memory alone was left to inhabit it , - all these circumstances filled me with indescribable sadness as I paced up and down in the gloaming , and thought of the strange passion for founding here a family of the old border type which had obfuscated the keen , clear brain of Walter Scott , made his wonderful gifts subservient to the most futile object of ambition , driven him to the verge of disgrace and bankruptcy , embittered the evening of his laborious and glorious career , and finally ended in this , - the utter extinction of the name he had illustrated and the family he had hoped to found . And while his noble works remain to make his memory ever loved and honored , this Brummagem mediteval mansion , this mock feudal castle with its imitation baronial hall ( upon a diminutive scale ) hung round with suits of armor , testifies to the utter perversion of good sense and good taste resulting from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ border chieftain of the sixteenth century instead of an Edinburgh lawyer of the nineteenth , and his preference for the distinction of a petty land-holder to that of the foremost genius of his age . Mr. Combe , in speaking of this feudal insanity of Scott and the piteous havoc it made of his life , told me that at one time he and Ballan 1876. 339 // tyne , with whom he had entered into partnership , were staving off imminent ruin by indorsing and acceptin* , each other 's bills , and carried on that process to the extremest verge compatible with honesty . What a history of astounding success and utter failure ! GLASGOW , July 8 , 1830 . You will , ere this , my dear Mrs. Jameson , have received my very tardy reply to your first kind letter . I got your second last night at the theatre , just after I had given away my jewels to Mr. Beverley . I was much gratified by your profession of affection for me , for though I am not over-desirous of public admiration and approbation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose intellect I admire , and on whose character I can with confidence rely . Your letter , however , made me uncomfortable in some respects ; you seem unhappy and perplexed . I am sure you will believe me when I say that , without the remotest thought of intruding on the sacredness of private annoyances and distresses , I most sincerely sympathize in your uneasiness , whatever may be its cause , and earnestly pray that the cloud , which the two or three last times we met in London hung so heavily on your spirits , may pass away . It is not for me to say to you , " Patience , " my dear Mrs. Jameson ; you have suffered too much to have neglected that only remedy of our afflictions , but I trust Heaven will make it an efficacious one to you , and erelong send you less need of it . I am glad you see my mother often , and *. rery glad that to assist your recollection of me you find interest and amusement in discussing the fitting - up of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the drawing you ma e of the rooms in James Street is mine , and that when you visit me in my new abode it will be pleasant to have that remembrance before us of a place where we have spent some hours very happily together . What you say of Mrs. N- only echoes my own thoughts of her . She is a splendid creature , nobly endowed September , every way ; too nobly to become through mere frivolity and foolish vanity the mark of the malice and envy of such things as she is surrounded by , and who will all eagerly embrace the opportunity of slandering one so immeasurably their superior in every respect . I do not know much of her , but I feel deeply interested in her ; not precisely with the interest inspired by loving or even liking , but with that feeling of admiring solicitude with which one must regard a person so gifted , so tempted , and in such a position as hers . I am glad that lovely sister of hers is married , though matrimony in that world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virtue or happiness ; it is sometimes in that society the reverse of an " honorable estate . " The poor king 's death gave me a holiday on Monday , Tuesday , and Wednesday , and we eagerly embraced the opportunity its respite afforded us of visiting Loch Lomond and the entrance to Loch Long . As almost my first thought when we reached the lake was , " How can people attempt to describe such places ? " I shall not terminate my letter with " smooth expanses of sapphiretinted waves , " or " purple screens of heath-clad bills rising one above another into the cloudless sky . " A volume mi* , ht be written on the mere color of the water , and give rio idea of it , though you are the very person whose imacrination , aided by all that you ye seen , would best realize such a scene from description . It was heavenly , and we had such a perfect day ! I prefer , however , the glimpse we had of Loch Long to what we saw of Loch Lomond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expanse and verdant shores , but the rocks and crags which guard the entrance of Loch Long are wilder and more sublime , and the dark water inclosed by the mountains of Arquhar , instead of reflecting the smiling sky as it lay mirrored on the wide surface of Loch Lomond , borrowed a sinister , gloomy tint from the black cliffs that wall it in on either side . Perhaps , too , the circumstance of our not having had time Old IlTornan ' 8 Gossip . // to explore Loch Long added the stimulus of unsatisfied curiosity to the admiration which was excited by what I saw of it , and fancy still suggests that what was " beyond " would have been more beautiful than all I had seen . I brought away an appropriate nosegay from my trip : a white rose from iDumbarton , in memory of Mary Stuart , an oak branch from Loch Loinond , and a handful of heather , for which I fought with the bees on the rocky shore of Loch Long . I like my Glasgow audience better than my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look for a pleasant audience in your country , for which we set out tomorrow , I believe . My aunt desires to be remembered to you , and so does my father , and bids me add , in answer to your modest doubt , that you are a person to be always remembered with pleasure and esteem . I am glad you did not like my Bath miniature ; indeed , it was not likely that you would . Believe me always yours affectionately , F. A. K. During our summer tour my mother , who had remained in London , superintended the preparation of a new house , to which we removed on our return to town . My brother Henry 's schooling at Westminster was over , which had been the reason for our taking the house at Buckiugham Gate , and , though it had proved a satisfactory residence in many respects , we were glad to exchange it for the one to which we now went , which had many associations that made it agreeable to my father , having been my uncle John 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the memory of my parents . It was the corner house of Great Russell Street and Montague Place , and , since we left it , has been included in the new court-yard of the British Museum ( which was next door to it ) and become the librarian 's quarters , our friend Panizzi being its first occupant afterward . It was a good , comfortable , substantial house , the two pleasantest rooms of which , to me , were the small apartment on the ground floor , lined with books from floor to ceiling , and my own peculiar lodging in the upper regions , which , thanks to my mother 's kindness and taste , was as pretty a bower of ele0ant comfort as any young spinster need have desired . There I chiefly spent my time , pursuing my favorite occupations , or in the society of my own especial friends : my dear H5- , when she was in London ; Mrs. Jameson , who often climbed thither for an hour 's pleasant discussion of her book on Shakespeare ; and a lady with whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till her death , my dear E- F- . I had the misfortune to lose the watercolor sketches which Mrs. Jameson had made of our two drawing-rooms in James Street , Buckingham Gate . They were very pretty and skillful specimens of a difficult kind of subject , and valuable as her work , no less than as tokens of her regard for me . The beautiful G5- , to whose marriage I have referred , had she not been a sister of her sisters would have been considered a wit ; and , in spite of this was the greatest beauty of her day . She always reminded me of what an American once said in speaking of a countrywoman of his , that she was so lovely that when she came into the room she took his breath away . While I was in Bath I was asked by a young artist to sit for my miniature . His portrait had considerable merit as a piece of delicate , highly finished workmanship ; it was taken in the part of Portia , and engraved ; but I think no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it even the intention of my portrait . Whether or not the cause lay in my own dissimilar expressions and dissimilar aspects at different times , I do not know ; but if a collection was made of the likenesses that have been taken of me , to the number of nearly thirty , nobody would ever imagine that they were intended to represent the same person . Certainly , my Bath miniature produced a version of my face perfectly unfamiliar to myself and most of my friends who saw it . Frances Anne Kerable. 1876. 341
