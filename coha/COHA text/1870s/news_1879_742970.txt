txt Queen VICTORIA 'S husband incurred popular displeasure by saying , at a critical period , that parliamentary government was on its trial . The suggestion of a doubt as to the absolute perfection of the parliamentary system was deemed worse than ' blasphemy . And yet the reasons assigned for the misgiving were not nearly so cogent as those which might be assigned for the apprehensions excited by the manner in which , year after year , Congress gets through the greater part of its most important work . A republican system presupposes , among other essentials of success , the application of the intelligence and moral principle of the community to the conduct of the Government . But the Congressional branch of the Government reflects neither intelligence nor principle in its treatment of affairs . The statesmanship and thrift which once gave charac ! disappeared. ; to its proceedings have well-nigh ! disappeared. ; demagogism and a reckless waste of money have taken their places . The Executive submits its estimates and indicates the probable condition of the Treasury . Congress alternately slashes the estimates and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the interests of the public service , and the latter without reference to the resources available . Time that should be devoted to the exercise of a judicious economy and the energetic prosecution of business , is spent , by the House in partisan wrangling and by the Senate in the cultivation of jobs . Attempts to provide for deficiencies occasioned by wasteful appropriations are scouted . Nowhere is there any just sense of responsibility . The Treasury expostulates in vain . Both parties in both chambers treat its statements with indifference . Nominally governing by the people and for the people , they really bring republican government into contempt . The immediate results may not be disastrous , because the great body of the American people are better than the politicians and jobbers who in their name legislate ; but the tendency is downward . The strain put upon the system is greater than it can permanently bear . Sober observers must be startled by the recklessness which just now is the chief characteristic of action at Washington . The Treasury is like the country  --  it can not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could make ends meet , ? fulfilling all existing obligations , maintaining the public credit , and nourishing the resources on which the restoration of financial soundness depends . But it can not do more . It has no margin for experiments ; no cash to spare for subsidies and , jobs . Taxation , too , is oppressive . The Treasury can not appeal to the people for more money to satisfy its needs ; the demand is for lighter taxation , not for more . No man has ventured to rise in the House or in the Senate as the advocate of heavier taxation . Yet both of those bodies pursue a course which under wise administration would be recog- , nized as making heavier taxes a necessity . They co-operate cordially in the enactment of a Pension Arrears bill which according to the latest estimate will absorb not less than , $26,000,000 . They substantially agree in favor of a measure that will create another large drain upon the Treasury for the benefit of the tobacco interest  --  one of Elate few intereats that should be taxed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separate- , ly , it Must be admitted that neither can toast of superiority . Both are doing all they can to bring republient government into disrepute . Each so eagerly pursues unworthy objects that they will be hold jointly responsible for the failure of the Appropriation bills which they have respectively perverted . The House is willing that the public business shall suffer , rather than that it shall lose au opportunity of gratifying its partisanship . It loads down a bill providing the means for keeping in motion three branches of the Government with measures that have not the remotest relation to'its legitimate wants , and . with the knowledge that iu such a shape the bill can not go through the Senate . On the other hand , the Senate concentrates its energies on flagrant jobs . Not content with ratifying the House Pension bill , it provides more pensions , costing millions . It puts the Postal Appropriation bill in jeopardy by tacking to it . the Roach subsidy ,  --  a job so scandalous that the House , which is certainly not squeamish , can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make them worse . It provides a set-off to the House job for the benefit of a partisan printing firm by assigning $325,000 for the purchase of " Boss " SHEPHERDS property on Pennsylvania-avenue . In short , while the House is , heedless of everything but the attainment of partisan ends , the Senate seems intent upon showing that its principal care is to cram into the Appropriation bills the greatest possible number of items indicative of jobbery and corruption . It is reasonably certain that one of the consequences of these shameless proceedings will be an extra session . If Congress were to devote every remaining hour of the present session to quiet business , this evil could hardly be averted . We know , however , that Congress will not do anything of the sort . The House keeps up its partisan gabble , and the Senate interpolates inexcusable items , big and little , as though the moments were too precious to be lost . Altogether the spectacle is humiliating alike to Republicans and Democrats . It exhibits a rivalry in folly so mean and yet so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ashamed . And the climax is reached when the two chambers , having sanctioned the addition of forty or fifty millions to expenditures entailing a deficiency , will not consent to provide the amount required . There are but two honest methods of obtaining the money . Fresh taxation , which is one of them , is out of the question . Issuing four per cent . bonds , which is the other ; is objected to by Senators and Representatives who have no scruples about voting away money , but are greatly excited when the expenditures they have sanctioned take the shape of an increase of the debt . The probable solution of . the difficulty is the payment of the money out of the reserve held by the Treasury on . account of resumption . This done , the Treasury will of course sell bonds to strengthen its resumption reserve . True wisdom will require that to be done ; and so , in the long run , the extravagance of the expiring Congress will be partly represented by an increase , of the bonded debt .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
