THE REPUBLICAN MOVEMENT IN EUROPE . By EMILIO CASTELAR . THE SCLAVIC PEOPLES. - ( Concluded . ) THE modern spirit , in spite of such a state of things , penetrated through all the pores of the Russian nation , the Selavic race . There are among all nations two beautiful manifestations of their activitypoetry and art-whose summits catch the first dawn of ideas , not yet revealed in the depths of men 's consciousness . By these means the Selavic race demonstrated , even in the time of Nicholas , that it was not to remain a monstrous exception in the earth ; that it could not much longer drag the weight of its chains after so many peoples had broken them . It is true that the emperors endeavored to quench the sacred fire of ideas , which announced the appearance of new laws , like the fire ofSinai ; but it is also true that they burned their sacrilegious hands in the act . Poetry , mysterious and veiled , uncertain as dreams , undecided as twilight , announcing in obscure symbols its luminous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reveals to men the innate dignity of the soul ; and with this the existence of justice . Even when nationalities have died in the world , they still llve in poetry . The children of Israel , proscribed , under the willows of Babylon , on the banks of strange rivers , only consoled themselves by observing the flight of the swallows which bore on their wings news from their country , or listening to the song of the Vot . XLV. - No. 2T0. - 54 prophets who bore in their strains truths to the intelligence , hopes to the heart , life to the spirit . The man who personifies in its highest expression the modern Russian idea is Pushkin . Romanticism , which in France and in Spain represented emancipation , in Germany , by one of those contrasts of race which are like the intrigue of historic life , represented reaction . The romantic school among us was a frank protest against the traditional courtier spirit of the so-called classic Bourbon literature , while in Germany it was an open reaction against the ideas of our time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russia romanticism had a character analogous to that which appeared in France and Spain . It was a lively protest against the hybrid Germanism of the court , an eloquent invocation to the spirit of the age and the advent of liberty among peoples . Pushkin was of the romantic school . In the morning of his romanticism he did not sing of nature , as the classic poets sang-Delille in France , Melendez in Spain . He did not sing , as tyrants would have wished , the groves of larch and firs ; the steppes , immense as the sea ; the virgin snow , silvered by the rays of the full moon ; the waves of the Baltic , heavenly in the long days of summer , and imprisoned in icy fetters in the eternal nights of winter ; the polar horizons , with their rosy auroras , // whose splendors were indefinitely repeated by the crystal deserts and peaks . He did not sing this nature , which continues the same in its movement and brightness even when it is the witness of crimes , which gathers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and fills with its vivifying air the lungs of tyrants . He sang the spirit with its ideas , with its agitations  --  the spirit which swells with internal storms , and sallies forth to scale heaven in the path of justice and of liberty , and which , when it falls , wailing with pain and despair , recogn4zes not even in God himself authority and power to take away its rights . To sing of the spirit in the heart of Russia must be a dear indulgence to a poet . According to some historians , Pushkin was flogged before being exiled . According to others , he was merely sent into the interior and shut up in a silent cloister . There he devoured his own existence . The martyrdom of the Titan , solitary on the crest of Caucasus , was his . To the impulses of the romantic school succeeded the agonies of Byron . These poignant pains , the doubt of every thing divine or human , the gall spilled from the wounds of heart and conscience , the fine irony , the bitter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mysterious prayers to the oaths of peasants in brutal debauch-all these changing forms of indignation lashed the dead conscience of a slavish people . His grief , his doubt , his bitterness , belonged to his generation , which had caught glimpses of liberty in the heaven of the future* to fall again beneath the knout of the Cossack pretorian . Russia lamented for the poet ; Russia blushed for the poet 's shame . He created a personification of his own sorrows , creating an immortal type of the Russian spirit  --  the type of Onegin . There is something admirable in the talent of poets to embrace in one person the character of the age . Our Spanish theatre has marvelous examples of such aptitude . The Sigismund of Calderon , born for a king , shut np among beasts , imprisoned in a gloomy cavern without communication with the human race , condemned to envy the liberty of the birds which flew above his head , and of the fishes which sported at his feet , with less free-will than the beasts of the forest , personified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world into miserable slavery , had lost in its chains even its soul . Onegin was also the type , the personification of the Russian spirit . Agile , he could not move ; intelligent , he could not think ; with speech , and not permitted to speak ; thirsting , and not permitted to drink ; hungering , and not permitted to eat ; his intellectual and physical faculties completely useless , even love appearing forbidden to one who could only engender slaves , Onegin is the image of the generations which are born and die in despotism , idle before the highest ministries of life , useless in all spheres of human activity , eager to escape from slavery , but never accomplishing the escape-abortive and inert generations , for whom the earth is like a vast sepulchre , and life-without liberty , without thought , without conscience-like a perpetual suffocation . This persuasion of the uselessness of all our faculties at last infused in the poet a cold indifference between liberty and slavery , between error and truth , between reaction and progress . Why should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Little by little every aspiration was quenched in that heart , every idea died in that intellect , and the poet remained like nature , which produces beauty without consciousness of it . He still sang , but he sang in the Olympian indifference of art . He sang on , but he repeated the fleeting impressions of the passing days , as a transparent lake repeats the objects on its banks . It was no longer the idea animating nature and life , which should always be the virtue of poetry : it was a photographic machine repeating facts and ideas which passed by the mirror of his mind . Nicholas arrived at the final accomplishment of his desires  --  the poet had committed suicide . In this sad suicide he cursed the only element which sustained him against tyranny , anJ which could aid him to support the solitude of his cloister : he cursed public opinion . A criminal against human nature , he cursed the protector of his misfortunes , the judge of his perjury . In the fancy of his desolate soul , when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hands , the stupid , indifferent people , capable only of appreciating the Apollo Belvidere for the weight of the marble and not for the beauty of its lines  --  the people , sleeping in the mire of the fields , with the breath of death like that of stale sepulchres , responded that his song was rich and sonorous , but empty and sterile as the wind ; and such a people , he thought , deserved not the celestial gift of poetry , but the durgeou of despots , the lash of their Cossacks , the axe of their headsman . The lash of the pretorian* had cut to the soul of Pnshkin . When Nature makes a poet , and places in his intellect universal ideas , and in his heart the sentiment of humanity , raising him to the luminous sphere where all objects are brightened and vivified in the light of beauty , and all ideas are expressed in pleasing harmonies , she rouses him , she gives him inspiration , confides the magic art of verse , fills his voice with melodious accents , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she makes him susceptible , and at times unhappy , that he may embellish the night of life as the moon embellishes the night of the // world , and may wake new souls as the spring wakes new organisms , and may diffuse ideas in the consciousness as the light and heat diffuse perfume and sweetness through nature . Nothing could have been more beneficial to him in the court than the denial of his inspiration . The tyrant sent him , not soldiers to flog , but courtiers to corrupt him . He remembered that all tyrants had kept a genius-Philip , Aristotle ; Augustus , Virgil ; Charles V. , Garcilasso ; Philip II. , Lope ; Louis XIV. , Moli&amp;e ; and Nicholas wished also to have his poet , choosing Pushkin , who had given marvelous flexibility to the Russian language , and who , having been gifted with the ideas of the age , had offered them up as a sacrifice to despotism . He appointed him his chamberlain . There were still some remains of shame in the heart of the poet , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dishonor him after having oppressed him , insisted that he should choose between the office of chamberlain and exile to the Caucasus . The Asiatic despot threw Daniel to the lions ; the Russian czar threw Pushkin to the courtiers . In such a situation there was no resource but death or dishonor , and he chose dishonor : he became chamberlain . The livery weighed upon him like a chain . God had made of him one of his angel&amp; of election , and despotism converted him into one of its beasts of burden . There , in the solitude of his soul , in converse with his conscience , when he remembered that there was a God in heaven and implacable justice in the earth , before history , whose rewards and punishments are eternal as the currents of time , the poet suffered keenly with grief and anger against himself , and despair that he had not preferred to the favors of the tyrants who can but kill , the transfiguration and apotheosis of the martyrdom which leaves an inextinguishable light in the memory of man . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He lost what is most necessary to every existence-self-respect . He sought for means to escape from himself and where he might not meet the corpse of his genius shrouded in the thick winding-clothes of his conscience . To escape from himself he gave himself up to pleasure . This life without future , talent without honor , thought without object , intelligence without light , song without inspiration , heart without hope , and spirit without ideal-this life , so far as ideas were concerned , evaporated into vacancy , and , so far as sentiments were concerned , became stagnant in vice . Debauch was for him like a narcotic . But if he found in it oblivion sometimes , at other times he found terrible and implacable punishment . He opened the doors of his house to bon-vivants , and they , as he suspected , corrupted the only woman he had ever truly loved , the companion of his exile , his wife . The poet was always jealous as an Arab . He was the great-grandson of a negro , and the passions of Othello @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ History can not decide ; but Pushkin had every thing to fear from his own degradation , and from the companions who surrounded him . Anonymous letters left him no tranquillity . Several injured husbands spoke to him openly of the community of their misfortunes . Danthes , an officer of the guards , was the preferred lover . The poet went to his house , showed him the letters , demanded immediate reparation . Danthes , to persuade him out of his suspicions , asked for the hand of his sister-in-law , the elder sister of Madam Pushkin . The marriage took place , but new suspicions arose . When matters had assumed this shape , the poet publicly insulted his brother-in-law , and he could not longer avoid a duel . Terrible tragedy ; two men , united by so many bonds , married with two sisters , who must also feel against each other mutual jealousies , were going to kill each other . One of them was carrying to the grave an existence full of pleasure , the other a life shipwrecked by having failed to obey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death , carried something dead in their souls . The duel took place in a thick wood near to St. Petersburg . Danthes fired first . Pushkin fell , mortally wounded . In the agony of death , with the veil of eternity before his eyes , feeling his breast torn by the final agony , he cocked his pistol feverishly and fired at his enemy . Danthes fell to the ground , wounded in the left shoulder . The poet , believing him dead , threw the pistol at his head , and said , " I thought that the death of that man would have pleased me more. ** But , in truth , he was the only one killed . A long and painful agony began . When they laid him upon his bed the family he had dishonored surrounded him with tears , and the people whom he had insulted begged for news of the national poet . Only one man , cold as ice , impassible as destiny , hovered about that bed of pain , to finish the extinction of something greater than the material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corrupted . This man was the emperor . He thought that perhaps the poet , there in the solitude of his cabinet and the secret of his conscience , when the spectre of a ruined life appeared to his feverish eyes , when the remorse of his genius demanded imperiously some word of truth-that he might have consigned the tyrant in immortal stanzas to the irreparable punishment of an execration which would descend to posterity . It was necessary to tear away this last flower of his garland , this last fragment of his soul . The emperor sent him an agent charged to demand all his papers in exchange for the payment of his debts and the assignment of a pension to his wife and // children . The poet signed this pact at the dark door of eternity . It was the morning of Jannary 2 , 1838 , that he died . In dying he could not contemplate posterity with serene eyes , nor say that he had faithfully accomplished the ministry of his genius . He left his immortality torn to pieces in the talons of despotism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his body . His persecutor would not consent that he should be publicly buried . In Russia every thing belongs to the emperor : the corpse was therefore his . In the dead of an icy night , conducting the body to a church which was not his own , sending for a priest , who clandestinely repeated a rapid mass , the emperor gave a grave to the body , which soon disappeared under a shroud of snow-not so cold as the frozen shroud which despotism had thrown over his genius . This is the destiny of every great soul born under the infamous domination of absolute power . What desolation there is in personal government ! How it extinguishes genius ! How it cuts the wings of all great human aspirations ! Lermontoff , who dared to cry in verse for vengeance over the grave of Pushkin , was dragged like him into exile , and like him died in a dueL Palevoi , who had the audacity to put on record the existence of a social problem , saw his articles condemned by law , his invective paralyzed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to praising the pretorians and their false glories . Gogol wrote " The Dead Souls , ' * a novel worthy of Cervantes ; and as the phantasies of the Middle Ages received a mortal blow from the mature and mo&amp;eru reason of Cervantes , the horrors of slavery , the trade in souls , received a mortal blow from the humanitarian pen of Gogol . The poor serfs in their eternal night ; the agcnts of the treasury in their unmeasured avarice ; the tax-gatherers of the steppes making commerce of bodies and souls ; the rottenness of administration , in whose veins ran the poison of all the vices ; the life of the territorial lord shut up like a toad in his swamps , which seemed moist with tears-all these crimes , all these horrors , took bodyand voice to denounce themselves , as evil always denounces itself , in the imperishable work of the Russian writer . Irony is a powerful corrosive of evil , a great awakener of conscience , because it opposes to the sorrows of reality and the shadows of the present the clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always appears by the side of an iniquity which is going to pieces . Before slavery came to an end in America the novel of a Christian woman spread through all consciences and through all hearts the clouds and tears condensed in the cabins of the slaves . A little before serfdom was buried in Russia it was killed by Gogol . It is a curious demonstration of the efficacy of genius and the weakness of persecution that the censorship gave free course to the work , and that the emperor rewarded it with a book whose leaves were bank-notes . But they soon recognized the venom containe4 in that humble flower of the steppes . Gogol was bitterly criticised , and accused of a total lack of patriotism . The second part of his novel was either never written , or was burned after being written . The poet fell into so deep a sadness that it is even yet unknown whether or not he died of it . It is known that his reason suffered , and that in his wanderings , to please the master of all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orthodoxy . Still in his youth , consumed by a mysterious and melancholy malady , Gogol died , after having revealed a few circles of the hell of slavery . But the literature awakened by Pushkin fulfilled its destiny . In the midst of the lash , of the knout , of bayonets , of hangmen , and of emperors it passed with its torch , and enkindled in millions of beings buried in serfdom the light and the warmth of life with the light and the warmth of liberty . Russia , agitated by innumerable ideas , was natur*lly profoundly agitated , also , in the inferior sphere of reality and of facts , during the first days of the reign of Nicholas . His brother Alexander , who in directly contributed to the violent death of his own father , Paul I. , and who invited the assassins to carry the pall at the funeral of their royal victim , lived a melancholy life , and died a desperate and sinister death . The recollection of his father , the conviction that the crown had scorched the forehead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led him to acts of violence , his marriage with a woman of a rank inferior to his own , decided the hereditary Grand Duke Constantine resolutely to decline the empire , which could only promise him a disastrous death . Long before his brother Alexander passed from this life the heir - apparent , Constantine , deposited in a secret place a solemn renunciation of the throne , which would thereby fall to the person of his second brother , Nicholas . He doubted if he should accept or not , and believed that the renunciation of Constantine would require a solemn confirmation . Thus , between the death of the Emperor Alexander and the advent of the Emperor Nicholas there was a moment of interregnum . The occasion was propitious for revolutionary movements . In those moments in which power lacks unity revolutions as-. sume force and courage . Through the Russian steppes ran the revolutionary breeze which agitated all Europe . Masonry was mingled with other sects of the Russian provinces , and filled many hearts with progressive and humanitarian sentiments . The irruption of the hosts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for social reform . The example of the military movements of Spain and Italy spread that contagion which virtually united all Europe . The Spanish constitution of 1812 , a constitution essentially democratic , dazzled and attracted many noble souls . The late emperor , led by his liberal leanings , admired it greatly , and demanded that the Spanish soldiers united against Napoleon under his banners should take an oath to preserve and defend it . To all these external motives was united the ideal cherished by many Russians of resolute disposition , which impefled them strongly to exalt the times of Ivan above those of the German dynasty , to seek in this purely Muscovite tradition not an impossible restoration of empires , which perished with the empire of Asia , but the germs of a Sclavic federal republic which might be the sacred bond among the whole heroic race . From this rose innumerable secret societies . Even in 1823 the so-called League of the Public Good had laid in Voihynia the basis of a Pan-Sclavic federal alliance . A commission of judges , of spies , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of republicans , which bent , but did not perish , under persecution . Many thinkers propagated it in the most distant provinces , *nd many soldiers received it as a promise of emancipation and as a means of harmonizing their institutions with the spirit of our age . Those societies were all conspiracies . In 1823 the conspirators had a mysterious meeting in Kiev , where they concocted the dethronement of the reigning family . Other reunions succeeded each other in different territories of the empire , all proposing the dethronement of the German dynasty and the proclamation of the Russian republic . These societies grew to such dimensions that they gained an establishment in the capital of the empire , in the midst of the armies of spies , and they drew life from the inspiration of a poet who laughed at despotism in spite of his presentiment that he should die at its hands . And while these ideas were confusedly working in the minds of the literary and military youth , Alexander died in his hermitage at Tagaurog , slain not by the dagger of rebels , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1825 , the hereditary grand duke learned the death of his brother , and immediately confirmed to Nicholas his re*olution not to accept the crown . In spite of this resolution Nicholas immediately took the oath of allegiance to Constantine , and only accepted the crown for himself when he was convinced that there was no other resource , in view of the tenacity of the grand duke in renouncing it . The papers which were brought from the hermitage where Alexander had died announced the conspiracy , and even designated as suspected of implication in it several officers of the guard . The military governor , a man of great simplicity and little foresight , would not believe it , and when they spoke to him of the mysterious reunions of the young men he would say , " Let them read and applaud among themselves their own wretched verses . " The conspirators knew that after having taken the oath of allegiance to Constantine they must take another to Nicholas , and they thought that they would find in this singular incident a plausible opportunity for bringing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legitimate heir had been dethroned by his rebel , intrusive , perhaps fratricide brother . It was the morning of the 26th December , 1825 . Nicholas , confused by conflicting ideas , read the formula of the oath , and completed it with a proclamation to his troops . Many of the regiments had already complied with the formula , and Nicholas breathed more freely , when the news came that the soldiers of Moskva had resisted and killed several of their officers , that they were coming in disorder toward the palace , and that they had collected around the statue of Peter the Great , threatening with their skirmishers and sharp-shooters all the passers-by . The emperor hesitated a moment , but decided to go to meet the insurgents . His family detained him , the afflicted princesses especially throwing themselves on his neck and at his feet to prevent his going out . The moment was decisive and supreme-one of those moments in which the fate of dynasties and of empires is settled . The vacillation of the emperor would give courage to the soldiers . Nicholas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listened to the proclamation , read by the emperor himself in a stentorian voice . This act being accomplished , a silence so profound ensued that the emperor addressed himself to several citizens , saying that upon their cheeks he kissed the whole people , and in that immense crowd nothing was heard but the sound of the kisses . The insurgents formed a confused and discordant mass , where there was as little unity of voice as of ideas , united by no discipline nor impelled by any clear motive ; for while some of their chiefs favored the republic , the rest , moved by the tradition of their slavery , demanded the true , the legitimate tyrant . There were many shouts of " Live the Constitution ! " which the soldiers repeated frantically , imagining that " Constitution " was the baptismal name of the wife of Constantine . While this discord ran in their ranks , Nicholas advanced to the front . An old general who accompanied him , and who was the first to command order in the insurgents , fell , struck by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A resolute man in that moment could have dethroned the German family and destroyed the work of Peter the Great , becanse the emperor , although exposing his life , failed to form any decisive plan , and suspended the order for attack . A charge of cavalry , which was also ordered , was immediately afterward suspended because the horses slipped upon the ice . It was decided to call on the artillery , but in this delay and nncertainty the regiment of Grenadiers of the Guard had also revolted , and approached the Winter Palace to seize the imperial family . Any one would have thought that in that moment the last hour of the Russian dynasty had sonuded . But another battalion of sappers , faithful to Nicholas , interposed and prevented the coup do main . The insurgent troops encountered the emperor in the street . He cried , " Halt ! " " We belong to Constantine ! " cried the grenadiers . " Then that is your way , " the prince answered , in his confusion pointing to the plaza where the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sides . The people , faithful to Nicholas , became irritated , and began to throw sto.ies at the rebels . The artillery arriving , finished the work begnn by the people , and the insurrection was destroyed , smothered in its cradle . To clearly conceive an idea , to give it form in silence , to spread it among slaves , to affect with its light blind consciences and with its warmth sterile souls , to organize by means of societies rapidly diffusing themselves through a vast territory desolated through ages by tyranny , to succeed in establishing it in the breast of the very institutions where antocracy finds the safety of its power and the anchor of its despotism-all this labor will appear trivial to those who only measure the greatness of human efforts by their result , but it will forever appear great to those who know how every idea once sown germinates , and how every impulse once given moves the people , although it may fail at the beginning , toward the supreme end of incarnating their own ideal and realizing their true existence in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he hears of the movement , throws himself at the foot of the altar , prays and weeps , takes leave of his family , mounts on horseback , goes ont , impels respect with his imperious manner , his handsome figure , his Olympian glance , awakes in the people the sentiments of obedience which exist in every crowd enslaved for ages , and accomplishes by means of his artillery the salvation begnn by his prestige and his boldness . But he could not prevent the idea having flashed in the eyes of the people ; he could not prevent this idea from having had its adherents , nor those adherents from having engraved a day of military insurrection in the pages of Russian history ; he could not prevent this day of insurrection bringing with it days of punishment , nor these days of punishment from giving birth to martyrs , nor the names of these martyrs from being repeated by new generations , and preserved in the midst of dungeons like a ray of light vivifying and penetrating their thick walls and lofty bars . The autocracy could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free souls . The movement of 1825 was not useless and sterile . From that time dates the impulse toward modern institutions felt by succeeding Russian generations . From that time dates that profound liberal and republican sentiment which is rooted in its universities . From that time dates the belief of the possibility of modifying institutions with thought . The insurrection was abortive , but its failure served to attract great souls with the fruitful power of heroism and martyrdom . And when we look at the vast empire bowed in despotism , and see that a legion of thinkers , in the midst of all obstacles imposed by the censorship , by the autocracy extended over thought , vindicates liberty , and that another legion of martyrs in the frozen roads of Siberia , in the mines of the Ural Mountains , suffers and dies for liberty , we recognize involuntarily that no progressive idea is lost , that no humanitarian labor goes for naught . And who were the chiefs of this insurrection-that is to say , the true founders of the republican party in Russia ' ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among whom they labored , they began by seeking an aristocratic name  --  a name of prestige . They found the Prince Troubetzkoi . He was the chief of a noble family which , like the Medinacelis in Spain , pretended to have a better right than the reigning dynasty to the throne of Russia . The prince being guided by this tradition , it was not surprising that he lacked , in the supreme hours of the insurrection , a courage equal to the height of the situation . A long martyrdom expiated this fault . The life which was spared him was worse than the death of his companions on the scaffold . Proscribed to the mines of the Ural Mountains , under degrees of cold intolerable to human nature , amidst the hardships of prisons , his exile was full of tragic suffering . There was at his side a guardian angel whose sorrows will be recorded by history - his wife . During their residence at the court the noble pair , who had been united by those reasons of convenience which dominate among the aristocracy , regarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the heroic princess became conscious of an intense passion , inspired by the sentiment of grief and sustained by the idea of duty . Though beautiful , tender , and young , born amidst the refinements of luxury , bred in those Muscovite palaces where // the splendors of the East are joined to the comforts of Paris , neither her sex nor her education detained her . In the primitive cart of the Russian peasantry , in the talega , by roads often untrodden , exposed to all the fury of the elements and the perils of the desert , she traversed , day and night , huncireds of leagues-sometimes fainting , sonictimes hungry , always in pain  --  to share in the eternal night of the mines the cell of a galley-slave . There she lived with him , sustained him , bore him five children ; and when , after fifteen years of horrible material and moral sufferings , the family , born in despair and chains , had grown up , their griefs were aggravated by virtue of a law which sent them to form in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not shrink before the rack shrank from solitude , and begged that they would allow her to remain with her husband in some town where she might find a school to educate her children . " The children of a convict ' ? Never ! " said the tyrant . And this mother , this wife , who might have moved stones with her grief and softened them witli the spectacle of her sacrifices , could not touch the iron heart of the czar when she humbly begged , with the tender forethought of a mother , that at least he would permit her to live in the neighborhood of a pharmacy , to procure medicine for her children when they were sick . The emperor replied to the noble who presented this moving petition , " How do you dare to speak to me of this family of rebels ' ? " It is thus that the human heart hardens upon thrones . But the true chiefs of this military insurrection were the great thinker , Pestal , and the great poet , Ryleyef , both officers of the army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pages , at the time of the revolt colonel in the regiment of Yiatka ; of clear intelligence , resolute heart , firm and honorable character ; with an enthusiasm of ideas as of sentiment which attracted and influenced the masses ; of a force of will which transformed events and modeled them at the demand of his spirit ; powerful through the very sweetness of his humility and the power of his extraordinary genius ; an apostle like all men of luminous talents , an organizer like all men of fertile will , stud*ying the history of his country , he found that autocracy , despotism , was of Mongol origin , and bureaucracy , centralization , of German on* that the Mongols had dominated two hundred years , the Tartars a hundred , the Germans a century and a half ; and that among all these invasions , among all these conquests , they did nothing but tarnish and obscure the Sclavic ideas , the ideas of right springing from the nature of the Russian character , the patriarchal and primitive family , the community of their vested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and restore all that was national , in the manner of the literary Selavism , by the race taking possession of power through election , in parliaments of universal suffrage , responsible before the people , who should unite themselves in a wide republican federation . Pestal had of the social revolution an idea worthy of the Gracehi , and of the country an idea worthy of Camilius , and cherished for the ropublie a worship worthy of Washington . In war and in organization he had aptitudes truly Napoleonic . Powerful genius had been given to him by nature , and he could not find the means of developing it under that cold atmosphere . This is one of the worst evils of despotism  --  the ideas which it extinguishes , the characters which it kills , the wills which it renders sterile , the generations of souls which it drives , silent and sombre , to eternity . Pestal had written a republican code which was ridiculed by the judges of his case , and which neveitheless contained the ideal of the present generations , and the social system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his companions , was begun and carried through by a tribunal under the inspection of the emperor himself , who directed questions to the accused like a spy , abused them like a prosecuting attorney , and then handed them over , already condemned in advance , to their derisive judges . I say derisive , because there is an instance of their having condemned an officer to a certain punishment , and the emperor with his own hand corrected the sentence and raised it to a higher grade of punishment . Pestal was condemned to death , and died as the brave know how . When he heard his sentence he merely asked to be shot instead of being hanged . The emperor refused this favor . As he went to the scaffold he only asked that they should preserve his political code . The executioners seized him , tied his hands at his back , fastened a running knot to his neck , and launched him like a pendulum kito the air , brutally destroying a brain from which escaned the invisible flash of genius . How many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boards of that horrible scaffold ! If Pestal was the idea of that movement , Ryleyef was its imagination and fancy . Heaven made him a poet , and gave him all the gifts of poetry . Even yet the youth of Russia recite with emotion his unpublished and unprinted verses , preserved in the memory as a sacred deposit , and repeated by many lips as the prayer of our age . The poet was not mistaken in regard to the fate reserved for his genius by implacable destiny . " I shall die for the land where I was born , " he said . " I feel it , I know it ; and I not only accept but bless my destiny . " Employed in the military and in the judicial // careers , he never once touched with his pure hands the wages of despotism . Being editor of a literary almanac , in its pages he set forth justice as the polar star of the human spirit . These motives alone entered into his action  --  the love of his ideal , the love of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disinterested love for all that was lofty . Incapable of hating , devoted to progress , swayed by no passion , he desired to accomplish the good by means of good , without shedding upon the earth , thirsting for justice , one tear or one drop of blood The word of Demosthenes appeared to him more efficacious against tyranny than the dagger of Brutus . His pure and fervent inspiration , enamored of the infinite , at the moment when it opened its wings , broke them against the irons of despotism . His only passion was the salvation of his country . To cure its evils , his first ideas were constitutional monarchical , which were later changed by the influence of Festal in'to federal republican . This was the law of his life , the consolation of his death . On a dark morning of January , under a sky covered with gray clouds , through the thick snow a group of condemned men walked to their death , dressed in sackcloth , their faces covered with large hoods , their hands tied behind their backs . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Conrad Ryleyef , and his companions were Muraviefi* , Rumime , and others . The executioner tied the rope around their necks and hurled them violently from the scaffold . The ropes broke , and the victims fell unhurt on the ground . " Unhappy country , " said Ryleyef ; rising- " unhappy country , where they do not even know how to hang a man . " But the executioner promptly showed them that they did know how to hang effectually in the Russian empire . Despotism perhaps thought that when these men were hanged , their ideal was also killed . Their lifeless bodies , their hushed voices , the extinguished light of their eyes , led the despot to believe that a principle may be killed when the blood is congested in the brain which conceived it , and death has silenced the lips which propagated it . But the idea transmits itself through mysterious conduits from genera/ion to generation , from people to people , from age to age . Raise up censorship against it , and the idea annihilates it ; oppose frontiers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it goes through them ; extirpate it with fire and sword , and still it remains as the eternal patrimony of the human race preserved in its inextinguishable conscience , until it ends by dragging its persecutors after it , by modifying and transforming the very laws intended for its extermination . The advances which social law has made in Russia are principally due to those heroes , those martyrs of thought . Without their apostolate and their . death the idea would still have lain dormant in consciences , and the serf like the plant , would still have been rooted in his wretched plot of ground . If a new life has palpitated in those frozen regions , if a social movement has impelled the poor peasant , the machine of toil , to right and to liberty , without doubt this is due to those voices which have broken their gags , to all those sacrifices which have sanctified our cause and redeemed those in bonds . Ancient slavery would never have come to an end if the stoics had not preached the fundamental unity of the human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn , had not completed this principle with that of the unity of God . And Russian slavery would never have ended without that sacred legion of poets , philosophers , publicists , . who dared to defy the wrath of power , in exile and on the scaffold , and to penetrate with the light of thought into that hell where the blood is frozen , into that limbc* of a perverted education , of a national spirit completely dead beneath the shadows of error . When the serf feels himself master of his conscience and of his life , when he sees himself free from the seignorial jurisdiction which oppressed and vexed him , when he can embrace his children without fearing the lash which scarred his face , and the exile in Siberia which continually hung over his life , he may not remember that the idea cherished by the unknown martyrs of liberty , preached by the obscure apostles of democracy , whose names have been blotted from public memory by an implacable censorship-that this idea , chastised as a crime , has ascended like a mysterious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the emperor , and from there has descended by its own virtue , its own force , converted into social reforms , like a vivifying shower over the feudal lands , and like the mauna of new life over the hearts of slaves . There is no question that since the death of Nicholas Russian society has made advances in a democratic direction . And this advance is principally due to the fact that the mysterious subterranean propaganda has never ceased for a moment . When it was forbidden to speak in Moscow or St. Pctersbur* , it has spoken in London and in Geneva , and the blow of the press has made itself heard from the heart of palaces to the midst of hovels through the silent expanse of Russia . Even in the year 1848 Nicholas could see the advance of the idea which fell from the scaffolds of 1826 . The French revolution , which he saluted with joy because it destroyed a constitutional monarchy , * brought warmth and electricity to his empire . In 1849 a. vast republican conspiracy was discovered , inspired by one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // ( Iarkness . Honorary counselors , officers of the guard , students of the university , gentlemen , and even noblemen , composed it . Twenty-one were condemned to death . In Russia the punishment of death was abolished by a law of the Empress Elizabeth . By one of the shrewd devices of despotism , though common tribunals can not impose it , it is still imposed by courts-martial , especially in the cases of those accused of high treason . The conspirators were pursued , imprisoned , condemned to death , placed in their cells , brought out to the place of execution , attended by priests , their eyes bandaged , their breasts thrown open to the balls , their knees bent to the earth , and at the moment the word " fire " was uttered , when they had already tasted all the horrors of death , expecting an immediate release from their agonies , the pardon was read , conceded by a caprice of tyranny , revengeful even in its compassion , cruel even in its mercy . But death struck the tyrant Nicholas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his son , the Emperor Alexander . Nicholas was a despot of the Asiatic fashion . The ruling principle of his furious policy was terror . If Ivan the Terrible lashed , lacerated the bodies of his victims , tearing away heads and entrails little by little , that life and pain might last longer , throwing afterward the lacerated flesh in caldrons of boiling water , Nicholas could write below the petition of a princess who begged for her husband a mitigation of the punishment of transportation to Siberia , " Let him go on foot * " and he could force an old man to assist at a court ball on the same night in which his only son began , loaded with heavy chains , his journey to the mines of the Ural Mountains , the sepulchres of the living . Like his father , Pad , like his grandfather , Peter III. , Nicholas had traits of madness . Thanks to these , the nineteenth century has seen , what seemed the exclusive property of more barbarous ages , the death of nations , the death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destroyed , as in the times of Nebuchadnezzar , of Cyrus , of Vespasian . But if Nicholas was a despot of the Asiatic fashion , Alexander is a modern despot-one of intelligence , one whose boast is that he exercises his despotism for the good of the people , distrustful , melancholy , desirous to serve the modern spirit to the point where the modern spirit may serve him , and then to falsify it . He exercises cruelty only when he thinks it needful , and after having used it he falls into profound melancholy , which many think will terminate , as was the case with some of his ancestors , in open madness . Only in Poland , and at the time of the last insurrection , has Alexander been cruel . Through the exile of multitudes , the extermination of towns , the slaughter of women and children , in the churches interrupting with bullets the song and the prayer , substituting the smoke of powder for the smoke of incense , through all the barbarities of Mouravief Alexander retained one great consolation-fantastic and archaic as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the oppression of the Russians by the Poles , of the aristocratic character of the latter , of their religious intolerance , of their fanatical attachment to Catholicism hostile to the Greek religion , of their Jesuitical tendencies , of their oppression of their serfs , the feudalism of their institutions , the disturbance which their diets spread over Europe . And after having soothed himself with these excuses , given by all the Russian periodicals , he found it a delightful vengeance to emancipate arbitrarily the slaves , and arbitrarily despoil their masters of their property . But history will not be grateful even for an act of justice when it is dictated by self-interest , and converted into ferocious vengeance . The most truly illustrious act of the reign of Alexander was the emancipation of the serfs . The Russian slavery , in the condition which our century witnessed it , dated from 1597 . A barbarous usurpei declared the peasantry the property of their lords , converting them into domestic animals . Nothing is so intolerable to human nature as the loss of its liberty , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at last the insui5gents fell under the yoke , and remained submissive and united . The proprietor maintained them , but he beat them like his beasts of burden ; he distributed them among his lands as so much brute force , gave them the work which he pleased , hired them for fixed times and fixed wages , disposed of them as if they were the animated and moving vegetation of his lands . And modern industry , far from diminishing , aggravated these evils . At least under the ancient agricultural regime they were farmers , fastened to the soil like the nest of the lark , but having on the soil their hearthstone and their families , and with these air and light and relative comfort . But when industrial enterprises came , raising their factories , seeking to accomplish large production with small capital , they had recourse to the country , offering to hire the serfs . They received them with no other proviso than that they should produce high wages for their masters . They worked them in such a way as to convert them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looms , where they poured out their lives with their bitter sweat . Some of these unfortunates were taken to Europe , trained in manufactories , and tanght in the industrial schools . They had lived in the cherished companionship of liberty for a certain time , and returning to Russia , when they saw that they had lost it , they grew melancholy , sick , and died at last of sor // row for their lost liberty . This sentiment does honor to human nature . This sentiment teaches that man does not wish to possess any thing when he can not possess himself and this conscious sentiment of himsell ; those unformed interior revelations of his right , move him always , in spite of those materialist doctrines which have in vain attempted to corrupt him , to be the eternal champion of liberty . At last came the war of 1854 , and with it the proof that the soldiers born in slavery could not measure argis with the soldiers born in liberty . The idea which had so animated the most illustrious writers of the Russian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , penetrated even into the minds of their most implacable persecutors , and drew along with it their most bitter enemies . The new czar came to the throne with this aureole for his diadem . The rumor that serfdom was to be abolished arrived at the cabins of the serfs when as yet it had not been heardin the cabinets of diplomacy . Many , as if a mysterious voice called them to a new life , rose , took their wives and their children , and went out like the Israelites of Egypt under the guidance of God , through the immense and desert stepPes , anxiously seeking the promised land of liberty . The soldiers went out to find them , stood with bayonets in their way , forced them to return to their lands and to submit again to their former slavery . But at last liberty resounded in their ears , like the Easter song in the ears of Faust , restoring them to life . The czar spoke , and twenty millions of men were made happy under the weight of their chains . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of their riches , but also a paPt of their political influence . Their jurisdiction , the right of administering justice , one of their highest prerogatives , was weakened in their hands . On the 20th of November , 1857 , appeared the rescript which announced emancipation . The proprietor was to preserve his property , his land , and the serf was to acquire the quantity of land indispensable to his habitation and support . The nobility , so submissive to the empire while the empire was an oppressor , demanded with a voice of opposition , and even of threat , the formation of committees which should bring the interests of the proprietor into harmony with the ideas of the prince . A period of twelve years was conceded to the nobles to receive the payment of the peasant 's hut and plot of ground , but at the same time they were charged to solve in these committees appointed by themselves all problems , and to pacify all difficulties , taking account of reciprocal interests . One of the bases essential to emancipation was that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in committees , and the committees began to oppose delays to the reform . The emperor cut short all these dclays , emancipating at one blow , and by one proclamation , the slaves of the imperial domains . This act profoundly wounded the nobility . The aristocracy of all European peoples have believed that it was an easy and practicable thing to attain political liberty and neglect social reform . They bave believed that they could have the press and the parliament , leaving only to the serfs the lash and chains . They have believed that ideas could remain , like floating vapors , on high in the mind , and not take form below in the reality . They have believed it possible to amalgamate liberty and slavery . And when they imagined that their political aspirations could never reach the slaves fastened to the soil , they have , unfortunately for themselves , found that the slave was socially emancipated out of hatred to them by the despots themselves , by the enemies of all . Thus in the years 1848 and 1849 , when the nobles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their country and for liberty , not remembering that plebeians had also need of liberty and country , the Emperor of Austria broke the feudal fetters of the peasantry , and conciliated to himself the people , inspiring them with his own sentiments of resentment to the nobility . The Emperor Alexander had brought a revolution to pass in Russia , a revolution through which , in all the Muscovite dominions , millions of men entered resolutely into the exijoyment of true life with the enjoyment of liberty , finding in this the foundation of social existencethat is to say , their independent personality . This social revolution brought about an important political revolution . The barbarous regimen of the previous censorship was essentially modified . It was replaced by a regimen not less authoritative , but more lenient , of official warnings , of fines , of the suppression of journals . The system of strangling ideas is , after all , a progress upon the system of preventing their birth . Changes were also brought about in the judicial system through the loss of the jurisdictionary rights of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is true that the government reserved for itself the arbitrary right to declare what crimes should or should not go to the jury ; but the root of the institution exists , and from this root will sprout new reforms . The provincial nasemblies have seen their privileges enlarged and their administrative influence increased . Modifications have been introduced into the worst practices of the bureaucracy , and some breathing space is now allowed to this oppressed people . Despotism has become a little ameliorated , and with the amelioration of despotism there is something of hope for the souls bowed under the ancient slavery . There are those who // cherish a presentiment of the appearance of new states-general , wlio demand for Russia free speech and the tribune . But the privilege of free speech will never be voluntarily conceded by despotism , for speech , animated by ideas , is the Word of social redemption . The revolutionary movement has not been on this account brought to an end . The human spirit has an infinite , an inextinguishable thirst for progress , and at each reform which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Rnssian people demonstrated that they had not , in the manner of the Roman people , completely lost in their chains the idea of their rights . When the barbarous tribes were advanciug , and the Roman empire was falling , the C*esars cried from their crumbling thrones , in the despair of shipwreck , " Liberty ! liberty ! " The Roman people , accustomed to five centuries of slavery , inked themselves and inked each other , " Liberty ! liberty ! What is this liberty * " They had lost even the consciousness of their rights . The Russian people loved and accepted liberty as the gift of Heaven , and they rejoiced at obtaining it on that soil wet with their sweat and their tears . The idea fought its course perseveringly . Hertzen , Ogarefi ; from their exile , never ceased their blows against the decaying despotism , the convicted and confessed author of the misfortunes of Russia . But as despotism can not exist without exciting conflicts , the war with Poland came . Dazzled by the recent emancipation of Italy , Poland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The revolutionary Russian publicists mourned over the misfortunes of Poland , and demanded for this invincible nationality justice and autonomy . Hatred of Poland is in Russia a national hate . The Russians still remember those times in which they were slaves of the Poles . They belleve that the opposition of the Poles to their own Russification is fundamentally an infamous and scandalous treason to the Selavic race . They call themselves the democrats of their race , and call the Poles the aristocrats , the feudal lords . Consequently they think that any defense of Poland is a defense of military feudalism and of theocracy . The exiled republicans in London and in Geneva can not share this sentiment ; the Occidental spirit envelops them like the air , and from the Western point of view Poland is a nation of martyrs , a nation three times quartered , a nation whose indomitable vitality excites wonder , and which has the right to embody itself and sit down among the nations of Europe . Some of these principles shine vividly in the works and articles of the Russian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maledictions . The national writer whose anger took the proportions of the anger of a whole people , whose writings were the writings of a whole race , capable of waking from their graves with his fiery speech the bones of the Russians enslaved by Poles , and capable also of preachlug a crusade of extermination against the Catholics in the manner of the Catholic crusade against the Albigenses  --  the writer of this force , of this power , the director and inspiration of the Gazette of Moscow , was named Katkolf . He presented to the eyes of his enthusiastic readers the ministry of this Selavic race in the world to carry its pure blood , its luminous spirit , its free personality , its social discipllne , to the Western races , which needed a renovation of their life . For this end the czar is like the chief on horseback of a race in arms , and Poland like a soldier of the van-guard deserting to the enemy , to the emperors and popes of the West . It was necessary to correct or to kill this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shootings in the public places of Warsaw , the violation of churches , the/burning of forests , and represented Mouravief in Poland as an exterminating angel , fulfilling , like the angel of the Apocalypse , the mandates of the Eternal . The unfortunate Polish revolution conferred great popularity upon the Pan-Selavist writer ; but the fury of his passions led him beyond the scope of his own intention . Katkoff has greatly admired the institutions of Great Britain , yet he has fallen into Russian Byzantinism . He was educated in Germany , and his hatred to the West has led him to hate the home of his mind . He possessed an independent reason , and he has submitted it to Greek orthodoxy . Representing the sentiment of his race , he has not purified it . He has followed it with fatal blindness , and has himself assisted in blending it with his own prejudices . At the same time with the war with Poland occurred the fires of Russia . The flames burst out in every direction ; from the populous suburbs of St. Petersburg to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if invisible furies , torch in hand , were ravaging the whole extent of the nation . At the same time that these conflagrations devastated the land innumerable republican manifestations moved and alarmed the public mind ; and that nothing should be lacking to the confusion , the students began to mutiny in the universities . The republican party was denounced by Katkoff as a disturber of the peace , as composed of rebels and incendiaries . The poet Michaileff sent to Siberia , and dying there , the journalist Tchernychevski imprisoned in a fortress , the unfortunate Martianoff , a serg who , having attained the emancipation of his body , aspired to the emancipation of his soul , encountering in this new ambi // tion every kind of woe , show plainly enough that despotism , finding itself criticised and urged onward , felt kindling anew within it the implacable fnry of the Czar Nicholas . To these misfortunes of the Russian revolutionary party succeeded others , which excited still more against it and its partisans the old Muscovite rage . One day there was a terrible crime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a serf who thrust aside the pistol saved the life of the czar . Public opinion imagined that the regicide was a Pole , but he turned out to be a Russian of the revolutionary party . Hence ensued new fury in the press toward the revolutionists , and new persecutions against the liberals . The idea which has gained ground and general acceptation is that of Mgr . Milutin , the idea of the revolutionary czar , the democratic czar , the czar opposing the aristocracy and protecting the people like the Roman C*esars . But the revolutionary party is not satisfied with this ideal , and pursues indefatigably , in secret societies , in the columns of a half-liberated press , and in exile , the glorious vindication of liberty and the necessary preparation for the republic . Russia is the land of paradoxes . Under the dominion of an intolerant church the most discordant sects are swarming-some who interpret the Bible for themselves , in the Protestant manner ; others who wait , like the Jews , the Messiah who is to liberate their race ; many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good and ill over nature in equal power , and others who practice the barbarous mutilation of Origen ; some who flee to the deserts , and there light the fagots in which fanatics consume themselves ; many who believe the New Testament a forgery and the Old one lost , and Christ still living , wandering over the earth - who believe that Peter III . still lives , an incarnation of the Messiah who will soon redeem the world ; and other sects to whom the human spirit has as yet brought none of its enlightenment , holding their ears to the earth , and waiting silently the supreme moment in which the heavens are to vanish like a vapor , the planet to be scattered like a heap of ashes amidst the flaming swords of the exterminating angels , and the wrath of God spilled like a vast ocean of gali over all the worlds . And while under an intolerant church there is this swarm of sects , under an immense C*esarism stretching from the Mediterranean to the pole , touching the White Sea of the north and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over an immense portion of the planet , penetrates to the centre of the two great Asiatic and European continents , which counts under its sceptre the most varied races  --  the German , who glories in his European character , and the Mongol , who proudly preserves his Asi atic character , the Lapp , of the pole and the Tartar of the steppe , the Greek , the most illustrious race of the past , and the Selave , which aspires to be the most iliustrious race of the future-under a vast C*esarism armed at every point , defended by great armies , there are unceasing reunions of enthusiastic apostles , obscure , disarmed , writing or speaking in secret and in exile , but who make their tyrants tremble , because they have an irrepressible force , the force of an idea , whose virtue must convert , sooner or later , legions of servile races into one federation , into one democracy , into one free and humanitarian republic .                  @ @ @
