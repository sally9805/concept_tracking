txt Seldom have these columns told . a sadder story than that which was revealed in a brief paragraph - which appeared on Monday . It recorded the death of a clerk of eighteen by his own hand . He had been detected stealing five dollars ' worth of goods from his employer , and a search after death brought to light the cause of his theft and selfdestruction . In his possession were letters from a person in Lowell who had a hold . upon him , and from time to time " put on the screw . " Unless money or goods were sent , a dreadful revelation was to be made . The unhappy boy could . at length bear it no longer , and put an end to his life . There are crimes for which banging seems far too good , and black-mailing is emphatically one of them . We have repeatedly , during the past five years , referred to instances of this description , and it is beyond a doubt that they are far from uncommon . If people in such straits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the horns , they would be amply rewarded , for they may rest assured that no trouble , no shame , can be so intolerable as the living under the rack of a relentless black-mailer . THACItERAY tells us bow Col. Esmond 's old acquaintance , honest Tom Trett , who had sold his company , married a wife , and turned merchant , was dreadfully gloomy for a time , though living in a fine house and carrying on a great trade , to all appearance . At length Esmond saw his friend 's name in the Gazette as a bankrupt , and a week after this circumstance the bankrupt walked into Mr. Esmond 's lodging with a face perfectly radiant with good . humor , and . as jolly and careless as when they had . sailed from Southampton ten years before . " This bankruptcy , " says Tom , " has been hanging over my head these three years ; the thought hath prevented my sleeping , and I have looked at poor Polly 's head on ' tother pillow , and then toward my razor on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to myself , and so give my woes the slip . But now we are bankrupts . Tom Trett pays as many shillings in the pound as be can ; his wife has a little cottage at Fulham , and her fortune secured to herself . I am neither afraid of bankrupt nor of creditor , and for the last six . months have slept easy . " Wise reflections , which should be laid to heart . But it may be objected , " Oh , Tom Trett 's trouble was only pecuniary . " But even to this there is an answer not devoid of comfort . It has been well observed that lot the worst arrive , it will reach the victim as something very different from what he imagined . The crash comes ; nothing could ' or did avert it ; it is hero , and he is a beggar . Worse than all , he is disgraced . Deeds come to light which cause him to blush deeply when revealed , although he blushed but slightly perhaps when doing them . Everything , then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is face to face with it the . terror vanishes . His strength is greater , his sorrow less . Even the shame is not so terrible as imagination pictured it His wife and children do not shrink from him , the dog licks his hand , the tradesman is obsequious , the heart still beats , and . heaven is above all . Even should self-love carry its pain to the grave , and . the memory of the catastrophe overshadow his remaining years , he has still ' the consolation of having purchased life by enduring thus much pain , and has fulfilled . serious responsibilities to those dependent on him . Can not some of those now greasing under a pressure get strength from such reflections There have been men who have passed long years of crashing agony under threats of charges perfectly false . A case came to light some years ago revealing how au elderly banker , a highly-nervous man , had thus endured infernal tortures . At length , driven to despair by the constantly-increasing demands of his torturers , ho turned upon them and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifelong sentence . With the utmost spirit , an ex-Lord . Lieutenant of Ireland met a like attempt instantly by giving those who made it into custody , thus evincing a courage of the rarest sort , and for lack of which the unfortdnate Lord LONDONDERRY , better known as Lord CASTLEREAGH , is Strongly suspected to have destroyed himself . It is better to face an unjust charge , or even a just one , - with frankness and courage than to allow all life to be poisoned by it .
