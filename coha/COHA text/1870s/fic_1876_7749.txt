Dodge , Mary Abigail , 1833-1896 : REVELLING. from Revelling ( 1876 ) Come to my Christmas feast , I have spread you Christmas cheer ; The scarlet holly hath lent her glow , And the fragrant oil burns clear . Valor , and Beauty , and Love , Gather around my board ! Let my roof-tree ring with your revelling , Nor my vintage be vainly poured . I am Lord of wassail and will ; Crown ye the brimming bowl ! Here 's a lilt to the beat of your lissome feet , And a health to the drooping soul . Do I hear a foot-fall ? You have come at my call ! Silken soft is your tread in my oaken hall . And before you enter your breath of perfume Fills with its fragrance my empty room . Aha ! little sister , thrice welcome to-night , ' T is many a year since you passed from my sight ; Rest at last in your vacant chair  --  All the waning summers it waited there . Methinks your cheek is a thought too white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light . O sweet little sister , how gayly we played Beneath the balm gilead 's flickering shade ! I can see the gleam of your twinkling feet In the soft , dense orchard grass , And the clover droops its purple head , Dew-laden , as you pass ; Again from my side you dart away , And defy me to follow after , Again from the heaps of new-mown hay Steals up your smothered laughter . Or , a tiptoe you stand by the garden wall , Where the morning shadows linger , Dimpling such dainty , resisting lips , With the tip of a rosy finger . Is it a robin , or is it the breeze , Rustling up there in the apple-trees ? Was it a fairy you watched so long , With wistful , peering eyes , In the morning-glory 's crimson cup , Ere the sun had gathered its incense up For his worship in the skies ? O dear little sister ! the day is gone by  --  I think I remember you still and white  --  I think all the sunshine paled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Was it not true , this pretty ring Of yellow silken hair , I kissed from that low-lying head , With tender , needless care ? Surely the prescient hand of Death I blest in after times , That led your stainless soul beyond The shadows of my crimes . Crimes ! Crimes ! Who speaks that word ? Who dares at banquet of mine ? Oh , raise , little sister , your goblet of gold , I pledge you in foaming wine ! What statelier step , what queenlier form ? A lady of the land ! Right royal greeting is thy meed , and seat at my right hand . Stay ! Stay ! I know the eyes that glow beneath that matchless brow ; I know the smile on those dear lips  --  my mother ! it is thou ! O noble name ! and nobly worn alike through woe and weal . Here , mother , as a little child , low at thy feet I kneel . I pray thee lay upon my head thy tender hand once more ; I pray thee press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dear love , that for my childish pain could find a quick relief  --  Dear heart , that smiled upon my joy , nor spurned my simple grief . O mother 's eyes , why gaze so long upon my upturned face ? O mother 's smile on mother 's lips , why did you leave no trace ? Turn , turn away that mournful look ; it rends my secret soul ! Relentless , o'er my shrinking heart , the waves of memory roll . There is a sharper pang than death 's  --  a woe that brings no tears , But graves the brow with deeper lines than patriarchal years . O mother , did my cruel hand work thus upon thy youth ? Speak , mother , did my madness bring such guerdon to thy truth ? I hear , as in a troubled dream , the winds of autumn rave  --  The restless whirl of withered leaves above a new-made grave . I thought a shadow hid the sun forever from my sight . Oh , happy that it was a dream since you are here to-night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you being here to-night ! Ring out the stirring song ! Pour forth the rosy wine ! I will to-night all hearts be light : To-night , to night is mine . Beautiful , beautiful shining one , Robed in the light of a softened sun , Gliding hither with noiseless tread , Who bows not before thee is ill-bested . Lo ! thus I welcome thee , peerless guest , Crowning with garlands the Queen of the Feast ! Nay , far and cold it seems at my side  --  Only near in my heart  --  O sweeter , my bride ! I fold thee in to my burning breast , Thou shalt calm the pulse of its wild unrest . Methinks , my darling , your lips are chill . Your heart against mine is strangely still . It used to throb at my downward look , And I read your face as a luminous book  --  That face is calmer and whiter now Than when you whispered your marriage vow . Then it was hushed from your fear 's excess , But I was trembling with tenderness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Distantly glowing , a tremulous star ; Gray and bitter the years have been ,  --  The pitiless years that rolled between . Why did that glory depart so soon ? Who quenched the light of your fair young June ? Heart of my heart , life of my life , Here I behold you , beautiful wife ; Yet I thought I witnessed you , day by day , Fade like the roses of summer away . I thought you went down to the silent dust  --  Ah , me ! the woe ! I thought you went up to the heaven of heavens , Long ago . Did the heart you should always have reigned within Open its portals to deadly sin ? Did the demon that lurks in the red wine 's glow Nerve my arm for a murderous blow ? Silent , serene , you are standing there , And yet , O God ! I can almost swear , Could frenzy itself such measure deal , I saw the gleam of the flashing steel ! O fearful gleam ! O hideous dream ! O flashing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dream , Since you are here to-night ; That I may deem it was a dream , You being here to-night . Avaunt ! ye Phantoms of the Brain , Avaunt ! nor mock my soul ; To-night , to-night , my heart is light , I crown the brimming bowl . Sweet friends , to you , the tried and true , I pour the purple flood  --  Ho ! dastards ! slaves ! Ho ! hellish race ! Who hath wrought me this foul disgrace ? Wine ! wine !  --  It is blood ! Gone  --  gone  --  gone  --  The mirth and the music of life ; Valor , and Beauty , and Love ; Sister , and Mother , and Wife . No sound but the clanking of iron chains , With which my jailers have bound me ; No sight but the gloom of the prison walls Which hopelessly close around me . Far away by the sounding sea , Stern in a stately home , A lonely watcher is waiting for one Who nevermore shall come . I know in what window o'erlooking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in vain . It hath glimmered long ; But my prison walls are high and strong , And Death is the warder grim . O lonely watcher , quench that light That gleams on the ocean wave ! Ere another moon rounds full and white The earth shall witness a doleful sight  --  You have no power to save ; And I , the heir of a noble name , Last of a house of princely fame , Freed from my burden of sin and shame , Shall rest in a nameless grave .
