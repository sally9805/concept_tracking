Ward , Elizabeth Stuart Phelps , 1844-1911 : THAT NEVER WAS ON SEA OR LAND . from Poetic studies ( 1875 ) I dreamed that same old dream again last night ; You know I told you of it once , and more : The sun had risen , and looked upon the sea , And turned his head and looked upon the shore , As if he never saw the world before . What mystic , mythic season could it be ? It was October with the heart of May . How count they time within love 's calendar ? Dreaming or waking , I can only say It was the morning of our wedding-day . I only know I heard your happy step , As I sat working on my wedding-day Within my usual place , my usual task ; You came and took the pen , and laughing , " Nay ! " You said , " no more this morning ! Come away ! " And I , who had been doing dreamily Within my dream some fitful thing before , ( My pen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Drew breath ,  --  dropped all my work upon the floor , And let you lead me mutely to the door , And out into a place I never saw , Where little waves came shyly up and curled Themselves about our feet ; and far beyond As eye could see , a mighty ocean swirled . " We go , " you said , " alone into the world . " But yet we did not go , but sat and talked Of usual things , and in our usual way ; And now and then I stopped myself to think ,  --  So hard it is for work-worn souls to play ,  --  Why , after all it is our wedding-day ! The fisher-folk came passing up and down , Hither and thither , and the ships sailed by , And busy women nodded cheerily ; And one from out a little cottage came , With quiet porches , where the vines hung high , And wished us joy , and " When you 're tired , " she said , " I bid you welcome ; come and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest , and left Us only out of all the world to be Idle and happy by the idle sea . And there were colors cast upon the sea Whose names I know not , and upon the land The shapes of shadows that I never saw ; And faintly far I felt a strange moon stand ,  --  Yet still we sat there , hand in clinging hand , And talked , and talked , and talked , as if it were Our last long chance to speak , or you to me Or I to you , for this world or the next ; And still the fisherwomen busily Passed by , and still the ships sailed to the sea . But by and by the sea , the earth , the sky , Took on a sudden color that I knew ; And a wild wind arose and beat at them . The fisherwomen turned a deadly hue , And I , in terror , turned me unto you , And wrung my wretched hands , and hid my face . " O , now I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 've talked , and talked , and talked the livelong day , Like strangers , on the day that we were wed ; For I remember now that you were dead ! " I woke afraid : around the half-lit room The broken darkness seemed to stir and creep ; I thought a spirit passed before my eyes ; The night had grown a thing too dread for sleep , And human life a lot too sad to weep . Beneath the moon , across the silent lawn , The garden paths gleamed white ,  --  a mighty cross Cut through the shadowed flowers solemnly : Like heavenly love escaped from earthly dross , Or heavenly peace born out of earthly loss . And wild my uncalmed heart went questioning it : " Can that which never has been ever be ? " The solemn symbol told me not , but lay As dumb before me as Eternity , As dumb as you are when you look at me . Ward , Elizabeth Stuart Phelps , 1844-1911 : DIVIDED . from Poetic studies ( 1875 ) If an angel that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shaft of quiet moonlight that rests upon the floor ; And if she should stir and stand With a lily in her hand , And that smile of treasured stillness that she wore , Should I , falling at her feet , Brush or kiss her garments sweet ? Would their lowest least white hem upon me unworthy , fall ? Or would she guarded , stand , Drop the lily in my hand , And go whispering as she vanished , " This is all " ? Ward , Elizabeth Stuart Phelps , 1844-1911 : THE LOST WINTER . from Poetic studies ( 1875 ) Deep-hearted as an untried joy The warm light blushes on the bay , And placid as long happiness The perfect sky of Florida . Silent and swift the gulls wheel by ,  --  Fair silver spots seen flittingly To sparkle like lost thoughts , and dip And vanish in a silver sea . And green with an immortal spring The little lonely islands stand ; And lover-like , the winds caress The fresh-plucked roses in my hand . And sweet with all the scents of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And passionate with harvest calm , Dawns the strange face of Christmas-day . O vanished world of ache and chill ! If purple-cold the shadows blow Somewhere upon the shrunken cheeks Of wan , tormented drifts of snow ; And if , beneath the steady stare Of a pale sunset 's freezing eye , The coming tempest , lurking , stabs The lonely traveller hurrying by ,  --  1 What art can make me understand ? What care I , can I care to know ? Star-like , among the tender grass , The little white wild-flowers show ! There is no winter in the world ! There is no winter anywhere ! Earth turns her face upon her arm , And sleeps within the golden air . If once within the story told  --  Of peace or pain , of calm or strife  --  The clear reveald sequencs Of every finished human life , It chanceth that the record reads : This wanderer , something torn and tossed By certain storms he had passed through , And something faint and chilly , lost Just here a little while the sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his life the roots Of spring eternal stir and start ; Could not one blessed little while , For very happiness , believe That anywhere upon God 's earth Souls could be cold and worn and live ,  --  That blessed once a glory were Enough , I think , to crown one 's days . O swift-departing days of youth , Lend me your evanescent grace Of fancy , while my graver years Like happy children rise and bless The shadow of the memory of Love 's sweet and helpless selfishness ! Ah , many , many years shall learn To blush and bloom as young years may , But only once the soul forget All else but its own Florida ! Ward , Elizabeth Stuart Phelps , 1844-1911 : APPLE-BLOSSOMS. from Poetic studies ( 1875 ) Cold Care and I have run a race , And I , fleet-foot , have won A little space , a little hour , To find the May alone . I sit beneath the apple-tree , I see nor sky nor sun ; I only know the apple-buds Are opening one by one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A lecture or a song To hear with you ; and yet I thought To find my whole life long Too short to bear the happiness That bounded through the day , That made the look of apple-blooms , And you , and me , and May ! For long between us there had hung The mist of love 's young doubt ; Sweet , shy , uncertain , all the world Of trust and May burst out . I wore the flowers in my hair , Their color on my dress ; Dear Love ! whenever apples bloom In Heaven , do they bless Your heart with memories so small , So strong , so cruel-glad ? If ever apples bloom in Heaven , I wonder are you sad ? Heart ! yield thee up thy fruitless quest Beneath the apple-tree ; Youth comes but once , love only once , And May but once to thee ! Ward , Elizabeth Stuart Phelps , 1844-1911 : RAIN . from Poetic studies ( 1875 ) What can the brown earth do , Drenched and dripping through To the heart , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rain ? What can the hurt life do , Healing through and through , Caught and captured by the slow increase Of the peace That cometh after pain ? I would not miss the flower Budded in the shower That lives to lighten all the wealthy scene Where rain has been , That blossoms after pain ! Ward , Elizabeth Stuart Phelps , 1844-1911 : PETRONILLA. from Poetic studies ( 1875 ) Of Peter 's daughter , it is said , men told , While yet she breathed , a tale as sad as life , As sweet as death ; which , now she sleeps , has lent The borrower Time its lighter tints , and holds Only the shadowed outline of a grief Before our eyes . Thus much remains . She lived , Yet lived not ; breathed , yet stifled ; ate , but starved ; The ears of life she had , but heard not ; eyes , But saw not ; hands , but handled neither bud Nor fruit of joy : for the great word of God , In some dim crevice of eternal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her  --  for her  --  call it what we may , And , bending to his will unerringly , As bends the golden feather of the grain Before the footsteps of the mailed west-wind , Since childhood she had lain upon her bed In peace and pain , nor had ever raised her body Once to its young lithe length , to view the dawn Of all her young lithe years , nor had once laid Her little feverish feet upon the face Of the cool , mocking , steadfast floor which laughed When other girls , with other thinking done Some time in Heaven about their happy names ,  --  Set like a song about their happy names ,  --  Tripped on it like a trill . As one may see Upon the hushed lips of a Sabbath-day A church door sliding softly as a smile , To let the solemn summer sunshine in To dream upon , but neither guess nor tell The dusky week-day secrets which the dome Whispers the darkened niches and the nave , Where in the purple silence which they love The marble angels sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they do on Monday mornings ? ) So slides the tale on Petronilla , left Upon a certain dull , wan day alone , Her face turned on her pillow to the room Wherein the wise and faithful met ( for faith With wisdom married then ; none forbid the banns Within the temple of the hearts of men ) , To break their bread with Peter , and discourse Of all the sacred , secret things ; the hopes , The fears , the solemn ecstasies , and dreams , And deeds , which held life in the arms of death , For the first namers of the name of Christ . And lying there , at rest , adream , asleep , She scarce could tell her state , so dim it was , Such lifeless reflex of the hueless day , A voice struck Petronilla ,  --  Peter 's voice , Solemn and mighty as a lonely wave Upon an untrod shore . " O brethren , hark ! Ye know not what ye say ; your minds are dark . O ye of little faith , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show you . Watch with me , For he is here . Abase your heads ; he lives ; It is his will I do his will , and show The power of God in that he once hath lived And died , but lives to work his glory still ,  --  To work his wish , unargued , undisturbed , Without resistance or appeal or blame , Upon the creature which his hands have made . Were it his choice to raise yon maiden now From out the coffin of her bed , and bid Her step ,  --  or live ; it means the same ,  --  what then ? Is that too much for him to do ? What now ? Is that too hard ? Increase your faith ! Behold ! " Awake , asleep , adream , or all , or none , What aild Petronilla ? The world spun Like a frail spindle in a woman 's hands . And all her breath went from her , and her sight , At the faint fancy of her father , still , Alone , alight within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a vision been Of a choice taper set to spend itself , And blaze and waste upon an altar 's brow , Not taught nor knowing wherefore ,  --  burning out , Since that ' s a taper 's nature , and enough . And faint the fancy of his face , if his It were . And faint the fancy of his voice , Which lost its way , so Petronilla thought , Or twice or thrice , before it bridged the bit Of fanciful , faint sunlight which crawled in Between his pitying , awful face and hers , And " Petronilla , " sighing softly , said , And " Petronilla ! " ringing cried , " Arise ! " Now , in the name of Christ who lived for thee , I bid thee live , and rise , and walk ! " Erect , Unaided , with a step of steel , she rose . What should she do but rise ? And walked ; how else ? For God had said it , sent it , dropped it down , The sweetest , faintest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet dropped far Below the dizzy dancing of her eyes , Adown the listening floor ; and fancying How all the rising winds crept mutely up The court , and put their arms around her neck For joy ; and how for joy the sun broke through The visor which the envious day had held Across his happy face , and kissed her hair ; And fancying faintly how those men shrank back , And pulled their great gray beards at sight of her , And nodded , as becometh holy men , Approvingly , at wonders , as indeed They ' d bade her walk themselves ,  --  so musingly , As she had been a fancy of herself , She found herself live , warm and young , within The borders of the live , warm world . But still , As faintly as a fancy fell the voice Of Peter : " Serve us , daughter , at the board . " And dimly as a fancy served she them , And sweetly as a fancy to and fro Across the gold net of the lightening day She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tangled into the happy afternoon , Tangled into the sense of life and youth , Blind with the sense of motion , leap of health , And wilderness of undiscovered joy , Stood Petronilla . Down from out her hand A little platter dropped , and down upon Her hands her face dropped , broken like the ware Of earth that sprinkled all the startled floor , And down upon her knees her face and hands Fell , clinging to each other ; crouching there At Peter 's feet ,  --  her father 's feet ,  --  she gave One little , little longing cry ,  --  no more ; And like the fancy of a cry ,  --  so faint ; And like the angel of a cry ,  --  so brave . For Peter 's face had lifted like the heavens , Above the presence of the holy men , Above the maiden serving in the sun , Above  --  God help him !  --  God 's own princely gift , The pity which a father bears his child . And far and calm as heaven is shone his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his voice , Yet held a cadence like a prisoned pain , As one twice-wrecked upon the same bare shore . " The Lord hath chosen Petronilla . Hearken ! Whom he will choose , he chooseth : some to honor , Some to dishonor ; this to be and bear , And that to dare and do ; these bear his swords , And these his chains . Nay , but , O man ! what then ? Who art thou that shalt mould the mood of God , Or search his meaning , or defy his will ? On Petronilla he will work his power . O , what is Petronilla ? What am I ? Nay , nay , my child , I tremble ; this is wrong . Thou moanest ; that is strange , for he is here To show his glory on thy young , bent head , And little smile and hands . O , lift them up Before him , while I speak the word he sent . For , by the love of him who died for thee , Commandment comes ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon thy patient bed Again ; for what am I , and what art thou ? So turn and lay thee down . Behold it , Lord ! ' T is finished , Master ! Petronilla , go . God 's hand is on thee , O my child ; God 's grace Go with thee . Brethren , see ! His will is done , And shall be done upon us evermore . " And there the wonder fell , so runs the tale ; For Petronilla turned her dumb as death , And laid her down upon her empty bed , Where a long sunbeam warm as life had curled ; And crept within it , white as sifted snow , Nor ever raised her slender length again , Nor ever dropped her foot upon the floor , Nor ever felt the winds from up the court Weave arms about her neck ; nor ever found Herself entangled more within the gold Warp of the moving , merry world ; nor once Again knew even the pallid happiness Which comes of serving holy men ; nor felt The leap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legend breaks : what good or ill Struck arms or folded wings about the heart Of Petronilla ; how fared she , prisoned Behind the bars of that untragic woe , The bearing of an old familiar fate From which long use has rubbed the gilding out , To which the wonted hours have set themselves So sorely they can neither smile nor sigh To think of it , but only drop the lids Across their leaden eyes for wondering What a glad chance an unworn grief must be ; What solemn musings marshalled in his mind Who was the Rock on which Christ built a church Of such as love nor son nor daughter more Than him ,  --  we know not ; rude our guesses are , And rough ; and mar the shady , sacred hush Which the raised fingers of the years enforce .

And then if it might be Appointed unto me ( God knows how sweet to me ! ) To plunge into the sharp surprise Of burning battle 's blood and dust and cries , And face the hottest fire for you , And fight the bitter fight for two !

" from Poetic studies ( 1875 ) I saw the prettiest picture Through a garden fence to-day , Where the lilies look like angels Just let out to play , And the roses laugh to see them All the sweet June day . Through a hole behind the woodbine , Just large enough to see ( By begging the lilies ' pardon ) Without his seeing me , My neighbor 's boy , and Pharaoh , The finest dog you 'll see , If you search from Maine to Georgia , For a dog of kingly air , And the tolerant , high-bred patience The great St. Bernards wear , And the sense of lofty courtesy In breathing common air .

The lilies will not tell ; The roses shake with laughter , But keep the secret well ; The woodbine nods importantly . " Who spoke ? " cried Franko . " Tell ! " The trees do not speak English ; The calm great sky is dumb ; The yard and street are silent ; The old board-fence is mum ; Pharaoh lifts his head , but , ah ! Pharaoh too is dumb . Grave wrinkles on his eyebrows , Hand upon his knee , Head bared for close reflection , Lighted curls blown free ,  --  The child 's soul to the brute 's soul Goes out earnestly .

Across my mind , like idle wind , A lost thought beateth lazily . Adream , afloat , my little boat And I alone steal out to sea . One vanished year , O Lost and Dear ! You rowed the little boat for me . Ah , who can sing of anything With none to listen lovingly ? Or who can time the oars to rhyme When left to row alone to sea ?

Ward , Elizabeth Stuart Phelps , 1844-1911 : GIVING OF THANKS . from Poetic studies ( 1875 ) Deep in the brooding shadow of thy wing , Hidden and hushed and harbored here , My soul for very stillness can not sing ; A word would rend the silence , and a tear Of joy affront the sense of cool and dark and rest . Unto the music of thine endless calm Sing thou then for me ! Thy glad child Sheltered and saved , wrapped all about from harm , Happy to be helpless ,  --  and thy child ; Can only turn and sleep within the blessed rest , Can only drop the gifts which thou hast given Back in thy lavish hand .

Distrust you the fable of old , Of the envious Goddess who set her On to defeat by tempting her soul With the wily bright roll Of an apple of treacherous gold . Distrust the story which tells you She loitered with willing , shy feet .

Where the September sunshine lay Languidly as a lost desire Upon a sumach 's fading fire , Where calm some pallid asters trod , Indifferent , past a golden-rod , Beside a gray-haired thistle set ,  --  A perfect purple violet . I wonder what it were to miss The life of spring , and live like this ? To bloom so lone , to bloom so late , And were it worth the while to wait So long for such a little day ? And were it not a better way Never , indeed , ( worse might befall , ) To be a violet at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calm when autumn splendors shone , So peaceful midst the blazing flowers , So blessed through the golden hours , So might have bloomed my love for thee .

Ward , Elizabeth Stuart Phelps , 1844-1911 : DESERTED NESTS . from Poetic studies ( 1875 ) I 'd rather see an empty bough ,  --  A dreary , weary bough that hung As boughs will hang within whose arms No mated birds had ever sung ; Far rather than to see or touch The sadness of an empty nest Where joy has been but is not now , Where love has been but is not blest . There is no sadness in the world , No other like it here or there ,  --  The sadness of deserted homes In nests , or hearts , or anywhere .

To walk and talk forevermore , Without a care without a dread , That were enough for you and me !

Somewhere , on a Shore of Silver , ( God be with you on the way ! ) In a sunlight sifted richly From a thousand skies of May , In a dream of June 's white roses , In a chant of waters low , In a glory of red maples , A hush of moonlight upon snow , In the meanings of the sunrise , In the heart of summer rain , In the soul of purple hazes , We will not say good by again . But the tears dash through my dreaming , And the thing I fain would say Falters into this ,  --  this only : God be with you till that day !

And one there is that looketh down to me Less like a face than like a star , for when With closed eyes I would think what it is like I only can remember that it shines . But when I turn again to con and learn Its lineaments like a lesson in my thought , The forehead has the look that marble has When it has drawn the sunlight to its heart . And if St. John had fought the Dragon , then He might have had perhaps such eyes as that ( But still I do not tell you what the eyes Are like , nor can I , and I am not sure , Indeed , that I should tell you if I could ) . O , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never have they dropped before its gaze , And never sunk they down abashed , to hide A glance of which their own light was ashamed . And if an unclean thing had chanced to step Into the presence of such eyes , pierced , scorched , It would have shrunk before their stabs , but ere It could have risen to flee , it would have dropped , And cowered moaning in the dust , because It felt itself a thing they pitied so ! And then the mouth !  --  I never saw a mouth , Another one , that seemed to think and feel At once like this . If haply lips like these Had found a word for which the whole round earth Were waiting , while they spoke the word , I think They ' d quiver most because upon that day The woman that they loved had touched them ,  --  said , " Go speak , my lips , and make me proud ! "  --  the most For that than for the worth of either work or world . And one there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a graver face , and touched A little with a sadness such as that Which might have fallen on the countenance Of Esther in the story , when she left Her throne to perish for her people 's sake ; The sadness of a soul bound fast to bear  --  Whether by fate or choice it knoweth not  --  Within itself the sorrows of a race , A kind , to which it has no gladder tie Than the blind old mystery of kin ; urged on By something in its nature like a cry That will be heard , come life , come death ! to lay Aside the crown , the robe of royalty , And mediate , a suppliant , for its own . If she perish , she must perish !  --  but must go . Though she perish , let her perish !  --  let her go . Soft falls the hair about this other face , Leaving a shadow like a shadow thrown By leafless trees upon a snow-drift 's brow , A slender shelter for the dazzling white . And out from it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ casual gaze , And out from it there leans a flying smile , As one smiles turning slowly from the page In which his heart is left to hear The sweetest interruption in the world More languidly than lovingly . I think You ' d never pause to speculate or guess Which interruption were the dearer fret To her , but only what the lesson was O'er which she bent , and only wonder on If Esther had a smile like that ; and if Her people , when they saw it , understood The half of it ; and if the King will hold , As did Ahasuerus in the time Of old , his sceptre out , and ever call This unqueened Queen in triumph to her throne . And if there were on earth a tenderer strength ? Or if there were a stronger tenderness ? What matters it to me ? for now behold ! That gallery in my longing soul is full , And God himself came up and shut the door .
