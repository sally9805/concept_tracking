txt The Hon. James N. Tyner , First Assistant Postmaster-General , who was in this City yesterday , on being questioned regarding the Prospects of the several Presidential candidates , said he h ad heard.much comment on the dispatches printed in Thursday 's TIMES . " If you want my opinion , " he said , " I am for Gen. Grant in 1880 all the way through . I believe he is the man to win , and that he is the best man that can be nominated . He is the spontaneous choice of the Republicans in almost every part of the Union , and when I say that I do n't mean merely that he is the choice of the politicians , but of the Republican people . It is a matter entirely above and beyond the politicians and managers . The Republican chances of success in 1880 will depend upon New-York State entirely . If this State can be carried for Grant , against Tilden  --  for Tilden is certain to be the Democratic candidate  --  then Grant 's election is seoure beyond question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Republicans of New-York . Speaking from my knowledge and information as to Indiana . I know that with Grant at the head of the ticket the Republicans of that State will guarantee to give him the Electoral vote . As to the whole ticket , my opinion is that Grant and Blaine would be the strongest kind of a combination , and if that can not be had , then I should favor as my next choice , and as being next in strength , Grant and Zachariah Chandler . In my post at Washington I come iu contact with men of intelligence from nearly every part of the country , and I find them almost unanimous for Grant . For six weeks past I have heard no other name spoken of as being sure and safe for our side . Grant , as President again , would be a greater man than ever  --  he would be a very different man from what he was during either his first or his second term . With the experience then gained , and the enlargement and expansion of knowledge and thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be no mistakes to complain of , and he would be influential and popular , both at home and abroad . " Referring to the black exodus from the Southern to the Western States , Gen. Tyner said the movement had not yet assumed proportions which would warrant an expression of opinion concerning it . If the movement continued , it must , of course , affect the South vitally as to her material , and ultimately as to her political , interests . But it would have to assume gigantic proportions to exert such an influence . If only 100,000 or 200,000 negroes should leave the South , ' iv would not make any great difference . So far as lie had learned the feeling of Northern negroes , they were in favor of the movement being assisted . so that their Southern brethren might be beyond the pale of oppression , and they were taking steps to aid the refugees pecuniarily . It was doubtful , however , whether any political support would be given to them , for the migration of a million or two of people from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter . Gen. Tyner said he doubted whether any political party would care to assume the responsibility of stimulating or accomplishing such a revolution in the distribution of population .
