txt Whatever may be the practical effect of Mr. HAY-Es ' Southern policy upon the welfare of the section with which it is immediately concerned , it is plain that there is nothing in the recent conduct of the Democrats of the North to lead to the conclusion that they will profit by it . In fact , if they had started out with the intention of cutting themselves off front taking advantage of any changes which Mr. HAYEs ' plan might temporarily bring about , they could hardly have acted . differently . They have from the first placed themselves in an attitude of blind opposition . They would not concede that anything good , or even tolerable , could come from the President . lie was to be under the guidance of the men who , they said , shaped Gen. GRANT 'S policy . His inaugural was a mere parade of glittering generalities . Ho mirrht think he could change matters , but he would soon find out his mistake . Ho never could withstand the pressure that would be brought to bear upon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planned and profited by the rule of the " carpet-baggers " in the South , held the key of the situation , and as soon as Mr. HAYES began to send in his nominations , he would discover their real strength and his essential weakness . No President could conduct the Government without the aid of the party managers , and the party managers , they assumed , were not in sympathy with Mr. ILkvEs ' policy . Thus they did everything they could to make their Southern allies believe that nothing would come from the new Administration which would help the South , or which the South could accept without stultification and danger of betrayal . It is plain that this lino of argument on the part of the . Northern Democrats would place them in au embarrassing position if Mr. HAvns should carry out the indications of his policy afforded by his inaugural , and especially if lie should do so in the particular form desired by the Southern leaders . Not content , however , with generalization regarding the President 's intentions , the Northern Democratic organs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been making a tremendous uproar over what they are pleased to style his " broken pledges . " They first gave all possible prominence to the reports that Mr. HavEs ' friends had made au agreement to.withdraw the troops from New-Orleans and Columbia , to which agreement Mr. HAVES was a consenting party , in consideration of support given by Southern Democrats to the decisions of the Electoral Commission . They declared that this agreement was distinct and explicit ; that it was made with the intention of deceiving the South ; that it was a part of a general scheme of fraud , of which the proceedings of the Commission were another part ; that the agreement was being deliberately broken , and that the South would find , when it was too late , that its representatives had fastened upon their section an Administration which would bo far worse than that of Gen. GRANT . The folly and short-sightedness of a pot . tioa of these accusations have already been demonstrated . It has been shown that there was no such agreement as was described ; that some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken part in it deny that their course depended on any promises whatever ; that others acted against the count , instead of facilitating it ; that the papers which were alleged to contain the agreement contained nothing about the withdrawal of the troops , and that , final- ly , the President was not in any sense a party to the transaction , such as it was . The Democratic organs , therefore , which have had so much to say about " broken pledges , " find themselves exposed . as the discoverers or inventors of a ridiculous mare 's nest .. That is their position already . ? What it will be if it is found that , after all , the President , without any preliminary bargain , and acting solely on considerations of his duty and the welfare of the country , concludes to withdraw the troops from the capitals of Louisiana and South Carolina , can be readily imagined . There are many indications that the Southern leaders are sick of being made the cat's-paw of the Northern managers , and of playing the part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Observers in the South report that this feeling is very freely expressed , not only by prominent poll ? ticians , organizers and leaders in the " White League , " but by active and . influential men in all classes of Southern society . The conclusion is general that the Northern Democratic managers would rather that the South should not be relieved of the difficulties with which it has contended than that relief should come from Mr. ILyEs ; that these managers would prefer bad government for the South if it could be attributed . to Republicans , to good , government if the Republicans were to receive any of the credit for thelattor . It can not be denied that this conclusion is sustained by the course of the Northern Democrats . It is not easy , therefore , to see , should the Administration be able to bring about an adjustment in South Carolina and Louisiana substantially in acccord with the wishes of the Southern leaders , what sort of an active opposition the Democratic Party will present to the Administration at the called session of Congress in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
