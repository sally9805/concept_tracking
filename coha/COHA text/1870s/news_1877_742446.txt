txt Notwithstanding the fact that the present strike is approaching a speedy and peaceful termination , and all chances or occasions for disturbances ha:Ye  --  receded almost out of sight , there is no relaxation of precautionary measures on the part 9f the authorities , and the city presents as war'like an aspect to-night as at any time during the existing troubles . Detachments of soldiers have been arriving here during the day , and the streets are being patrolled in all directions . It may be that these directing affairs have information not possessed by the public , and that there is really some threatening danger yet to be guarded against by the exercise of the strong military arm of the Government , but to the uninitiated everything seems to be as quiet and orderly as it is habitual for Scranton to be when questions arise between the coal companies and their employes . But whatever may be the cause for the unusual military demonstrations made for the past few nights , it is plain that the miners , as a body , are not contemplating the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To-day has been a busy and important one to the miners , and the question of work or no work has received its quietus for the present . At 10 o'clock this morning two conventions , representing the non-union and union sentiments , were assembled in Hyde Park at the same time . The former delayed action in order to allow the regular union delegates to adopt such measures as would be likely to wind up the strike harmoniously , and thus avoid any subsequent bitterness of feeling between those desiring to prolong the strike and the men who on Saturday determined to break away from the strikers and return to work . The union delegates were in session nearly the entire day , and , after considerable wrangling , determined to shift the responsibility of resuming work upon a mass-meeting to be held in Round Woods to-morrow morning , It is understood that they also resolved to recommend the men to resume work upon the company 's terms . The meeting to-morrow will no doubt he a stormy one , but no question exists as to the final action of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there will he a general resumption of mining as soon as the several mines can be put in order for working . The men of the Briggs shaft voted to go to work at the mass-meeting held by them at the mine to-day ; the Roaring Brook colliery at Dunmore was put in operation with a full complement of ? hands , and the Jermyn mine at Green Ridge began to produce coal with some 50 of the old employes , who seemed glad to get into their old chambers once more . Some of the other colleries which it was expected would also start up remained idle , the miners not coming to time , a. difficulty which will not exist to-morrow . However much the men composing the mass-meeting to-morrow afternoon may dislike the alternative presented to them they will accept it and go to work with as good a grace as may he . The movement of the Hyde Park miners was in nowise hastened by the somewhat rash experiment resorted to by W. W. Scranton . A large number of employes of the Delaware , Lackawanna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's proposal was rejected by the mass-meeting held a week ago Saturday . The men who were discontented on that occasion have since caused their influence to be felt , and they deserve all the credit for giving the strike its deathblow to-day . Gen. Osborne , of Wilkesbarre , arrived in the city this morning , called here by Mayor for consultation with some of the leading men of the city . This afternoon there was an interchange of views between Gen. Thomas Dickson , W. F. Halstead , W. R. Storrs , W. W. Scranton , and Col. Howard . It has not transpired that this council was called to provide for any particularly threatening exigency . The men employed in the rollingmill of the Lackawanna Coal and Iron Company seem to be getting restless now that the miners have resolved to be quiet . These men occupy a locality known as " Shanty Hill , " and it is reported that some outrages wore committed by them last night upon certain parties who were suspected of being willing to return to work in the mill . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " will probably prove to be Scranton 's last throe in the miners ' strike .
