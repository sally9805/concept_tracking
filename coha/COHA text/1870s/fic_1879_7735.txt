Saxe , John Godfrey , 1816-1887 : " ALLOW FOR THE CRAWL . "  --  A HOMILY . from " Allow for the crawl " , in Scrap-book recitation series 1879 You have often no doubt had occasion to note , Though the garment , at first , seemed certain to please , That , after some wearing , the sleeve of your coat Toward the shoulder was crawling , by easy degrees ; And that 's what the clothier , of course , had in mind When he said to a customer , " Long ?  --  not at all ! The sleeve is just right  --  as you 'll presently find  --  In cutting a coat we allow for the crawl ! " The expression was one wholly new to me then ; But it set me a thinking how well it applies , Not merely to coats , but to women and men , In matters of life as they daily arise : Consider the shrinkage in human affairs  --  The promise how great ; the performance , how small ; And , lest disappointment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the crawl ! The statesman who asks for your ballot to save Your country , so rashly imperiled to-day , May covet an office , and not be a knave , Whatever the fierce opposition may say , But the platform to which he so valiantly clings , By which he proposes to stand or to fall  --  " Resolutions " remember , are slippery things  --  And in politics always " allow for the crawl ! " You are deeply in love with the sweetest of girls ; An angel , in fine  --  only wanting the wings ! ( If angels could purchase such beautiful curls ! ) Like a seraph she smiles ; like a siren she sings ! Ah ! splendid and vast are the fancies of youth : But down to plain facts they must finally fall ; And happy the couples who , finding the truth , In conjugal kindness , " allow for the crawl ! " In brief , recollect that in human affairs , In social connections , in travel and trade , In courtship and marriage , in sermons and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; In fine , be a prudent , though generous man : Unfriendly to none , veracious to all ; Believe in your neighbor as well as you can ; But always be sure to " allow for the crawl ! "
