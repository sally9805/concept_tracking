txt The brief cable dispatch announcing the annexation of Darfour to Egypt , indicates one step in a silent change going on in Africa of great historical importance . Through all past history the heart of this vast continent has been almost impervious to all reformatory or progressive movements . Though the earliest known traces of human advance and civilization are on the northern shores of this continent and in the alluvium of its great rivers , and though some of the most powerful of the Christian and Jewish influences emanated from one of its cities , no ray of light seemed ever to penetrate its interior . To Herodotus , as to Baker , there were numerous tribes known in its equatorial regions who never , in all previous history , had advanced beyond the condition of ' cannibals and savages . The great current of human progress seems to have left this Africa alone and unfertilized  --  a perpetual monument of human barbarism . And even in the once civilized portions , Africa presents the almost unique spectacle of a country where Christianity has died out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and equatorial portions have always been " the dark places of the world , " the habitation of cruelty and oppression , the theatre of the most heartsickening scenes of human degradation and inhumanity . Nothing seemed able to reach this " running sore of the world . " All the European efforts to abolish the slave trade only touched the distant coasts ; but here , in these remote wildernesses and about these solitary lakes , the Arab and Turkish traders in human beings had lull sweep , and , by the temptations they could offer to the blacks , turned Central Africa into a pandemonium . Then the various tribes robbed and murdered one another , and used , for luxury or labor , the men and women they carried off from their enemies . Even Mohammedanism , which is certainly a much higher form of religion than Fetichism , failed to bring any improvement to some of these tribes , and , as LIVINGSTONE somewhere says , has only left behind it in Central Africa disease and the slave-trade . England has undoubtedly , on the western and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connected with war and the slave trade , and she is now beginning similar efforts on the eastern coast , at Zanzibar . But all this never reaches the regions near the Wkite Nile and the great equatorial lakes . The only power that could by any possibility benefit this portion of Africa is Egypt . But until the rule of the present ** she has been inextricably involved in the disgraceful profits of the Upper Nile slave trade . The Kh6dive , however , is a man of loftier ambition than his predecessors , and is evidently determined to enlarge his Empire by new conquests in the heart of Africa , while he defers to the voice of the civilized world hi breaking up the horrible slave traffic , from the borders of the N'yanza Lakes through Gondokoro and thus down the Nile . Sir SAMUEL BAKER 'S expedition was the first step in this great conquest and reform . Col. GORDON 'S administration is carrying out the same principles . The ** now nominally rules over a vast empire , stretching above Gondokoro almost to the equator , embracing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pot ton in unlimited quantities , and . filled with all tropical productions . Ivory enough for the wants of the world could be obtained from this immense region . And should he once succeed in establishing here an honest and orderly Government , and in thoroughly uprooting slavery and the slavetrade , a tropical Empire , rich in every production , might here be founded which would scatter its blessings all through interim Africa . The accounts of LIVINGSTONE and SCHWEINFURTR show what a simple , honest , and kindly people are the blacks when away from the influences of the slave-trade . A wise Government in Equatorial Africa would no doubt win the affection of a numerous population . New lines of commerce would ' be formed . The simple tools and manufactures of England and America would pour into these unknown regions , to be exchanged for ivory and other tropical products . With a railroad to Khartoum , and boats to . Gondokoro , and a traveled road to the Victoria Nile , we should see steamers on the grand unknown lakes of Victoria and Albert N'yanza @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One step in this great progress is the conquest of Darfour and Kordofan , a region containing over five millions of inhabitants , lying to the south-west of the Upper Nile . This important district is now annexed to Egypt ; and as one of the great lines of slave traffic was over these provinces , the Kh6tlive , if he be consistent , must put a stop to it hero also , and carry out the same principles of administration which Col. CORDON is following on the Upper Nile . Railroads and European improvements will soon make vast changes iu all these provinces . Christianity had no chance in Central Africa while whites carried on the slave trade . The spirit of European reform opens a new path for religion . There will soon be , we may hope , missionary colonies planted in those dark places of the earth . For experience shows that the solitary missionary has but little influence , , while a colony of selected persons , imbued with the spirit of Christianity , would , in a thousand imperceptible ways , elevate and improve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working as the instrument of progress and of a higher religion . Through Egypt light once more may spread to a world of darkness , and Africa learn of her in modern centuries as Asia and Europe did in ancient .
