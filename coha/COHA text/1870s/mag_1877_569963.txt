ARTICLE VIL-SHALL WOMANHOOD BE ABOLISHED ' ? A WRITER of progressive sympathies remarks that " this question has often been settled by learned exegesis , and argument that appeal 's impregnable . But it does not stay settled . We can not see how to confute the argument , but the conclusion does not harmonize with sanctified common sense . " Whatever may be thought as to the sanctified character of the common sense , which , though itself not clearly in a majority in weight of character if in numbers , persists in practices which both Scripture and reason condemn , the fact thus admitted is a significant feature of the present state of the question before us . Masses of compact argument , certainly deserving of serious attention , have been placed before the public , to be quietly ignored , or met with vague sentiment , or exegesis which excites a smile on the face of every expert . It is not inspiring , to be obliged to repeat again and again considerations , which ought to have been either answered or respected long ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the present case the field is so wide that the more salient points only can be touched in a single article . And in the first place , let the true question be understood . It is not whether the sphere of activity usually occupied by women may not occasionally be considerably enlarged . This has always been conceded . Society was not agitated by the career of Caroline Fry , or that of Mary Lyon , or Catherine Beecher , or Delia Bacon . Nor is the question whether new forms of activity may not offer themselves to women as to men , yet without trenching upon the essential idea of womanhood . Much more than this is now demanded . Women are crowding into the public gaze , and men invite them there , without necessity or special occasion . Publicity for its own sake seems often sought ; praise and flattery are lavished ; vanity and the love of admiration awakened ; the religious conscience is enlisted , and told that this is the natural , if not necessary // expression of love to Christ ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapidly is said to be , that woman has not assumed the harness of public fight ; the laudable ambition of maidenhood is directed into this channel ; a distinctive idea of propriety for woman is denied , and the rule substituted that she should do whatever she is able to do , or whatever can be done for Christ , or whatever she herself thinks fit ; in short , not modification but revolution is aimed at , and is accomplished , to an extent that leaves surprise struggling with grief , in many , if not most of the clearest and most farseeing minds . Those whose eyes are opened to what is going on know , that the conception entertained by our mothers as to what is true womanhood is rapidly dying out . Not merely certain acts or customs , but the very atmosphere of time is changing , and the instinctive sense of delicacy that forms its oxygen , so far as female character is concerned , is charged with poison . The terms of our title , therefore , present the true issue . Shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , be abolished ? The central utterances of the New Testament upon the subject are well known . " Let your women keep silence in the churches , for it is not permitted unto them to speak , but to be under obedience , as also saith the law . And if they will learn anything , let them ask their husbands at home ; for it is a shame for women to speak in the church . " " Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection . But I suffer not a woman to teach nor to usurp authority over the man ; but to be in silence , " 1st Cor. xiv , and 1st Tim . ii . This language is perfectly plain , and has been considered so by the church generally in all ages . Of the twelve or fifteen commentators whom I have consulted - including Bengel , IRosen-Muller , Olshausen , Lange , Bloomfield , Alford , Conybeare and Iiowson , Barnes , IRobinson , and others more recent , not one seems to regard any other exegesis as possible . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretence , grave arguments in favor of polygamy , and the unrestrained intercourse of the sexes ; and against the received principles of geometry , the spheroidal figure of the earth and // the right of individual property , persons are found to make " no " mean " yes " in the passages l ) efore us . Various interpretations of this sort have been proposed , no two of them agreeing ; each more absurd , if possible , than the others , yet some of them elaborate and exhibiting a show of scholarship , but collapsing as utterly , on examination , as ever did bubbles blown from the lips of childhood . The once notorious " NaNsco " argument , for example , giving to that word a meaning which would make Christ , the Apostles , the Holy Spirit , and God the Father himself " babble " thronghont the New Testament , seems to be given np , yet persons who passed for Greek scholars have urged it in its day ; and many an honest Christian still feels the influence of that strange vagary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is a kind of work in the field of exegesis , which depends upon a critical knowledge of New Testament Greek , such as few besides professional scholars can be expected to possess . But the next best thing to the possession of it , is to be aware of the want of it , and thus to avoid making one 's self ridiculous . Not being an expert in this department , I have taken pains to obtain the opinions of men who , by position or reputation , are responsible to the world for the judgments they give . The commentators have already been cited . Others have becn consulted , and especially , for the sake of definiteness , as to the exegesis of 1st Cor. xiv : 34 , 35 , proposed by a writer in the New Englartdei- , for Jan. , 1877 . The answers in writing , of seven men , all of them occupying , or having done so for years , some of the highest chairs of instruction in New Testament Greek in the land , are before me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greek scholars , are to be added to the list . One of the writers ,  --  a membei of the American committee for the revision of the New Testament ,  --  says : " The exegesis ( in the New Englarider* , first amused me , and then provoked me . The whole article is an attempt to fit scripture to the exigencies of the times . " Another , also a member of the same committee , says : " It is melancholy to me , that a man should spend so much time and thought as the writer in the New Englaader has done , and // think he has rendered so much service to the church , when his positions are perfectly untenable . " These extracts exhibit the judgment and feeling of all the persons consulted . All of them condemn absolutely , and in detail , the exegesis in question . And if any reader knows of a man , in any country or age , responsible , either by position or reputation , as an eminent scholar in New Testament Greek , who dissents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be given to the public . Until some such names can be found , it seems to me that most of us would better make few words in the field of critical Greek exegesis . There is , however , a kind of scrutiny , which persons of general culture and sound judgment , with , or even without some knowledge of Greek , may exercise upon the interpi-etation of the New Testament . Thus we obsei-ve how short-sighted appeal-s the attempt to get rid of the import of the word " NaA*a , , " when the phrases " keep silence , " " under obedience , " " ask husbands at home , " as well as the similar language in the epistle to Timothy , would still remain . Can this language be neutralized by questioning the meaning of " laleo ; " or that of " *AAa ; " or the use of the dative as subject of the infinitive ? Indeed it is remarkable throughout , how the passages which fall with most crushing force upon the new philosophy , 1st Cor. 11th , and Eph. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ostrich-like , they hide their heads in the dust raised about some other texts , which , even if demolished , would leave the case against them scarcely weaker than before . But , on the other hand , the logical relation of other passages in more than one of the apostles , throws a flood of light upon the subject , by unfolding the New Testament theory of the nature of the sexes , and of the family , the relation of husband and wife ; and since the family is the true unit of human society ,  --  the husband the normal man , and the wife the normal woman , and their relation the normal relation of man and woman ,  --  as involved in this , the true constitution of all human society . " Wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands , as it is fit in the Lord ; " " ye wives , be in subjection to your own husbands , as in the old time the holy women ; even as Sarah obeyed Abraham , calling him lord . " " And the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // The apostles were not looking at one side of the subject merely , when they wrote these words . They saw all around it , and knew well the significance of what they were saying : " Husbands , love your wives , as Christ also loved the church . " " Let every one of you so love his wife even as himself . " But not a word to the husband of obedience , or of reverence , though in a certain sense of the latter word it is due in the highest degree to the true woman and wife . into the depths of social philosophy underlying these directions , the mind of the apostle also penetrates . " For the husband is the head of the wife , even as Christ is the head of the church . " " Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ , so let the wives be subject unto their own husbands , in everything . " " The head of every man is Christ , and the head of the woman is the man . Man is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the glory of the man . For the man is not of the woman , but the woman of the man . Neither was the man created for the woman , but the woman for the man . " Please observe this is not my language , but that of the New Testament . Few men would care to quote such texts , had not the proud , self-worshiping spirit of modern democracy , in what may be called its social " avatar , " turning its envious eyes on the family , chafed at the sight of the happy organization , and therefore subordination constituted by God and Nature there . To that spirit organized subordination ,  --  " many members in one body , " - seems slavery . " But if all were one member , where were the body ? " " Are all apostles ? are all prophets ? are all teachers ? " " Now ye are the body of Christ , and members in particular . " " If the foot shall say because I am not of the body , ' is it therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peter regarded the family as an organization , made up , not of identities , but of different members , each having its distinctive nature , and occupying its own naturally assigned place , and that of this organization the husband is the head . Admit this , and the rest follows . The husband is the leader and representative of the family before the world ; the wife shines , and charms , and reigns , queen of the consecrated home . In the mind of the apostle , marriage is fraught with mysterious , almost sacramental import . " As we are mem-* // bers of Christ 's bofly , so they two shall be one flesh . " " He that loveth his wife , loveth himself . For no man ever yet hated his own flesh , but nourisheth it , and cherisheth it , even as the Lord the church . For we are members of his body , of his flesh , and of his bones . For this cause shall a man leave father and mother , and shall be joined to his wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a great mystery , but I speak concerning Christ and the church . " These profound ideas are yet , perhaps , a mystery ; but they are not thereby emptied of their truth , or their power . Marriage is yet the Ark of the Covenant of human society . Of all the sacred arcana of human happiness , outside of the personal character itself there is none so deep , so rich , so important . It makes the man and woman both , far more than any other worldly condition ; and whatever interest or destiny is rooted in the healthy nature of the marriage relation grows in the richest soil that earth or life afford . And to that mystery of mysteries , the union of Christ with the church , and its soul-pervading , life-creating power , comparing marriage , the apostle may well affirm that the highest welfare of the wife is wrapped up in the love of her husband ; and on the whole is safer there than in any possible selfasserting power , or position , or office of her own . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus to commit one 's all to the free care of another . But a deeper thought sbows the whole progress of the race , from barbarism to the highest Christian civilization , a steady development of more and more vital and complicated relations of interdependence between man and man . The savage hunter roaming the forest , of all men , trusts least to the faith and goodness of his fellows . Civilization , and Christianity are mutual trust . Nor less really does the husband commit his life to the keeping of his wife , than she her 's to him . It is a mutual bond ,  --  a casket rich in the treasure of two immortal lives . " They twain shall be one flesh . " True , marriage often falls short of its high ideal ; but not more so than the parental , and all other human relations . And no more in the former than in the latter does the remedy for any short-coming lie in the alteration of the terms of the relation , or escape from its natural sweep , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condemnation of this whole movement for the masculinization of woman is written in its unmistakable tendency to develop husband and wife into distinct , on pretence of equal powers , and to profane the domestic altar into an arena of business relations ,  --  " you stand for your rights and I stand for mine . " Yet in all this the apostle still shows that he remembered both sides of the case , and weighed well the significancy of what he was saying . " Nevertheless neither is the man without the woman ; neither the woman without the man in the Lord . For as the woman is of the man , even so is the man by the woman , but all things of God , " that is , all things in due order ,  --  each in its own place , without envy or strife . " If the whole body were an eye , where were the hearing ? " This is no slavery , but order , organization ; and there is no true liberty , but liberty in order . The opposite of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the writer of 1st Cor. 12th , with the defiant individualism of modern character ! The apostle fortifies himself by citing the law of Moses . " As also saith the law , " referring , perhaps , to Num. 30th , where , if a wife make a vow unto the Lord , even that solemn obligation is declared not binding if her husband disallow it . How strange such a statute appears in the light of modern theories ! The history of the creation is also appealed to , for illustration if not for argument . " For Adam was first formed , then Eve . And Adam was not deceived ; but the woman , being deceived , was in the transgression . " That is to say , Adam , as the head , was formed first , and with a nature fitting his position ; and naturally , from both the nature and position of the two , Eve , not Adam , was deceived and led in the transgression . That the apostle thought the nature of woman adapted to her position appears also elsewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to knowledge , giving honor unto the wife , as unto the weaker vessel . " Man , then , is the stronger nature , fitted to lead , and fight , and govern , and protect the finer , choicer , sweeter , and not less precious and truly honorable nature of the weaker wife . And neither he nor she must confuse the system , and destroy its harmony , by confounding the two offices , or encroaching either upon the office of the // other . It did not seem to the apostle , as it does to many now , that woman is not honored because she is not made a man of . The whole modern theory is cut up by the roots , by the single phrase , " giving honor - - - - as unto the weaker vessel . " And finally the apostle appeals to the instinctive sensibilities of woman 's own nature , as testifying to the propriety of a more shadowed career on her part than that of man . " If a man have long hair , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but if a woman have long hair , it is a glory to her , for her hair is given her for a covering . " Why covered , if she is to look surging multitudes in the face , and ride the storm of public debate like a man ? " It is a shame for a woman to speak in the church . " Would some one kindly tell us where was Paul 's inspiration when he wrote these sentences , if the modern theories of womanhood be correct ? But inspired or not , his philosophy is the same throughout . Here is his picture of the true Christian woman . " If she have brought up children ; if she have lodged strangers ; if she have washed the saints ' feet ; if she have relieved the afflicted ; if she have diligently followed every good work . " Not a word about preaching ; or the public platform : or any form of activity which all ages have assigned generally to men . And is it fair to suppose that under the vague phrase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines of conduct so widely different from the preceding , as to require , to effectually suggest them , a quite definite expression ? And so again , " Teach the young women to be sober ; to love their husbands ; to love their children ; to be discreet ; chaste ; keepers at home ; good ; obedient to their own husbands . " Why did he not say , " Earnest speakers for Christ ? " In describing a different class of women , the picture does assume more " advanced " hues . " Withal , they learn to be idle , wandering about from house to house tattlers also , busy bodies , speaking things which they ought not . " It is easy to see the sort of character the apostle had in mind ;  --  a character tired of the modest duties of home , and ambitious for a wider sphere of action . Such are the teachings of the New Testament on the distinctive nature of man and woman , and their mutual relations as involved in the family , and in society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the strong expressions of Paul in 1st Cor. 14th , and 1 Tim . 2d ? Is it possible any longer to doubt that he means what he there says ? Women are forbidden to speak in the church because God and nature never meant them for public characters . The texts in question were written , some to the Corinthians , some to the Ephesians , some to the Colossians , some to Titus and Timothy , to be by them expressed in all their charges , and some by Peter in his general epistle to the churches . And then the grounds upon which the prohibition is evidently placed ,  --  the order of creation , the relation of man and woman to the fall , the law of Moses , the theory of marriage , the still deeper nature of the sexes , the instinctive modesty of woman and the proprieties thereby implied , and the ideal conception of Christian womanhood . And yet men are heard to ' talk about the prohibitions of Paul being designed for a peculiar state of society in ancient Greece And when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and remain unanswered , dreams are still , entertained of meeting the tide by remarking on the inadequacy of a verbal interpretation of the Scriptures , as if the distinguishing feature of this whole argument were not , that it rests on the philosophy of the sexes and of society running as a system through the New Testament ! We are still treated to ostrich-like efforts to reverse the plain meaning of certain texts , as if these were not sustained by the system , instead of the system by ' any two or three of these ! The absurdity of some things of this sort which have lately appeared in the New E'igla*ider , may be seen without the aid of the eminent Greek scholai-ship which has been appealed to above . Thus when it is proposed to completely reverse the meaning of a text by assigning rare and forced , if not impossible senses to some words ( *AAa , 1 Cor. xiv , 34 ) , and interpolating others , without the slightest justification , in a way that if carried out , would send a man through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasure ( pronoun after AaNsiv , v. 35 ) ; objecting to a construction in one verse ( dative before the infinitive , v. 35 ) , while accepting it in another ( v. 34 ) , any trained and balanced mind can see the unsound // ness of the exegesis . And when it is arbitrarily assumed that " not to speak " means only " not to dispute in a disorderly way , " although the apostle had just treated that topic , and given it a nevident close ( v. 32 , 33 ) , opening upon the silence of women with the air of a new topic , and when , had the former been still in his mind , there was no reason for distinguishing the sexes , as if disorder were no evil in a Christian assembly unless produced by women ; and when the force of the words , " I suffer not a woman to teach , " is sought to be broken by assuming something disorderly in their manner , which alone the apostle wishes to censure , ignoring the connected language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if there were no alternative to woman 's wrangling but absolute silence , nor any remedy but subjection to men , and this concluded on no other ground than a clause in the context enjoining simplicity in dress ! and when , in the face of the apostle 's solemn objurgation , after the prohibition , " If any man think himself to be a prophet , or spiritual , let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the commandments of the Lord , " we are taken back to the 11th chapter to find a phrase , which , when carried on to the 14th chapter , and applied to another topic than its own , might seem , though hardly justly , to indicate a somewhat yielding tone of feeling on the part of the apostle ; and when the mere omission of the prohibition in one passage ( 11th chapter ) where another topic forms the subject , and woman 's speaking is only incidentally alluded to but not discussed , is held to neutralize the most positive and direct language in another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of discussion , besides that chapter xi , 7 , 8 , 9 , inevitably implies the whole conservative idea of the relation of the sexes , which renders any discussion of the propriety of public action on the part of women a waste of words ; and when we are told that the promise , " Ye shall be my sons and daughters " proves that both were to run the same public career ; and that the words , " They were all filled with the Holy Ghost , and began to speak with tongues , " necessitate that women spoke in a public way , although the writer himself admits that the language of the narrative covers " conversation with one another in different // parts of the assembly , as well as public speech , " besides that in the surprise and excitement of that occasion there was some disorder , giving rise to the suspicion of drunkenness , which sensible Christians would hardly select as a feature of the day worthy of imitation ; and when Anna giving thanks for the sight of the infant Jesus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speech ; and when we are asked to consider the expounding of the way of the Lord to Apollos by Aquila and Priscilla at home as constituting them both public teachers ; and that Christ sending by Mary , the first disciple whom he met , the news of his resurrection , inducted her into public office ; and every woman who " labored in the Lord , " or even helped or sympathized with an apostle is of course a public laborer , although the same language might have been used , without the slightest strain , of the Christian faithfulness of the most retiring of our modest mothers ; nay , when even the title the " Lamb 's wife , " applied to the church is thought to count something against such a mass of testimony as has been adduced ,  --  when feats of exegesis like these are proposed , it would be bold indeed to deny to any sensible man the privilege of dissent . In the whole New Testament there is but a single text ,  - -  1 Cor. xi , 5 : " Every woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " that looks in the other direction . This has already been slightly noticed . It may be added that the apostle does not here say " in the church , " and may refer to more private occasions . He is speaking of another subject ; and there is no evidence that the propriety of a woman speak . ing in public was in his mind at all , any more than was the custom of wine-drinking , when , a little further *n , he condemns gluttony and drunkenness at the table of the Lord , or the propriety of private brawls in the mind of Moses when he forbade a certain mode of interference on the part of a wife , Dent . xxv , 11 . And this appears the more natural since the writer may have had already in mind , awaiting its proper place , the prohibition three chapters further on . The changes are rung with childish delight , on the various allusions in the New Testament to the faith and labor of women in the Lord , as if all labor were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But prophesying was not always public discourse ; and if it were , women generally , in these days , are perhaps not prophets . Who shall assure us that an instance of this kind establishes a rule any more than the " having all things common , " and the summary punishment of Annanias and his wife ? What is to be said of the state of mind which can cite mere historic allusions of this sort against the positive commands upon the other side , supported as they are by equally clear ideas respecting the nature of the sexes , running through the New Testament ? And yet there is no proof that in a single instance in the apostolic age , a woman stood forth as a public much less as an official preacher of the Gospel . We are often reminded of the evidently high appreciation by both Christ and the Apostles , of the faith , and love , and self-denial of women . I accept all that can be said on that topic . Nothing can be more certain than that Christ and the Apostles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact more noticeable that they never placed her in any public position ; a fact utterly unexplainable except upon the theory that they did not regard her as a candidate for anything of that sort . The remark just made respecting the force of historical allusions to practices clearly condemned by positive commands applies with even greater force to the Old Testament than to the New . The ancient civilization was crude , coarse , and semi-barbarous . The Hebrew Scriptures are a history of the religious growth of a nation 's mind . Polygamy , slavery , and a multitude of single acts which would destroy all title to Christian character , on the part of the perpetrator now , are mentioned without censure , in favor of which an argument from that circumstance might just as well be offered as from similar grounds in favor of public life for women . Nowhere in the Old Testament is there any approval , in terms of any such practice as a rule . There is only practice uncondemned ; or , to give it the strongest statement , practice approved for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of morals , how about the conduct of Rebekab and Jacob toward Isaac and Esan ? and that of David toward the innocent sons of Saul and IRispah ? and the policy of // Mordecai in the matter of Esther and the vacant place in the king 's harem ? and many similar transactions . Shall the practice of a state of society like that be set up against the most clear and positive precepts of the New Testament ? Moreover the strongest passages in favor of the public action of women , which are found in the Old Testament utterly break down when looked at closely . No one of them is more frequently quoted , for example , than the words of Joel - " I will ponr out my spirit upon all flesh ; your sons and your daughters shall prophesy , your old men shall dream dreams , and your young men shall see visions . " But the whole import of this passage is included in the single phrase ,  - -  the general out-pouring of the Holy Spirit . The other particulars are merely the drapery , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall beat their swords into plow shares , and their spears into pruning-hooks . " What would be thought of an exegesis of this passage which should lay stress upon the distinction between swords and spears , and base an important rule of human conduct , one even to be set up against Gospel precepts , upon it ! One could better have patience with interpietations like these did those who propose them adhere to them themselves , any longer than to serve the present purpose . But we do not find those who wish to make woman a public character attaching importance to the distinction between old and young men , or to that between dreams and visions , or to the place of these latter in the prophecy at all . Why not , if the mention of both " sons " and " daughters ' * is so significant ? Besides , was this prophesying surely to be public ? l3ut it is said " God recognized Deborah as a prophetess . " True , and he calls Cyrus his " Shepherd , " - his " Anointed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Samuel to anoint Saul to be king over Israel , yet either of those persons would be a poor example in some respects , for the Christian now . Deborah " recognized " Jael calling her " blessed above women , " for an act which would now consign her name to infamy . We shall find the acceptance of all the Old Testament practice that appears to have been recognized " at the time somewhat embarrassing . Some one has discovered that the " publishers " // in Ps. lxviii , 11 , were women , and therefore women should preach . But that passage is a " Te iDeum " on the deliverance of Israel at the iRed Sea ; and the women spoken of are those who sang with Miriam the song of triumpb . Thus far , no farther ; it is another example of Hebrew practice . The course of the Biblical argument on this subject has not been of a character to feed the professional pride of an American clergyman . What shall be said , for one more example , of the frequent citation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind , of the words , " In Christ there is neither male nor female , " as if they bore upon this question ! can it be necessary to spend words upon such applications of Scripture as this ? A woman has said , " what I have seen and heard on the pro side of the subject , has ( with one exception ) appeared so weak , such special pleading , has shown such ignorance of the Scriptures , and such light regard for their authority , that it scarcely needed the arguments against woman 's speaking to convince me that God did forbid it . " These words are not too strong , though charity may allow us to find the cause in a too ready yielding to a popular impulse rather than a light regard for the authority of revelation . My own views of the nature- of inspiration are not such as to render me a " strict constructionist " in the interpretation and use of the Bible . But the nonchalance with which it has been treated in the matter before us , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mine . Brethren , do you not know , after all , that the New Testament theory respecting woman is not the same with that of modern reform ? How long will scholars and intelligent men of the world believe us honest in our claims in behalf of the Bible , when they see us treat it in this way ? Were there any general consent of human reason against the New Testament theory upon this subject , that fact would furnish an excuse for our conduct , though it would not save the honor of revelation . But on the contrary , a majority , it is believed , of the best minds , hold the modern movement to be as supremely foolish in philosophy as it is rebellious in religion . The intellectual fatuity which marks the movement on this field is scarcely less astonishing than that shown in the // field of exegesis , though assuming , generally , the form of persistent ignoring of vital considerations rather than of absurd argumentation . It will scarcely be denied that orgaruzation is the constructive law of the universe ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that all human society , and the family-the undoubted natural and Divine unit , . and germ of society , are organizations ; that male and female , father and mother , brother and sister , are parts of a system , each having its own nature , place , and office , which it must therefore keep , or be out of place , and violate nature . It can not be denied that nature , and God , by making woman the mother , have shown which half of the great sphere belongs to her . Science teaches that her physical nature is adapted to her own work rather than to that of man . The general consent of the race testifies that her spiritual constitution exhibits a similar adaptation , and differs as much from that of her stronger , coarser brother , as the physical . And why should it not he so ? Would nature be likely to impose the duties of motherhood , through all time , without the corresponding faculties ? And so of manhood on the other hand . And can anyone pretend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , is so nearly the same with that of the mother as to call for no difference of spiritual nature ? Why then shQuld father and mother seek to exchange or mingle , and so to confuse their duties , and thereby thwart their action in both departments ? The beauty and perfection of the whole system , and of each individual part depend upon each keeping his own place , and doing his own duty , and that means letting the duty of others alone . The obvious specific character of both the male and the female organization confirms this view . The exquisite delicacy and sensibility of woman point unmistakably to a delicate and sheltered career in life . The end , and the adaptation illustrate and prove each other ; and both reveal the design of nature that woman should be woman , and not man . The constitution and temperament of man are different . Can any one suppose that he would succeed in the realm that belongs to woman , even could he assume the mother 's place ? Now // these facts of organization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the foundation of the whole subject . But who in the interest of change , has considered and weighed them fairly ? It may perhaps be supposed , that while the organizing purpose of nature now described is a reality , the execution of it may also be left to her ; with an open door , and encouragement from society to as many exceptions as may choose to present themselves . And this might perhaps be so , were woman s instincts left to their own unbiased choice . Natural womanhood does not seek to endue itself with the attributes or the functions of manhood . But in these days nature is not left to herself in this matter . An agitation is raised ; a crusade preached ; the trumpet of " reform " is blown ; religious conscience is appealed to , and abused ; every unfortunate masculine weakness in a woman 's character is scented out , and quickened into activity ; and women are flattered , and beguiled , and almost forced upon the public stage . It is anything but spontaneous womanly nature that has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The effect of an occasional exception to nature 's organizing i-ale might not be seriously bad . Nature herself seems to contemplate something of the sort , indulging , now and then , in a lusas natarce , -a Joan of Arc , or a Penthesilca cutting off her breast tobecome the better archer . But the general confusion of functions which is now sought is a different thing . Confusion of function is confusion of thought , of feeling , and of character . Is it possible that anything is to be gained for woman or for society , by running athwart nature 's plans , and confounding things which she intended to be distinct ? Plato di-eamed of irnproving upon nature 's plan of entrusting the raising of children to parental care and love . Of course he expected other care and love to replace that of the parent , and with superior wisdom and advantage to the child and to the State . And doubtless advantage would thus have accrued in sonic cases , and some threads or elements of it in other cases , and in as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar traversing of nature 's assignment of position and duty , respectively , to man and woman . But exceptional advanLages do not justify a rule . Nature understood her work ; and men work most successfully // in harmony with , an ( i not in violation of her plans . The amount of talent and energy and vitality , which make a good husband and a good wife , when properly distributed , will make failures of both if the distinction be disregarded . Age after age , as civilization advances , and the power of the race rises in grander and grander proportions , d*v*sion of labor becomes more and more the law of all human activity . It is a strange time now to reverse the rule , travel backward and confound functions which nature , and all time thus far , have made distinct . What if , as might have been in Plato 's state , in individual instances , the artificial way seem to have an advantage over the natural plan . Nature sees further than we , and if blacksmiths , painters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the result on a broad scale will he excellence in nothing . And loss to society will carry with it , in the end , loss even to the individual who thinks he gains . Schiller , in his version of the story of Joan of Arc , brings out the principle in the hesitation , dismay , and paralysis which oppress the soul of the maiden , when , at the climax of her career , she finds the crown that she had won too heavy for her strength to bear , sees her mistake in attempting with a woman 's soul to run a hero 's race , and passionately exclaims , " High Queen of Heaven ! 0 would that thou Had'st ne'er revealed thy self to me ! Take hack-I dare not claim it now ,  - -  Take back thy crown , t is not for me . Why , i'Ioly One , on me impose This dread vocation ? Could I steel , And to each soft emotion close This heart , by nature formed to feel ? Choose not a tender woman 's aid ,  - -  Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is the poet 's interpretation of the story . But great poets are great seers of natures , and read the secrets of the human soul by the inspiration of genius . Schiller , in this case , read aright . And George Eliot bears testimony , all the more mighty because unconscious , to the truth , in making Gwendolen , xv bile unloving , strong , self-reliant , and masculine , an object of disgust but when , with broken spirit , and heart touched by the magic wand of love , the woman awakes within her , and she clings confidingly to a stronger arm for support , she wins the sympathy and respect of every reader . // It would be interesting to learn whether the friends of socalled " reform " have formed any consistent theory of the reformed distribution of labor which their notions involve . They propose that woman shall take upon her shoulders perhaps a quarter or a third of the work of man ; and that the very portion of his work most taxing and wearing on brain and nerve , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might go further . For if woman is to share the most showy , proud , and popular portion of man 's work , why not also that which is most disagreeable , slavish and degrading ? If she is to go with him upon the platform , into the pulpit , and to Congress , she should , and eventually she will go with him also into the ditch , the forge , and the wood-yard , the fore-castle , and the battle-field . And this is another point on which we should like to be enlightened as to the expectations of our friends  --  the reformers . What is their programme ? iDo they expect woman to share the coarsest , hardest , most repulsive and slavish of man 's labors , or only his privileges , and his honors without his burdens ? This is a very important question , which ought to be answered before we go much farther . It most assuredly will have to be answered , in the end , and in a way consistent with justice . It need not be imagined that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power to fight , when the old chivalrous regard for woman as a creature of beauty , and weakness , and dependence , and love , shall have been choked by her assumption of the helmet , and the baton , the horny fist , the iron nerve , and the war-club will yield to her the prizes without the blanks of the new apportionment . if woman aspires to manhood , she must eventually accept its burdens with its joys . And then the question " Is she equal to all this ? " will compel an answer . But taking the claim of the reformers as it now stands , they demand for woman a share in certain of the privileges , the honors , and the duties of men . How then is the new distribution to be arranged ? It is thought by many that the burdens of American women are about as heavy as they can bear , as it is . Is it desirable that a portion of the burden which nature and all ages have laid upon men , should be taken from them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men thus // to be relieved at the expense of women ? Or is an exchange expected ? Shall men assume , in turn , a portion of the burdens of women ? If so , which ? and where shall they begin ? How early in the care of children for example , shall the band of man replace that of woman ? Or in the keeping of the house , 7* at what point shall that be separated from the care of children , or what portion of it shall be thrown upon the husband , while the wife goes to the court-room , the pulpit , or the stump ? These , too , are questions , which , however ignored now , lie emhedded in the very substance of the subject , and must be met , and answered by and by . Nay , can the ideal character of man and woman thus be mixed up and confused without detriment to each , and therefore to the society which together they compose ? Why were they made so different , if , after all , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to have thought there was reason for it . Are the two characters so similar that the same person may possess them both ? Can a single person be perfect man and perfect woman too ? In the answer to this question lies the solution of the whole pioblern . There are few , I am sure , who will answer it in the affirmative ; yet there is a source of error , at this point , that should be pointed out . The graceful , lithe , and charming form of woman may ornament the equestrian ring , or even the poetic hay field . But how long will the fairy form retain its grace , the cheek its bloom , the hand its soft and magic touch and the movement its aerial charm , if woman take her place beside man in every field of coarse rough toil ? So in the realm of character . When woman , clothed with the sanctity of ages of modesty , appears on a sudden in the court room , on the platform , or the stump , or on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with pleasure , and tenderness , and something of awe , and exerts an influence for the time , exceeding perhaps all that man could do . Thoughtless philanthropists cry out : " Behold ! a new power appeal-s to battle for the right . The world will now be converted to God . " Alas , the white robes of the succouring angel will // triumph , apparently , over them on their own ground . But how many times could she do it ? How long would the magic power of her womanhood prove effective ? The Lady Godiva might ride through Coventry in safety once " clothed on with chastity . " But ldt the experiment become a practice ! The success of woman in ( loing man s work , without injury to womanhood , and thus finally to her own security and influence is not to be inferred from the first few experiments . iDeteriorations of spiritual character , like those of bodily health in some miasmatic clime , are usually slowly wrought . He who takes only a hasty view overlooks the inward process that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ odor of character belonging to some of our most public women to-day , with that which distinguished them ten years ago , and he will not be surprised at the remark of another : " You can see in the case of a truly modest woman , who begins to appear in public a gradual stiffening of nerve , and emboldening of eye , and thickening of skin which mark the eclipse of whatever is distinctively characteristic in woman . " No , one can not play the role of man and woman both with success . " For either he will love the one and hate the other , or else he will hold to the one and despise the other . " The family , again and again , is an organization , and it is , in this respect , the germ , andembodies the love of all human society . Man and woman are not identities , but supplements of each other . And this relation they fill , by virtue of their differences , not by the extinguishing of them . A beautiful illustration of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher and lower notes are not the same ; they are different . Nay , the qualities of the ba*e and treble voices , in other respects than pitch , are different . And these differences there must be no thought in the use of them , of disregarding , much less attempting to abate . The perfection of the harmony requires them all , each in its proper place , one , in some sense , less prominent , or sometimes leading than another ; but all in reality equally necessary , equally honored . " For if all were one member where were the body . " If all were the treble , or the base , where were the music ? It is amazing that the richness , and beauty , and power of the // harmony produced by the different characters of man and woman in human society should not be perceived , or else that men should dream that the harmony can be preserved while we destroy the differences of character from which it springs ; or that the distinctive character itself may be kept while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employing it on other than its proper work ! If you value the harmony , you must guard the integrity of the qualities from which it springs . " The poet , and the great creator of imaginative fiction , are supposed to see as clearly as any one , where lies the real charm , and therefore power of womanhood . With one accord , from age to age , they place it in the distinctively feminine , not masculine characteristics . iDesd emon a , Miranda , Juliet , and all the female characters in whom Shakspere evidently took most delight were women , true women , who would have felt as much out of place and as uncomfortable in meddling with any part of man 's distinctive work as they would in a suit of knightly armor . It is true , women are often introduced with more or less of the masculine in their composition , and yet on the whole are lovely and admirable . But a close observation will always show either that they were regarded as exceptional , and unnatural cases , studies and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the museum of the surgeon ; or that the masculine elements were designed as faults , to bear fruit in the fifth act as such , or as foils to bring out by contrast with greater brilliancy the finer hues which they partially shadow . Creators of fiction present startling forms and colors , for the sake of effect ; no one of them , perhaps , has ever drawn an unwomanly woman as thereby winning woman s true crown . The instinct of the creative imagination feels that woman 's true heaven on earth is love ; and that to be loved , she must be woman , with woman s delicacy , tenderness , clinging trust , and even weakness , and not least , with woman 's modesty shrinking from the public gaze . " And her little hand lay lightly , confidingly in mine . " Why is it that in the ceaseless song of love , in the poetry and fiction of all ages , the sweet refrain suggested by the words " little " and " lightly " in this line son ncls like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " little " and // " lightly ? " Why not strong , and firm and manly ? Why , but that it is nature 's voice , echoing the truth as it lies in the core of every human soul . Love , between man and woman , is normally the sweet harmony that unites the strong and the weak , the bold and the timid , the rough and the beautiful , the inflexible and the gentle ; loving protection and loving trust . This is love , and nothing else is love , in its true ideal , between man and woman . And whatever tends to emasculate man , or to masculinize woman , acts upon love like choke-damp upon the human lungs . And the moment the wife steps forward into the field of manly work she both emasculates her husband and masculinizes herself . And thus in the traditional sense of the English race , nay of civilized men , the husband of the wife who rules the family , stands only second in disgrace to him who owns a dishonored bed . And this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth , concerning the relations of sex and the family . Love , like other relations , depends for its validity upon the integrity of the objects which are to stand related . Genuine love can not exist without the genuine man and the genuine woman . rfwo persons , merely , are not sufficient ; one must be man , and the other woman , and that through and through , and not mci-ely persons clad in the respective robes of these . But no woman can play a man 's part in life , and remain a true woman . No person can practice public speech , for example , without acquiring , if not possessing at first , self-confidence , boldness , firmness of nerve , an eye that will not quail , a cheek that knows not how to blush , every thing in fact that is manly , with the corresponding loss of everything that is distinctively womanly . Let this be the type of character cultivated by women , and what becomes of that only true nectar of the gods on earth , love between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though with reluctance . The spiritual element in love ,  --  that which distinguishes it from the mutual attraction of brutes , depends on the spiritual differences of the sexes . Reduce the two to a character of the same type , and there might be friendship as between man and man , but not the love of man for woman . Everything that goes to assimilate the character of woman to that of man , tends in this direction . Were such processes to go on to com // tTjJ Shall Womanhood be Abolished ? 563 pletion , there would remain in love only the animal element . Men and women would still come together because they are animals as well as spiritual beings ; but they would unite as animals only . That is to say , love , and the family that springs from it would sink below their level in barbarism , for there is no barbarism but where the spiritual distinction of the sexes is wholly blotted out . Such a result would be much more impious and fatal to all high and pure society than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every pure mind . Free love might retaiu some slight element of spiritual elevation and sweetness ; animal attraction none . It may seem harsh to say that to this result the whole course of this " reform " is tending ; yet this is the simple truth , as not a few of our best minds clearly see . The old lofty , ineffable type of love is fading , just in proportion as the new ideas come in . I know keen , observing ladies who believe that no married man or woman goes into this movement , who knows by experience at home what true connubial love is . The lips that have missed the sweetest draught from life 's cup are most likely to thirst for some unknown good elsewhere . It is surprising that certain sources of popular error , which all thinking men know to exist in our society and institutions , have not been recognized more generally as the sources from which this movement for the abolition of the old womanhood springs . INothing is plainer than that the history and experience of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has lived , and thought , and felt , and grown in character , and reared its children for two hundred years have been such as inevitably to form a certain type of character , with many virtues , and some unmistakable faults . Tue direction in which the virtues and the vices will respectively lie it would seem impossible to mistake . Among the former will be energy , enterprise , hopefulness for the future , courage , self-confidence , justice between man and man , readiness to awake from error and to cast off prejudice , to acknowledge equal rights , to live for the benefit of our fellow-men , etc . Our vices are for the most part the correlatives , or extremes of our virtues . Too little respect for the past , too little regard for any authority , too much self . confideuce , pride , ambition , utter disbelief that there is any // human good to which we personally may not aspire , envy at the sight of good that we do not ourselves possess , utter ignorance of the depth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the danger of laying hasty hands upon the most sacred parts of it , outward thi-ust and drive regarded as constituting nearly the whole of character and of value , little sense of organization , everythil ) g swallowed up in individualism , these are among the faults to which , by universal admission , the American character of to-day inclines . Why can not men see that these are precisely the springs which give to the modern woman movement its motion ? Fair-play , " for example , cries one , " woman shall have fairplay . " Fair-play ! Where , then , is organization ? Is society only a congeries of identities ? Shall the infantry soldier insist on mounting a horse ; and the artillery-man upon carrying a musket ; and the organist upon preaching half the sermons ; and the preacher upon playing the organ ; and the woman upon going to Congiess ; and the man upon nursing the baby ; and the maiden upon singing base ; and the young man upon learning to ciochet ? Is this fair-play ? It may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those things which she finds she can do . But this is grante ( l . No one asks a law to prohibit these things ; the question is what shall be advised , encouraged , and thought to be the true mission of woman in human society . Woman has liberty to loaf among rowdies in bar-rooms and saloons , but sensible people do not advise , or invite it . But cries another , " Christianity is shorn of half its strength by the silence of woman in l ) ul ) lic . " That is , noise , talk , outward thrust and drive constitute the real Ibree that is to move the world , and bow the hearts of men to God . This is a characteristic American idea ; but more arid more , in politics , in business , in education , and in religion we are beginning to see that we have carried it considerably further than the soundest and healthiest state of mind requires . What the world needs most to bring it to Christ , is not so much more talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more pure and exalted Christian homes , rather than more wives and mothers to leave their homes , and go out to preach . Little was gained // toward the real establishment of the kingdom of Christ on earth by the sweeping of the barbarians who overthrew the Roman Empire into the Church , they formed the soil in which sprang up Popery , and the Christianity of the Dark Ages . What we want now is a kind of Christianity , to which , when a man is converted , he will be better , more to be trusted in political , social , and business life . But female character , through mother and sister , and wife , lies at the heart and lungs of all character ; and we shall make a very poor exchange if we coarsen , and brutalize , and ( legrade the character of woman , as we surely shall if we masculinize it for the sake of adding to the number of preachers . Women , and men for them , sometimes rebel against the seeming of constraint as put upon them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't wish to do thus and so ; but I do n't wish to be forbidden . " This , too , is the extreme democratic spirit of the age . No one assumes to forbid anything in this matter , save on the authority of trust . What would be said of a student who should rebel against the authority of his teacher , because the latter insisted that the rules of algebra and geometry must be obeyed ? Truth is true , and right is right , and the business of every rational being is , first to offer his own loyal submis. sion to truth and right , and then , as far as propriety admits , seek to persuade his neighbor to do the same . Now a large number of us ,  --  men ,  --  are officially set apart to the business of public instruction ; the solemn commission of Christ is in our hands , and the awful vow to exercise it we have taken upon our souls . And shall we be silent when we see women misled , and seduced into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mar the beauty and excellence of human society ? This is no question of dictation , or authority , or liberty , at all . It is a question of what constitutes true female character ; and who is the true friend of woman , the man who flatters her to her ruin , or he who warns to save ? Be assured , Christian sisters , the woman has already one foot on the slippery path who begins to talk about asserting her liberty to do , if she please , the thing that is foolish and wrong . Eve asserted her liberty , and under precisely the same temptation that assails her daughters now ,  --  the ambition to exalt herselg that // is , " ye shall be as gods , " and earth and Eve 's own children have groaned in consequence for six thousand years . Have our reformers realized hoy exactly they are playing over again the part of the Serpent and his victim in Eden ? " Ye shall be as gods , to know good and evil . " That is the temptation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obtain your " rights , " and rise in the scale of being , and act for yourselves as men in the affairs of the world , and " know good and evil . " Woman certainly will know a good deal of evil that she does not now when she becomes at home on platform , and stump , and in court room , and jury box , with what effect on her womanhood , imagination may conceive . The whole movement for the masculinization of woman bears the marks , to a remarkable degree , of a hasty , ill-considered , popular tide of feeling and practice rather than thought , prompted by immediate apparent advantage , and the gush of pleasing sentiment . In seasons of religious revival , or when distinctive revival hopes rule the hour , Christians come under the sway of feeling to an unusual degree , and that so associated with the thought , and perhaps the fact of the agency of the Holy Spirit , that they scarcely dare to hold the reins . To yield to feeling is sweet . Error , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that which is innocent and fair . But in the shadow of Flatterwell , to assail poor Parley , lurked an hundred robbers . The eagerness of some men to call out the " fairy forms , " and " sweet voices " of the " sisters " upon the religious stage , has been called , it is said , on the highest progressive authority , an " aberration of amativeness . " I do not ( liscuss the propriety of the term . But it is possible that if the psychology of the whole movement could be explored , there would appear more to move to pity than is sometimes supposed . A late writer occupies twelve solid pages in drawing out the single idea that woman , having been held in early and bar . barous times substantially as a slave , had gained a slowly expanding libeity , under the influence of Christianity and advancing civilization , until the present hour . Ergo , she must throw off restraint more and more . Were the ground that has been entrenched on the conservative side , to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ license of motion displayed in the case now mentioned , a small library would be composed of the books that should be written . But the answer may be more brief . The progress of Christian society in the past in a given direction does not prove that further progress in the same direction is required , since it is possible that we have already reached , possibly passed , on that line , the golden mean of true wisdom . Thus in the relation of children to parents , in that of crime to the administration of justice , in that of subjects to government , and in that of free thinking to intellectual authority , there has been a similar progress , throughout Christendom , and in the same direction . Yet most men would agree that with large numbers of the human race at least , the progress in these cases has gone quite far enough , sometimes too far . So I think it is with the freedom of woman . And inasmuch as the writer in question left that point unguarded . his twelve pages were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask two or three questions of my brethren of progressive sympathies , which I would fain hope might be considered somewhat thoughtfully . ( 1 ) IDo you believe that mere virtue , without the fine , choice delicacy and modesty that makes woman , to the apprehension of every true man , sacred , is sufficient for the highest charm . and influence , of the female character ? ( 2 ) If not , do you believe that a woman can play the part of a man in public , through her lifetime , and retain those finer characteristics above named ? ( 3 ) And do you believe that a woman can be taught and induced to sacrifice those attributes habitually , on the religious stage , for Christ , and a the same time retain them in other than religious fields of thought and action ? ( 4 ) IDo you think that religion ought on any pretense of apparent present usefulness , to coarsen , and degrade , and deface the finest , and most exquisitely beautiful , and captivating attributes of female character ? ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the end , by such a course ?
