CHRIST 'S MIRACLES SCIENTIFICALLY CONSIDERED . CONSIDERED , as it will be throughout this discussion , wholly apart from its object , a miracle as defined by Strauss is " an event which , inexplicable from the operation and cooperation of finite causalities , appears to be an immediate interference of the supreme , infinite Cause , or of God himself ; " and by Renan , " the special interposition of Deity in the physical and psychological order of the world , deranging the course of events . " Thus regarded , a miracle may be disallowed , first of all , on the supposition that there is no personal God to perform it . This would be a common ground of denial , whether for the atheist , materialist , or pantheist . But either of these is to-day a rara avis in the higher mental circles . Indeed , to be classed with such is now regarded by the leading skeptics as a mingled travesty and insult . " This lamentable observation of mine , " says Strauss , for example , " according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , namely , in my total disbelief in a living God . " So also Renan says : " Persons unfamiliar with subjects of thought often affect an air of lofty wisdom by falsifying and exaggerating . . . . By their leave , one is pantheist or atheist without knowing it . They create schools on their own authority , and often one learns from them , with some surprise , that he is the disciple of masters he never knew . " The truth is that Strauss explicitly places " the belief that the world is governed by a spiritual and moral Power " among " the indispensable , imperishable parts of Christianity . " And Renan , with an equal emphasis , avers : " If your faculties , vibrating in unison , have never rendered that grand , peculiar tone which we call God , . . . you are wanting in the essential and characteristic element of our nature . " And thus unequivocally also , Herbert Spencer says : " By the persistence of Force , we really mean the persistence of some Power . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which persists is the unknown Cause of these manifestations . " The reason , therefore , why nearly all the skeptics of the day deserving notice deny a miracle , is not because they are either atheists , materialists , or pantheists . " The absolute Cause , " according to Strauss , " never disturbs the chain of secondary causes by single , arbitrary acts of interposition , but rather manifests itself in the production of the aggregate of finite causalities , and of their reciprocal action . " - " What we deny to the miracle , " says Renan , " is the exceptional state . . . . We acknowledge heartily that God may be permanently in everything , particularly in everything that lives ; and we only maintain that there has never been any particular intervention . " But no matter whether it be affirmed that no personal God exists to work a miracle , or that , although existing , he is yet , like the law of gravitation , always uniform and constant , never exceptional in action , and so performs no miracle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , whether , all theories of denial to the contrary , the miracles of Christ in particular are not scientifically proven ones . " Inevitably , " says Froude , " the altered relation in which modern culture places the minds of all of us toward the supernatural , will compel a reconsideration of the grounds on which the acceptance of miracles is required . " - " Discussion and examination , " says Renan , " are fatal to miracles . " " We do not say a miracle is impossible ; we say there has been hitherto no miracle proved . " " None of the miracles with which ancient histories are filled occurred under scientific conditions . " - " And if any one is able to make good the assertion , " says Huxley , " that his theology rests upon valid evidence and sound reasoning , then it appears to me that such theology will take its place as a part of science . " This , therefore , is that imperious requisition which is now abroad among the master minds , namely , either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a scientific demonstration , or else they must be abandoned as mere illusions of the past . From such a test as this no real miracle will care to shrink . And if those of Jesus do not fully bear it , henceforward they must look for credence solely to believers of the lower mental orders , or at least to those by whom they are received without a thought about the why or wherefore . " In support of the reality of miraculous agency , appeal is made , " says Renan , " to phenomena outside of the course of natural laws , such , for instance , as the creation of man . " Nor , until comparatively recently , would any believer in a personal God , however anxious to deny the supernatural , have thought to challenge the concession made by Strauss , even in his final Life of Jesus , that " of the first origin of organic beings , or the beginning of the human race , it is impossible to explain the difficulty without assuming // an immediate interference of the Divine Power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remark of Strauss will be considered by many scientists almost absurdly antiquated . " Science demonstrates , " says Renan , as their mouthpiece , " that on a certain day , by virttie of natural laws , which so far had presided over the development of things , without deViation or external intervention , the thinking being appeared , endowed with all his faculties , and in all his essential elements perfect . " " He who is not content , " says Darwin , " to look , like a savage , at the phenomena of nature as disconnected , can not any longer believe that man is the work of a separate act of creation . " A theory of the origin of man , however , which , though held by a large number , especially of the younger and rising naturalists , is yet " opposed , " as even Darwin owns , " in every form by many of the older and honored chiefs in natural science , " can scarcely be said , as Renan claims , already to have attained to the dignity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to speak of it as a theory not without a vast array of scientific data in its favor , and as becoming more and more largely an accepted opinion in certain of our highest scientific circles . " Besides , " says Darwin , " I see no good reason why the views given in this volume The Origin of Species should shock the religious feelings of any . . . . A. celebrated author and divine has written to me that he has gradually learned to see that it is just as noble a conception of the Deity to believe that he created a few original forms capable of self-development into other and needful forms , as to believe that he required a fresh act of creation to supply the void caused by the action of his laws . " Unquestionably , however , Darwin here concedes too much to the supernaturalists , that is , too much to suit the present temper of the evolutionists . " Looking back , " says Huxley , " through the prodigious vista of the past , I find no record of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any means of forming a definite conclusion as to the conditions of its appearance . . . . But . . . if it were given me to look beyond the abyss of geologically-recorded time , . . . I should expect to be a witness of the evolution of living protoplasm from not living matter . " Indeed , the entire existing tendency of the anti-supernaturalistic schools of science is utterly , and at all prehistoric epochs , to exclude all thought of a special divine intervention from alike the origin and the history of things . This , then , is what we wish to say . Oily to the satisfaction of certain scientists has the evolution theory of the first origin of organic beings been at all established . Others , equally coml ) etent to form a judgment in the case , steadily reject the theory in every form , and still adhere to that of the special-creationists . And even Darwin himself feels the intellectual need of admitting-though he prefers to say it through a clergyman-that God did at least specifically create " a few original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either begin , oi begin to evolve itself into other and higher forms . Nor is it by the compulsion of any scientific demonstration , any more than it is by a wholesale concession solely to the present temper of the anti-supernaturalists , that we herewith and henceforward argumentatively assume in this discussion , that , in order adequately and undeniably to explain , both iii their origin and development , all phenomena peculiar to the field of science , in no case is it essential to resort to the hypothesis of a special intervention of Divinity . And now what ? In the first place , there doubtless is a supposition , current in sundry scientific circles , that the entire subject of the supernatural may be summarily dismissed as one of simple science ; - we use the term as distinguished from that of history . For instance , one of the most brilliant of the younger skeptics , solely in his capacity as cosmist , assures the writer , in a private letter , that " while the miracles of Jesus are still matters of interest for the theologian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinker than the oracles of Apollo . " But manifestly , if the entire field of science should vainly be explored for any trace or sign of miracles , it by no means follows that the same would be the case did we enter upon a thorough investigation of the history of Jesus Christ . Indeed , simply as the scientist , one might precisely as well undertake to dogmatize whether Alexander ever fought a battle , as whether Jesus ever wrought a miracle . By the same impartial historical processes employed in any other instance , it must first of all be determined , and that beyond a question , what events really figure in the life of Christ . Then the scientist will of course be at perfect liberty to cast those events into his crucible , to see if they will stand the test of miracles or not . Turn we , therefore , to the gospel record of the life of Jesus . " Criticism , " says Renan , " has two modes of attacking a marvelous narrative. * . It may // admit the substance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consideration the age , the person who have transmitted it to us , and the forms adopted at such and such an epoch to express facts . . . . It was in i8oo that Dr. Paulus put out under full sail on this new sea . . . . The gospels , according to Paulus , are histories , written by credulous men under the action of a vivid imagination . To arrive at the truth , we must place ourselves at the point of view of the epoch , and separate the real facts from the embellishments which credulous faith and a taste for the marvelous have added to it . . . . When they tell of Jesus as walking on the sea , they mean to say that he rejoined his disciples by swimming , or walking along the shore . Another time he calmed the tempest by seizing the tiller with a firm hand . The multiplication of the loaves is explained by secret magazines , or by provisions which the auditors have in their pockets . . . . The insufficiency of such a shabby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " In 1835 appeared the famous L*fe of Jesus by Dr. Strauss , driving with a scourge of intertwisted argument and ridicule the school of Paulus out of every subtilty and subterfuge , far from the presence of every scholar and logician , and triumphantly establishing that " if the gospels are really and truly historical , it is impossible to exclude miracles from the life of Jesus . " But criticism has this second " mode of attacking a marvelous narrative , " which Renan mentions , namely , that it may " cast doubt on the narrative itself , and may account for its formation without conceding its historical value . " There are at present two leading lines of assault , or of " casting doubt , " upon the Bible , the scientific and the critical . And first , the scientific . " The account of the creation of man and the world which is given in Genesis , " says Froude , " and which is made by St. Paul the basis of his theology , has not yet been reconciled with facts which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theologies , " says Huxley , " which are based upon the assumption of the truth of the account of the origin of things given in the book of Genesis , being utterly irreconcilable with the doctrine of evolution , the student of science , who is satisfied that the evidence upon which the doctrine of evolution rests is incomparably stronger and better than that upon which the supposed authority of the book of Genesis rests , will not trouble himself further with these theologies , but will confine his attention to such arguments against the view he holds as are based upon purely scientific data . " Nor does it require the slightest penetration to perceive that these remarks of Huxley only need the formality of a specific application in order to lie with equal force , as against the truthfulness of Genesis , so also against that of all those other portions of the Scripture , wherein the correctness of the Mosaic account of the origin of things is asserted or implied . Indeed , Froude has already pointed out to us their fatal bearing on certain underlying features @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be long in learning how they stand related to the entire New Testament doctrine of Jesus as the Creative Logos , and the like . Two courses here present themselves . One is to pause and endeavor to clear the Bible , not only from the doubts suggested above , but from all others of whatever nature cast upon it by the scientists . The other is argumentatively to leave the Bible resting under all these doubts , however manifold and vital , and so proceed with our investigation . The latter is the course decided on . The chief attack of modern times upon the Scriptures , however , is the critical . This attack of course makes full account of all that science urges for their invalidation . Speaking also with reference to the gospels in particular , Renan says " The four principal documents are in flagrant contradiction the one with another ; Josephus , moreover , sometimes corrects them . " But this latter objection , namely , that the gospels are not in harmony with general history , the critics urge with very feeble voices . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And here Strauss is , and ever must remain , their chosen mouthpiece . As Renan has it : " The criticism in detail of the text of the gospels . . . has been done by M. Strauss in a manner which leaves little to be desired . " Concerning this assault of Strauss upon the gospels , the time will come to speak before the sequel . Just here suffice it to say that , if it were not for a single thing , the most hostile of their critics would be perfectly content if they could only reduce these Christian writings from the rank of an inspired history to that of an ordinary human composition of the like antiquity . What , therefore , is that one element in the gospels which , in the estimation of the modern skeptics , not merely sinks them below a Tacitus or Livy in point of their historical value , but converts them , according to // Strauss in to mythical productions , according to Renan into legendary biographies ? That element is  --  the supernatural . " It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says Renan , " that the evangelists do not merit an absolute credence , that I reject the miracles which they relate . It is because they recount miracles that I say the gospels are legendary . " So also Strauss avers that " the gospels , or even one of them , could not be taken as truly and fully historical , for the simple reason that they contain supernaturalism . " Renan accordingly adopts " this principle of historical criticism , that a supernatural relation can not be accepted as such ; " and Strauss maintains that " such an account , in so far as it either expressly states or even implies the supernatural , is to be considered as not historical . " The first thing imperatively requisite for the anti-supernaturalists is , in accordance with the above principle of historical criticism , to set aside the gospel of John almost entirely . " In presence of this gospel , " says Strauss , " it was incumbent upon criticism either to break in pieces all her weapons and lay them at the feet of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historical validity . " Attempts have indeed been made to separate this gospel into historical and non-historical fragments , and thus save as much of it as possible . " While Weisse assumed the reflections and longer speeches of Christ in the fourth gospel to be apostolical , " says Strauss , " rejecting , on the other hand , the narratives as a late compilation , Renan , conversely , takes offense at the abstract metaphysical lectures , as he calls the speeches of Jesus in John , and , on the contrary , considers the narrative portion of the gospel as extremely important . " " Now , " continues Strauss , " it will be from the speeches most immediately that every one , with a sound understanding and capable of appreciating historical truth , will get the first rays of light as to the late origin of the fourth gospel , but still it is the common ground of its divisibility , upon which Renan places himself with his Germm ***edecessor , which also makes his hypothesis untenable from first to last . The narrative part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the very first he takes no accurate notice of the miraculous narratives in it . The raising of Lazarus , indeed , he can not well l ) *55 by ; and as he will have nothing to do with miracles , he makes of it a mystification . " In the thirteenth edition of the Life o/ Jesus , Paris , 1867 , Renan , smarting under such stings as these , inserts a lengthy Appendix , the aim of which , says he , " is to show that in recurring so often to the fourth gospel to fix the woof of my fabric , I have had good reasons . ' ' Into the merits of this dispute we have neither the desire nor the occasion to inquire . All that we wish is to point out and emphasize the fact that , whether the fourth gospel be accepted in part as history , or be rejected en masse as mythical or legendary , either hypothesis is only tolerable to him who makes it in so far as it will not compel him to take any accurate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convinced that to deny in /o/o its historical character is the only method to get rid of its supernaturalism , no critic will hesitate an instant to say it is a simple fiction . It is needless to add that the canon of historical criticism in question has been applied to the synoptics as well as John , and that everything in them seeming to the special critic , or to the special school of critics , to support the supernatural , has been duly set aside as not historical . But the question now arises , whether the four documents referred to are unqualified inventions . " At first sight it would appear , says Row , " to have been the easiest course to assert that they are simple forgeries . . But this is what no unbeliever of the present day who regards his literary reputation ventures to propound as the alternative to their historical credibility . Why is this simple course abandoned , and an infinitely complicated theory substituted in its place ? The answer is , that their entire l ) henomena negative the supposition that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Accordingly the task which the modern skeptics have iml ) osed UI ) Ofl themselves is not to prove that the gospel is an absolute invention , but , according to Renan , " to seek what portion of truth and what l ) Ortion of error it may contain ; " or , as Strauss has it , " to see what , after the severance of foreign and baser elements , would remain as historical gold . " It has already been seen that , in order to satisfy the extremest demands of anti-supernaturalistic criticism , the fourth gospel must " disavow all claim to historical validity . " Of the three remaining gospels , both Strauss and Renan accord to Luke in all resl ) ects the lowest rank as history , and so we herewith pass it by in silence . // " The narrative portions in the first gospel , " says Renan , " ha*re . . . in them many legends . . . sprung from the piety of the second Christian generation . The gospel of Mark . . . is much less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the contrary , we , as well as Baur , " says Strauss , . . . " consider the gospel of Matthew as the most original , and , comparatively speaking , the most trustworthy . " In quoting which our only object is to say that insomuch as Renan regards the narratives of Matthew as being so largely fraught with fables , and Strauss those of Mark , compared with those of Matthew , as having even a less historical value , the narrative parts of both the first and second gospels may therefore as well be at once dismissed from any furthe , r notice . Which leaves us only the discourses of Jesus in Matthew and Mark to ask ourselves about . So far as Mark has any of the speeches of Christ in common with Luke and John , they have already been set aside . If those speeches which Mark has in common with Matthew also be deducted , the residue of its speechelement becomes so inconsiderable , that , for all the practical purposes of this debate , as above in its narrative portions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likewise may as well be altogether remanded from our presence , as a common basis of investigation . The only final fragment of the gospels , therefore , which is left us to consider , is the Logia of Matthew . And concerning this Strauss remarks : " As regards the speeches of Jesus in particular , notwithstanding all doubt upon individual points , every one must admit that we have them in the first gospel , though not unmixed with later additions and modifications , still in a purer form than in any of the others . " In connection with these " later additions and modifications , " Strauss would specifically call attention , first , to the " prophetical pragmatism of Matthew , " and secondly , to his " tendency to combine traditional utterances of Jesus with larger groups of speeches . " " We have therefore to take away , " says he , " many a Jewish feature from the figure of Christ as given by Matthew , " and also to bear in mind that he " represents Jesus as saying at one time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasions* " This done , the discourses of Jesus in Matthew come out even of the crucibles of Strauss as a pure , historical residuum of the gospels . Renan also pronounces " Matthew the Xenophon of nascent Christianity . " Elsewhere more in detail he remarks : " Matthew clearly deserves our unlimited confidence as regards the discourses ; he gives . . . actual notes from a clear and living memory . He who attempts the task of forming a regular composition out of the gospel history possesses in this respect an excellent touchstone . The real words of Jesus will not be concealed ; as soon as we touch them in this chaos of traditions of unequal value , we feel them vibrate ; they come spontaneously and take their place in the narration where they staiid out in unparalleled relief . " If it should now be inquired , therefore , to what extent the anti-supernaturalistic criticism can lay claim to having " cast doubt " on the miraculous narratives of the gospels , the foregoing analysis develops , first , that , allowing in undiminished force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the score of their conflict with the discoveries of modern science , their discrepancies with each other and Josephus , their contradictions , and the like , though no longer to be regarded as inspired , these documents would still , at the lowest supposition , maintain as high an historical rank as any other works of the same historical epoch . Beyond this point the entire onslaught upon the gospels must be waged solely in the name of the anti-supernatural . And after this onslaught has been pushed to the uttermost extreme , and we have bodily thrown away as unhistorical every fragment of these Christian records which any critic questions , even then , with unimportant limitations and exceptions , the discourses of Jesus reported by Matthew remain to us confessedly authentic . Argumentatively , therefore . from this point forward it will be assumed that these Logia of Matthew are , as Renan says , " the basis of all that we know of the teachings of Jesus . " But after the anti-supernaturalistic criticism has thus thoroughly finished the task of casting doubt upon the gospel narrative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more difficult task of " accounting for the formation of this narrative without conceding its historical value . " " And that no one may say " - we. quote from Renan- " that such a manner of proposing the inquiry implies a begging of the question , let us suppose d priori that which is to be proved in detail , namely , that we know that the miracles related by the gospels have not had any reality . " // I.-TIE METAPHYSICAL OR MYTHICAL HYPO THESIS OF STRAUSS . " In my former work , " says Strauss , " I offered the idea of the Myth as the key to the miraculous narratives of the gospel . It is in vain , I said , in the case of stories like that about . . . the miraculous feeding , and the like , to make them conceivable as natural events ; V , ut . . . all narratives of this kind must be regarded as fictitious . If it were asked how , at the time to which the appearance of our gospels is assigned , men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , above all , to the expectation of the Messiah current at the time . When men , I said , had come to see the Messiah in Jesus , they supposed that everything coincided in him which , according to the Old Testament prophecies and types , and their current interpretations , was expected of the Messiah . Jesus might have uttered words of severe reproach against the desire for miracles , . . . and those words might be still living in tradition but Moses , the first deliverer . . . had worked miracles , therefore the last deliverer , the Messiah , and Jesus of course had been he , must likewise have worked miracles . Isaiah had prophesied that at the time of the Messiah the eyes of the blind should be opened and the ears of the deaf should hear , etc . Thus it was known in detail what sort of miracles Jesus , having been the Messiah , must have performed . And so it happened that in the earliest church narratives might , nay , could not fail to be invented without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them . " - " But when we thus point out that an unconscious invention of such accounts was possible far beyond the limits within which they are generally considered admissible , we do not mean to say that conscious fiction had no share at all in the evangelical formation of myths . The narratives of the fourth gospel , especially , are for the most part so methodically framed , so carried out in detail , that if they are not historical , they can apparently only be considered as conscious and intentional fictions . " This , therefore , is what Strauss is pleased to call his " peculiar apparatus for causing the miracles of the evangelical history to evaporate into myths . " Only it must not be supposed that he designs to draw his materials for its practical operation solely from the sources specified above . He draws them in fact from every quarter of the compass . If a given feature of the gospel narratives of miracles did not originate traditionally in some Messianic type or prophecy , then it did in some doctrine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if in none of these why , then in something else . Besides , wher* the case is very desperate , it always remains for him to fall back upon " the unconscious poetry of legend , such as prevails in the first three gospels , " or , " the more or less conscious fictions , the existence of which we can not overlook in the fourth gospel . " And with such an apparatus , and with such a vast variety of resources and resorts , what more facile mode of proving the miracles of Christ not historical could possibly be conceived or wished for ? The problem , however , which Dr. Strauss proposes by his mythical hypothesis to solve , is this , namely , how , though Jesus personally disclaimed performing any miracles whatever , and was not believed by his contemporaries to perform any real miracles , he yet became accredited with performing them in the tradition which arose about him after he was dead , but prior to " the time to which the appearance of our gospel is assigned " by the critic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disclaimed performing miracles , is , of course , too much for Strauss to take for granted ; and so , though not until the issue of his final Lzjfe , he makes the feint of seeming to prove the point , by citing the summary refusal of Christ to show to certain Scribes and Pharisees a sign from heaven . But even here he is driven to say that " Luke , as compared with Matthew , has preserved the more original account , " not to mention other subterfuges . It so happens , however , that when he has thus far , and after such a fashion , proceeded , to his unalloyed delight , our critic has then exhausted all the evidence even appearing to look in the direction of his desires . Accordingly , he is forthwith compelled to say : " It is true , indeed , that the answer which Jesus gave to the messengers of the Baptist . . . appears to stand in the sheerest contradiction to this refusal to perform signs and wonders. ** From this dilemma , how does Strauss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very simple manner : " To this detailed account , " says he , " of the miracles which any one might see him perform , Jesus adds : And blessed is he who shall not be offended in me . ' .. . These words seem . . . to have been uttered against those who were offended at his not performing the miracles expected of the Messiah , and then the miracles to which he appealed are to be under // stood in a spiritual sense of the moral effects of his doctrine . How , ' he means to say , you do not see me perform the miracles which you expect from the Messiah ? And yet I am daily opening , in a spiritual sense , the eyes of the blind , the ears of the deaf , making the maimed walk uprightly , and giving new life to those who are morally quite dead . He who sees of how much more worth these spiritual miracles are , will take no offense at the want of material ones . ' " Now this is indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see how it will stand inspection . And , first of all , we must demand why Dr. Strauss ever presumed to dismiss this whole question as to whether Christ disclaimed working miracles , after glancing at only the merest item of the evidence , it was well indeed for him to notice the words of Christ about " the sign , " and also those before us now . But why should he so strangely forget to notice-only these ? If it was all along flis intention thus conveniently to ignore the evidence almost en masse , he would have immeasurably more deserved the respect of scholars had he ignored it altogether . As it is , we must insist that he likewise pay some specific attention to those other pertinent words of Christ of which he has chosen to seem so perfectly oblivious ; words with which , according to all the most rigid canons of historical criticism ever yet invented to reduce and destroy the speeches of Jesus in our 1 ) possession , he yet may not refuse to grapple ; words not found in the fourth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Mark or Luke , but vouched for by the almost unquestioned Matthew . Let us begin , however , by rejecting in a body , first , all the words of Christ in question of a Judaizing tendency , as when he says : " Show thyself to the priest , and offer the gift that Moses commanded for a testimony unto them ; " and , secondly , all those others in the case of which the precise phraseology of Jesus himself is not given , as when it is merely asserted that he " rebuked the wind and the sea , " though in exactly what terms we do not know , unless we accredit Mark that his language was : " Peace , be still . " That this process will leave us only well-authenticated words of Jesus for the purposes in view , M. Strauss , even in his most fastidious moments , reluctantly must own . To remove this matter even still farther , however , from any future question , even of those undeniably authentic discourses of Jesus thus remaining to us in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mass which depends upon the narrative portions with which they are interwoven , to render it certain that they relate to miracles . Thus : " Believe ye that I am able to do this ? " - " Be it unto thee even as thou wilt , " and so on to the end of the catalogue . Perhaps here also should be included , as being in themselves somewhat ambiguous , such further words as these : " Stretch forth thine hand * " Let no fruit grow on thee henceforward forever ; and the like . And yet , after all this is done , Jesus still continues his discourses thus in Matthew : " I will come and heal him . " - " I will ; be thou clean . " - " Whether is easier to say , Thy sins be forgiven thee , or to say , Arise and walk ? But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins . Arise , take up thy bed and go unto thine house . '  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devils , then the kingdom of God is come unto you . " - " Woe unto thee , Chorazin , woe unto thee , Bethsaida ; for if the mighty works which were done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon , they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes . " - " They need not depart ; give ye them to eat . Bring them hither to me. " - " I have compassion on the multitude , because they continue with me now three days , and have nothing to eat ; and I will not send them away fasting , lest they faint by the way . . . . How many loaves have ye ? " - " Why reason ye among yourselves because ye have brought no bread ? Do ye not remember the five loaves of the five thousand , and how many baskets ye took up ? Neither the seven loaves of the four thousand , and how many baskets ye took up ? " These words of Jesus in Matthew alone , therefore , detached entirely from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper by themselves , would abundantly establish , and that beyond a question , that whoever took such language on his lips professed , and in the most decided sense of supernaturalism professed , to be a worker of miracles . And in the light of this , consider now these further words of Christ in Matthew also , " Go and show John again those things which ye do hear and see : the blind receive their sight , and the lame walk , the lepers are cleansed , and the deaf hear , the dead are raised up . " Assuredly , when Strauss endeavors to make Jesus here enter into a sort of apology for not performing the expected Messianic miracles , and to appear in the rdle // of a Messiah , seeking to palm off upon the Jews the moral effects of his doctrine in lieu of proper miracles , he only deserves to have it retorted upon him that by no means a Paulus is the only skeptic who is " fond of lending to the hallowed personages of primitive Christian history the views of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to whether Christ disclaimed working miracles , there is , on the part of Strauss , such ineffable condescension , first , in his special pleading about the solitary text which even seems to suit his purpose ; secondly , in his imputii*g to the only other text he presumes specifically to notice , a meaning in utter contradiction to the thought of Christ himself ; and , thirdly , in his wholesale suppression even of his own evidence at large in Matthew ; - such an ineffable condescension on the part of Strauss is here evinced , we say , that his entire argument deserves no further notice than barely the exposure given it above . But the question still remains , how Christ succeeded in his r31e of wonder-worker . In the proper and the highest sense , did his contemporaries receive him in this character or not ? On this point , however , Strauss has ventured to commit himself much more fully to the central current of the truth than on the former one . There he did not dare to wet his feet ; but here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meanwhile , " he says , " however Jesus might disclaim the performance of material miracles , it was supposed , according to the mode of thought of the period . . . that miracles he must perform whether he would or not . As soon as he was considered a prophet , . . . miraculous powers were attributed to him ; and when they were attributed to him , they came of course into operation . From that time , wherever he showed himself , suf ferers regularly crowded around him in order only to touch his garments , because they expected to be cured by doing so . " From which it is apparent , even according to the critic , that Jesus was regarded by his contemporaries as the performer of not spiritual , but material miracles . What they thronged him for was not to be spiritually profited by " the moral effects of his doctrines , " but to be physically healed of their diseases . So far as these material miracles can be accounted for by the mere " force of excited imagination , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was believed by his contemporaries to have worked them , but that " in many cases the account given in the gospels may have exactly corresponded with the fact . " The secret of this concession is that afterward , in attempting mythically to account for " the origin of the evangelical narrative of miracles , " the critic finds it exceedingly convenient to declare : " First , there are the miracles produced by faith , perfectly natural , and which we have not disputed . " But after Strauss , in order to reach this helpful goal , has thus unguardedly allowed himself to be swept so far down the stream of proof as to admit that Jesus was accredited by his contemporaries with working mira - des at all , his doom is fixed . Beyond help or hope , he must now be swept onward to confess that as well as with those to be accounted for by the force of excited imagination , so also with those to be accounted for only by the exercise of supernatural power , Jesus was accredited with performing miracles by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jesus , for instance , professed to cleanse the leper and raise the dead , so the entire tenor of the testimony establishes he was believed to do . Wherefore have we written this ? Most assuredly not still more absurdly to swell the list of formal refutations to the mythical hypothesis of Strauss , as it concerns the miracles of Christ . When even , Renan says : " The book of Strauss , in spite of its somewhat exaggerated fame , has been laid aside , and has satisfied nobody , " the day is surely past when formal refutations of this aspect of Das Ltben Jesu are in place . But our point is this . The mythical hypothesis of Strauss , as it concerns the miracles of Christ , has never called for , and never can call for , a formal refutation . Whatever the fact may be , and whatever the fact may over and over again have been demonstrated to be , no one has ever needed to inquire whether it is satisfactory or unsatisfactory . The simple truth is , that , despite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it has always been utterly irrelevant ; it has never had the slightest bearing on any actual issue about the miracles in question . It was contrived , ' as we saw above , solely to solve the problem how , though Jesus while living personally disclaimed performing any miracles whatever , and was not believed by his contemporaries to perform any real miracles , he yet became converted into a miracle-worker by traditions arising after he was dead , but prior to the time to which the appearance of our gospels is by Strauss assigned . // But historically the critic never had , and never could fairly get before him , any such problem for solution . Christ while living professed to perform , and was believed to perform , not spiritual but material , not imaginary but actual miracles . Posthumous traditions never had the remotest opportunity originally , and in the fullest sense , to foist upon him his character as miracle-worker , because he both claimed and attained that character long before he died . In other words , the very question about the miracles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solve , itself is mythical . The same brain that contrived the apparatus , contrived the problem also . If Dcis Leben Jesu should therefore be compared to a man-of-war , whenever its constructor and commander runs out his guns before a paper fort of Paulus , death or flight is sure to follow . Whenever he directs a broadside against the gospels ,  --  at their contradictions and the like ,  --  whoever may doubt that he breaches through and through the theory of their inspiration , no one who knows the facts can question that his missiles smite a thousand times against the view as with a clap of thunder . But when he gives the order utterly to annihilate the miracles of Christ , discharge after discharge results in simply nothing , except in noise and smoke , and for the simple reason that his fire has not been directed against any possible scholarly issue about the miracles in question , but has merely been emptied at a target put up to seaward for his own private practice . He commits the blunder of trying to storm the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sea . On the question now before us , therefore , we do not need specifically to inquire whether any one either ever has or ever can dismount or spike a single gun of Strauss . Conversely , suppose that , on this especial side , Das Leben Jesu should continue in full force and fire until its gallant captain has filled up with wasted scholarship and subtlety the very ocean of his conjectures as to how tradition posthumously converted Jesus into a wonder-worker of the very highest order . It will be time enough for those within the walls to think about replies , when he launches forth with quite another kind of cruiser , whose guns , instead of being forever fastened to the seaward , are brought immediately to bear upon the citadel itself namely , upon the question how Christ came so successfully to play the part of wonder-worker , if he did not do his miracles in truth . And now for vital and real aspects of our subject still remaining . 11. - THE SCIENTIFIC , OR LEGENDARY , HYPO* THESIS OF RENAN . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that if France , better endowed than Germany with practical perception , and less inclined to substitute in history the action of ideas for the play of passion and the force of individual character , had undertaken to write scientifically the life of Christ , it would have employed a more rigorous method , and , avoiding the error of transferring the problem , as Strauss has done , to the domain of abstract speculation , would have come much nearer the truth . " Of which presaging remarks we now have before us in the since famous Vie de Jisus the detailed exposition . Renan , then , in comparison with Strauss , is far too penetrative even to make the effort to have Jesus converted for the first time into a miracle-worker by the posthumous traditions which arose about him . He can not , indeed , concede that Jesus ever worked a miracle . But , he does " admit unhesitatingly that acts which would now be considered traits of illusion or of hallucination figured largely in the life of Jesus . " Not that he thinks Jesus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him in the gospels . Conversely " It is impossible , " says he , " among the miraculous stories , the wearisome enumeration of which the gospels con .. tain , to distinguish the miracles which have been attributed to Jesus by popular opinion , from those in which he consented to take an active part . " " In most cases , " he alleges , " the people themselves , from the undeniable need which they feel of seeing in great men and great events something divine , create the marvelous legends afterwards . " Besides : " Who knows whether the celebrity of Christ as an exorcist did not spread about without his knowing it ? Persons who reside in the East are sometimes surprised to find themselves , after a little time , possessed of great renown as physicians , sorcerers , or discoverers of treasure , without being able to discover any satisfactory account of the facts which have given rise to these strange imaginings . " But after all the marvelous acts thus unhistorically foisted on him have been deducted , there still remain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he consented to take an active part . " And what of these ? Why , according to M. Renan , to the // contemporaries of Jesus these acts were miracles , but to us moderns they are merely " traits of illusion or hallucination . " Precisely what he means by which we now proceed to see . " Miracles , " says he , " only occur in periods and countries in which they are believed in , and before persons disposed to believe in them . No miracle was ever performed before an assembly of men capable of establishing the miraculous character of an act . Neither men of the people nor men of the world are competent for that . Great precautions , and a long habit of scientific research , are requisite . in these days have we not seen nearly all men the dupes of gross prestiges or puerile illusions ? . . . Is it not probable that the miracles of the past , all of which were performed in popular assemblages , would present to us , were it possible for us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? . . . Let a thaumaturgist present himself to-morrow with testimony sufficiently important to merit our attention ; let him announce that he is able , I will suppose , to raise the dead ; what would be done ? A commission composed of physiologists , physicians , chemists , persons experienced in historical criticism , would be appointed . This commission would choose the corpse , make certain that death was real , designate the hall in which the experiment should be made , and regulate the whole system of precautions necessary to leave no room for doubt . If , under such circumstances , the resurrection should be performed , a probability , almost equal to certainty , would be attained . However , as an experiment ought always to be repeated , . . . the thaumaturgist would be invited to produce his marvelous act under other circumstances , upon other bodies , in another medium . If the miracle succeeds each time , . . . supernatural acts do come to pass in the world . But who does not see that no miracle was ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has chosen the subject of the experiment , chosen the means , chosen the public ? . . . Till we have new light , therefore , we shall maintain . . . that a supernatural relation always implies credulity or imposture . " If now a commission of modern scientists should be selected by M. Renan , and they should start upon an exploration of the past , at the utmost what sort of a resurrection from the dead would he expect them to witness on the part of Christ ? " It seems , " says he , " that Lazarus was sick , and that it was indeed in consequence of a message from his alarmed sisters that Jesus left Perea . . . . Perhaps Lazarus , still pale from sickness , caused himself to be swathed in grave-clothes as one dead , and shut up in his family tomb . . . . Martha and Mary came out to meet Jesus , and . conducted him to the sepulcher . The emotion which Jesus experienced at the tomb of his friend whom he thought dead , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that trembling , which accompanies miracles . . . . Jesus . . . desired to see once more him whom he loved , and the stone having been removed , Lazarus came forth with his grave-clothes and his head bound about with a napkin . This apparition must have been regarded by all as a resurrection . " It is indeed true that , as a substitute for the above , Renan subsequently declares " The hypothesis which by the ill reception which the kingdom of God found in the capital , the friends of Jesus , it appears , sometimes desired a grand prodigy which should have a powerful effect upon the Hierosolymite incredulity . A resurrection must have seemed to them as that which , more than anything else , would be convincing , it may be supposed that Mary and Martha suggested this to Jesus . Popular report already attributed to him two or three works of this kind . If , ' doubtless said these pious sisters , one of the dead were raised to life , perhaps the living would be brought to repentance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even a dead man should be raised , they would not believe . ' Recalling then a history which was familiar to him , that of the good beggar covered with ulcers , who died and was carried by the angels into Abraham 's bosom : Should Lazarus return again , ' he said , they would not believe him . ' Afterward there arose on this subject strange mistakes . Hypothesis passed into assertion . They spoke of Lazarus resuscitated , " etc . All of which is very acutely surmised , indeed , by way of a change of base , about this narrative of John . But Renan must still remember that not only had popular report attributed to Jesus two or three resurrections from the dead prior to the episode in question , but that Jesus himself , in Matthew , places works of this kind among the Messianic miracles which the messengers of John might see him do . And if he is at all , intelligibly to // himself , to conceive how Christ could play a conscious part in working wonders of this order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his theory , but substantially to fall back upon the expression given of the matter at the very outset . Even if Christ had never historically claimed to raise the dead , even if John had never put the incident of Lazaius on record , even if it should now for the first time merely be hypothecated that Christ appeared proclaiming he could effect a resurrection , still it inheres in the very principle of his legendary hypothesis of miracles at large , that Renan must depict Jesus as able to raise the dead only after some such a fashion as , in all the earlier editions of the Life of Jesus , he does depict him doing at the ancient town of Bethany . For if the thauInaturgist , Christ , should present himself tomorrow with testimony sufficiently important to merit our attention , announcing he could raise the dead , what would be done ? Why , a commission composed of physiologists , physicians , and the like , would be appointed . But why a commission of scientists , rather than of men of the people or men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men of the world are not competent to sit in judgment in the case of miracles . In fact , nearly all men , and even in our enlightened age , have in such matters been the dupes of gross prestiges or puerile illusions . Doubtless at the bottom of all these pretended prodigies is either credulity or imposture . To detect this , however , great precautions and a long habit of scientific research are requisite . Scientists should be the ones to conduct the whole affair , choose the corpse , make certain that death is real , designate the hall in which the experiment is to be made , demand to see the prodigy repeated under other circumstances , upon other bodies , in another medium . But who does not see that no miracle was ever performed under such conditions ? that always hitherto the thaumaturgist has chosen the subject of the experiment , chosen the means , chosen the public ? And to this the case of Christ is no exception . If he ever did perform a conscious part in the i-die of one who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our guard against is , first , credulity on our own part ; secondly , intrigue on the part of the special friends of Jesus ; and thirdly , imposture on the part of Christ himself . " A miracle , in other terms , " says Renan , " supposes three conditions : the credulity of all ; 2 , a little compliance on the part of some ; 3 , the tacit acquiescence of the main author . " Now it must of course be admitted , first of all , that the miracles of Christ only occurred in a period and a country in which they were believed in , and before persons disposed to believe in them ; and that , in addition to being over-credulous , the popular assemblages before whom they were performed undeniably did not possess that long habit of scientific research which would have been requisite to take the proper precautions against being the dupes of Christ and his disciples* in case the latter did propose to dupe them . Nor is it , in the second place , essential to inquire whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morally capable of playing any such compliant part in getting up a miracle for Christ , as Renan , in the first twelve editions of the Vie de fisus , pictures them a doing , when they would have him work a resurrection at the grave of the beloved Lazarus . Let us the rather proceed upon the supposition that they were so . But what of the compliant Christ himself , in case M. Renan is correct in his proposed solution of his thaumaturgy ? Before responding to this painful question , however , it will be essential to make some explanatory remarks as to the reason why we must nerve ourselves up to probe this legendary view of the miracles of Jesus to the very bottom . The first reason , therefore , is this : that the volume in which it occurs , by a powerful and permanent impression , has everywhere been , as it were , branded on the minds of men throughout the Christian world . " The reception of Renan ' s Life of Jesus , ' * says Hurst , " was most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand copies were soon sold , and translations were made into all the European tongues . ' t- " It marks , " says Schaff , " an epoch in the religious literature of France , and found an unparalleled circulation on the continent of Europe , and even in England and America. *r Froude also speaks of it as " the now notorious work which is shooting through Europe with a rapidity which recalls the era of Luther . " This was indeed all written soon after the first appearance of the book in 1863 . But even so recently as 1870 , Dr. Rigg , of England , pronounces " Renan undoubtedly one of the most distinguished leaders among men of learning and culture . " A second reason why we must not pause until we have probed the legendary hypothesis of the miracles of Christ advanced by Renan to the very bottom , is this , namely , that when the whole question of the miracles of // Christ comes eventually to be decided , Renan , from the very nature of the problem , ever must remain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the anti-supernaturalistic side of the investigation ; and this we now proceed to show . " Science , " says one of our highest American authorities on all such subjects , in a private letter , with kind consent to cite in this connection ,  --  " science knows nothing of miracles , or of events which are not explicable as the consequents of finite , knowable antecedents . The hypothesis of a personal God does not form a part of science , but is added to science by theology . If one begins by accepting the hypothesis of a God extraneous to the Cosmos , and acting upon it as a man acts upon a machine , the controversy about miracles becomes a legitimate one . But so long as we stand upon purely scientific ground , discarding all the extra-scientific theories furnished by theology , the controversy about miracles is not legitimate . Hence , in my articles on the Jesus of History ' and the Jesus of Dogma , ' I have omitted the subject entirely . And in my projected work on the Founding of Christianity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only in the preface . " Before making a single comment on this extract , we must , however , do its gifted author the simple justice of saying that , despite anything in his language which looks in that direction , he is yet neither an atheist , materialist , nor pantheist . Conversely , aftergiving his detailed reasons , he has expressly stated in the public prints , that it is " the final outcome of a purely scientific inquiry , that the existence of God  --  the supreme truth asserted alike by Christianity and all inferior religions - is asserted with equal emphasis by that Cosmic philosophy which seeks its data in science alone . " But what we wish to say is this . No matter whether the position taken by the investigator be that no personal God exists to act upon the Cosmos from without , and as a man acts upon a machine ; or that , although confessedly existing , no personal God , or if it be preferred , no Persistence of Force , no Divine T ) ynamis , ever acts upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When we come specifically to speak of the miracles of Jesus Christ , all this is simply irrelevant . Let it be supposed no personal God exists . Still a personal Jesus Christ unquestionably has existed . Says Renan of Strauss , and very truly : " Most people know him only through the abuse of his adversaries , and from the re port that a visionary of that name had denied the existence of Christ , for it is in terms as absurd as these that the Ly'e of Jesus has been summarily spoken of . " So also let it be hypothecated that no personal God , no Persistence of Force , no Divine Dynarnis , though existing , ever has acted , ever does act , or ever will act , extraneously upon the Cosmos , as a man acts upon a machine . Still Jesus Christ has undeniably been in this world , extraneous to this world , and has acted upon it , so far as the mere principle is concerned , precisely as a man acts upon a machine . Did he do this after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something more ? While , therefore , and for very obvious reasons , the demonstration that Jesus was in truth a worker of miracles might possibly be the first step towards establishing the views of God which Jesus held , as contra-distinguished from those of the atheist , materialist , pantheist or modern anti-supernaturalistic scientist , we must emphasize and never forget the fact that the question of the miracles of Christ is by no means dependent for its settlement upon the prior establishment of either of the views of God referred to . In other words . the atheist , the materialist , the pantheist , and the modern anti-supernaturalistic scientist , in common with the Christian theist , must alike concede that a personal Jesus Christ has existed , and that he has performed certain actions in this world , and it only remains to be determined whether among those actions miracles can be proven to the satisfaction of the scientist . A second remark above suggested by our distinguished Cosmical philosopher is this . We have already noted the fact that there is a supposition current in certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be summarily dismissed as one of simple science . " Not from our line of reasoning , but from the whole mass of modern science , " says Renan , " comes this immense result : Nothing is supernatural . " And our correspondent but carries this supposition to its extremest logical results when he proposes , ex ca/hedrd , to assume that to the modern scientific thinker even a controversy about the miracles of Christ is not legitimate , and then , having merely recognized the existence of the question in his preface , proceed to write a formal treatise on the Founding of Christianity , in the body of which the whole matter of those miracles is most steadily ignored . But we must here be permitted to reiterate what we have said before , that , as // the simple scientist , one might precisely as well undertake to dogmatize whether Alexander ever fought a battle as whether Jesus ever wrought a miracle . Renan may , or may not , be perfectly correct in saying that " by so much as one admits the supernatural he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in no sense scientific ; an explanation ignored by the astronomer , the physician , the chemist , the geologist , the physiologist , and which the historian also should ignore . " But what we wish here to insist on and emphasize is this , that because the scientist has concluded that he can , as such , ignore the supernatural , it does not therefore and of course result that the historian can conclude the same . in other words , when it was above argumentatively assumed that , in order adequately and undeniably to explain , alike in their origin and development , all phenomena peculiar to the field of science , in no case is it essential to hypothecate the supernatural , the question still remained , if the same were true about all the phenomena peculiar to the field of history . When the astronomer , the physician , the chemist , the geologist , the physiologist , and every other scientist , has announced that nothing is supernatural in his especial sphere , altogether they must yet explore that other field of facts referred to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It would indeed be perfectly legitimate altogether to dismiss the supernaturalistic view of the miracles of Christ , after only a brief reference to it in the preface of a formal discussion of the Founding of Christianity , because , in the estimation of the writer , that view had already been exploded by certain predecessors in this department of historical investigation , as by a Renan , Strauss , or even Paulus . But thus to dismiss the supernaturalistic view of the miracles of Christ , on the simple ground that " science knows nothing of miracles , or events which are not explicable as the consequents of finite , knowable antecedents , " is carrying the logical results of modern anti-supernaturalistic tendencies , as opposed to demonstrations , not merely to a most illogical extreme , but almost beyond the calm respect of scholars . The first thing to be done , as we remarked above , is , by the same impartial historical processes employed in any other instance , to determine , and that beyond a question , what events really figure in the life of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be at perfect liberty to cast all such events into his crucibles , and satisfy himself completely whether they survive the proper tests of miracles or not . But no sooner does the scientist attempt to explore the records of the life of Christ , than , on the supposition of the historical reality of those records , he is in the midst of miracles on every hand Men who do not quail before the problem of acco Linting , in a purely natural way , not only for the fact of the descent , but for the manner of the development of man - intellect , conscience , religious sense , and all-from some pre-existing form , must yet falter before the problem of healing lepers and raising dead people by a word , aside from the hypothesis of something supernatural . Here there is for the scientist , indeed , no choice , except either , first , to say we have to deal with miracles in truth ; or , secondly , to drop the character of scientist and play the part of Paulus ; or , thirdly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jesus with which we have to do are in the proper sense historical ; or , fourthly , and as a last resort , as we shall see hereafter , adopt the views of Renan . Of these four alternatives , the third , of course , will be the one first considered by the scientist . But so soon as the work of " casting doubt " upon the gospels has progressed to the full extent to which they can be asserted to be in conflict with the settled facts of science ; the scientist then must pause , and leave the rest of the task to be completed by the proper gospel critics . Accordingly , when it has argumentatively been conceded to the scientist , first , that within his special province there is no trace or sign of the supernatural , and , secondly , that to the extent above mentioned the historical validity of the gospel record of the life of Christ has been by him impugned , he is thereafter and forever left behind in his cal ) acity of simple scientist , and can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miracles before us , only on condition of his turning the critical historian until we come , in conclusion , to sift and test the hypothesis of Ren an , when he may don again his character of scientist . But first the field of history " Paulus , " says Renan , " was a theologian who , admitting the least possible of the miraculous , and not daring to treat the Biblical recitals as legends , tortured them to explain them in a purely natural way . Paulus pretended with this to maintain all the authority of the Bible , and to enter into the real mind of the sacred writers . " - " All the features of the recital were thus accepted as real , but explained without miracle . The new interpreters did not for a. moment think of // asking if the narration in question might not be a fiction . " But after a few preliminary suggestions on the part of other critics , Strauss , plainly perceiving , as he has already told us , that " if the gospels are really and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the life of Jesus , " instituted and organized that attack upon the gospels which is still raging throughout the Christian world , thus hoping that it would be possible to exclude miracles from the life of Jesus , as a matter of fact in which we moderns must believe . For it was not merely at that time , but it has continued until the present day to be the current supposition among the skeptics and the orthodox alike , that , as Christians ,  --  to quote again from Froude ,  --  " the inspiration of the Bible is the foundation of our whole belief , and it is a grave matter if we are uncertain to what extent it reaches , and how much it guarantees to us as true ; " and that , specifically on the subject now before us , " nothing less than a miraculous history can sustain the credibility of miracles . " Starting out upon this supposition , the objective point which Strauss had in view is stated very clearly by himself , where he says , " that the external evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye-witnesses , or those who were near to the date of the gospels themselves , or to the events narrated in them , have , on the contrary , an interval open between that date and the composition of these writings , during which very much that is unhistorical may have been introduced ; and that the internal character and relation of the gospels to each other are altogether those of writings which , having been written in succession at this later period , from different points of view , record the facts not purely as they were , but metainorphosed by the ideas and struggles of this later period and its various tendencies. ** The reader who has made himself familiar with the preceding stages of this investigation , perceives how very neatly this conclusion of Strauss about the late origin and manner of the unhistorical development of the gospels is adjusted to his proposed mythical solution of the miracles of Christ . Whether it is a conclusion which can be legitimately drawn from the external and internal evidences about these documents or not , it surely is precisely that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could assume that , though Jesus never personally professed to perform any miracles whatever , but rather the reverse , and was never believed by his contemporaries to perform any real miracles , still , between the death of Jesus and a certain indefinite period afterward , when our present gospels are alleged by the critic to have been reduced to writing ,  --  could assume , we say , that between the death of Jesus and this imagined later date , we have an interval open during which Jesus , metamorphosed by the ideas , and struggles , and various tendencies of the times , became unhistorically converted , both in his personal l ) re*ensions , and in the popular belief about him , into a wonder-xvorker of the very hP ; he*t order . Now , after he has thus neatly brought out his conclusion about the late origin of the gospels , and the l ) recise manner of their unhistorical development , so precisely to suit his proposed mythical hypothesis of the miracles of Christ , we do not need to be so unceremonious as Renan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistaken in his theory of the com*ilation of the gospels. " - " Upon the whole , I accept the four canonical gospels as authentic . All , in my judgment , date back to the age that follows the death of Jesus . " On the other hand , we can well afford to allow this much-belabored Titan of the modern gospel critics such poor consolation as there may be afforded him in supposing that , so far from being mistaken , he is undeniably correct in his theory of the compilation of the documents in question . No matter , then , at how late a period our present gospels were reduced to writing ; and no matter , also , how much of the unhistorical may have been introduced into them by reason of this supposed tardy composition . We must still-for this we can not possibly avoid-be so unfeeling as to ask our critic how all this will help him onward , even by a trifle , towards success in his peculiar effort unhistorically to solve the miracles of Christ . Whatever else may have been unhistorically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the speeches of Jesus , as we have them now in Matthew , are still confessedly authentic . But , as has already been I ) roven , those speeches at once , forever and unalterably , fix upon Jesus in person the responsibility of professing to perform , and of being believed to perform , not spiritual but material , not imaginary but real miracles . And thus all the peculiar apparatus invented by our critic to evaporate the miracles of Christ into myths , on the assumption that Jesus personally disclaimed performing miracles , and that the problem to be accounted for is how posthumous tradi // tions transformed him into working miracles , - thus does all this peculiar apparatus become , we say , precisely as much an apparatus without a problem before it for solution , on the supposition that only the words of Christ in Matthew are authentic , as it would become on the supposition that , ipsissirna verba , the gospels are throughout inspired . Nor , be it furthermore observed , would this result be at all improved for Strauss , if , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to leave us , selecting , at his perfect option , any other fragment of the gospels as authentic . The speeches of Jesus in either of the other three gospels , or the narrative portions of either of the four , would be equally fatal to his views . In other words , no fragment of the gospels whatever can be left us as authentic , and Strauss be permitted to consume our time with the detailed consideration how Jesus was metamorphosed into a miracle-worker after his death , since the historical truth with which we must always remain confronted is that Jesus was , in the highest conceivable sense , a professed and accepted wonder-worker long before he died . From the iron grasp of this dilemma there is no possible escape for Strauss , except he becomes so desperate as to say that the gospels are utterly without a historical basis ,  --  that no single portion of them is authentic ,  --  that no such person as Jesus ever lived , and said anything , or did anything , of which we have a certain knowledge . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ever did say anything , or do anything , narrated in any given fragment of our gospels , he said he worked miracles , and if he did not do them , he at least somehow succeeded in causing his contemporaries to believe that he did them . After this charge is once fairly fixed upon Christ , however , our whole interest in the modern gospel controversy , so far as it merely bears upon the subject now before us , has forthwith ended as a primary question . We no longer need or care to ask when , or by whom , a certain book was written , or in how far that book is true or false . What we are now alone concerned to discover is how Christ came to profess to be a superhuman wonder-worker , and how he came so astoundingly to succeed in these pretensions , if he did not do his prodigies in very truth . And here , after the materialist , and atheist , and pantheist , and modern anti-supernaturalistic scientist , and cosmical philosopher , and gospel critic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in so far as they have anything in principle to say , whether relevant VOL V.-4z or irrelevant , on this subject of the miracles of Christ , here , last of all , in verification of our remark above , stands Renan ready to have the final word . And not only so , but , in the light of the developments of this discussion , it will be discovered that this final word about the miracles of Jesus , which Renan waits to have , will specifically bring before us that very point about those miracles , which , being , as it is , above all others the most fundamental and decisive , is therefore , comparatively speaking , almost the only one concerning which we need to be assured beyond a peradventure . To illustrate : Concerning that passage in the Ly'e of Jesus where Renan demands that Christ appear before a body of men capable to decide about his thaumaturgy , Froude remarks : " We have quoted this passage because it expresses with extreme precision and clearness the common-sense principle which we apply to all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employ against the whole cycle of Catholic miracles , and which M. Renan is only carrying to its logical conclusions in applying to the history of our Lord , if the gospels are tried by the mere tests of historical criticism . The gospels themselves tell us why M. Renan 's conditions were never satisfied . Miracles were not displayed in the presence of skeptics to establish scientific truths . . . .. Nothing less than a miraculous history can sustain the credibility of mir*-des . " But our brave and brilliant English author , " hard worked , " as he says he is , " in other professions , and snatching with difficulty sufficient leisure to learn how complicated is the problem " of the miracles of Christ , as well as of " the go*pels , " in here " turning to those for assistance who are set apart and maintained as the theological trustees of the laity , " has only been furnished with another one of those most glaring instances of reasoning in a circle , which have come down to us from very ancient times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But manifestly , on all such vital subjects as the one now before us , it is high time that we clergymen cease to be the simple parrots , which we often doubtless are , of the merely piously sounding phrases of the sacred past , and of which we do not even pause to ask ourselves the meaning . For in this special instance , what do we do ? Why , in the first place , we , on the supposition that the miracles recorded in the Bible have beforehand // been themselves established by their own independent and proper proof , then very legitimately employ those miracles to attest the Bible as the Word of God . But some one now steps forward and demands that the miracles by which we would attest the Bible as the Word of God , be themselves not supposed , but proven to be established . And then what ? Why we then very naively turn about and say , ex cathedral , that the Bible is the Word of God , and that the scriptural evidence to the miracles recorded in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hence that the miracles therein narrated are of course established ! " 0 Sane/a Simplicitas I " A given miracle may , if proven , attest a given miraculous history , but that same miraculous history can not , in turn , be used to attest its own attesting miracles . So , though all else in the Bible should be regarded as under the ban and seal of a divine authority , the miracles of the Bible must , even from the stand-point of the strictest orthodoxy , ever remain without the l ) ale , and freely open to a fearless scrutiny . Or take the special case of Christ himself . Suppose he were in person to appear on earth to-day in the character of a divine revelator . Upon being asked for his credentials , he professedly and apparently pefforms a miracle . But we are incredulous , and demand of him to know how we are to be assured beyond a doubt that his offered credential is not a thaumaturgic trick . Would we be content to have him merely turn around and say , cx @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it is therefore sufficient for us to know that he , a divine revelator , asserts his miracle is true ? Manifestly , on any such principle as this , any pretender or enthusiast or charlatan whatever can be a self-asserted messenger from heaven , and can attest himself at pleasure also in these pretensions with his self-asserted prodigies . No , what we wish to know about the miracles of Christ is not in what sort of a book they may have happened to be , or not to be , recorded . On the contrary , all we need the Bible or the very gospels for is merely this , namely , to determine primarily ,  --  as we have already said ,  --  - whether Jesus professed to be and was believed to be a real wonder-worker ; and , secondarily ,  --  and this is all we need to say about our uses for the gospels ,  --  whether there exists to-day sufficient reason for us to believe the same . Upon the former point it has already been seen that the Logia of Matthew , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is perfectly conclusive . What will yet be our answer to the second portion of our problem remains to be determined . Meanwhile we must , first of all , point out this further mistake of Froude , namely , that " the gospels themselves tell us why M. Renan 's conditions were never satisfied . Mira des were not displayed in the presence of skeptics to establish scientific truths . " But no matter for that . Jesus displayed his miracles to establish his supernatural mission . And if he expects them to establish his supernatural mission to the satisfaction of a modern scientist , he has no right whatever to shrink from displaying them before the party to be convinced . So the direction in which Jesus now must go is not to take shelter under the attestation of a certain alleged miraculous record of his life , to sustain the credibility of his miracles . But the only proper thing for him to do is frankly and fearlessly to appear before our congregated savants , and then and there submit his prodigies to the most searching tests that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , is right . The same " common-sense principle which we apply to all supernatural stories of our own time , which Protestant theologians employ against the whole cycle of Catholic miracles , " ought to be " carried to its logical conclusions " in the case of Christ as well . If he can not stand before the same searching scientific scrutiny before which any other wonderworkers fall , then he must fall as well as they . For this there is no help ; nor should there be . But precisely what is the point about his thaumaturgy which a modern scientific commission needs determine ? It is not whether the prodigies which he professedly performed with such astonishing success before his contemporaries , if actually done , were real miracles . Healing lepers by a word , raising the dead ,  --  these are surely superhuman acts enough to satisfy any modern scientist , if only Jesus ever did them . Did Jesus ever do them ? If not , then precisely the thing to be detected is the very matter raised by Renan , namely , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deluded his contemporaries into believing that he di them . It is utterly impossible , however , for Jesus now to appear in person before our modern savants , in order that they may not only see his miracles , but see them under those conditions of a perfect scientific scrutiny which // would be forever exclusive of any future question , in case his miracles were invariably successful . Put , in the unavoidable absence of the thaumaturgist , Jesus , it will answer equally as well , if it can only be demonstrated to the satisfaction of a scientific commission , that both mentally and morally he was utterly incapable of professing to perform any prowgies at all , unless he did in fact perform them . Once for all , therefore , let us look this matter in the face , frankly , fully , fearlessly , and see with what results . In a general way , therefore , Renan 's position here is this : " Fraud shall yet come to be regarded as an inseparable element of religious history . " - " Christianity is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it has not escaped the common laws which govern the facts of religious history . There is not a single grand religious creation which has not been implicated a little in what would now be called fraud . " With regard to miracles in particular , his language is : " There is no religious movement wherein such deceptions do not play a part . " And from this remark , as we are already well aware , he does not propose to make the miracles of Christ the least exception . They , like all other miracles , are yet to find their true solution , not in the hypothesis of a supernatural order of facts , but rather in the hypothesis of credulity on the part of the witnesses , and of imposture on the part of Christ and his disciples . Planting himself upon this position boldly in the Life of Jesus , Renan tells us , and tells us truly , that " the first task of the historian is to depict well the surroundings in which the events which he records took place ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past according to our fancy ; " that " Asia is not Europe ; " that , in the case of the miracles of Christ , we must recollect that we have to deal with " a tradition coneeived by another race , under another sky , in the midst of other social needs . " Then ,  --  putting us especially on our guard against " mutilating history to satisfy our poor susceptibilities ; " - exhorting us to remember here that " the essential condition of true criticism is to comprehend the diversity of periods , and to lay aside those instinctive repugnances which are the fruit of a purely national education ; " - cautioning us not to forget that " by our extreme scrupulousness in the employment of the means of conviction , by our absolute sincerity and disinterested lo**e of the pure idea , we all , who have devoted our lives to science , have founded a new ideal of morality ; " - thus cautioned and guarded against rejecting what we shall see , merely because to us the whole affair is most supremely " shocking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ midst of the Oriental scenes of Jesus 's thaumaturgy . Here we find ourselves at once " transported into a world of women and children , with minds ardent and wandering ; " into a world where " passion is the soul of everything and credulity has no limits ; " where there is , in short , " no grand movement produced without some deceit ; . . . where natures , absolute after the Oriental fashion , once having embraced an opinion , never draw back ; and where , if delusion becomes necessary , it requires no effort . " Renan , however , tries to conduct the exposition of his hypothesis of the miracles of Christ always within these limits . " Must we sacrifice , " says he , " to this unpleasant aspect of such a life its sublii**e aspect ? Let us beware of it . . . . So the exorcist and the miracle-worker have fallen , but the religious reformer shall live forever . " Accordingly , we forthwith find him endeavoring to clear Jesus from the charge of being a common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed throughout it will be discovered by him who reads the L*fe of frszts with this thought in view , that M. Renan is forever at his very wit 's end how to represent the case of the Christ of his hypothesis so as to keep the implications cast upon his mental and his moral character always at the very lowest . But M. Renan here has upon his hands a most delicate and often a most desperate affair to keep within control . So long as he can have " the people themselves , who , from the undeniable need which they feel of seeing in great men and great events something divine , create the marvelous legends afterwards " for Jesus ; so long as he can say , " Who knows whether the celebrity of Christ as an exorcist did not spread about without his knowing it ? " - on the principle that " persons who reside in the East are sometimes surprised to find themselves possessed of great renown as physicians , sorcerers , or discoverers of treasure , without being able to discover any satisfactory account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imaginings ; " so long as he can continue in this strain , we say , all goes forward " as merry as a marriage bell . " The only misfortune to Jesus is that the people will , unhistorically , foist upon him his thaumaturgic character . // But no sooner do we begin to inquire about those miracles " in which Jesus consented to take an active part , " than the waters begin to deepen . The lowest form of suspicion that instantly begins to cling to Jesus is that after " some one , not himself , " had become " responsible for the first rumor of his miracles , " he merely " did not reject the reputation given him , " though he knew full well that he ought in honesty to do so . The next unavoidable query suggested is whether , after all , Jesus was a common charlatan . We begin to reply in the negative . " Not a charlatan , " we confidently assert , for " a charlatan is detestable ; he performs miracles without believing in them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we proceed no further than to say : " The most of the miracles which Jesus thought he performed were miracles of healing . The disorders were very slight  --  a gentle word often sufficed to drive away the demon . " His only misfortune here is not being a modern savant . " Ignorant , " as he was , " of a rational medical science , " he could not have suspected that his prodigies of healing were but psychical effects . What we moderns would put down to the " force of excited imagination " in his patients , he very artlessly passed over to the credit of himself , as a person of supernatural powers . But when we come to ask ourselves how about those other instances of healing which he professedly performs , such as curing the leper by a word , we find ourselves in - deep water . Possibly , however , in all such deeply suspicious instances the adoring friends of Jesus may have prepared his thaumaturgy ready to his hand ? Thus Lazarus , still pale from sickness , might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead , and shut up in his family tomb . Martha and Mary might then have sent for Christ , and conducted him to the sepulcher . Responsively to the command of Jesus , Lazarus only needed to come forth with his graveclothes , and his head bound about with a napkin , and the resurrection was complete . In view of which , as Jesus is supposed not to " be a party to the deception , " Strauss only cares to ask whether " he was blinded by so coarse a trick . " But , unfortunately for this view of the matter , it will cover only certain portions of the evidence , not others . Cases of leprosy , and of feeding thousands of people with a few loaves of bread and a few small fishes , are miracles , for example , which could not have been successfully manufactured for Jesus . At leas* we are already beginning to be confronted with the question whether this Jesus of Renan 's hypethesis is to be taken for a lunatic , or-worse . Less than a lunatic he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own ignorance of nature 's laws , or of the imposition of his friends , r for any other reason , he really believes he performs such prodigies as we now find he professes to do , and does not do so . And if he is nor a lunatic , and does not do these prodigies in ti uth , it is the mildest thing that we can assert when we say , that in professing to do them , and in deluding l ) eol ) le into supposing he does them , he is one of the most detestable charlatans possible to imagine . But really this unpleasant feature in the life of the Jesus of Renan 's hypothesis is becoming so excessively unpleasant , perhaps it can in some way at least be palliated . It may be that " he was a miracle-worker only in spite of himself . " Perhaps , " as always happens in great and divine careers , he suffered the miracles which public opinion demanded of him , rather than performed them . " They may have been " a violence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessity of the hour wrung from him . " But here again the facts in the case of the Jesus of Matthew are very far from being covered . After all the evidence looking in this direction in his favor has been exhausted , we still find him deliberately taking the entire initiative and conduct of his miracles ; as when he refuses to let his disciples send the multitude away to buy victuals , and persists in personally feeding them in a superhuman manner . But was not all this done at a " late period ? " Not by the Jesus whose discourses we have in Matthew . It might as well be said that that Jesus began to talk only at a late period , as that he began to discourse about miracles only at a late period . It is a matter of daily conversation with him to profess to work *miracles , to appeal to his prodigies in proof of his divine mission , and the like . Or , if it be preferred to say that Matthew , whose characteristic is supposed to be massing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact delivered on many diverse occasions and at remotely differen*t periods of his preaching , as in the instance of the Sermon on the Mount ,  --  that Matthew has here exactly reversed his custom , and broken up certain long discourses which Jesus delivered only late in life concerning miracles , and has distributed them in fragments throughout his gospel ,  --  the matter for Renan 's Christ would even then scarcely be mended . C*. // versely , we should then have a Jesus , during the last few days of his career , crowding his pretensions as a miracle-worker for the first time upon his contemporaries after such a sudden and overwhelming fashion , that he would forthwith appear before us in the double character of a most detestable charlatan and lunatic combined . But when we now raise the question why , late or early , no/ens vo/ens , Christ performed his prodigies at all , Renan 's ready answer is : " It was the received opinion that the Messiah would perform many . . . . Jesus therefore had to choose between two alternatives , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And after we have waded out so far as this from shore , deeper and deeper grow the waters with a surprising swiftness . Now Jesus has introduced into his life " the page that wounds us . " Now he has fully entered upon that career of " grievous acts " by reason of which " his worship " is already beginning to " grow feeble in the heart of humanity . " In order " to succeed , " he has begun " to make sacrifices . " He has entered , in short , upon that " desperate struggle " for the triumph of his mission , out of which he never can emerge immaculate . " " Believing that all great things are achieved by the people , " and that " the people are led only by yielding to their ideas ; " " taking into consideration each day the weakness of men , " and laying it down as a settled line of policy " not always to give the true reason for truth ; " he " adopts the baptism of John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prophet Elias resurrected for his precursor ; " " accepts the title Son of David , " or calls himself " the Son of Man , " or " Son of God , " to suit his auditors ; " spares himself too precise declarations , " pretends , like another " Joan of Arc , " " to reveal the secrets of the heart or life ; " works a miracle , or does anything beside , either " in his own direction " or " not in his own direction ; " does all this , we say , to help him onward in his divine career . And if all this begins to wear a very threatening aspect for every sublimer feature of his life , we must still wait until " we can accomplish by our scruples what he did by his falsehoods , " before we shall acquire " the right to be severe upon him . " Meanwhile , let us now for a moment see how our critic will depict this tricky thaumaturgist of his hypothesis in action . " Antipater heard of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubtless supposed were *cunning tricks , and he desired to see some of them . With his ordinary tact Jesus refused . He took good care not to wander forth in* to an irreligious world , which desired of him nothing but a vain amusement ; he aspired only to gain the people ; he reserved for the simple means good for them alone . " - " Thus far he had always avoided great centers , preferring for his field of action the countries and towns of small importance . " - " Behold what is of the greatest moment . That Jesus should have acquired a great renown as thaumaturgist in an ignorant , rural country , favorably situated as Galilee , is quite natural . Had he not even once countenanced the execution of marvelous acts , these acts would still be done by him . His reputation of thaumaturgist would be spread abroad independently of all co-operation on his part and without his knowledge . A miracle explains itself before a well-inclined public ; it is then in reality the public that makes it . But before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is well seen in the relapse of miracles which took place five or six years ago in Italy . The miracles which were produced in the Roman States succeeded . On the contrary , those which dared to appear in the Italian provinces submitted imme , diately to an inquest and were quickly stopped . Those whom they pretended to have cured acknowledged never to have been sick . The thaumaturgists themselves , upon being interrogated , declared that they did not comprehend anything , but that the noise of their miracles being spread abroad , they had believed to have done them . In other words , for a miracle to succeed a little compliance is necessary . The spectators not aiding , then it must be that the actors aid . " - " Jesus was a stranger at Jerusalem . . Instead of . that unlimited facility of faith . which he found in Galilee , . . . he encountered here at every step an obstinate incredulity , upon which the means of action which had succeeded so well in the north produced little effect . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miracles at Jerusalem , we come to suppositions very shocking . " - " One can not for years lead the life of a thaumaturgist without being many times cornered ; without having the hand forced by the public . He begins with ingenuousness , credulity , absolute innocence ; he ends with embarrassments of every kind , and to sustain the divine power , in default of its possession , he extricates himself from these embarrassments by desperate expedients . . . . Ought he to let the work of God perish because God delays to reveal himself ? " // Wherefore , in the case of Renan 's Jesus , we come eventually to read : " We must remember that , in this impure and oppressive city of Jerusalem , Jesus was no longer himself . His conscience , by the fault of men , and not by his own , had lost something of its primitive pureness . Desperate , pushed to extremes , he no longer retained possession of himself . His mission imposed itself upon him , and he obeyed the torrent . Death , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his divine liberty , and to snatch him from the fatal necessities of a character which each day became more exacting , more difficult to sustain . " And all this M. Renan is fairly driven to say in order merely to account for the fact that Jesus " played a conscious part " in the resurrection of the beloved Lazarus , even according to the " mere-misapprehension theory " of the matter given in the final casting of the Life of Jesus ; and played a conscious part therein only to the extent that will enable us to conjecture that it is " not impossible that even a report of this kind should be noised abroad in the lifetime of Jesus , and have had fatal consequences for him . " Does not the reader now perceive what a perfectly fearful hypothesis of the miracles of Jesus Renan has to hold in hand ? If he should for a single instant dare to let this hypothesis dart onward , goaded at full speed only by the Logia of Matthew , to its legitimate goal , so far from leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Jesus unaffected , it would at once and forex*er shatter the entire mental and moral character of Jesus into a thousand hopeless fragments . If he should only once honestly and fully give free reins to his theory of Jesus 's thaumaturgy under the full whip and spur of his own historical proofs , instead of ever being able to announce : " So the exorcist and the miracle-worker have fallen ; but the religious reformer shall live forever ; " he would inevitably be obliged to exclaim : " So the religious reformer has fallen in an utter and eternal ruin , and only the detestable and tricky thaumaturgist stands forever . " Thus says Strauss : " Jesus can not , as the evangelists report , have rebuked the wind and the sea , unless he was either conscious of unconditional power over nature , or a miserable braggart and impostor . " Again : " If , according to Matthew , Jesus said to the captain , Go thy way , and as thou hast believed , so be it done unto thee , ' . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performer of miracles in the sense of the most decided supernaturalism ; or , if he attributed to himself such miraculous power as this without any good ground , he was a wild enthusiast ; while , if he ascribed it to himself with the consciousness that he did not really possess it , he was an audacious cheat and impostor . . . . No one but either an impostor , who was as inconsiderate as he was shameless , or a man who was conscious that he could put an end to illness , would declare that a sick person at a distance , represented as dying , would not die . " Now it is indeed no sufficient reason for rejecting this last scientific word against the current Christian view of the miracles of Christ , simply because it is supremely " shocking . " No more is it any sufficient reason for adopting it , simply because it is to the very last degree revolting . Is it true or is it false ? is it tenable or is it not tenable ? This is all we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guard against mutilating his-* tory to satisfy our poor susceptibilities , *t either seek or wish to know . And regarded as a hypothesis of the miracles of Christ which merely casts the gravest implications upon his mental status , little need be said about it one way or the other . For suppose it should be conceded , for the mere sake of scientific shortness , that Jesus could have been " blinded by so coarse a trick , " as either one of his major miracles doubtlesswould have been , in case they were only foisted on him by his adoring followers . We must still soon leave this region altogether , and pass onward into that other region where Jesus . is always himself the prime mover and actor in every cardinal feature of his thaumaturgy , as . when , be it here repeated , he deliberately refuses to let his disciples send the multitude away to buy victuals , and persists in 1 ) personally feeding them by a prodigy . So , as ultimate scientific thinkers , we herewith cease to have the slightest interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Renan requires . his thaumaturgic Christ to be ; and all our interest centers in the single final questionhow great a knave it would require that wonder-working Christ to be whose words remain to us in Matthew . And this Strauss just now has very plainly told us . But is it historically l ) OSsible , is it even . historically conceivable , that this Jesus of Matthew could have been so very great a knave as this ? M. Renan here , however , to the extent of the needs of his hypothesis , would prefer to speak with the utmost scientific guardedness . Thus , concerning Christ , his question is : // " What was his moral character ? " and this his answer : " Those who wish in history only what is unquestionable , ought to keep silence in all this . " Again his subtle query runs : " Does not Jesus seem to us devoid of human frailties simply because we look at him from a distance and through the mist of legend ? Is it not because we lack the means to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the solitary sinless person ? " Or thus , in general : " XVhat prophet could hold out against criticism , if criticism followed him into his closet ? Happy they whom mystery covers , and who fight entrenched behind the cloud Indeed , M. Renan not merely holds , but plumply says : " Jesus was not sinless ; he conquered the same passions which we combat . " But , first of all , is it indeed true that we have been left by history in such a very great incertitude about the moral character of Christ ? Strauss at least does not think so . " If Jesus , " says he , " ouiiitted to do this , his conduct places him in an equivocal light , in which he by no means appears in the other evangelical narratives . " Again : " This view of the matter would place the character of Jesus in the most equivocal light .. . . We can not ascribe such conduct to him , because it would be in direct contradiction to his general conduct , and the impression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we turn from Strauss to the final test , i.e. , the words of Christ in Matthew . " Blessed are the pure in heart . " " Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness . " " Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness ' sake . " " If thy right eye offend thee , pluck it out . . . If thy right hand offend thee , cut it off . " Do these indeed appear to be the key-note to the moral teachings of a Christ whose very moral character is itself in doubt ? Our second remark is this : Renan 's hypothesis of the miracles of Christ does not lead the purely scientific investigator into any comparatively trivial question about the absolute sinlessness of the thaumaturgist . Wholesale fraud , and open , shameless charlatanry are the real things wherewith we have alone to do . And where can we find such a Christ as this , even by suggestion , in the Logia of Matthew ? The truth is , that the farther this chase to get away from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , the farther away we get , as simple scientists , from all the facts and figures . Thus , Paulus only needed to invent a suitable private interpretation of his own to get rid of the real meaning of the gospels , in crdez to bring his so-called rational solution of these miracles into requisition ; and Strauss only needed to create a purely imaginary issue about these miracles themselves in order to make his mythical hypothesis of them available ; but Renan must arbitrarily contrive his very thaumaturgist , and that in all the essential features of both his mental and his moral character , before his theory can find any sort of Christ to fit it . Men of science , what do you say , therefore , i.e. in view of this final outcome ? Was Jesus . Christ either " a miserable braggart , " " an audacious cheat , " or " an impostor who was as inconsiderate as he was shameless " ? Or was he " conscious of unconditional power over nature " ? was he , in fine , " a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ? At least , in the light of this discussion , we are not merely shut up to these alternatives , but shut up to them as scientists . In other words , though we should flee again and again from destructive gospel criticism to Cosmic philosophy ; and from Cosmic philosophy to all the anti-supernaturalistic schools of science ; and from all the anti-supernaturalistic schools of science to materialism ; and from materialism to pantheism ; and from pantheism to atheism ; still , when the race is ended in either and all these directions , the goal always reached must be that Jesus has lived and done something in this world , and that if lie did not do real miracles , then he was-precisely as he is depicted in the words of Strauss above . The Christian world accordingly awaits to hear from the anti-supernaturalistic schools of science on this very vital question . Who will now stel ) forward to demonstrate the necessary proposition resulting from the denial that Jesus was a wonderworker of the very highest order ? Will it be Darwin ? Will it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be Herbert Spencer ? Will it be our own Fiske of Harvard ? At least the scientific schools of thought in question ought in honor here to rally to the rescue of their Renan . Not only is he the only truly scientific thinker who has thought their side of the subject to the very bottom ; he has also had the rare moral courage to bring the Christian world fairly confronted with the final shocking issue . Men of science , to your Renan 's rescue ! Either prove that the Christ of history was at once an arrant knave and fool ; or else frankly confess that the Christ of history worked miracles , just as actually as the C*esar of history led armies .
