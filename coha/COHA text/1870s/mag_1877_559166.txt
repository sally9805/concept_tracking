ART . lY. - How SHALL THE NATION REGAIN PROSPERITY ? PART II . IN a previous article * it was maintained that for the production of a very large class of commodities , which all the world want and must have , the Upited States enjoys peculiar and exceptional advantages ; that , notwithstanding these advantages , there is a lack of demand entirely and abnormally disproportionate to the amount of such commodities which the United States is able , and desires to supply ; or , in other words , while under natural circumstances it would be natural for all the world to buy largely of the products of our ( manufacturing ) industries , as a matter of fact the world does not so buy , but finds it for its interest to trade elsewhere ; that in the absence of this demand a large percentage of the labor of the United States is , and from the very necessities of the case must continue to be , without employment , and a large percentage of its fixed capital is , and must continue to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things poverty has increased , immigration has diminished , emigration has begun , and through temptations , heretofore unexperienced , the manifestations of crime have become alarmingly greater . The above premises being correct , the conclusion arrived at was , therefore , legitimate ; that the most important of all the questions now before the American people and their government are , How can we create new and greater demands and markets for our national products ? How can we open new channels for trade , or enlarge those already existing ; thereby creating new , larger , and remunerative employments for our surplus labor and capital , and so bring back the country to its old and normal condition of material prosperity ? In the present article it is proposed to enter into the consideration of , and show , in part , by what agencies the demand and market for the products of American labor have been checked and made smaller than they need or ought to be ; how the channels of * North American Review , July - August , 1877. // our trade and commerce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course of policy and specific legislation these checks and obstructions can be removed , and the business of the country be revived , enlarged , and placed on a broader and more healthy basis . These are large words and bold assuniptions . He who uses the one and ventures upon the other unwittingly , and is not prepared to make good his positions , is liable to a harsh criticism for vain speaking . Let the reader judge whether the writer has made himself liable to such accusation . Continuing the line of argument before entered upon , it is desirable to next briefly consider how wants , in general ( of things essential to a good livelihood ) , arise , and how , in general , they are satisfied . Wants have their origin in human nature , and are practically illimitable . No one ever has all he wants , though pretension may be made to that effect . In general , every one satisfies his wants by his own labor ; but no man who is not a savage or a Robinson Crusoe ever attempts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or from the products of one locality ; and nature evidently never intended that it should be otherwise . For there is no nation or country or community , nor probably any one man , that is not , by reason of differences in soil , climate , physical or mental capacities , at advantage or disadvantage as respects some other nation , country , community , or men , in producing or doing something usefuL It is only a brute , furthermore , as economists have long recognized , that can find a full satisfaction for its desires in its immediate surroundings ; while poor indeed must be the man of civilization that does not lay every quarter of the globe under contribution every morning for his breakfast . Hence , springing out of this diversity in the powers of production and of wants in respect to locations and individuals , the origin of trade . Hence its necessity and advantage ; and the man who has not sufficient education to read the letters of any printed book perceives by instinct , more clearly , as a general rule , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade freely , he can better his condition and increase the sum of his happiness ; for the first thing the savage , when brought in contact with civilized man , wants to do , is to exchange ; and the first effort of every new settlement in any new country , after providing temporary food and shelter , is to open a // road , or other means of communication to some other settlement , in order that they may trade or exchange the commodities which they can produce to advantage , for the products which some others can produce to greater advantage. * And , obeying this same natural instinct , the heart of every luau , that has not been filled with prejudice of race or country , or perverted by talk about the necessity of tariffs and custom-houses , experiences a pleasurable emotion when it learns that a new road has been opened , a new railroad constructed , or that the time of crossing the seas has been greatly shortened ; and if to-day it could be announced that the problem of aerial navigation had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with all their goods and chattels , for one tenth of the cost and in one tenth of the time that is now requircd , one universal shout of jubilation would arise spontaneously from the whole civilized world . And why ? Simply because everybody would feel that there would be forthwith a niultitude of new wants , an equal multitude of new satisfactions , an increase of business in putting wants and satisfactions into the relations of equations in which one side would balance the other , and an increase of comfort and happiness everywhere . At the same time this truth , which is in the nature of an economic axiom , ought to be clearly kept in mind , namely , that there is no wealth to be made through trade or exchange of products , beyond the simple economy that results from the producer supplying the consumer cheaper than the consumer can supply himself directly by his own efforts . So much , then , for why we trade . A brief word , next , for how we trade . Many , perhaps most , people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly many legislators , to judge from their talk , * There has been much of speculation , in which Henry C. Carey has taken the lead , as to what determines the location of settlements in new countries , and whether a community , if left to itself , will occupy primarily the poor or the rich soils . But the theory or consideration , above all others , that is determinative of this ques. tion , is the natural methods or channels available in the first instance for intercommunication with other settlements or centres of population . And hence such new settlements always follow in the first instance the seacoast or the shores of navigable lakes or rivers , and rarely penetrate otherwise into the interior . The rich , easily cultivated fertile lands in the interior of such State3 as Indiana , Iowa , and Minnesota would , without the ready means of intercommunication afforded by railroads , have remained to the present hour almost as much a wilderness as they were at the commencement of the present century . // regard money as essential for trade . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy anything , it is necessary to give money , and when we sell , to receive money . Money is not , however , absolutely essential to trade , business , or production . It facilitates trade ; it is a most useful and desirable adjunct of trade , and discharges the same function in trade as a ship , a locomotive , a horse and cart , or a wheelbarrow , though in a larger and higher degree than any of these , or all other similar instrumentalities . These statements are all truisms , the A B C 's of economic knowledge ; yet they are not understood by the mass of the people , or by those whom the people select to represent them in legislative assemblies ; and because they are not understood is one great reason why this nation is now in trouble . It is important , therefore , to endeavor to make more clear these truisms by illustration ; such , for example , as is afforded by the analysis of what takes place in the purchase and sale of a pair of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a familiar transaction , and they will tell you , " Why , of course we understand . What a frivolous question ! We went to the shop ; picked out and took what suited us ; gave the shoemaker five dollars , more or less , and departed . That s all there was about it . " But hold ! there was a good deal more than that involved in the transaction ; so much more , that he who fully understands it has mastered the fundamental principles of finance , commerce , and political economy , though lie may never in his life have read a book or attended a lecture on the subject . What the shoemaker gave was the result of his labor applied to a piece of leather ; as the leather was the result of some other man 's labor applied to a piece of hide ; as the hide was the result of a third man 's labor given to the raising of cattle . On the other hand , what was given for the shoes in the first instance was a sum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the purchaser , or he stole it , it was obtained in exchange , and represented some labor or service performed or to be performed in turn by the purchaser . We may therefore eliminate the use of the money from the transaction altogether , as it was simply used as a convenience , as oil is applied to the axles and bearings of an engine , to make the movements work easy with the minimum of friction . And , eliminating the money , the transaction resolves itself into an exchange of the labor or services of the // shoemaker for the labor or services of the man who desires to have and wear shoes . And as every other transaction throughout the world , by which men satisfy their wants and desires by producing and exchanging , or buying or selling , when a*nalyzed , resolves itself into identically the same elements , we are led up to the recognition and acceptance of this broad general principle , namely , that all trade is at the bottom a matter of barter ; product being given for product and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must buy , and in order to buy we must sell ; and that he who wo n't buy ca n't sell , and he who wo n't sell ca n't buy . Now , to come back to the more immediately practical questions under consideration . Why is there no demand for the multitude of useful things that the United States have the facilities for producing better and cheaper ( as can be demonstrated beyond all question ) than other countries ? Why is there no opportunity for the multitude of our laborers , who ask for nothing else than that they may have the opportunity to support themselves by producing , and are now denied that opportunity ? One answer is , that the United States for now a long series of years has , in its fiscal policy , denied or ignored the truth of the above economic , axiomatic principles . It has not , indeed , in so many distinct words said to the American producers and laborers , You shall not sell your products and your labor to the people of other countries ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other countries , We do not think it desirable that you should sell your products or your labor in this country ; and as far as we can interpose legal obstructions , we do n't intend that you shall ! But in shutting others out , we have at the same time , and necessarily , shut ourselves in . And herein is trouble No. 1 . The house is too small , measured by the power of producing , for those that live in it . And remedy No. 1 is to be found in withdrawing the bolts , taking off the locks , opening the doors , and getting out and clear of all restrictions on producing and the disposal of products . In fact , the country is very much in the condition of a merchant who has a store advantageously situated , and its shelves filled to repletion with a great variety of desirable goods . The roads that lead up to the store are in admirable condition , with good sidewalks and signboards and lamps to make sure that no one goes astray . But when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // proprietor has taken down the steps , walled up the door , and made it so troublesome to get in that they prefer to journey by longer and worse roads to purchase elsewhere . Even if it is only desired to get into the store , not for the sake of trading , but of conversing with the proprietor on the subject , and showing samples of what the outside would like to give for what the inside would like to sell , the outsider ( as in the case of the foreign contributors to the late Philadelphia Exhibition ) finds too his cost that even this is a very troublesome and vexatious matter. * One of the most striking illustrations to be found in all history - one that is going to stand and be quoted for all time in treatises on political economy - of the evil effect of commercial restrictions in limiting trade and industry , and consequently national developnient , is to be found in the history of the commercial relations between the United States and the British North American provinces . Thus , in 1852 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The irritation of the Commissioners of every nation to the International Exhibition at Philadelphia in 1876 at the annoyances to which they were subjected by the United States Custom House regulations was very great , and openly manifested ; and it was universally agreed that nothing similar had occurred in the case of any former international exhibition . On this subject Mr. Goshorn , General Superintendent , thus expressed himself at the close of the Exhibition " The administration of the cus* toms laws gave them the foreign exhibitors a good deal of annoyance which I could not obviate . The customs officials never comprehended the Exhibition . Instead of regarding it as exceptional and peculiar , they treated it like a retail shop , and tied it up with all the red tape they could apply . Besides , there was a want of harmony between different branches of the customs service , which added to the troubles of exhibitors . " r* he catalogues of the articles contributed by one country ( the Netherlands ) were abandoned in the New York Custom House " simply because the Commissioners found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in having them passed would be so great that it was not worth their while to attempt it . " Applicants for information were accordingly in great numbers denied , although pages printed for the express purpose of giving the information " were actually on our soil and in charge of the officers of the government on whose invitation that exhibit was sent . " Great sense of wrong was also experienced at the close of the Exhibition by the refusal of the Treasury Department to make allowance , in payment of duties , for damage of goods sustained through exposure or lapse of time at the Exhibition , so that if an article , originally costing $20,000 , had become so damaged during the exhibition that it would not sell for $1,000 , it must needs have paid duties on $20,000 , or be sent out of the country . A certain firm of foreign exhibitors , it was reported , made two immense vases to show what they could do . They had to build new kilns large enough to burn them in , and they cost $17,000 before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for $1,000 , and yet these vases were chargeable with a duty of about $ 6,500 if they allowed them to remain in the country . // commercial freedom , the aggregate exchanges between the two countries amounted to only $20,691,000 . The subsequent year a treaty of reciprocity went into effect , whereby the people of the two countries were enabled to trade and exchange their products with little or no obstruction in the form of import duties . The result was that the aggregate of exchanges rose the very first year of the operation of the treaty from $20,691,000 to $ 33,494,000 , which subsequently increased , year by year , until it reached the figure of $55,000,000 in 1862 - 63 , and $ 84,000,000 in 1865 - 66. * In this latter year the treaty of reciprocity was repealed , and restrictive duties again became operative . The result was that the annual aggregate of exchanges immediately fell to $58,000,000 ; and in 1875 , nine full years after the expiration of the treaty , when both nations had largely increased in wealth and population , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been but little more than made good ; the probable aggregate for 1875 having been about $86,600,000 . Again , the quantity of freight - meaning thereby commodities - transported on the railroads of the United States , is at present at the rate of about two hundred millions of tons per annum ( for the year 1876 , a period of great industrial and commercial depression , 197,082,000 tons ) . If we assume each ton so moved to be worth on an average but $50 ( a low estimate ) , then the value of the exchanges at present annually effected in the United States , through the agency of railroads alone , excluding all other instrumentalities of trade - boats , ships , wagons , animals , and the like - from consideration , is , in round numbers , ten thousand millions of dollars ; or , to state it differently , if the present population of the United States is forty-four millions , then every 4,400,000 of its people now exchange annually commodities among themselves , through the agency of railroads alone , to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true that much of this freight is transported backward and forward under different ' conditions and forms * It is not to be concealed that during the last year of the reciprocity treaty , or after a serious movement had been made for its abrogation , importations from the Provinces increased in anticipation of a consequent renewal of the United States tariff . This fact does not , however , affect the general result stated ; the exchanges for 1863-64 being more than threetimes greater than those of 1852- 53 , the year before the ratification of the treaty .

The line which separates these Provinces from the United States is purely artificial and not natural ; and except where a lake or river has been accepted and named as the boundary , no one can readily tell where one country begins or the other ends . It stands , therefore , to reason , that were it not for artificial barriers , arbitrarily set np by legislation , men and commodities would pass as freely between the two countries as they now do between different sections of the Provinces , or between the different states of the American Union , and that the methods and amount of trade over the whole territory under the two governments would be uniformly subject to the same influences . But the United States , with a view of promoting national industry and effecting national development , has been mainly instrumental in establishing all manner of arbitrary and burdensome restrictions on trade and commercial intercourse along this artificial or imaginary line separating the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States , divesting themselves of prejudice , stop for a brief moment and consider the result ? It is very interesting , very instructive , finds few parallels in modern commercial experience , and may all be summed up in the following brief statement . The aggregate value of all the exchanges between the 4,000,000 of people in the Dominion of Canada , and the 44,000,000 of people in the United States , for the year 1875 ( the latest year for which we have returns ) , through every variety of instrumentality , was only $86,600,000 ; while , as before shown , every 4,400,000 of people on the United States side of the line , under the condition of perfect internal free trade , effected exchanges between themselves , through the agency of railroads alone , to the extent of $ 1,000,000,000 .

The way stands open ; and it only remains for the people of the United States who are suffering for lack of employment , and who complain that there is no demand for the products of their industry , to signify that it is their wish , and it will be done . The people of the British Provinces are only too ready to enter into reciprocal and general commercial arrangements with the people of the United States which will result in such augmentation of trade ; and there is no ear more quick to listen and respond to the demands of the people than the representatives of the people in Congress assembled . Selfish private interests , on both sides of the line , will promptly respond , as they have heretofore , * that it is not desirable that any such commercial arrangement as is proposed should be entered into .

Richard J. Cartwright , beftire the Canadian House of Commons , February , 1875 " Our distress ( industrial and commercial ) has been considerably aggravated by external causes over which we had no sort of controL The House knows that the people of the United States have been laboring for two or three years under most unusual depression . The House knows , also , that it is quite impossible for a small community like ours , placed as it is in the immediate vicinity of a great nation of forty-four millions of people , bordering on us for two or three thousand miles ,  --  the House knows , I say , that it is quite impossible that any long . continued permanent depression can exist in the United States without reacting very powerfully upon us . We know that when the prices of American staples are high , ours will be high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it will be dear in Canada ; when cheap , it will tend powerfully to make it cheap in Canada also . " ? The mass of the people of the United States , occupied with their private cares and business , and giving but comparatively little attention to the details of our foreign relations , probably do not know , what it is full time they should know , that the policy of the United States towards the British Provinces has for a series of years been anything but generous and worthy of a great people . Thus , by the treaty of 1871 between the United States and Great Britain , it was agreed that " fish of all kinds , the produce of the fisheries of the Dominion of Canada , shall be admitted into the United States free of duty , fish caught in inland waters and fish packed in oil excepted . " But in 1875 Congress , under influence exerted in behalf of the canned salmon interest , imposed a duty of a cent and a half on each quart of contents of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fish of any kind admitted free of duty under any existing law or treaty , " the effect of which was to nullify , by a small and mean device , an essential part of the stipulated provisions of the treaty ; and all remonstrances on The part of the Dominion government against such enactment has thus far availed nothing . Had a similar act , adverse to the interest of the United States , been perpetrated by any foreign state , words could hardly be found to express the extent of American indignation for so intentional a violation of solemn public engagements ; and the government at Washington would have been quick to demand reparation . Again , under the provisions of the e sting treaty , all 3 - fish , the product of the Dominion fisheries , fresh , dry , or preserved in any way , except in oil , are admitted into the United States free of duty . Under the e isting tariff all fresh fish , intended for immediate consumption , wherever caught , are also admitted to free entry // Thus , to illustrate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Lakes Erie and Ontario and the river St. Lawrence , east of But within the present year the Treasury Department has ruled that if fresh fish insported from Canada into the United States are packed in ice ( simply in order that they may be transported to greater distances and supply the immediate demands of more inland markets ) , the fish in such cases do not then answer to the conditions for imme , diate consumption , and are , therefore , subject to varying rates of duty , accord . ing to their species . Article XXVII . of the same treaty provided that the British government would urge upon the government of Canada to secure to the citizens of the United States the use of the canals " in the Dominion on terms of equality with the inhabitants of the Dominion , " and the United States in turn engaged to urge upon the State governments to secure to the subjects of Great Britain " the use of the several State canals connected with the navigation of the lakes and rivers traversed by or contiguous to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of equality with the inhabitants of the United States . " At the same time the free navigation of the St. Lawrence River was guaranteed by Great Britain to the United States . Immediately after the ratification of the treaty the British and Colonial governments made haste to carry out the stipulations on their part in these respects . The St. Lawrence was made free , and the privileges of the Canadian canals were granted to American vessels on the payment of tolls that barely covered the cost of wages and repairs . But up to the present time the government of the United States have not only failed to do anything to facilitate the transit of Canadian commerce through the States , but they have omitted no opportunity to harass and obstruct it . Thus , the Federal government ( last administration ) has so construed the Washington treaty of 1871 as to withhold from Dominion vessels with cargo the privilege to load in Canadian ports for New York and other ports on the Hudson River ; in consequence of which any merchandise transported in a Canadian bottom can only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entered at customs and transshipped into a United States vessel for transportation to its destination . Technically , the privilege to use the canals does not necessarily imply the use of rivers connecting therewith ; but in the case in question , the New York canals , which the Canadians desire to use , constitute , in connection with the Hudson River , a great marine highway between Canadian ports on the St. Lawrence and the Great Lakes and the United States ports on the Hudson River and seaboard , and the cutting off of any one link or section renders the remainder nearly , if not quite , practically useless . In a precisely similar case , namely , that of the Ottawa River and the Grenville Canal , the Dominion government have acceded to vessels of the United States every privilege enjoyed by Canadian vessels , and apparently have never thought that any other interpretation of the treaty could be honestly contemplated . It was also provided in the same treaty that the value of the privilege then conceded to the inhabitants of the United States by Great Britain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ North American Colonies without being restricted , as formerly , to a certain distance from the shore , should be determined by commissioners to be appointed by the respective parties . Six years have now elapsed since the ratification of the treaty , and although the subject has been repeatedly pressed upon the attention of the Federal authorities , it is only within the present year that the United States has been willing to comply with its agreement and appoint a commissioner to take part in the stipulated determination . // Lake Huron , south of the 45th parallel , and included mainly within the present Dominion Proyince of Ontario , there is as fair a country as exists on the North American continent ; nearly as large in area as New York , Pennsylvania , and Ohio combined , and equal , if not superior , as a whole , to these S&amp;ates , in its agricultural capacity . It is the natural habitat on this continent of the combing-wool sheep , without a full , cheap , and reliable supply of the wool of which species the great worsted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we should rather say , exist . It is the land where grows the finest barley , which the brewing interest of the United States must have if it ever expects to rival Great Britain in its present annual export of over eleven millions of dollars worth of malt products . It raises and grazes the finest of cattle , with qualities especially desirable to make good the deterioration of stock in other sections ; and its climatic conditions , created by an almost encirclement of the Great Lakes , especially fit it to grow men. * Such a country is one of the greatest gifts of Providence to the human race ; better than bonanzas of silver , or rivers whose sands contain gold . Is it desirable for the United States to own it , and incorporate it as an integral part of the Union ? It can be done .

During the period of the operation of the IReciprocity Treaty before the war , the ratio of its increase of population was at the rate of 4.38 per cent per annum , or in a ratio greater than that of the United States at any period of its history ; but after the outbreak of our war and the repeal of reciprocity ( or from 1861 to 1871 ) this annual ratio of increase ran down to 1.61 , or to a ratio less than that of the United States at any period of its history .

But supposing the policy indicated to have been entered upon by the United States , and the anticipated results of development having been speedily attained , the new States across the border , or indeed the entire Dominion , should not then desire to become politically united with us ? The answer to this would be , first , that if statecraft had done its whole duty in making the interests of the two countries common , such an opposition probably would not exist .

With the single exception of the satisfaction of a brutal , heathenish sort of feeling which rejoices in the extension of dominion and the enlargement of territory as evidences of the possession of physical power , there is not one single advantage which could come to the United States from Canada annexed which might not in an equal degree be made to accrue , under a rational system of economic laws , from Canada independent .

In the absence of all restrictions on commercial intercourse , the people of New York , Pennsylvania , and Ohio trade among themselves , and the rest of the Union when it suits their interest ; and when it does not suit , they desist . Under similar conditions of freedom the Canadian states , present and future , obeying a common law of self-interest , would act in the same manner . Whatever products of labor the one at any time desired to sell to the other could only be sold by receiving in exchange an equivalent amount of labor of the other , and if the exchange was not mutually advantageous and profitable , it would not be continued .

But , reasoning from general principles , how much longer , it may be asked , are we to read from the pages of the Book we profess as a nation to believe , that God has made of one blood all the nations of the earth , and then turn away and act as though there was not a word of truth in the averment ? How much longer shall we turn the pages of European experience during the seventeenth , eighteenth , and a good part of the nineteenth century , before we learn that the planting of colonies and the acquisition of territory for // the purpose of compelling trade and profiting by advantages not accorded to other nations , has been a business far more productive of evil than of good ? And when as a nation shall we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what it would seem ought to come through intuition , " that if commerce is allowed to be free , its advantages will be shared by every country that engages in it ; that in the absence of monopoly the benefits of trade are of necessity reciprocal ; and that in a mercantile point of view it would be as absurd to attempt to impoverish a people with whom we trade " ( as we have attemped to impoverish Canada ) , " as it would be for a tradesman to work for the insolvency of a rich and frequent customer " ? * Left to itself , the average human mind must , it would seem , receive and act upon these truths as if by intuition ; and that it does so tend to act finds a curious illustration in an extract from the last annual message of General Grant as President of the United States . General Grant , it is well known , in the earlier years of his * " The great producing regions of the Dominion , which we formerly knew a Upper and Lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , one capital advantage over us in their mighty St. Lawrence , which affords a water-line navigable for a ship of 1,000 tons , 2,500 miles inland to the very centre of the continent . This great water-way , having its outlet on the fiftieth parallel , is closed to them for nearly half the year . This alone has prevented the Canadas from rising to the condition of a first-class state ; for the practicable and only proper commercial outlets to the great river , for climatic reasons , are the harbors of Boston , Portland , and New York . On the other hand , this great water-way , even when free from ice , and flowing ready to serve the Western States , as their outlet to the ocean , is closed by a harrier far worse than ice , that of the prejudice and non-intercourse worked by bad statutes . The Almighty made the great plains of the West and of the Canadas for the habitation of his children . Between them and the ocean he raised the great Laurentian chain of mountains which we know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the river St. Lawrence , and through the frequent gaps in the mountains the way for our iron roads has been discovered . As one country , each section would have supplemented and benefited the other ; but men in their ignorance and prejudices have frozen the river after the ice itself had floated away , and have closed the gaps in the mountain chains , even after the iron road had been laid down in them . Are there words to express the folly of those who would reconstruct the continent more fitly than it has pleased the Almighty to do it ? Are those men statesmen or blind idiots who render the labor of man more arduous , who double the sweat of the brow , and serve but half the loaf that might be eaten ? These are not mere questions of a dollar more or less , but they are questions that lie at the foundation of human society , and that are a part of social ethics . " - EDWARD ATKINSON , Address before the Boston Board of Trade , 1874. // Presidency , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with us as a nation races and states that we can not politically assimilate or digest , earnestly desired to annex San Domingo , and make it a part of the United States . The scheme failed to receive the assent of either Congress or the nation , and consequently failed ; but recurring to it in his last message , General Grant maintained , that if " my views about annexation had been concurred in , the country would be in a more prosperous condition to-day , both politically and financially . " And for this belief he gives the following reasons : " Santo Domingo is fertile , and upon its soil may be grown just those tropical products of which the United States use so much , and which are produced and prepared for market now by slave labor almost exclusively , namely , sugar , coffee , dyewoods , mahogany , tropical fruits , tobacco , etc . " He next proceeds to show , that of the aboveenumerated useful commodities , Cuba and Brazil furnish the United States at present with the larger portion of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cuba , " is " unfavorable to a mutual exchange of the products of each country . " San Domingo annexed , the following changes , in the opinion of General Grant , would immediately occur : " All that is produced in Cuba could be produced in Santo Domingo . Being a part of the United States , commerce between the island and mainland would be free ; there would be no export duties on her shipments , nor import duties on those coming here . There would be no import duties upon the supplies , machinery , etc. , going from the States . " All restrictions on commercial intercourse being removed , " hundreds of American vessels , " he continues , " would now be advantageously used in transporting the valuable woods and other products of the soil of the island to a market , and in carrying supplies and emigrants to it . The island is but sparsely settled , while it has an area sufficient for the profitable employment of several millions of people . The soil would have soon fallen into the hands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commerce that emigration there would have been encouraged .. The emancipated race of the South would have found there a congenial home , and where their labor would be so much sought after that the poorest among them could have found the means to go . " Whether all these glowing anticipations would have been // speedily realized had the proposed scheme of annexation been carried out may well be doubted . But apart from matters of con-. jecture , it is interesting to note how quick and keen a mind , which showed itself so little acquainted with industrial and commercial matters as that of General Grant , was to discern the benefit that might follow the removal of all restrictions on exports and imports and intercommunication between the United States and the island of San Domingo ; and at the same time how utterly incapable it was to perceive that it was not necessary for the United States to annex and own San Domingo to secure such a degree of commercial freedom between the two countries ; that all barriers in the way of attaining such a result were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislation of the United States ; and that there was nothing which the people and government of San Domingo would do more willingly than to admit every product of the United States , free of impost , into their ports , and accord all manner of other privileges to citizens of the United States on their island , on condition that the latter country would , in turn , allow the peculiar products of San Domingo to be imported into the United States on the terms that they would be , had the scheme of annexation been perfected , that is , free of duty . The effect of arbitrary legislative restrictions on the international exchanges between the United States and the British Provinces , in hampering and diminishing the general business of the country , has been pointed out ; but the effect of such restrictions on particular branches of business , obtained by analyzing the details of such exchanges , are equally significant and instructive . The case of the export of man2tfaetured lumber is especially a case in point . Thus before ' the expiration of the reciprocity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when Canadian lumber could be imported into the United States free of duty , a yvry considerable business existed , all the way from Eastport , Maine , to New York , on the Atlantic coast , and also at certain points on the lakes , in importing Canadian lumber in the rough , working it up by machinery into the ready constituents of houses , - boards , flooring , shingles , doors , paling , sash , blinds , etc. , - and shipping it to the West Indies , South America , Cape of Good Hope , Australia , and other countries , where labor was scarce and machinery almost wholly wanting . Of this business the United States , previous to // and during the first two years of the war , had almost entire control ; and it is doubtful if even so much as one vessel up to that time left the Dominion waters for a foreign port loaded with any such manufactures . The great increase of prices and wages during the war , coupled with the presence of Confederate cruisers upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affected the extent of this business ; but immediately on the termination of the war the export increased and gave evidelV of complete revival . But when the reciprocity treaty was repealed in 1866 , and Canadian lumber was , in consequence of the duties on its import in the A United States , made twenty per cent more expensive to manufacture on this side of the boundary-line between the two countries than it was to manufacture on the other side of the same line , the increase was checked and the revival did not take place . American manufacturers moved their capital and machinery across the borders , or entirely abandoned the export business ; while Canadian manufacturers made haste to take up the business where the Americans dropped it , or rather , by the action of their own goveminent , were forced out of it . So that , whereas in 1863 few vessels loaded with manufactured lumber sailed out of the ports of the British Provinces for foreign markets , the number of such vessels so loaded and sailing in 1871 was reported in excess of seventy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from the port of St. Johns , New Brunswick , to the British West Indies for example , increasing from $16,000 in 1855 to $ 550,000 in 1872 ; to the Spanish West Indies from $269,000 to $882,000 ; and to South America from $18,000 to $127,000 , during the same period . On the other hand , the exports of manufactured lumber from the United States have never regained the proportions that they attained prior to the war , $1,882,000 in 1875 , as compared with $ 3,158,000 ( gold valuation ) in 1857 , and $2,703,000 in 1860 . The annual exportation of all lumber from the United States , from 1865 to 1874 , has also remained almost stationary ; while the amount of lumber imported from the Provinces into the United States has increased , notwithstanding the duties and a large augmentation of prices , to meet home necessities . But the commercial relations between the United States and the British North American Provinces are by no means peculiar or exceptionaL They are , in fact , the type of the commercial rela // tions which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries ; and it matters little at what point one begins to investigate it . For he will find everywhere evidence , amounting to demonstration , that the development of the industry and commerce of the United States has been most disastrously checked , and the present state of business depression in a great degree occasioned , by the persistent refusal to recognize , in our commercial and fiscal legislation , the simplest principles of political economy . In further proof of this , attention is next asked to the character of our commercial relations with Chili , - one of the most prosperous of the South American states . The manufactures of Chili being few and rudimentary in the extreme , its people import from other countries nearly all that they require of cottons , woollens , hardware , agriculturai implements , and other machinery , paints , oils , gunpowder , earthen and glass ware , boots and shoes , straw goods , etc. , etc . The largest single item of their imports is cotton cloth , of which Chili imported for domestic consumption during the year 1874 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Britain more than 55,000,000 yards ; and from the United States during the same year , a quantity not in excess of 5,000,000 yards ; or , in other words , this little state , one of the smallest among the nations , with a population of about 2,000,000 , imported more cotton cloth , to supply her wants , from Great Britain in 1874 than the United States exported that same year in the aggregate to all foreign countries combined . During the year 1874 many of the cotton-mills of the United States stood idle or worked on reduced time , for the reason that no market could be found for their products ; but had the United States been able to supply Chili during that year with 55,000,000 yards of cotton cloth , the demand would have sufficed to have kept about 150,000 spindles ( No. 14 yarn ) , or about one quarter of the cotton-mills in the State of New York , in active operation for every working day in the year ; and the withdrawal of the products of these mills from competition in the domestic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country to have avoided suspension , to the great benefit of labor and to the diminution of destitution and idleness . Now what was the reason that the United States were unable to sell but five millions of yards of cotton cloth in 1874 to Chili , while Great Britain could sell in the same year fifty-five // 302 Sept. millions ? Not that the people of Chili preferred English cloth to American , for the general testimony is to the effect that the American cloth is better . Not because the people of Chili were unwilling to trade with the people of the United States , for the relations of the two countries have always been in the highest degree friendly ; and then , again , sentiment has very little to do with trade nowadays . Trade knows little and cares less of the places and nations where goods are made , and nations , alike with individuals , everywhere buy and sell as they think they can best subserve their own pocket interests . " Exactly so , " will doubtless be the remark of some readers at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than the United States , because of the advantage which comes to her through the possession of cheaper , or , as many are pleased to term it , pauper labor . " But hold ! England indeed has an advantage , but the advantage does not come in here . All recent investigations and practical experience have shown that in respect to the coarser cotton fabrics which constitute the bulk of the world 's consumption , the United States can now manufacture full as cheap , and probably a little cheaper than Great Britain . There are cotton-mills now running in New England whose products are , and for the past year have been , largely exported and sold , after paying freights and commissions , at a profit in London , Liverpool , and Manchester . Cotton goods made at Fall River , Massachusetts , and shipped to England , have been reshipped by Manchester firms to foreign markets at a profit . According to the recent investigations of Mr. Atkinson ( see communication to the New York Herald , April 24 ) the cotton-spinner in New England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an advantage in the price of his cotton over the cottonspinner of Manchester , England , of three fourths of a cent a pound on the cost of his cotton , which would admit of the New England manufacturer paying thirty-three per cent higher wages than his English competitor , " and yet make the thirty-inch ( cotton ) drill at the same cost . " But the American cotton manufacturer does not pay thirty-three per cent higher wages than are paid for similar labor in Great Britain . On the contrary , according to Mr. Atkinson , all the evidence obtainable is to the effect that " the cost of labor per pound or yard of cloth is now as high in Great Britain as it is in New England , and , according to some of the evidence , the cost of manufacturing is to-day less in New England than in Great // Britain . " " This difference the English manufacturer has of late only surmounted " ( we continue to quote from Mr. Atkinson ) " by adulterating his goods with starch , clay , barytes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reacting , and which , in the long run , will not succeed . " * In the cost of producing cotton goods of the same quality suitable for the Chilian market the advantage , therefore , is clearly with the American rather than the British manufacturer ; and , other things being equal , the American ought to have the trade . But other things are not equal ; and in one particular especially the English manufacturer enjoys an advantage over the American , and by the American 's own act and volition , which in the race for competition leaves the American nowhere . The Englishman recognizes the truth , and acts upon the basis , that all trade is barter , product being given for product , service for service ; that to sell one must buy ; and in supplying Chili with cotton cloth he takes his pay for his cloth in what Chili has got to pay with . The American manufacturer , on the other hand , refuses , or by the act of his own government is not allowed , to take his pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a consequence has not , and as long as he continues to pursue the same course never will have , any considerable trade with Chili . Thus , the commodity which Chili has mainly to sell is copper ore ; out of a total export in 1872 of about $30,000,000 , more than one half in value ( $17,500,000 ) consisting of ores of copper , copper regulus , and unwrought copper . Another important article of Chilian export is wool . Now the method of trade between Great Britain and Chili is as follows : British ships , loaded with cottongoods ( average 55,000,000 yards per annum ) , hardware , paints , machinery , paper , etc. , sail for Valparaiso , earning freights . Arriving in Chili , the cargo unloaded is replaced . with another cargo of copper ores or wool , and the ships return to England , earning other freights . Profitable employment is thus given to many British ships , and an explanation in great part afforded of the continued supremacy of the British commercial marine , which * In a recent lecture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ William Thompson , F. C. S. , upon the " Sizing of Cotton Cloth , " a list of the materials used . for adulteration was given in detail and the methods described . In witness of the importance of the subject the lecturer said : " As a general rule the whole margin of the whole English manufacturer 's profit lies within the size used . " // strengthens and increases just in proportion as trade increases . Arriving in England the copper ores are sold to the copper-smelters at Swansea , in the southwest of England ; who , in converting them into mercaiitile forms , employ English labor , English capital , English railway service , and consume large quantities of English coal Smelted into ingots , rolled into sheets , or converted into yellow-metal , or brass , the Chilian copper is finally sold to whoever in the world wants to buy , - and all the world always does want to buy copper under some conditions , * - and out of the proceeds of the sale the Swansea smelter pays himself , pays the conton-spinner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and all others concerned ; the movement , as a whole , being in the nature of a great circle of transactions , in every one of which some profit accrues to English capital and some opportunity for employment is afforded to English labor . But in this great , and special circle of production and exchange American capital and American labor find no place . t Other interests have in effect said to Congress , a dollar made in copper-mining in the United States is worth more than a dollar made in copper-smelting in the United States , although the copper-smelting forms the link in a chain of transactions , which , uninterrupted , will allow of a great and continuous commercial current , and which in turn will give employment to ten dollars of capital and ten laborers , where the interests of copper-mining will employ of each but one . And Congress has thus far listened to the demands of the small and crushed the interests of the great , and since 1869 has imposed rates of duty on copper and copper-ore , which really were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world known as the United States buys . English yellow metal is admitted free of duty if used on American vessels not engaged in the coastwise trade ; while the copper ore and copper out of which this very yellow.metal is made are excluded from our ports by the excessive duty imposed on their iml ) ortation. t The extent of this special circle of industry and commerce , from which the United States has excluded its labor and capital , is strikingly illustrated by the fol. lowing figures : For the year 1875 the United States exported 5,147,140 pounds of unmanufactured copper , of the value of $1,046,227 ; and of brass and manufac. tures of copper and of brass , to the value of $1,125,711 ; total , $2,271,938 . During the same year Great Britain exported of copper , wrought and unwrought , and of brass and yellow-metal , 1,001,940 cwt. , having a declared value of $24,910,250 ; an amount greater than the value of all the wheat , in the form of flour , exported from the United States during the same year . // needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ importation of either of these commodities into the United States practically impossible . Previous to 1869 this was not so . Then under a duty of five per cent ad valorenL copper ores , obtained in exchange for various products of American labor in Chili , on the coast of Africa , and in the West Indies , were imported in considerable quantities , and large works existed in Boston and New York harbors and in Baltimore for smelting them in connection with American ores that mixed advantageously . But no smoke has come out of the chimneys of any of these works since the imposition of the existing duty , and so long as itis continued none ever wilL In 1876 , there being an evident opening for the sale of American farm products , cotton-fabrics , machinery , hardware , etc. in Chili , a line of steamers was started from Boston ; owned in great part in the United States , but of British build and register , carrying the British flag and commanded by an English captain . After a year 's experience , the agents report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but are embarrassed about the return cargo ; and ships to be profitable must earn freights both going to and returning from a market . These Boston steamers , to obtain a return cargo , have therefore been obliged to take Liverpool freight and transship it at Boston ; several hundred tons of copper in one instance , for example , having been recently brought by one steamer to Boston . But as this cargo could not be profitably landed at Boston , paying duty , it had immediately to be sent to England . Another important article which Chili has to export , and give in payment for foreign products , is nitrate of soda ( Chilian saltpetre ) , largely used in the manufacture of gunpowder , sulphuric and nitric acids , and for fertilizers ; and our recent industrial and commercial experience with this raw material for manufacture as strikingly illustrates the beneficial effects of exemption from governmental interference , as our recent experience with that other raw material , copper , illustrates the disastrous effects of such interference . Prior to 1870 nitrate of soda was subjected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; since 1870 it has been admitted free of duty . Note the effect . The imports , which in 1869-70 were 28,8.67,000 pounds , have increased to 51,887,000 // in 1876 . Who and what has been benefited ? First , the carrying trade between the United States and Chili . Second , the general industry of the United States , for the labor embodied by the Chilians in digging and shipping the saltpetre has been compensated by an equivalent amount of labor embodied in some products ( manufactured ) of the United States , - nearly two pounds of nitrate of soda being used for the manufacture of gunpowder , nitric and sulphuric acids , and fertilizers , where one was used but a few years previous . Third , the powder , acid , and fertilizer makers , and the bleachers and dyers of the United States , who , having a part of the tools ( raw materials ) of their trade cheapened , have evidently sold more , and been enabled to sell cheaper , and so better contend against foreign competition in the production and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experienced anything of detriment by the remission of duties on this Chilian saltpetre ? The United States lost an amount of annual revenue ( 1869-70 ) of $288,000 , which was probably not one twentieth of what the country gained indirectly , reckoned in money . Leaving now Chili , and crossing the continent to the east , we have the Argentine Republic , another South American State resembling Chili . Its importations for the year 1874 were as follows : from England , $ 21,405,000 ; from France , $ 19,836,000 ; from Belgium , $ 16,777,000 ; and from the United States , $3,945,000 , with exports to the United States of $3,747,000 . An analysis of this insignificant trade between the United States and the Argentine Republic shows that it consisted , during the year specified , mainly of lumber , with some kerosene , tobacco , railway supplies , alcohol and whiskey , furniture , machinery , and a few other articles , exported from the United States , which were paid for mainly ( to the extent of about two thirds ) by an import from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little wool ; and small as was this trade in 1874 , the latest consular advices report it as diminishing and not increasing . During this same year the export of cotton goods from Great Britain to the Argentine Republic was in excess of forty millions of yards ; while for the year 1875 - 76 the export from the United States of these same fabrics to this same country was practically nothing , - 155,000 yards being officially reported . The explanation of this curious commercial phenomenon is not , // however , at all difficult . The principal commodity of domestic production which the Argentine States have got to give in exchange ( or pay with ) for the commodities of foreign production which it desires to have , is Mestiza wool ; which , in connection with sheepskins and tallow , comprises about two thirds in value of the entire exports of the country . The United States could use Mestiza wool in large quantities , and pay for it with cotton goods and other manufactures , if our manufacturers were allowed to buy it . But this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the import of this description of wool are all but prohibitory , and under such a condition of things there can be but little trade . It is useless to expect to ship goods to Buenos Ayres to the growers of Mestiza wool and ask money in exchange ; for they can not pay money , even if the prices of our merchandise are considerably lower than the prices of corresponding English products , for they have not got it . There is no coin of any kind in circulation in the Argentine States , not even for small change , and the paper money used is of the most depreciated character . Hence , so far as we shut Mestiza wool out , we shut American cotton-fabrics and other merchandise in . England , on the other hand , imposing no restrictions on the trade with wool , the wool product of the Argentine States finds its way mainly to England , and is paid for , primarily , with English goods ; and this in the main also is the reason why England , in 1874 , sold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the United States sold one . If it now be rejoined that , in proportion as we exclude and use less of Mestiza and other foreign wools , the greater the amount of home-grown wool we will manufacture , and the larger the quantity of home manufacture we will sell to the American wool-grower for consumption , the answer is , that any such rejoinder will not be in accordance with experience . For ( as will be hereafter demonstrated ) the home producer of wool has always obtained the highest prices , and has raised proportionally the largest quantity , when foreign wool has been free of duty ; while at the present time , with duties on the importation of foreign wools that are practically prohibitory , lie is obtaining the lowest prices for his product , and buying the smallest quantities of other domestic merchandise. * // Sept . How shall the Nation regain Prosperity ? The same obstacles in the way of an extended commerce between the United States and the Argentine States also exist and operate on even a larger scale in respect to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The rapid development of these British colonies in the South Pacific is one of the wonderful social and economic phenomenon of the latter half of the nineteenth century ; the aggregate of their exports and imports ( with a population of 2,278,000 ) for 1875 being $ 458,399,000 , or more than three eighths of the aggregate foreign trade of the United States , with a population of about 44,000,000 , for the same year . During the year 1875 these colonies imported , paid for , and consumed commodities of foreign production to the extent of $ 236,000,000 ; and of these the United States furnished so small a proportion that in the official and general summary of our exports ( see Report of the Bureau of Statistics , 1875 - 76 , p. 110 ) our Australian export trade is not considered of sufficient importance to have a special enumeration , but comes in under the general head " Domestic Exports to all the British East Indies , Australia " and New Zealand for 1875 , $ 3,978,000 . " And yet an examination of the details of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their interest to buy a little of almost all the manufactured products which it is particularly for the interest of the labor of the United States should be sold abroad ; and this , too , when the Australian markets were undoubtedly fully stocked with similar articles , the products of other foreign countries . If it be asked why these British colonies did not buy more of us , the answer is simple , and in the main is the same as must be given to the question , Why do not the Chilians and the people of the Argentine States of South America buy more ? It is because the people of the United States will not take their pay for what they want to sell in what the Australians and New-Zealanders have got to pay with , mainly , wool and copper ; and the enemies to the development of American industry are not , as it is continually and most impudently asserted , those who desire freer trade as a part of the fiscal policy of the United States , but those who demand that the existing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the injurious effects of which are so obvious , shall be continued .
