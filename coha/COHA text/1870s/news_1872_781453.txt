txt Ex-Senator GENET has developed a sudden sensitiveness . He could stand being classed among thieves in November last , but now that the Grand Jury has indicted him for forgery , be becomes suddenly alive to the fact that his character is worth something . He has accordingly selected Mr. LEvi . ADAMS , a member of the Twelfth Ward Citizens ' Association , as a defendant in a libel suit  --  damages stated al $100,000 . The alleged libel is to be found in two documents , circulated before the election , nett ing GENET 'S connection with the Harlem Court house job , and making sundry suggestions more forcible than complimentary , regarding the fate in store for the candidate for the Senatorship . Judge BARNARD , who thought Woe sufficient bail for TWEED , thought fit to fix the bail of Mr. GENET at $10,000 . A very large number of merchants in this State have joined with a number proportionately as large from twenty-one ? other States in a petition to Congress , which ought to be , and we do not doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earliest and most thorough attention of Congress to three subjects , as follows : First , appointments to and removals from public offices , both of which the petitioners claim should be made solely with reference to capability , efficiency and honesty , in case of appointments , and the want of them in ease of removals ; second , the salaries of public officers , which the petitioners aver should be commensurate with the quality of the men required and the duties to be performed , while perquisites and moieties should be abolished , as demoralizing to the service . corrupting to public servants , and pernicious to the business community ; and third , the seizure and examination of private books and papers in revenue cases , which the petitioners state are now made in a manner subversive of private rights and unworthy of a free country . This petition is signed by some four hundred and fifty of our leading business firms , including such names as Brown Brothers &; Co. , A. A. Low &; Brothers , Schultz . Southwick &; Co. , Jay Cooke &; Co. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &; Co .. J. H. Van Nostrand &; Co. , Wm . A. Booth , Ball , Black &; Co. , Tiffany &; Co . These are the names of men who represent a powerful interest in the community , and one not at all represented by the ordinary political machinery . The petition is , moreover , in itself so well grounded that Congress will do well to turn Its attention promptly to its subject-matter . Further investigation into the subject of the Bartlett street-lamps , shows that the breakages of these lampsare by no means so numerous as we were led to suppose . In the parka and squares where they have had a fair trial , the durability of the lamp has been almost , if not . altogether , equal to that of the ordinary make . The patentee of the lamps has nothing whatever to do with the expensive ornamental posts on which they are placed , and the strictures directed to the latter can not , therefore , apply to Mr. BARTLETT . Sufficient attention has hardly been paid to the change of procedure in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day by Controller GREEN . For the lint time in several years , those bonds were exposed to public competition , and the bids were published in a regular and business-like way . In addition to the satisfactory nature of the precedent thus established , the result of the bidding was eminently creditable to the financial administration of Mr. GREEN . Bonds on which the interest of six per cent . is payable in currency were thus openly , and without expense , disposed of at a little above par , while it may be remembered that the bonds under the celebrated Belmont ( ) entreat , on which the interest was payable in gold . were entered on the City books simply at par . A strong effort is being made by the rnemtiers of the Legislature from the Eastern or Williamsburg District of Brooklyn , to obtain better facilities for ferriage to and from NewYork . The ferries connecting with this part of Brooklyn are all owned by one Company , of which Mr. GEORGE Law is the principal shareholder . There is no doubt that they are scandal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Eastern District , and that it grows out of the fact of monopoly . The boats are run always irregularly , and often at long intervals ; they are some of them small and unfit for the work , and they have within the past week actually SilEipeudeci their trips on one of the lines , rather than expose the boats to possible injury . Meantime the Ferry Company appears to be making very largo proilts  --  some $200.000 a year on a nominal capital of $1,000.000 , and a real capital very much smaller  --  probably not over one-half that amount . The ease is a very bad one , and . oonaidering the Large number of persona interested . a very urgout one . The recent retirement from the Berlin Cabinet of Herr Motii.en , Minister of Public Worship and Edueittiom , is felt by the Liberal Party to be an event of the highest importance . as ImelYine a change of system and policy , Hera Mutt= has been the apostle of conservatism in the Ministry , and . the representative of tradition . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Imperial . in referenoe to certain art subjects , has had eomothing to do With his retirement ; but there seems good rear son to suppose that this is merely a plausible explanation offered by the Conservatives , and that he has in truth been removed by Prime , BISMARCK in order that ( is may carry out other reforms and innovations on which that statesman is intent . The stop will , as is no doubt intended , increase the Prince 's popularity with the Liberal Party . Mr. BARNUM is said to be inconsolable for the loss of his last giraffe , which died in tramp ' : on the ocean . We recommend him to seek Qom . fort in the prodigy which Otsego County offers him  --  a three-armed man . This phenomenon 's name is JACOBS , and the superfluous grows out of his right shoulder-blade . Et haw " extraordinary muscle , which tta owner displays when occasion demands it . " Otherwise he keeps it buttoned up , so that " no person passing through on a railroad-car , or meeting him in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or " after becoming cognizant of this singular case , would perceive a peculiar fit of his coat . " Naturally , during the war he bore arms in defense of his country , and is now , therefore , a three-armed veteran . To add to his other attractions , he is a man of fine conversational powers , and he relates many pleasing anecdotes of himself with great relish , so that " an interview with him is especially agreeable . " as the Williamsport Gazette testifies . We trust , for the honor of our City . that Mr. BARNUM will not tail to secure this amiable Briareus.
