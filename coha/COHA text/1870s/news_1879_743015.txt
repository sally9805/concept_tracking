txt Senator Bayard introduced a resolution in the Senate to-day calling on the Secretary of the Treasury for a statement showing what sums of money were paid in 1870 , and in each succeeding year , to John I. Davenport , either as Chief Supervisor of Elections , Clerk of the Circuit Court of the United States , or United States Commissioner , or for service in any other capacity , specifying the amounts paid to him in the different capacities in which he has been employed and all disbursements made by him . The resolution calls also for all the correspondence in relation to this expenditure of money by Mr. Davenport . Mr. Conkling said he thought it was a good resolution , as far as it went , but he thought it should lie over . This was in the nature of an objection , and the resolution , therefore , was laid over until to-morrow , when it may be called up for consideration . The Secretary of the Interior has rejected an application made by Gen. Jefferson C. Davis , of the regular Army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law . Gen. Davis claimed that under sections 2,293 and 2,308 of the Revised Statutes he was entitled to make a homestead entry , and to have a patent ? ssued thereon without actual ' residence on the land , basing his . claim upon the ground that his service in the regular Army was equivalent to residence upon the land . The Secretary decided that the sections of the Revised Statues referred to apply only to persons who served in the military and naval service - of the United States during the war of the rebellion , and ' who , ? before or : after entering the ? service , made entries which had been , canceled , or upon ' which the claimant could:not make final homestead proof on account ' of ' his , absence in the Army or Navy , and that an officer , soldier , or sailor who enlisted in the . regular Army or Navy since the close of the rebellion is not entitled to homestead privileges while in such service . Speaker Randall will not announce the standing committees until the House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which will be presented to ? morrow . In addition to mommending an increase in the membership of several of the more important committees , the Committee on Rules will recommend changes iu the rules which will , doubtless , lead to a protracted debate . The most important of these changes is an amendment to require a three-fourths majority to suspend the rules and pass any appropriation bill . This amendment is not intended , however , to interfere , except with the rule which enables two-thirds of those present and voting on Mondays to suspend the rules and pass bills . The new rule is especially aimed at the River and Harbor bill , which is usually fixed up to satisfy all whom it is possible to satisfy with the aggregate amount of money agreed upon , in order to gain for the bill sufficient strength to secure the necessary two-thirds vote to suspend the rules and pass it . Should this new rule be adopted it is not likely to prevent the passage of the River and Harbor bill in the usual manner , although it will make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secured for this bill by a systematic distributioh of the money appropriated , it is probable that three-fourths could be obtained by the extension of the same system so as to meet the new conditions imposed by the new rule . The Army Appropriation bill was received in the Senate from the House to-day and referred to the Committee on Appropriations , by which committee it was subsequently referred to Senators Withers , Wallace , and Blaine as a subcommittee . It is not likely that the bill will bo taken up in the Senate before Thursday , and all the indications point to a debate which will continue for 10 days or two weeks . The Legislative , Executive . and Judicial bill will probably be delayed in the House until the latter part of the week , by reason of the debate which will follow the report of the Committee on Rules . The majority do not seem to be anxious to push this bill , for the reason that . they would like to get the Army bill before the President and have it returned to the House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Legislative bill . The debate in the House on this bill may not be marked by as much ability as was the debate on the Army bill , but it will assuredly extend over as much time .
