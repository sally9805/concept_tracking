txt The project of a topographical survey of New-York is not a new idea . It has been advocated on various occasions , and by different persons , for the past twenty-five years or more ; but the great cost of the work and , the opinion generally entertained that its results could only have a scientific value , have prevented any practical steps being taken toward carrying out the plan . A very able paper on the subject was prepared some time ago by Gen. VIELE , and read by him before the American Geographical Society . On that occasion he exhibited a topographical map of the State , drawn by himself from personal observation . Looking over its broad area , as delineated on this map , it was easy to see how important had been the influence of topographical conditions in building up the present commercial prosperity of the Empire State . Within its boundaries lay the only lines of low level from the Potomac to the St. Lawrence , by which commerce could find its way from tide-water to the great lakes and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of New-York , one of the finest harbors in the ' world , the way was open along the full stream of the Hudson , which cuts through the Appalachian chain northward to the point where the Mohawk flows into it . From the junction of the two great rivers , a level line of valley divided the State from east to west almost to the shores of Lake Erie . Here lay the natural road to all the fruitful lands west of the Alloghauies , and there is no point south of it where a rail7-road can cross them except by heavy grades and costly curves . North of the Mohawk Valley the mountainous Adirondack region is almost in its primitive condition ; south of it , from Schenectady nearly to Lake Erie , stretches a beautiful region of hills and dales , with meadow expanses , of the richest fertility , which has become the great grain-growing section of the State . East of the Hudson the narrow strip of territory which lies between the river and the neighboring States is rich in minerals and in pasture lands , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great seaport at its southern termination draws its water supply . These main features of the topography of New-York Gen. VIELE 'S map shows with a fullness and accuracy which for merely scientific purposes leave little to be desired . The proposition for a complete survey of the State , to be made on the same methods and . with the same minute accuracy as our coasts are surveyed by the National Government , is now based on quite other grounds than its value to geographic science . In its latter aspect , the American Geographical Society has never failed to urge the scheme , but other advocates of it believe that such a survey would have an economic and sanitary value , amply compensating for its cost . In other words , they assert that a topographical map , would be an absolutely accurate tax map for the whole State . Only a very small portion of the State is now surveyed , chiefly the cities and towns ; while nearly all the agricultural and ? other lands have never had a surveyor 's chain stretched across them . Assessments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no way , under present conditions , of arriving at an accurate estimate of their area . The grossest inequalities iu the distribution of the State tax , are said to have their origin in the confusion of calculations . In a report recently made to the Geographical Society by Mr. JAMES T. GARDNER , these facts are very forcibly presented . The estimate is mad .. i , from the most accurate information obtainable , that one-tenth of the landed estate of New-York escapes taxation altogether , and the unfair burden is thrown on the other portions . It is pointed out that , while the value of land per acre is easily ascertainable , there is no way in which Assessors can know the actual area of property except by a survey of it . In the absence of this , assessment-rolls are made up almost entirely by guessing , and as one man 's guess is as good as another 's , the estimate of a property-holder , if particularly persistent , is the one most likely to be accepted , even against the opinion of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be no more accurate in their descriptions of area than the loose guesses of individuals . The case of the town of Flushing was recently mentioned in these columns ; and to this may be added the more striking example of the city of Yonkers . A tax map was made of that place and used for the first time last year. - By its use an addition of 525 acres was made to the assessable property . Their value was estimated at $260,000 ; the assessment upon them was about $4,000 ; ' therefore the property assessed in 1873 had paid $4,000 more ? hau it should have done . Cases were found where individuals were paying on ten , twenty , thirty , and even forty acres more than they owned , while others escaped taxation on like amounts . The condition of the Twenty-third and Twenty-fourth Wards of this City is said to be even worse in respect to inequalities of assessments . By a survey of the town of Newport , R. I. , it was found that only four of its property-holders were properly taxed ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the inequality being sometimes as much as fifty per cent . Taking the State as a whole , the existing system of making up assesssment rolls is said to operate to the disadvantage of the large majority of the tax-payers , while the minority , who have willfully or ignorantly underestimated the property they own , are the gainers by it .
