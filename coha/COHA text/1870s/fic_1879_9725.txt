SCENE .  --  A Reception-room at PRIMROSE 'S , furnished in Renaissance style . The general entrance is at R. U. E. There is also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a recess window is between these two , with seats . There is a door , L. , down stage , and at L. , a fireplace . A small smoking-table and outfit near the fireplace , and a small desk , down stage , R. Above this is a carved cabinet . Skins , rugs , and ornaments about the place . Easy chairs in every direction . NERVY , a stylish looking valet , enters , R. I. , opening a wrapper and disclosing a box of cigars . Nervy . That 's right ! Same brand ! Goes with box to table , L. , at same time loosening the lid of box . It 's a singular coincidence  --  the deeper a gentleman gets involved , the better his cigars are . And we are getting involved now , or my experience do n't count for anything . Puts the box of cigars in cabinet and locks it . DICKERS appears at door , R. , hat in hand . Dickers . I say , young fellow  --  are you sure your governor knows I 'm here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wait till he 's dressed  --  as I told you . Dick . Dickers Coming down . Not up yet  --  eh ? Nervy . Up ? Long ago  --  but he 's at his toilet . Dick . Dickers Oh , well , there 's no hurry . Sits  --  puts hat on floor . Nervy . Handing him paper . Would you like a cigar ? Dick . Dickers Come now , I say  --  you do the honors in prime style . Nervy . Offering him cigar from new case . Master 's orders , of course . If I were you , I 'd take the light colored . Knowingly . Dick . Dic kers Oh , you 've sampled ' em yourself , eh ? Master 's orders , too , eh ? Nervy . No ; we have to keep ourselves posted without orders . Dick . Dickers Just pull up a bit . You and another young fellow I once knew would make a dead match . You ai n't both of ' em , are you ? Nervy . It you mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why , I hired my stable of your mother , and you used to come for the rent . Nervy . Precisely . Dick . Dickers And now , you 're here  --  with Mr. Beverly Primrose  --  Looks at him and pauses . Nervy . As flunkey . That 's me . Dick . Dickers But how ? Your mother left a lot of money  --  and she had n't nobody but you . Nervy . I was one too many for the money , though . You see I was born with a perfect genius for getting rid of cash . Dick . Dickers And so you ran through it ? Nervy . Ran through it . Galloped !  --  flew ! The whole thing only lasted two years . Fact ! Dick . Dickers Rises . But with your eddication , Tommy , you could have got lots of things to do . Nervy . Oh , lots !  --  if I could bring myself down to boiled beef and potatoes . But with my naturally refined tastes , cultivated by a brief season of luxury  --  there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ? Nervy . As I could n't be the master  --  to be his man . In my present position , I have everything just as I used to have it  --  and get paid besides . I 'm living on Fifth Avenue ; spend the summer in Europe ; the autumn at Newport . I drink the best wines ; smoke the best cigars . I 'm allowed two a day , but I 've increased the allowance to three . Dick . Dickers You have ? Well , I ca n't blame you  --  they are good . Nervy . Crosses , R. , with business . I even have my carriage and pair . Dick . Dickers Blowing a cloud , crossing to fireplace to knock off ashes . Only now you sit on the box . I see . Nervy . Not always . Mr. Primrose has taken a fancy to driving himself , and gives me a ride every afternoon . I tell you what , Dickers , if you ever see a gentleman and his valet , do n't make no mistake , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the company he keeps . Look at me . Sits , C. I enjoy the society of Mr. Beverly Primrose , the leader of Fashion , the oracle of the clubs , the swellest widower in the four hundred . And he pays me for it . Say , have n't I got the best of him ? Dick . Dickers Going to him , slaps him on back . Yes , only he can kick you downstairs whenever he gets tired of you . Nervy . Well , he ought to have some advantage for his money . Rises at PRIMROSE 'S voice . Prim . Primrose Outside . Tom ! Tom ! Where are you ? Nervy . Ah , here he is . DICKERS tries to get rid of cigar . PRIMROSE enters , L. U. E. Prim . Primrose Tom ! Ah , there you are . See that party out . Ha , Dickers ! good morning . Sorry I kept you waiting , but ' pon my soul , it seems the less hair one has , the longer it takes to dress it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C. NERVY brings bouquet of violets with a small vase and places them beside him on the table , then exits , R. Dick . Dickers Sitting again at a sign from PRIMROSE . Oh , I 'm willing to wait when there 's any business to be done . Prim . Primrose My dear Dickers , I 'm afraid you 'll be disappointed this time . Dick . Dickers Oh , any order , however small , from Mr. Beverly Primrose is a pleasure . I just got the finest chestnut mare  --  the very thing for you . Fifteen hands , a regular beauty . Prim . Primrose Stop , man , stop ! You 'll break my heart . The fact is , Dickers , instead of you selling me your horses , you 've got to buy mine . Dick . Dickers Keenly . Ah ! Prim . Primrose Slightly embarrassed . Yes  --  I  --  you see I 'm about to give up my stables . You must take the whole lot off my hands . How does that strike you ? Dick . Dickers Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Prim . Primrose Sarcastically . Do n't take it too much to heart . Fortunately , the situation is not wholly novel . How often have I sold out ? Four times , is n't it ? Dick . Dickers But you always came up again ; and I bet you will this time . Going , R. Prim . Primrose No , it 's positively my last appearance this time . Case is hopeless . Do me the favor to send for the horses this afternoon , while I 'm away . I should n't like to see them trotted out . Dick . Dickers Certainly , Mr. Primrose . Any way you say , sir . Takes up his hat . Prim . Primrose And you must promise me to see that they get into good hands . They 've been rather spoiled here . Dick . Dickers Going up . Rely on me , sir . Where am I to send you the money ? Looking in hat . Prim . Primrose Just dump the whole lot in at the club . I had a terrible time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself , and take a receipt . How much will I get , anyway ? Dick . Dickers I 'll have to figure it up first . Going up . But there 's one thing sure , Mr. Primrose , I do n't take a cent profit . Bet your bottom dollar on that . Good-morning , sir . Exits , R. U. E. Prim . Primrose Talk of wonders ! A horse-dealer declining to make a profit on a sale ! Takes up and opens a newspaper , and to NERVY , who enters with breakfast on a tray , which he places beside PRIMROSE . By the way , Tom , I 'm expecting an art dealer here this morning . If I happen to be out , show him everything  --  pictures , bronzes , bric -- brac , the whole circus ! Begins to take his breakfast . Nervy . Yes , sir . May I ask what art dealer is coming , sir ? Prim . Primrose Sipping coffee . Duveen , I think . Nervy . Oh , well ; he 's square . Prim . Primrose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Smiling , helping him to toast from the rack . He bought my collection , sir , when I went up . Prim . Primrose My dear fellow , I wish you would spare me your parallels . Besides , this is no joking matter . Nervy . I trust it may be , sir . I 'm sure it 's only a temporary embarrassment . Prim . Primrose Your confidence honors me . By the way , Thomas , before I forget it , I 'll have to put you on half rations , especially in the matter of cigars . Nervy . Ahem ! Prim . Primrose After this you 'll content yourself with one a day . Nervy . There 's no sacrifice I would n't make for your sake , sir . Prim . Primrose Well , for impudence ! Bell is heard . Nervy . Are you at home , sir ? Prim . Primrose Of course . NERVY exits , R. U. E. A man in my position forfeits the right to deny himself to anyone . Lights cigarette . DOUBLEPENNY , preceded by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to appear well-bred . NERVY removes the breakfast things . Doub . Doublepenny R. U. E. I hope I 'm not de trop for calling , but I wanted to see you partickleyer . Prim . Primrose Indicating a chair . Pray be seated . Doub . Doublepenny Sits , C. I do n't know as I 'm intruding on confidences , but I thought I overheard you saying last night , at the club , when we was proximate tables , that you thought of selling your house . Was you ? Prim . Primrose Promptly . Yes . I 've sold my stables . Somebody else will shortly possess my pictures and bronzes . And you may look any day to see the old family tapestry at Sypher 's . Doub . Doublepenny Well , if you 've made up your mind , I know a party as will take your house . Prim . Primrose Indeed ! That would be most agreeable . Who is the party ? Doub . Doublepenny Me . Prim . Primrose Half surprised . Indeed ! Doub . Doublepenny Oh , I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've turned my business into a trust . Prim . Primrose Quite the regular thing , now , I believe . What is your business ? Doub . Doublepenny Hairpins . We control the market . I own five of the largest hairpin factories . I 've sold out for a million clean , and we 've formed the Great Hairpin Trust ! Prim . Primrose It must be quite an industry . Doub . Doublepenny Rises and struts , L. Of course my social position is altered now . Prim . Primrose Most advantageously , I hope . Doub . Doublepenny Sits on sofa , L. Yes , my dear Primrose . PRIMROSE draws up haughtily at the familiarity , but DOUBLEPENNY goes on without noticing . An independent fortune has its drawbacks . Prim . Primrose Indeed ! Doub . Doublepenny First and foremost , I do n't know what to do with myself all day . You see I used to have my nose to the grindstone all the time . Prim . Primrose And now you 're a gentleman of leisure . Doub . Doublepenny Exactly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't flounder about half as much . Of course , having so much time on my hands , I 've got to kill it  --  like all the swells do ; and I want to swell like the best of ' em . That 's natural , ai nt it ? Prim . Primrose Precisely ! You want to transform yourself from a hairpin to a man about town . Doub . Doublepenny That 's it ! That 's my bull's-eye ! But it do n't seem to be as easy to hit as I thought . Prim . Primrose Of course not . The art of being rich gracefully is extremely difficult , and the trouble is that when one has learned to spend one 's money with elegance , there 's generally none left . That 's my case now . Doub . Doublepenny And that 's precisely what brings me here this morning . Rises  --  looks around room . Do n't you think it would give me a good start to begin with taking your house ? Prim . Primrose Not a bad idea . Doub . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This was Beverly Primrose 's place , you know . He gave it up to oblige me . " Crosses , R. I may say that , may n't I ? Prim . Primrose Coolly . Oh , yes  --  we 'll put it in the title deeds if you like . Doub . Doublepenny Confused . The idea ! Sits , C. No . I only thought we 'd have it understood amicable  --  and fix the price accordin ' . Prim . Primrose Oh , I see . You 've put the figure on that already . Well , if the place suits you  --  Doub . Doublepenny Rising and going about , R. It 's perfectly lovely , and how swell everything is arranged . Prim . Primrose Yes , it took me a good many years , and gave me a great deal of trouble to get all this together from every quarter of the globe , and make them match like a well-chosen bouquet . I say , why not take the whole thing in a lump ? Doub . Doublepenny Timidly . Well , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Prim . Primrose For goodness ' sake , do n't . Everything about you is so very new as it is . Your money , your friends , your taste , and your refinement . If you move into a new house with new furniture , by Jove , my dear fellow , your whole existence will smell of fresh paint . Doub . Doublepenny Sits at desk , R. Meditatively . There 's some point to that . Prim . Primrose Oh , yes ; you had better , for some time to come , attach yourself to something thoroughly well established . I 'd even advise you , in selecting a lady for particular attention  --  that question will present itself , of course  --  Doub . Doublepenny Winks . I 've thought of it already . Prim . Primrose I thought so . Doub . Doublepenny Rises and sits , C. Mysteriously . What do you think of Miss Pettigrew ? Prim . Primrose Pettigrew ? Oh !  --  came home last year from England . Doub . Doublepenny Yes . Prim . Primrose I think she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doublepenny Exultingly . Yes , sir . Prim . Primrose Go right ahead . With Beverly Primrose 's house , and his serene highness 's dulcinea , all you will need is to get in the papers , and your position is established . Rises and stands at fireplace . Doub . Doublepenny Draws his chair nearer . How can I get in the papers ? Prim . Primrose Do you think you have courage enough to pull somebody 's nose at the club ? Doub . Doublepenny Half alarmed . Is that a good way ? Prim . Primrose Anything to get up a quarrel and be abused . A row of some sort is indispensable to make yourself respected . Doub . Doublepenny It is unpleasant to be rich and laughed at . Prim . Primrose You wo n't be laughed at after you 've been in a fight . You see it gives people to understand that if you do look funny , you mean business . Doub . Doublepenny Well , if you really think  --  blamed if I do n't ! Rises , and down R. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Prim . Primrose Show him in . NERVY steps back , as if to make way for the visitor . You 'll excuse me  --  it 's my lawyer . Doub . Doublepenny All right . I say , you do n't mind my looking at the other rooms with your man , there ? Takes hat from table , R. Prim . Primrose Certainly not . To NERVY , who now ushers in GUTHRIE . Show this gentleman over the house . Doub . Doublepenny When shall we draw up the contract ? Prim . Primrose We 'll talk it over to-night , at the club . Goes up to meet GUTHRIE . NERVY crosses to L. C. Doub . Doublepenny Then au revere ! Bows to both , and goes of , R. C. with NERVY . To GUTHRIE . Bon Jore ! Prim . Primrose Crosses , R. , to GUTHRIE . Now , then , old man  --  what news ? GUTHRIE shakes his head and puts his hat down on the table , C. , and throws his gloves into it . Has there been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning . Prim . Primrose Has it gone against me again ? Guth . Guthrie Well , you know , I only consented to carry the appeal at your urgent request . It has turned out just as I said . The appeal is dismissed  --  with costs . Prim . Primrose Have I got to lose and pay , too ? Guth . Guthrie As the unsuccessful party  --  of course . Prim . Primrose That 's a poor joke . If I do n't get the property , what am I to pay with ? Guth . Guthrie The Court does n't consider that , you know . Prim . Primrose It strikes me the Court does n't consider anything we say . Sits on sofa , L. Guth . Guthrie Sits in chair , L. Oh , yes ; they pass upon all your points . Just listen ! Produces legal paper . " In the matter of the probate of the last will and testament of Jefferson Primrose , deceased  --  " Prim . Primrose Sighing . My poor deluded brother ! Guth . Guthrie Continuing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testator eight months before his death , was united to Venetia Everett , the proponent , by a marriage ceremony , duly and publicly solemnized ; that he died without issue , leaving a duly executed last will and testament by which he devised to his widow  --  " Prim . Primrose Ne Everett . Guth . Guthrie Continuing . " All his real and personal property  --  " Prim . Primrose That 's just the point  --  did he ? Guth . Guthrie Reads . " The will is contested by the brother of the deceased , Beverly Primrose . " Prim . Primrose Exactly ! Guth . Guthrie Reads . " On two grounds . Firstly , that the deceased , at the time of the execution of the will , was not in full possession of his mental faculties . Secondly , that by virtue of a certain family custom or tradition existing from time immemorial , and directly traceable as far back as the year 1775 , and having , by the consent of the deceased , the force of an obligation , the estate real and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ descendants , should revert to the next of kin . " Prim . Primrose Well , that 's plain enough . Were there any descendants ? Guth . Guthrie No . Prim . Primrose Am I his next of kin ? Guth . Guthrie You are . Prim . Primrose Then how the deuce do you get over that ? A family custom dating back to the Revolution . Guth . Guthrie Certainly . The custom was conclusively established . Prim . Primrose Well , then , why the devil  --  Guth . Guthrie Unfortunately , it does n't amount to anything . Prim . Primrose Not amount to anything ? Guth . Guthrie Not at Common Law  --  if the party chose to make a will leaving his property to somebody else . That 's Common Law . Prim . Primrose Common drumsticks ! Rises and crosses , R. The whole country is going to the deuce ! A man with a great-grandfather is treated like a toadstool , kicked over by the first lout that comes along . Guth . Guthrie As for your other objections  --  Prim . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well ? Guth . Guthrie There was n't a particle of evidence to sustain it . Prim . Primrose Oh , come now ! A man with the best blood in America  --  old family  --  on the shady side of sixty  --  marries a girl of twenty ; a young person employed as companion , an adventuress attracted by his money . If all that does n't show a falling off of mental faculties , I do n't know what will . You could understand his getting infatuated with an opera bouffe artiste , or a ballet girl  --  rises  --  but a young insignificant country school teacher !  --  Guth . Guthrie The Court is of different opinion , and decides that neither difference of age , of fortune , nor of social prominence , is enough to indicate mental unsoundness . Prim . Primrose Then there 's nothing to be done ? Guth . Guthrie Nothing . Prim . Primrose And we must give it up ? Guth . Guthrie Unless you wish to throw away more money upon another appeal . Prim . Primrose No ! The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got the lead ! Sits , C. NERVY enters . Nervy . Mr. Candid , sir , wants to know  --  Prim . Primrose Mr. who ? NED CANDID enters , passing NERVY , who exits . Ned . Down C. I hope you do n't mind my coming right in . Your servant told me your were engaged . Sees GUTHRIE . Hallo , old fellow , how are you ? To both . Do n't stir . I 'm not going to stay a second . To PRIMROSE . I just wanted to ask when I can have ten minutes with you . Prim . Primrose Rises and goes , R. Come in  --  come right in . Our conference is over . To GUTHRIE . There 's nothing more ? Ned . Comes forward , putting hat down . I 'm just going round , you know , to say good-by to all the fellows at the club . Guth . Guthrie Are you going away ? Ned . No , not that I 'm not going to leave the country , but I do n't know when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PRIMROSE . Prim . Primrose Why not at the club ? Ned . I 've given up the club . Guth . Guthrie Been cleaned out ? Ned . No . I 'm in love . Prim . Primrose Honest ? Ned . Downright earnest ; and if you look sharp and listen , you 'll hear the tinkle , tinkle , tinkle of the marriage bells . Prim . Primrose Indeed ! Ned . The engagement will probably be announced next week , and the wedding comes off a month later . Sits , C. Prim . Primrose Have you fixed the date of the divorce yet ? Ned . Oh , come ! This is no joke . Prim . Primrose Not for the bride , at all events . You 're a very good fellow , Ned , and I wish you all sorts of happiness ; but it ca n't be for too long . You 're good for a quarter-mile dash , but you soon get tired . Guth . Guthrie To NED . I think he 's right there . Ned . Well , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prim . Primrose Sits , R. No , you ca n't , my boy . Nobody reforms  --  the other fellows nor nobody . Those who think they do are the worst hypocrites  --  they try to hoodwink themselves . Ned . But if a man is really in love  --  Guth . Guthrie Where did you find time to fall in love ? What do you know about love , anyway ? You are always dawdling at the clubs . Where did you make the lady 's acquaintance ? Ned . That 's the romance of it . We have n't met at all yet , but I 've got her photograph . She 's a friend of my sister Dot ; and as Dot says she ca n't live without her friend , she wants me to do her a favor and marry the young lady . Prim . Primrose And you blushingly consented ? Ned . Of course . I thought it great fun , and so Sis gave me the beauty 's photograph to inspect . What did I do but put the picture in my pocket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Next morning came home , emptied pockets on table . Not much left in ' em after a night at the club , you know . Down falls the picture on the floor . I pick her up and apologize : " I beg your pardon , miss  --  so sorry ! "  --  looked at her for the first time and , by Jove ! saw such a pair of eyes looking straight at me and through me ! I was stunned ! PRIMROSE turns away . Honor bright ! I stood spellbound ! Then  --  " Nonsense , rubbish  --  it 's the champagne ! " I said to myself , jumped into bed , and fell asleep . When I woke that afternoon , what was the first thing my glance fell upon ? Guth . Guthrie The picture , of course . Ned . Exactly ! And it was the next thing my glance fell upon also , and the last thing as I went out  --  always on that picture ! I began to feel uncomfortable , do n't you know , and resolved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Primrose You could n't think of anything else . Guth . Guthrie You had simply fallen in love with it . Ned . Desperately ! And now I ca n't live without that girl . Rises . She 's the most glorious creature ! She 's the  --  Hands the picture to PRIMROSE . Just look for yourself . Prim . Primrose Rises , looking at photo . Well , this is most extraordinary ! Ned . Is n't it ? Prim . Primrose Aside to GUTHRIE . See here  --  do you know who this is ? Guth . Guthrie Looking at picture . No . Prim . Primrose Still aside . Why , it 's Rena . My daughter Regina . Crosses , L. Guth . Guthrie Rises . What ? To NED . Look here , Ned ; do you know the lady 's name ? Ned . Coming forward , C. No . Dot wo n't tell me till I reform and give up all my bad acquaintances . Prim . Primrose That 's why you 're taking leave of me . Ned . Crosses to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person that occurred to me . Prim . Primrose A very happy thought , too . Ned . I owe you a very heavy debt of gratitude , old fellow . You gave me my first lessons on the turf , and in poker , and in your agreeable company I 've squandered about a third of my fortune . It was all very nice and awfully jolly , but you must acknowledge yourself now  --  we ought to part . Prim . Primrose On account of your proposed match with this young lady ? Ned . Of course . When a man marries an angel  --  all innocence  --  Prim . Primrose He ought to be careful in the selection of his friends . Ned . To a certain extent . But  --  Takes his hand.  --  it need n't be all over between us , forever ! Prim . Primrose No ? Ned . Gayly . There 's no telling how long my good resolutions may last . You 'll have to wait till I get over the honeymoon , anyway ! Digs him in the side , crossing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Prim . Primrose You 'll ask me to the wedding , at least , wo n't you ? Ned . Hesitating . H 'm ! Well  --  do you set much store by that ? Prim . Primrose I 'm afraid you 'll hardly be able to get along without me . Ned . Why so ? Prim . Primrose The young lady herself will probably insist upon my being there . Ned . Do you know her ? Prim . Primrose Slightly . She 's my daughter . Crosses , L Ned . Sinks into chair , C. , vacated by GUTHRIE . Your  --  daughter ? Guth . Guthrie Goes to NED . Yes , you blundering booby ! To chair , R. Ned . Good gracious ! I 've given myself away to my father-in-law ! Well , the best thing I can do is to take the bull by the horns and ask for your blessing on the spot . Prim . Primrose No , my dear boy , that is not the best thing ! Return the picture to your sister , and tell her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question ! Ned . But why ? Prim . Primrose Because there are certain things that do not admit of jesting . Because I want a son-in-law whose love for my daughter will last longer than the honey-moon . Sits on sofa . Ned . Passing his hand over his brow , rises . To GUTHRIE . I say , old man , if you can guess what 's going on in my head now , you 'll win a case of Pommery . Guth . Guthrie Easiest thing in the world . You 're thinking , " I 've been rejected by the father  --  I shall now propose directly to the daughter !  --  as I should have done at first . " Ned . The Pommery is yours . Guth . Guthrie Have I guessed right ? Ned . Goes to him  --  shakes hands . No ! But it 's a capital idea , and I 'll adopt it ! To PRIMROSE . Good-by , governor . Kissing picture at door . Directly to the daughter , as I should have done at first . Exits . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I did n't know you had a daughter . Prim . Primrose Coming forward . Gad ! I had almost forgotten it myself . But it was chiefly for her sake I fought that will . Now tell me , is n't there the slightest little bit of a chance of getting a dollar of that money ? Guth . Guthrie Deliberately . Yes , one chance . Prim . Primrose What is that ? Guth . Guthrie Rises . Attack his marriage ; prove the widow is not his widow . Prim . Primrose Well , ca n't we do it ? Those adventuresses always have a former husband living . Hunt for him . Guth . Guthrie No use ! Prim . Primrose It 's worth trying . Sits on sofa . Guth . Guthrie No ; I 've only seen the lady once , but I 'll answer for her ! Prim . Primrose Oh , you know her . Tell me all about it . Guth . Guthrie Three years ago , I happened to call on business at your mother 's , and was introduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ member of the household . Prim . Primrose Lighting a cigarette . What did she look like ? Guth . Guthrie I ca n't describe her . I can only tell you what to this day I feel I experienced when I first saw her , in a modest black dress , with a face as demure as a saint 's . At the first look you felt as if you had met a friend . And when I took leave of her , and she placed her little hand in mine and smiled at me so artlessly  --  Almost fiercely  --  I would have believed  --  Rises.  --  anything rather than , that she was so shortly to sell her youth and innocence for an old man 's money . Goes , R. Prim . Primrose Rises . Thank you . I 'm posted . I see through the whole plot to which my unfortunate brother fell a victim . My fair sister-in-law belongs undoubtedly to the Third Class . Guth . Guthrie To the Third Class ? Sits , R. Prim . Primrose Yes . As the result of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , C.  --  I have divided the ladies , to whom we lose our heart and money , into three classes . First Class : the gay delightful rollickers ! They cost an awful lot , but they do n't want you  --  they want a good time , and they have this one great advantage  --  sooner or later they 'll throw you over , and you are free . Light , very light , but  --  free ! Guth . Guthrie Sits , R. , laughing . That is everything  --  free ! Prim . Primrose Second Class : The dear delightful humbugs ! The soulful sighers , whose hearts are seared with a hundred engagements , but who flop on your chest at the first faint zephyr of a suggested declaration ! Who confess every flirtation  --  as soon as you have it from somebody else  --  and beg you not to throw away the love that after a hundred previous shipwrecks is now cast ashore on your rocky bosom . Rises . You believe you are called upon to make up for the perfidy of the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've had five experiences of that kind and had to get out of it five times with the loss of untold riches in forfeited tokens of affection  --  Goes , L.  --  on an average two or three thousand dollars per angel ! But they have one advantage ! When you want to get out of the scrape you find them so used to it , that ultimately you are once more free ! Light , very light , but  --  free ! Guth . Guthrie And the Third Class ? Prim . Primrose At fireplace . That 's the most dangerous of all . They are the burglars of love  --  the sweet , soft , demure burglars , whom you suddenly find in your house  --  like strange cats , and who come in as noiselessly . The burglars , with downcast eyes , high-necked dresses , severe , sedate , irresistible  --  Sits , C.  --  who , the moment they cross the threshold , make up their mind to marry in that house either the son or the father  --  age does n't matter  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give no quarter . They come , they see ; you are lost if the money 's there . That 's the class say precious sister-in-law belongs to . Rises . Guth . Guthrie I 'm afraid you 're right . NERVY enters , with card . Nervy . The lady wishes to see you , sir . GUTHRIE rises . Prim . Primrose Reads card , and starts up . By jove ! Look at that . Hands card to GUTHRIE . Guth . Guthrie Takes card , and reads Mrs. Venetia Primrose . What can it mean ? Prim . Primrose Did you ever hear of such impudence . After the lawsuit , too . Did you say I was at home , Tom ? Nervy . No , sir . Prim . Primrose Crosses , L. Well , I 'm not at home ; and mind you say it in a way to let the lady understand that I 'm denying myself . Guth . Guthrie To PRIMROSE . Pardon one suggestion . To NERVY . Just a moment . To PRIMROSE . I do n't think it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Primrose Do you suppose that I would consent to see her ? Guth . Guthrie No , no . But , since you have placed your business in my hands , I feel it our duty to give her at least a hearing . Prim . Primrose Crosses , R. C. , and up . Well , if you think so . But you must excuse me . And if you wish to make her call as snort as possible , tell her I 'm cleaned out . Those ladies are like bees ; they wo n't light where there 's no honey . Third Class ! Ha-ha-ha ! I know the sort . Exits , L. U. E. Guth . Guthrie At fireplace . To NERVY . Show the lady in . Makes a turn up and down L. , as NERVY goes to R. E. , and speaks off . Nervy . Please step this way . Gives way to VENETIA , who enters , R. U. E. , as he goes off . Guth . Guthrie Formally . Mr. Primrose begs me to make his excuses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? This is what I call an agreeable surprise . I am really and truly glad to see you . Offers her hand , which he does not take . Guth . Guthrie Coldly . You are very kind . Points to chair . Wo n't you be seated ? Ven . Venetia Down C. , with sigh of relief . You ca n't imagine how bitter I felt as I crossed this threshold . And now , at sight o ' you and the recollection of happy days it brings , I 'm quite myself again . A step toward him . You 've changed . You do n't look as if you could talk and laugh as brightly as you used to . Steps back . Has anything happened to you ? Guth . Guthrie Oh , yes ; I had a bitter disappointment , but that is over . Ven . Venetia I 've had my experiences , too , in the last three years , but never mind that now , when I 'm so delighted to see you . Do you remember the last time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I really ca n't say . Ven . Venetia Dear me , what a poor memory you 've got . It was the day you left . You sent the wagon ahead , and I walked with you through the wood as far as the waterfall . There we stood chatting and leaning over the side , and , as we looked down into the water  --  Breaking off in a laugh.  --  why , do n't you remember . Guth . Guthrie With a shade of bitterness . Oh , yes . Ven . Venetia Goes , R. Neither of us dreamed , then , that my fate would be decided a few months after , just by that fall , at that very turning of the stream . Well , I 'll tell you all about it some time . Sits , C. I shall stay all winter in New York , and hope to see you now and then . Guth . Guthrie Sits on sofa . Excuse me , but I fear I 'm delaying the business of your call . Ven . Venetia Sighs . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step because I felt I owed it to the memory of my husband . You know , of course , all about the lawsuit I was forced into by my brother in-law . Guth . Guthrie Forced into ? Ven . Venetia Most certainly . I should never have opposed any claim of my husband 's brother ; I was ready to make any sacrifice , but when our old lawyer read the wicked charges brought against me , there was no possible answer but a fight to the death . I signed the papers that were laid before me and went to live with my father in the little village where I was born , that I might hear nothing of the scandal of that fatal suit . Guth . Guthrie Indeed ! Then I suppose you never heard the name of your adversary 's counsel ? Ven . Venetia No , I did not . With growing suspicion . But why do you ask me ? Guth . Guthrie Rises . Because I can not allow you to proceed without first telling you that the counsel was myself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! You ? Guth . Guthrie Yes . Ven . Venetia Impossible ! What  --  you put your name to such accusations ! You  --  who knew me ! Who  --  Goes , R. Guth . Guthrie Pardon me , you are mistaken . I only knew the young girl who seemed to bear so lightly , and so contentedly , her modest lot in a strange house . The pleading I framed was against the woman who had managed to get possession of the whole estate of an old family , and who was now fighting inch by inch for every tittle of her rights  --  She turns away.  --  and every dollar of her gains . Ven . Venetia Moved . And you could really think that I  --  I  --  Oh ! Turns away and supports herself by the table . Guth . Guthrie Quickly advancing . You are ill ! Let me  --  Ven . Venetia Turning on him . Do n't touch me ! Recovering with an effort . I  --  Going down , R.  --  I believe we have nothing further to say . Up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think it 's about time to intervene . Advancing . You wished to see me on business , I believe , Mrs.  --  Mrs.  --  ah  --  Primrose . Ven . Venet in Yes . I believe we may dispense with introductions . Prim . Primrose I should feel obliged if you would . Ven . Venetia The suit which was pending between us has been finally decided . Prim . Primrose Yes ; in your favor . You are to get everything , and I am to get nothing . If you call that justice , of course , there is nothing more to be said . Ven . Venetia A step toward him , smiling faintly . Oh , no ; I can not rest satisfied with the judgment that has been rendered . Prim . Primrose With a sneer . What ? Not yet ? Well , I 'm sorry I ca n't oblige you any further . At present I am stripped as bare as a worm-eaten tree , and I have only one satisfaction left  --  you ca n't take anything more from me . Crosses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refuse to accept all that the law has awarded me . Prim . Primrose What ? Guth . Guthrie You refuse ! Ven . Venetia Not heeding GUTHRIE , sits , C. Be good enough , to listen . As sole heir of my husband 's bounty , I would suffer no one to wrest from me what his generosity and kindness had given . But I recognize the obligations of the name I bear  --  which his love and bounty also gave me  --  and I am resolved , not upon compulsion of your lawsuit , but by my own free will , to respect the family dispositions under which you claim a share of the inheritance . Prim . Primrose That is to say , in plain language  --  Ven . Venetia Rises . In plain language , that even the decision of the Court will not induce me to take what my own convictions do not tell me is rightfully mine . Sits , as PRIMROSE crosses , L. Prim . Primrose Oh , now I understand . Will you pardon me a moment ? Goes to GUTHRIE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? She 's trying to purchase a reputation with the little pourboire she 's offering me . But she 'll find she 's dealing with the wrong man . Going back to VENETIA . You will excuse this short consultation with my lawyer , who fully concurs with me . Glancing at GUTHRIE . Do n't you ? GUTHRIE makes no sign . Your offer is too late . I might , perhaps , have consented to a compromise while the action was pending , and the Lord knows I should have been glad of one . But an arrangement after the Court has pronounced judgment is nothing more nor less than a present ; and in the matter of presents we have our own peculiar notions . We make them with eyes shut , but we accept none unless we are able to look the donor straight in the face . This is also a family tradition , and I shall respect it . Turns away with a bow , L. Ven . Venetia Very calmly . You are free to act in that respect as you please . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I am concerned , the point is not whether you accept , but that I restore . You can not prevent that . The papers are with my lawyer . I have deposited the money with the bankers , whose certificate and check-book you will find in this envelope . Puts envelope on table . You may draw the checks , or throw them in the fire  --  just as you please . Prim . Primrose In that case you will permit me to choose the fire . And now , I suppose , you are through with me . Crosses , R. Ven . Venetia Yes . I am quite through with you , but you have not done with me . You owe me satisfaction , full and ample , for the wrong you have done me , and I shall have it yet . Going up R. , to GUTHRIE . And you , when the time comes , will ask my pardon , and my bitterest vengeance will be to grant it . Gentlemen , I wish you good-morning . Exits . Prim . Primrose After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VENETIA , then at GUTHRIE . Well , are you scared ? Guth . Guthrie It is possible we have done her injustice ? Prim . Primrose Oh , murder ! Blessings on your childlike innocence . Guth . Guthrie Down L. C. You may be rich in experience , but my profession has taught me to distinguish between the true and the false . Prim . Primrose Bosh ! What does a lawyer know of wickedness compared to a man about town ! Why , at twenty , I drove two guardians into fits by my goings-on , and I 've been adding to my stock ever since . That woman was simply acting a part , and she 's taken you in . I sha n't accept her money , not if my hair grew gray this minute . Passing his hand over his brow . By Jove !  --  there 's not much left to turn any color . Come ! Taps bell . . Jump into my cab and I 'll drop you at your office . GUTHRIE rises . To NERVY , who enters with PRIMROSE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tom ? Nervy . What carriage , sir . Prim . Primrose Why , my carriage , stupid . Nervy . I beg your pardon , sir , but you sold it this morning . Prim . Primrose Crosses to GUTHRIE . Gad ! So I did ! Forgot all about it . Well , then , old chap , we 'll take the horse-cars . Horse-car 's good enough for me . Come along ! Hands GUTHRIE his hat , claps on his own , and taking GUTHRIE 'S arm , goes off gayly , L. C. CURTAIN . ACT II . The same scene .  --  The next day . PRIMROSE enters from L. C. , with a legal paper in his hand , which he examines through his glass . DOUBLEPENNY follows . Prim . Pr imrose Seems to be all right ! Sits near desk , and reads it over : " In witness whereof , we have hereunto set our hands this  --  " Signs it with a flourish . Beverly Primrose . Now for your name . Rises and goes , C. Doub . Doublepenny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prim . Primrose Everything all right now ? Doub . Doublepenny Quite . Prim . Primrose I did n't think it necessary to have an inventory made . You simply take the house with everything in it , from the door-bell to the last parlor match . You do n't mind my lighting one ? Lights a cigarette at table , L. Doub . Doublepenny Laughing . Why , the idea ! By the way , how will you have the money ? Prim . Primrose Just turn it in to my credit at the club , will you ? I 've had another terrible night at poker . Doub . Doublepenny Very good . Rises and goes , R. C. And when do you think of  --  a  --  a  --  moving ? Not that I want to  --  Prim . Primrose Sits . Oh , I shall go at once . My few traps are being packed now . I can vacate instanter . Doub . Doublepenny Have you got another place ? Prim . Primrose No . I 'm going to stop at the club . Doub . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Primrose No , no . As long as it must be done , it 's best to be done at once . It 's not so easy , you know , for me to say good-by to this house  --  Rises.  --  full of touching recollections . Here I brought my bride  --  that was my first . Here I got divorced from my second . Oh , memory !  --  memory ! But what 's the use . Doub . Doublepenny Taking a statuette from the cabinet . Did you buy this in New York ? Prim . Primrose No , no ; that 's from Vienna . Doub Doublepenny Puts statuette back . This is a very gay little cabinet . It 's what they call Rennysans , is n't it ? Prim . Primrose No ; that 's Rococo . Doub . Doublepenny Funny I always get the two mixed up . Prim . Primrose Oh , that wo n't do , my dear friend . Blunders in art , like blunders in speech , stamp you as belonging to the remoter depths of the social system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but hang that Rococo and Rennysans  --  I always make mistakes with them . Prim . Primrose Oh , it 's quite easy . Just knock your head against the thing . If you make a hole in it , it 's Renaissance . If you get a bump , its Rococo . Doub . Doublepenny Rubbing his head . Gad , there 's no learning anything without some pains , is there ? Going up and around , L. C. Prim . Primrose Rises , crosses , R. Can I do anything else for you ? Doub . Doublepenny Thank you ; there 's nothing I think of just now . Prim . Primrose Then I 'll have this deed recorded and sent to you by my lawyer . Doub . Doublepenny Disturbed . Your lawyer ! That 's that fellow Guthrie , is n't it ? Prim . Primrose Yes . Doub . Doublepenny Well , I should n't like to have anything to do with him just now , even in the way of business . Prim . Primrose Why not ? At desk . Doub . Doublepenny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I expect to hear from him about it . Prim . Primrose What  --  a row ? Sits . Doub . Doublepe nny You bet ! Sits , C. You remember you advised me to pick a quarrel with somebody ? Well , I tried my best , but everybody seems so infernally good-tempered , and disposed to overlook everything I say or do . Prim . Primrose Rather have a laugh at you , I suppose . Doub . Doublepenny But last night , when Guthrie dropped in at the club , I noticed he was kinder uneasy , you know . Well , without thinking of anything , I began to talk about buying this house , and then about you , and then about your lawsuit , and then about your sister-in-law , and then , in the most natural way in the world , I alluded to her as a  --  a  --  " female Shylock . " Rises . Well , you jest oughter seen him ! He turned on me like a tiger , and abused me like the deuce . By granny , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that row ; so I says to him : " Here , here ! That 'll do !  --  that 'll do ! A friend of mine will wait on you in the morning ! " Prim . Primrose What did he say ? Doub . Doublepenny I think he said , " Hang your friend , " or words to that effect . But it was a clever idea of mine ; do n't you think so ? Prim . Primrose Rises . Well , that depends . Guthrie 's a crack shot , and he can send a hundredweight bag to the ceiling eleven strikes out of every dozen . Doub . Doublepenny That settles it ! I wo n't have anything more to do with him . Who the deuce would dream of a lawyer being a regular murderer like that ? The courts ought to put a stop to it . Prim . Primrose But suppose he turns on you and pulls your nose ? Doub . Doublepenny Oh , that 's all right . I wo n't bear him any malice . So 's he ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's one solution of the difficulty . NERVY appears at door , L. E. , with portmanteau . Nervy . Everything is packed , sir . Prim . Primrose Crosses , L. Very well . Bring me my hat and umbrella . NERVY exits . Doub . Doublepenny And I 'll send my man around to get the keys . Prim . Primrose Yes , do . NERVY returns with top-coat , hat , and umbrella . Why , Tom , what 's that long face for ? Nervy . I feel sad , sir . I ca n't help it . Prim . Primrose Nonsense ! It 's the up and down of life . Mr. Doublepenny has made a million in the last month ; I 've lost about as much , so it 's only fair that I should make room for him . Get me a cab . I 'm ready to start . Goes , R. Doub . Doublepenny At window . Why , there 's a hack just driving up , with a big trunk on the top , and a young lady is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nervy . I 'll run ! Exits , L. C. Prim . Primrose A stunner ! Where ? Goes to window . Good gracious ! Why , that 's Rena ! Doub . Doublepenny Rena ! Prim . Primrose Yes , My daughter . Raises window and calls . Why , Rena , where do you come from ? RENA laughs , outside . Doub . Doublepenny Your daughter ? Sees PRIMROSE kissing his hand to the arrival . Then I sha n't disturb you . I 'll see you at the club . Going . His daughter ! What a stunner ! Exits , L. E. Prim . Primrose Shutting window . Rena in town ! Down L. What 's the matter ? What 's up ? NERVY appearing , R. C. , all over smiles . Nervy . Miss Rena , sir . RENA enters , running . Rena . Where is he ? Where is my darling papa ? Embraces him . Oh , papa , darling  --  well , what do you say ? Prim . Primrose What do I say ? Looks at her critically , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how you have grown ! Rena . Yes . But I 'm looking well , ai n't I ? Sees portmanteau , which NERVY had put on chair . But what 's that ? Are you going away ? Prim . Primrose Crosses , R. , to NERVY . Embarrassed . Eh ? No  --  no  --  I 've just come back . Takes off his overcoat and hands it to NERVY . Here , Tom , take this , and put Miss Rena 's things in  --  H 'm !  --  the comer room ! NERVY takes coat , and RENA 'S things , and exits , L. 1 . E. Rena . It 's a surprise , is n't it ? Crosses , R. Prim . Primrose Rather ! The fact is , I thought you  --  Rena . Now do n't fib , papa . The fact is , you were not thinking of me at all . Prim . Primrose Why , it 's only a week ago that I wrote you a long letter . Rena . I beg your pardon , papa ; that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dear , dear  --  how time flies ! Rena . Besides , you did n't write me a letter , you sent me a telegram . Prim . Primrose I know : I wrote a telegram . Rena . Well , I sha n't be angry with you , because I 'm so happy to be home . The chief thing is , here I am , and I 've come to stay ! Sits on sofa . Prim . Primrose What ? Here ? Rena . Surprised . Here ? Of course ! Where else ? Prim . Primrose Aside . Here 's a pretty mess ! How can I explain to her ? To RENA . But , I say , what about the school ? Rena . Rises and goes to him . Almost tearfully . You wo n't send me back , will you ? Prim . Primrose But the arrangement was made for three years . Rena . With decision . No matter . When you come to know me better , you 'll find I 'm educated enough . I need n't learn any more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school for the sole purpose of telling me that ? Rena . I have n't run away , papa . I came on with the principal . She has got to stay two days in New York , and I begged her so that she brought me along . I told her you 'd be glad to see me , and I was right there , was n't I ? Prim . Primrose Certainly , my darling . Rena . Snuggling close to him . And when Miss Parker calls to-morrow to take me back  --  you 'll simply tell her you ca n't live without me ! Prim . Primrose Patting her cheek . You rogue ! Well , we 'll talk it over later . First of all you want breakfast ! Taps bell . Rena . Oh , no , papa ; we had some at Poughkeepsie . Crosses , R. Prim . Primrose Well , is there anything you wish ? Rena . Well , I would n't mind taking a drop of brandy  --  Sits , C.  --  if you have it in the house . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yes , I think I want something to pull me together , after travelling so far . Prim . Primrose Where on earth did you get the idea of brandy , and " pulling yourself together ? " Rena . With seriousness . Oh , the girls are very advanced in our school . Most of ' em have brothers , and that 's the way we get posted . Prim . Primrose But brandy ! Rena . Oh , we 're all used to that ! Rises , and up R. , and down L. , sits . Prim . Primrose Are you ? To NERVY , who has entered . Tom ! Aside . Bring up a bottle of Madeira . Nervy . Very well , sir . Going  --  stops  --  reflects  --  and returns . Then aside to PRIMROSE . I beg your pardon , sir . Whispers to PRIMROSE . Prim . Primrose Oh , never mind . Doublepenny wo n't object to one bottle of wine . NERVY exits , R. C. Rena . Has smoothed her hair at mirror . And now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a long , sensible talk . I 'm so fond of talking ; and one ca n't get a word in at school . They are the greatest set of gabblers you ever knew . First and foremost , let me have a good look at you . How handsome you are ! So distingu  --  but rather flushed ! I know what it is  --  you work too hard ! Prim . Primrose Sometimes . Rena . Oh , I 'm so glad to have a chance , at last , to get acquainted with you . Do you know how many times in all we 've met these last two years ? Prim . Primrose Well , I 've been up to see you often , I 'm sure . Rena . Often ? Three times ! Prim . Primrose Oh , come  --  you 're mistaken ! Rena . Mistaken ? Gets diary and sits , C. Here it is in my diary . Turning leaves of a small book which she has taken from satchel . Do you keep a diary ? Prim . Primrose Dubiously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is . December 24th  --  underscored in red pencil . That means a red-letter day : " Called for visitors . Papa . I am so happy . How well he looks  --  in spite of his gray hair . And so distinguished and indifferent ! I want my future husband to be exactly like him in everything . " Prim . Primrose Rises , aside . H 'm ! I hope not ! Rena . Turning more leaves . And now , eight pages further : " May 17th . Papa has called again at last . He was very nice to me . The whole school is in love with him . And he has grown so much younger since I last saw him . Even his hair has changed . " Prim . Primrose Little minx . Pinching her cheek . Rena . Shuts book . Then your last visit was just three months ago , on my birthday . After you left , I know Miss Parker and the French teacher talked a lot about you . But they shut up as soon as I came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me too vain . Prim . Primrose Yes , I dare say that was it . Rena . There was one thing , though , I did manage to overhear . They said you were a " regular rounder "  --  what does that mean , papa ? Rises . Prim . Primrose Well , naturally that means a man always " about  --  around "  --  a man  --  you always know where to find ! Crosses , R. C. Rena . Incredulously . Oh , yes . I guess it means you love fun . Well , I 'll tell you a secret , too . NERVY enters . Prim . Primrose Amused . What is it ? Rena . I love fun , myself . Prim . Primrose Then we are regularly made for each other . Rena . Oh , we 'll have a jolly time together , papa . I had to keep up appearances at school , you know , but I 'm just dying to break out . NERVY has returned with dust-covered bottle and two glasses , and now offers the wine which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ papa , to our eternal friendship ! We 'll never have a secret we do n't share ! Prim . Primrose Pleased . Good ! Rena . After taking sip , critically eyes wine . My ! That 's fine ! What is it ? Hennessy ? Prim . Primrose No ; it 's Murphy ? They drink . Rena . I guess that must be better . Jumps up , after taking her wine , and puts glass down , L. Wo n't we have a lively time together ! As Ruth says , " Where thou goest , I go ! " Prim . Primrose Aside , putting his glass down . That would be lively . At table , L. Rena . Toying with a small bust , on mantel . I say , papa , who 's this ugly old fellow ? Prim . Primrose Alarmed . Do n't touch that . It 'll break if you look at it , and besides , it do n't belong to me . Rena . No ? To whom does it belong ? Prim . Primrose A person named @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Comes down . By the way , papa , I had better prepare you at once , as we are going to live together . I shall cost you a lot of money . Prim . Primrose Coming down . Oh , indeed ! Rena . But that 's of no consequence to you . Prim . Primrose None whatever , just now . Rena . First , I 'll want a lot of new gowns  --  and papa  --  I have n't a single diamond . I should so like a ring , and a pin , and things like that . We can choose them together . Takes arm . I know just what I want , and I have to have them . Prim . Primrose Oh , you have ? Rena . Yes , indeed . The girls will expect it of me , if I 'm to live up to my name . Prim . Primrose Your name  --  what name ? Rena . Why , the name the girls gave me at school . Prim . Primrose And what is that , may I ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immensely rich , papa , so the girls called me Miss Million . Prim . Primrose Miss Million ? But how 's that ? You never made any display at school . How could they suppose  --  Rena . That you were so rich ? Why , Miss Parker used to say , " Girls , remember , the people with most money know how to keep it . " That meant they were stingy , you know . Prim . Primrose Oh ! Rena . So you know , for your own sake , I must have the diamonds . Prim . Primrose Well , there 's plenty of time to talk about that . Crosses , L. Rena . Certainly . We must get the indispensables , first ! But do you know what I really must have at once ? A pony cart with two wee ponies  --  Takes arm.  --  tandem . Of course , when I say at once , I mean next week will do . Sits at table , L. Prim . Primrose Going round to R. of table . That 's lucky ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dear , I 've spilled some on the table . Prim . Primrose Jumping up . Why , darling ! On the India cover , too ! Dabs it with his handkerchief . If Doublepenny sees that  --  Rena . Gracious ! Does that belong to him , too ? Prim . Primrose Testily . Of course ! Everything belongs to him . I mean he left the things here for safe keeping . Rena . For safe keeping ? Prim . Primrose Yes . We had a special arrangement . I 'll explain to you by and by . But would n't you like to go to your room and make yourself comfortable ? At table . Rena . Delighted . To my room ? Crosses and sits , C. Ah , how nice that sounds . I 've been so little at home all my life . Prim . Primrose Aside . So have I. Rena . When I was a child I lived with grandma and uncle . And then I was sent to school  --  after uncle married Aunt Venetia . Dear Aunt Venetia . Prim . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settle one thing at the start . You will do me a special favor by never mentioning that woman 's name again . Rena . Amazed . Not speak of Venetia ? Why not ? She was always kind to me , papa , from the first  --  when she came as companion to grandmamma , and nobody ever dreamed that she would marry uncle ! Prim . Primrose She dreamed it , if nobody else did . Rena . And after I went to school , she used to write me such lovely letters . I 've got a whole box full of her letters . And she came to see me so often . Prim . Primrose She came to see you ? Rena . Why , certainly . What have you got against her , papa ? Prim . Primrose You 'll learn all in good time . Go to your room , now , and rest yourself . RENA goes , L. NERVY enters , L. C. Nervy . Mr. Doublepenny 's man just called for the keys , sir . Rena . What , papa ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Primrose Abashed . It 's all a mistake . To NERVY . Tell him not just yet I 'll see Mr. Doublepenny myself . NERVY exits , R. U. E. Rena . What 's the matter with that Mr. Doublepenny , papa ? He must be a little off . Prim . Primrose Annoyed . I ca n't explain it all to you just yet . You 've got to get better acquainted with money matters first . Crosses , L. Rena . After a momentary pause , then very frankly . By the way , papa , that reminds me , I have a very painful confession to make to you . Prim . Primrose Alarmed . What is it ? Rena . I 'm afraid you 'll be very angry with me . Prim . Primrose Now , come , Regina . I hope you have n't fallen in love with a piano teacher , or anything of that sort . Rena . Oh , no , papa . Fanny Ricketts did that long ago , and saved the whole class . Mine is something worse ! Prim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rena . I  --  I 've run in debt ! Sits , C. Prim . Primrose Run in debt ? My own daughter ! Rena , give me a kiss . Lifts her to him and kisses her . Rena . But you do n't ask how much ! Prim . Primrose That 's of no consequence  --  Aside.  --  just now . Crosses , R. Rena . Kissing him . Oh , you darling popsy ! You 've taken such a load off my mind . Is n't it good to make a clean breast of everything . If anything ever worries you , papa , just tell me , and I 'll give you a kiss and cheer you up , just as you 've done me . Bye-bye ! Bye-bye ! Exits , L. 1 . E. Prim . Primrose C. Takes his hat . Now to hunt up Doublepenny , and get a few hours ' respite . As he goes up , meets GUTHRIE , who enters , R. U. E. By jove ! I 'm glad you 've come . I 'm in a dreadful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to cause you a fresh unpleasantness . I 've come to return you all the papers in the various matters you placed in my hands from time to time . Prim . Primrose Why  --  the deuce ! Why ? Guth . Guthrie I 'm going abroad  --  to stay . Prim . Primrose Is n't this very sudden ? Guth . Guthrie No ; I 've had the idea two or three years , and a meeting which took place recently , an old disappointment I thought I had overcome  --  Trying to assume a light tone . In short , I 'm tempted to run away as far as my legs can carry me . Prim . Primrose Glancing at door , L. I wish I could run away with you . Guth . Guthrie Tom tells me your daughter has come home . Prim . Primrose Yes . Now , what am I to do ? As far as I am concerned , personally , I could have managed to jog along for a while yet . But with a grown-up daughter at my side  --  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment ago ! She naturally expects to find a rich father . And so I ought to be  --  if I had lived like a father , and not like a boy . She began to talk of all the things she wanted me to buy for her . Gad ! it was a bitter dose to take ! I felt ashamed of myself  --  for the first time in my life ! I tell you , you do n't want any hereafter to keep a father straight ! The worst day of judgment for him is when his children grow up and he has to explain ! Crosses , R. Guth . Guthrie Do n't take it so much to heart . Prim . Primrose No , no ! The time has come when I must pay for making a fool of myself . Guth . Guthrie Well , if the worst comes to the worst , you can make use of that deposit . You 've got the check-book , have n't you ? Prim . Primrose The one that woman left here ? Of course I 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his breast pocket and takes out a check-book . I sha n't touch a penny of the money . She knows it , too ! It 's her trick  --  to shove a lot of money under my nose while I 'm starving . It 's a sweet revenge ! She might as well stick me on a spit and roast me at a slow fire . I confess , as I figured up this morning , what I had  --  or , rather , what I did n't have , I was so tempted that I seized a pen and dipped it into the ink to write a check . Turning over the leaves of the book . Gad ! when one looks at a thing like this , with all these crisp leaves  --  how they smile at you . Reads : " Pay to the order of "  --  all I need do is to fill in the amount and sign it . Here !  --  here ! Take it away or I 'll go crazy ! Holds it out and shakes it . Guth . Guthrie I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't , I 'll put it out of my reach somehow . Opens drawer of desk , down L. , and throws check-book in it . There ! Locks drawer and removes key . And there ! Opens window nearby , throws out key , and closes window . And there ! Takes a deep breath . Now I feel better . I am armed against myself to a certain extent . And now , before everything else , to find Doublepenny . To NERVY , who enters and clears away wine , etc . If my daughter asks for me , say I 'll be back in twenty minutes . To GUTHRIE . Come , old man ! Now you can grasp the hand of an honest man . Points to desk and slaps his breast . Poor , but not dishonored ! Takes GUTHRIE 'S arm , and they exit , R. U. E. Rena . Appearing at door , L. In a whisper . Tom !  --  Tom ! Are you alone ? Nervy . Yes , miss . Rena . Come here . L. C. I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; what is it ? Rena . How 's papa 's purse ? Nervy . In alarm . His purse , miss ? Rena . See what a nice one I 've made for him . Produces a small purse from her pocket . See ? Nervy . It 's lovely , Miss . Rena . It 's small , but it 'll hold a lot of money . Nervy . That 's just the thing for him , miss . Rena . You manage to slip it into his pocket . I wanted to do it myself , but his wardrobe 's empty  --  how 's that ? Nervy . Oh , everything is packed up . Rena . Packed up ? Nervy . Embarrassed . I mean  --  put away  --  from the moths . Crosses , L. Rena . Moths ! At this time of the year ? Nervy . Yes , miss ; we have a special kind this season . Excuse me , there 's the bell . Exits , R. U. E. Rena . Reflecting , throwing herself on chair , one foot doubled under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The wardrobe empty  --  everything packed up  --  a special kind of moths ! There 's something wrong here ! Enter VENETIA . Ven . Venetia As she enters . You need n't announce me . Down R. C. Well , Rena ! Rena . Rises at sound of her voice and flies to her . Oh , Venie ! Dear Venie , how did you know ? Ven . Venetia Coming forward with her . Miss Parker has just left me . And you can imagine I put on my hat , and drove here at once . Rena . How good that was of you ! Ven . Venetia If you only knew ! It 's more than good , it 's simply heroic ! Goes , R. Rena . How 's that ? Ven . Venetia Well , I left this very house yesterday , after delivering a sort of general malediction , and vowing never to set foot on the threshold again . Sits , C. Rena . Crosses , R. , behind , and sits at her feet . Tell me what it all means . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  What can have happened between you two  --  the people I love best in ail the world . Ven . Venetia It 's a painful story . I 'll tell it you some time , when you are better acquainted with money matters . Rena . Crosses , L. That 's just the way papa talked . I do n't know what you both think I am . But let me tell you , I 'm not such a greenhorn in money matters . How could I run in debt if I were ? Sits on sofa . Ven . Venetia Have you run in debt ? Rena . Almost crying . Yes , I have . Ven . Venetia How did you come to do that ? Rena . In great distress and shame . Oh , Aunt Venetia , it was ice-cream caused my ruin ! I am so fond of it ; and I had so little pocket  --  money  --  at last I ran up a bill . Ven . Venetia You gormandizing little thing ! Sits , R. of table , L. Rena .

It 's a childish dream , of course ; but who knows ? Dotty has a brother , a very nice fellow . Produces her diary at desk , and takes out a photo. , which she shows to VENETIA . Here he is ! Ven . Venetia Reprovingly . You carry his picture ! Rena . I had to promise Dotty never to part with it . Well ,  --  Sits.  --  what do you think , Aunt Venie ? Ven . Venetia I do n't know . Looking at picture and reflecting . Rena . He 's very nice . Dark eyes , small hands  --  just as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  just as mine is ! Ven . Venetia What have you read of Ibsen 's ? Rena . Nothing  --  he 's too dry . But Dotty says that Ned says that Ibsen 's what they all want now . Ven . Venetia He looks like that . Rena . Like what ? Ven . Venetia As if there was something wanting . Rena . You do n't mean he looks like a fool ? Ven . Venetia Well , that may be an excuse in his case . Rena . Oh , Aunt  --  Ven . Venetia But his face certainly does n't betray any very powerful thought . Rena . Snatches photo , and crosses , L. Why do you abuse my very first sweetheart in that way ? Ven . Venetia Sits , C.

Ven . Venetia Heartily . More @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be happy together again , as we were at grandmamma 's  --  do you remember ? Ven . Venetia You shall be happier yet . Rena . Perhaps . But I 'm grown up now . But tell me all about yourself . Tell me all your secrets . A handsome woman like you must have lots . With childish insistance . Come ! Out with them ! What 's the state of your heart ? Quick ! Tell me ! Ven . Venetia Do n't ask me , dear . It 's in a state of chaos . There are anger and longing , fierceness and doubt . I ca n't make it out myself .

Venetia I do want a confidential talk with you . Crosses to RENA . Rena dear , run to your room , there 's a good girl . That is if your papa can spare me five minutes . Rena . Of course he will , so I 'll leave you just that long . Aside to PRIMROSE , as he comes down R. Now be good to her , papa , or  --  Crosses , L.  --  you 'll have to answer to me . Remember ! ( Exits , L. 1 . E. Ven . Venetia Let me say at once that I have not come here with any intention of bringing about a reconciliation between us . Prim . Primrose That is re-assuring . Thank you . Ven . Venetia We parted enemies yesterday . Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Oh , in that case , pray be seated . Ven . Venetia Sits , R. of table , L. , and , PRIMROSE sits , C. The fiercest war , however , does not preclude an occasional truce . And so I have resolved to forget , at least while this interview lasts , all provocation  --  great or small , I have suffered at your hands ever since the time when , unlocked for on my part , I gained the distinction of becoming your sister-in-law . Prim . Primrose " Unlooked for on your part "  --  Ha-ha-ha ! Excuse my merriment . It was unlooked for on my part . Ha-ha-ha ! Ven . Venetia Coolly . Oh , pray do n't restrain yourself , for then I need not refrain from an occasional hit back if the opportunity offers  --  and that sort of thing does so facilitate free expression . Prim . Primrose Getting confused . That 's so ! Aside . I 'd like to know where the creature picked up her self-possession . Aloud . And may I now beg  --  Ven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawsuit is over  --  but you have a daughter . Prim . Primrose My Rena ! I do n't suppose you claim her under your judgment ! My lawyers failed to inform me of any such provision . Ven . Venetia Naturally . Do n't worry . I do not claim her under my judgment  --  but you 'll have to give her to me all the same . Rises . Prim . Primrose Wheels chair toward her . What ! My daughter ! To you ? Ven . Venetia Certainly . I love Rena with all my heart I wish to protect and care for her as a sister . Prim . Primrose You want to be everything ; a wife to my brother  --  and a sister to my child . You 'll soon absorb the whole family . Rises and goes , R. The Primroses must have a special attraction for you . Ven . Venetia Down  --  to him . With one exception ! Pause  --  he finally comprehends and makes a low bow . I have n't got the remotest design upon you . Prim . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know  --  Ven . Venetia I know ! But let us drop jesting . I know your situation exactly . Prim . Primrose Well , then , the least said about that the better . Ven . Venetia Very well Then let us talk only of Rena . What 's to become of her ? Is she to share your bachelor life , and finish her education in a hotel ? Prim . Primrose Gloomily . I do n't know what to do about her . Ven . Venetia You ca n't send her back to school . She has outgrown her school frocks . Her head is filled with a thousand dreams of life , of love , of ambition ! School would be a cage where she would dash herself to death against the bars ! Prim . Primrose Crosses , L. , distressed and irritated . Do n't I know it ! Do n't I see it ! But , confound it  --  all that 's my business ! You have nothing to do with it . I do n't care what you offer  --  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are enemies ? Prim . Primrose Doggedly . Yes . Ven . Venetia I do n't think that should stop us in this . Prim . Primrose Decisively . I see we shall never understand one another . Ven . Venetia Oh , I understand you thoroughly . Let me recall to your memory a little incident which was told me by my husband . It was one night in August , ' 62 . A Union officer with the help of another man , who had hastened to his call in the darkness , rescued an old negro woman from a burning cabin . Holding their hands firmly grasped , they carried the poor old creature to a place of safety . Then the Union officer looked at the other for the first time , and recognized a rebel soldier . That Union officer was my husband 's only brother , and he had never stopped to consider whether it was a friend or a foe who had helped him in his generous deed . Yes ! He moves a little , L. It was you  --  and your thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , if we can save the helpless between us ! Even the hand of an enemy is welcome in such a need . " That was your thought  --  was n't it ? Prim . Primrose Going L. , evasively . Well  --  it was so long ago I ca n't remember . Of course , if anything of the kind occurred , it was very nice . Up L. , stands by sofa . Ven . Venetia Very nice ! So nice that I think it ought to be preserved in the family history in place of that other family tradition we quarrelled so long about . Goes , R. Prim . Primrose Aside . It 's astonishing how it improves a woman to marry into a good family . I never noticed it before ; but she 's really quite superior . Ven . Venetia Turns and goes to him . Well , is it settled ? Prim . Primrose Quickly . Is what settled ? Goes , C. Ven . Venetia C. Simply tell your daughter that you had given up your house to a friend in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or anywhere . Invent any plausible story , and tell her that she 's to stay with me until you 've got a home ready for her . That will remove every difficulty . Prim . Primrose Brightening . Yes ; that will do capitally . Impatiently . But no  --  Stops.  --  it wo n't ! She ca n't stay with you . Ven . Venetia Why bother your head all the time about me . I shall remain your enemy just the same . Prim . Primrose Relieved . Oh , in that case  --  but remember  --  that 's understood . Ven . Venetia Only we must n't let Rena suspect . It would make her unhappy . So it 's arranged  --  in her presence  --  Prim . Primrose We shall try to control ourselves ; but when we 're alone , the understanding governs . Ven . Venetia Of course ! You 'll have to take tea with me occasionally , to keep up appearances . Prim . Primrose What ? Tea with you ? To fireplace . No , no ! That 's going too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Venetia But for Rena 's sake . Prim . Primrose Well , so be it ! I shall take tea with you , for Rena 's sake ; but I shall have my own thoughts all the while . Back to C. Ven . Venetia Certainly . And pray do n't nourish any pleasant illusions about my thoughts , while playing the hostess under compulsion . Prim . Primrose Looks at her , and goes , L. Aside . There 's no stopping that woman 's tongue ! She 's got an answer for everything ! Ven . Venetia So it 's all arranged . Going R. I shall come for Rena in an hour . Going up . Meanwhile , good-by . Continue to be my enemy , and believe me  --  Bowing.  --  sincerely yours ! Exits . Prim . Primrose Up C. , looks after her . I 've done that woman injustice ! I made a mistake about the class . Down . She does n't belong to the Third Class . She 's a new species  --  Sits.  --  which has never before come under my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infatuation . When I consider how everybody deserts me , except that woman whom I persecuted ; that she alone has offered me a hand . Rises , arguing with himself . But I can not accept it . Struck . Still , that does't lessen the merit of her act . Strongly . It 's a shame to hurt such a creature 's feelings  --  a downright shame . Going R. , to desk . And when she inquires at the bank  --  Sits and toys with desk.  --  and finds I have n't touched the money , she 'll be hurt ! She 'll be cut to the quick ! To C. Oh , this is more than obstinacy on my part ! It 's downright malice ! Where 's that check-book ! At desk . I 'll take it ! I 'll accept it ! It 'll be a mere decent acknowledgment of her efforts to be of service . And there 's not a moment to lose , either . Where did I put that key ? Oh , I remember ; I threw it out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and kneels in front of desk , trying one after another . This one does n't fit ! Nor does this one ! Vexedly . Confound it ! A regular burglar-proof ! RENA enters L. 1 E. Rena . Why , papa , what are you doing ? Prim . Primrose Still on his knees , impatiently . I 'm trying to open this drawer . Rena . What 's in it ? Prim . Primrose Money ! Rena . Money ! Oh , let me help you . Over to him . Here , let 's try my keys . Prim . Primrose Good ! Rena . Kneels by desk , trying her keys . That do n't fit ; nor that ! None of ' em fit , papa . What are we going to do ? Prim . Primrose Rising . Perhaps we can open it from behind . Examines the back . No use ! Rena . Let 's turn it over . Prim . Primrose It 's too heavy . Rena . I 'll call Tom . Going C. Prim . Primrose The idea ! No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ca n't we pry it open ? Prim . Primrose With what ? Rena . Looking round . Here , take these scissors . Seizing a pair from desk . Prim . Primrose All right ! Wedging scissors into aperture . It 's giving way ! But you must push from the other side . Rena . Seizes a paper-knife . All right , papa . This will help . She goes to back of desk ! Prim . Primrose How strong the confounded thing is . Rena . Trying to insert the knife . I heard a crack , papa . On her knees , at back of desk . Prim . Primrose Yes , I think it 's giving way . No  --  CANDID enters , at R. U. E. Candid . Pausing . I beg pardon . Hope I 'm not in the way . Down C. Prim . Primrose Hallo , Ned . You 're just in time . Come and help us . Ned . Help in what ? Goes to desk . Prim . Primrose To get this drawer open . Ned . Puts glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what  --  the thing is locked ! RENA nods in confirmation . Prim . Primrose Yes , but we 've forced it a bit . Now you take the scissors . Hold it there while Rena works at the back . Get down on your knees as I did . That 's it ! NED and RENA thus face each other on their knees . Ned . But wo n't you introduce me ? Prim . Primrose Oh , excuse me . My daughter  --  Mr. Candid . Now I must get something to help with . Goes to man in armor at back and takes sword from the figure . Ned . To RENA . Charmed to make your acquaintance . Rena . Delighted , I 'm sure . Prim . Primrose Unfastening sword . Ah , this will do ! Ned . I 've already had the pleasure of seeing you in a photograph . Rena . Quickly . So have I. Prim . Primrose Do n't let go your hold  --  I 'll be there in a minute . Ned . I got your picture from my sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ned . And I 've carried it with me ever since . Rena . Rapturously . So have I. Checks herself . I mean Dotty told me  --  Prim . Primrose Coming forward with sword , which he tries to insert in drawer . Stop talking for one moment ! Now for a general effort ! Attention ! All together ! One , two , three  --  go ! The drawer snaps open with a crash . We 've got it ! Rena . Rising . Phew ! papa , but it was hard work . Ned . Rising . Rather rough on the knees . Prim . Primrose Never got money by such hard work in all my life . Produces check-book , and leans sword against desk . And now , let 's get to work , quick . Sits at desk . How much is it ! Opens certificate of deposit . By Jove  --  that 's a handsome figure ! I must show my appreciation of that . I 'll fill up a couple of ' em right away . Begins to write . Rena . Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a seat near her . Wo n't you take a seat ? Ned . Thank you , I will . Aside . The photograph does n't begin to do her justice . Sits , C. Rena . Wo n't you sit with us , papa ? Prim . Primrose My dear , I ca n't . I 've got to go to work . Tears off one check , and puts it on a small table , near by . Rena . Poor papa ! He does so overwork himself . He 'll kill himself . Ned . In low tone . Do n't let 's worry him . Let 's talk low . Pulls his chair nearer . Rena . In a whisper . This way ? So ? Ned . Yes , that 's it . My sister will be so glad to hear that I 've made your acquaintance . Rena . Do you think so ? Prim . Primrose Tearing off another check . That settles at the club . Lays it on table . Ned . Dot loves you so dearly . And I can quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you were acquainted with papa  --  and I never knew it . Ned . Oh , yes ; ever so long . We 're great chums ! Rena . That 's just splendid ! Then you can call very often , ca n't you ? Ned . Sorry  --  but I ca n't . Rena . Why not ? Ned . Your father has something against me just now . Besides , he thinks you are too young , only a child ; so it would n't do for me to call just because I 'm anxious to see you . Rena . But why  --  tell me why ? Ned . Well , we might talk about forbidden things , you know . Rena . What are forbidden things ? Ned . Love , for instance . Rena . Well , where 's the harm ? Ned . Your father thinks it wo n't do . Rena . Does he suppose we do n't talk of love at school ? Ned . I told him that , but he wo n't be convinced . Prim . Primrose Tearing off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wonder where our parents get all their old-fashioned notions from . They are all alike . Every girl 's father and mother are just the same . It 's a common complaint among us . We girls compared notes at school . Ned . Never mind , I 've got a plan . Rena . What is it ? Ned . You 'll call on my sister , of course ? Rena . Yes ; I 'm going to-morrow . Ned . And of course I 'll be there . Rena . At one o'clock . Ned . Yes ; at one . Alone ? RENA nods assent . All right . In a whisper . I 've got so much to tell you . Rena . I 'll stay an hour . Will that be long enough ? Ned . Oh  --  two hours  --  please . Rena . All right  --  two hours . Ned . Oh , Miss Rena . Tries to seize her hand , but she withdraws it as she sees her father rise . Prim . Primrose After tearing off a fourth check , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present . I say , Rena ! Surprised to see NED . What , Mr. Candid , you are still here ? Ned . Yes , sir ; I thought you might want my assistance  --  if there 's another draw . Crosses , R. Prim . Primrose No , no , thank you . There 's nothing else here to break into . Takes him aside . No young ladies ' hearts , particularly . Ned . Why , you do n't for a moment suppose  --  Prim . Primrose You ca n't humbug me ! I 'm too old a fox for that . Ned . With assumed frankness . Humbug you ? I would n't even pretend to try . Prim . Primrose That 's sensible . You know my views on that subject . Indicating RENA . And now find a polite way to take yourself off . Ned . Well , if I must  --  I must . Aloud . Miss Rena , I 've just told your father that I 'm afraid I sha n't be able to call again for some time . Rena @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prim . Primrose Yes ; for a year , or possibly , two . He 's going abroad . Well , good-by . Pleasant journey ! Sits . Ned . To RENA . I 'm so sorry that our acquaintance will have to be renewed at another time and in another place . Aside , as she extends her hand . To-morrow  --  at my sister 's . Aloud . Let me hope that you wo n't forget me . Gets hat , and bows stiffly to both , and exits , L. C. Prim . Primrose Sarcastically , and following him to door . Oh , no ; we wo n't forget ! Rena . After him , at door , to herself . And Aunt Venetia thought that young man a fool . Prim . Primrose Sits . Now then , darling , come here , and tell me what you want for your wardrobe . I might as well give you a check now . With importance , opening the check-book and dipping pen in the ink . Rena . Goes to him . Oh , how nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , I 'll dictate a few more . Prim . Primrose No , no ; this is n't a typewriter ! Aside . I 'm afraid this pen writes too easy as it is . VENETIA enters at R. C. Ven . Venetia Down L. C. Well , am I too early ? Rena . Meets VENETIA . Oh , Aunt Venie , I 'm so glad . Prim . Primrose Throws book in drawer , and shuts it up . By jove ! Ven . Venetia What ! not ready yet ? Did n't papa tell you ? Prim . Primrose Rises . Pardon me , but I 've been so busy that I have n't had time to tell her . Rena . Tell me about what ? Ven . Venetia Stage , L. I 'll explain everything in the carriage . Put on your hat and come with me . Rena . Oh , are we going to drive ? I 'm so fond of driving . Runs to window . Oh , what a lovely Victoria ! And such horses ! Papa has promised me a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can write a check for that , too . Runs off , L. 1 E. Ven . Venetia Quizzically . A check ? Prim . Primrose Aside . Deuce take it ! Ven . Venetia Sweetly . Oh , then , you have made up your mind at last . Prim . Primrose H 'm ! H 'm ! There 's no use denying , I suppose . Ven . Venetia Do you know , you 've really made me very happy . Prim . Primrose Well , I wanted to make some return for your kindness to Rena . Ven . Venetia And it was so thoughtful of you to choose that way . Prim . Primrose Lightly . It was really the nearest at hand . But I must confess that in my haste I have already disposed of the greater part of the annual allowance . Ven . Venetia Raising her eyebrows . The annual allowance ! You must have misunderstood . PRIMROSE stands chopfallen , and utters an " Oh ! " She continues archly . That was only your half-yearly allowance . Prim . Primrose Shuts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ven . Venetia I did n't want to make it harder for you to accept . I said to myself , " Let us first offer the little finger . " Holds out the finger as if to illustrate . Prim . Primrose Over to her . And he 'll soon take the whole hand . Kisses her hand . Ven . Venetia Why , you are actually kissing my hand . You forget that we are enemies . Prim . Primrose Oh , I 'm not bigoted ! If the hand is pretty , I do n't care whether it 's friend or enemy . My brother forgot to tell you that when that Confederate soldier and I were alone I hugged him . Ven . Venetia Laughing . Then I 'm lucky . I came off cheap . PRIMROSE makes a step toward her . She moves off as RENA enters , with her hat and cloak on . Rena . Now then , here I am , all ready . Ven . Venetia Oh , you darling ! RENA runs to VENETIA , hugs her ; then to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side , hugging her . Oh , you darling ! Rena . Gives a little scream each time she is squeezed . Let 's run ! Drawing checks just makes papa wild . Bye-bye ! Be a good popsy ! Off we go ! Exits , R. C. , with VENETIA , as PRIMROSE sits at the desk , takes out check-book , and begins to make out another check . CURTAIN . ACT III . A parlor or reception room at VENETIA 'S . It is furnished elegantly , but without ostentation , everything indicating a woman of taste . Mantel at R. A small sofa above it near C. , and an arm-chair on either side of it . A small screen near by . Door below mantel , leading to an inner room . Door on L. , also . A desk or writing-table below this door . A piano , C. , on which is a painting or portrait . The sofa is in front of this . Large double door at C. , as general entrance , opening on a richly furnished hall . Day window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As the curtain rises , VENETIA is playing on the piano , and RENA is at the fire , in an arm-chair , reading . A bell is heard , at which RENA jumps up and runs to window . Rena . Oh , there they come at last  --  Aunt Venie , all our purchases ! TIBBETTS , an old servant , appears at C. , loaded with parcels . RENA runs to take them from , him . Bring them right in , Tibbetts ! He empties his arms on the table , near the fireplace ; she separates the packages , reloading him . This little box belongs to Aunt Venetia . All the rest are mine . Oh , I tell you , Tibbetts , we 've bought everything pretty I could find . There 's nothing left in the shops for anybody else . Would you mind taking mine to my room ? Thank you . Tib . Tibbetts To VENETIA . Shall I take this too , ma'am ? Ven . Venetia Yes . Did anyone call while we were out ? Tib . Tibbetts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . Ven . Venetia Very well ; fetch them to me . TIBBETTS exits , L. 1 E. Rena . Sits C. There 's one thing . Aunt Venie , that puzzles me about the people we 've been calling on lately . Why is it that none of them has returned our call ? It looks like downright rudeness . Ven . Venetia L. It may be worse  --  an intentional slight . Rena . But what have I done to them ? Ven . Venetia You ? Nothing ! But I  --  they do n't seem to be able to forgive me for marrying your uncle . Rena . C. Rises . And you think they intend to  --  Ven . Venetia Cut me ? Oh , yes ! I 'm afraid you 'll be terribly lonely here . Tib . Tibbetts Re-entering L. 1 E. , with letters . Here are the letters , ma'am . Hands them to her . Ven . Venetia Thank you . Goes to fireplace , R. , to open and read them . Rena . Rises . Aside to TIBBETTS , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Tibbetts , has Mr. Candid been here ? Tib . Tibbetts C. Aside . Yes , miss . Rena . C. Why on earth did n't you tell me before ? Tib . Tibbetts I thought , perhaps , I had better wait till you were alone , miss . Rena . Tibbetts , you 're an angel ! Would you like a cream-drop ? Tib . Tibbetts Oh , miss ! Rena . Yes , yes ; take one . Forces candy into his mouth . They 're ever so good . Tell me , Tibbetts , what did Mr. Candid say ? Tib . Tibbetts Munching the candy . He asked me to tell you particularly that he was here , and that his sister would call this afternoon . Rena . Oh , thank you , Tibbetts . That 's just what I wanted to know . Take another candy . Tastes it herself , puts it into his mouth . Are n't they nice ? Here , take the whole box ! Forces them upon him . Ven . Venetia At desk . Oh , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Runs to VENETIA . What is it , Venie ? TIBBETTS exits , eating more candy . Ven . Venetia A letter from the old place ; from the gardener 's wife . Four long pages , full of news . Rena . Taking from VENETIA 'S hand a photo , which was enclosed in the letter . And who is this ? Ven . Venetia Why , that is little Pearl . Do n't you remember the little girl who used to tumble about the garden ? Rena . That 's so ! The little rogue ! How she 's grown ! Ven . Venetia Has n't she ? Kissing photo . Rena . There 's something on the back . Ven . Venetia So there is . In her own writing , too . Look at the big letters . Reads : " To my dear Aunt Venie , with kisses . Your little Pearl . " Rena . Going , C. Little has only one t , and a big blot over it . Ca n't you see her little hand trying to write , and dropping that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ven . Venetia The precious little hand ! Do you remember what I told you about those little hands ? What a part they played in my destiny ? Rena . And how they decided the fate of your whole life ! And do you remember how I cried when you told me ? C. Oh , I do so love a cry in bed  --  Sits , C.  --  just before going to sleep , especially if you have some cake . Did you ever eat things in bed , under the sheet , aunt ? We girls all did . But the crumbs are distracting to sleep on , and you dare n't get up to shake yourself . Ven .

Venetia Reflectively . I wonder what you find in the gentleman . Rena . Rises , down C. Well , when a girl has only just come out of school , she has to make the most of anybody to begin with . Ven . Venetia But Ned Candid is so uninteresting ! Rena . Uninteresting ? Why , Aunt Venetia , he 's got such a nice face  --  as if he was never worried by a thought  --  and such a pleasant smile when he enters a room , as if he brought a bit of sunshine for everybody with him !

Doublepenny I hope you 'll excuse my running here , Mrs. Primrose , but I ca n't help it . I wo n't say it is n't my fault , but I ca n't help it , and you 'll see I ca n't . Ven . Venetia Pray tell me how I can be of service to you . Indicating a chair . She sits , and he is about to , when he sees RENA . Doub . Doublepenny Oh , Miss Primrose , I 'm blamed glad to see you , too . It 's a piece of luck to find you here . Real dandy luck ! It 's a regular snap ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Doub . Doublepenny Yes . Did n't you know ? No , of course . But I seen you the day you came home  --  just as you was getting out of your cab . It was only a glimpse  --  cause why  --  I cut and run , but I could n't forget you , never ! Rena . Not certain that she ought to feel amused . Indeed ! Doub . Doublepenny I know your father first-rate . Sits , C. Rena . Sits on sofa , interested . Yes . I 've heard your name mentioned frequently , at home . Doub . Doublepenny I should think so . To VENETIA . You see , I bought their house , and  --  Ven . Venetia Quickly interrupting . Yes , yes ; I know . But may I ask , what procures me this pleasure ? Doub . Doublepenny Oh , yes . Well  --  it 's a tender subject . That part of it is my fault . I own up  --  it 's all my fault . I 'm honest about that . Ven . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doub . Doublepenny Well , to come right down to the point , you see my former business used to be making hairpins . Ven . Venetia But has this got anything to do with  --  Doub . Doublepenny My present business ? Oh , yes . That explains it . You know of all the kinds of pins ever made , a hairpin is about the dullest Whether makin ' ' em makes a man precious dull himself , or blunt , I do n't know ; but I happened to repeat before a lot of fellows at the club some pretty foolish remarks that I heard from people that claimed to know you , and know all the facts . Ven . Venetia Contemptuously . Oh , remarks about me ! Doub . Doublepenny Yes , that 's the size of it . And I 'm downright ashamed of what I said . But you do n't need to reproach me for it . Somebody else took it upon the spot , and as I thought I was spoilin ' for a fight , it grew pretty serious for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see the ears of a pretty large-sized jackass sticking out of the affair , and recognized ' em as mine . Then I apologizes , but the gentleman insisted on my making the amend-on-a-rab  --  ( Amende honorable. )  --  to you . I did n't know at first what the amend-on-a-rab was , but I found out it meant I was to call on you and beg your pardon  --  and here I am , and I beg your pardon . Ven . Venetia Oh , indeed ! Well , if you set so much value upon it , I forgive you with all my heart . Doub . Doublepenny Well , that 's splendid ! Rising . By jingo , I think the amend-on-a-rab is a big institution ! Down C. Ven . Venetia Recollecting . But you sent word that a human life was at stake ? Doub . Doublepenny Up C. So there was . Mine , you know . He threatened to end my existence pretty short unless I made the amend-on-a-rab , and I guess he 'd a done it , or I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Venetia Oh , that 's it . Doub . Doublepenny It was blamed awkward for me , do n't you see  --  now that I 'm just strikin ' out in society . Sold out the hairpin business  --  turned it over to a trust  --  with stock a jumpin ' every minute . We 're quoted at 158 now . A man would be a fool to stand out , under them circumstances , about a little amend-on-a-rab . Rena . Watching her aunt . Who was the other  --  the somebody else who  --  who  --  Doub . Doublepenny Who stood up for Mrs. Primrose like a brick ? Did n't I tell you ? Why , it was Mr. Guthrie . Ven . Venetia Rises . John Guthrie ? Doub . Doublepenny Yes , the lawyer . Ven . Venetia He defended me ? He called you to account for repeating slanders against me ? RENA goes up and over , L. Doub . Doublepenny Did he ? Well , you oughter heard him . I never saw a man so mad in all my life . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alarmed on his account any more . Ven . Venetia Who has gone aside in deep agitation , now returns to him , and in a light tone , as if to hide her emotion . You do n't know how grateful I am to you for all the hard things you said against me . I hope I shall see you again . You must come to see us often . You 've made me very happy . Crosses to RENA . Rena , darling , I 'm so happy , I ca n't find words to tell you how glad I am ; and I dare not tell you why ! No  --  Crosses , L.  --  I dare not ! Exits , L. 1 E. Rena . Looking after her . Oh , you dare not tell me . Well , I 'm not a hairpin , and I think I can guess . So he 's the man ! Doub . Doublepenny Well , ai n't I in luck ? A minute ago I was standing on the ragged edge , expecting to be fired out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm a friend of the family . And we 're friends too  --  you and me  --  ai n't we , miss ? Rena . Certainly . And what 's more , I 've been really anxious to make your acquaintance . So you 're the person to whom papa gave up our house , and everything in it ? Doub . Doublepenny With conviction . That was another piece of blamed luck . Rena . How do you like our house ? Doub . Doublepenny Well , at first , I felt rather queer . Felt as though the things and me did n't quite match . So much Rocoky and Rennysans ( Rococo and Renaissance ) . Though one of the fellows at the club got off a good thing . He said , " It 's only a mixture of styles , Penny , old boy . They 're Rennysans , and you 're Gothic . " But blamed if I know the difference . Rena . Amused . Do n't you ? Doub . Doublepenny Of course I could n't get the hang of all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father oughter left a catalogue . But I managed that fine . I hired your man . Rena . What , Tom ? Doub . Doublepenny He 's a dandy , I tell you . When the fellows dine with me and want to know about the pictures and stuff , I just ring for Tom , and he talks ' em blind about the Satsumas , and Ko-rows , and Dauby-knees ( Corots and Daubignys ) , and all that . Up stage . I 'm picking up a little myself , by just listening . Rena . And so you feel quite at home now ? Sits , C. Doub . Doublepenny Hesitating , and eying her , L. of her . Well , there 's one thing missing . I wish I could make a confidant of you . Can I ? Rena . Oh , yes , do . I like to hear you talk . Doub . Doublepenny Do you ? Sits L. of her .

Now , there 's an empty chair there  --  see ? And if I go over there  --  Goes to other chair  --  the other one 's empty ! Can you make that out ? Rena . Laughing . Perfectly . You want a wife ! Doub . Doublepenny Rises and goes toward her . That 's it ! I do want a wife ! Rena . Then why do n't you marry ? There are lots of girls , and some very easily pleased . Rises . Doub . Doublepenny Ah ! but I 'm not easily pleased . My wife must be pretty  --  like you . Rena . Oh , now you 're making fun of me . Doub . Doublepenny No I 'm not  --  ' pon my word , I 'm not . And she must be elegant  --  like you ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doublepenny Yes . I mean , no ! Crosses , L. She must know more than I do . Suddenly drops on his knees . Oh , Miss Rena  --  if you only would  --  Rena . Firmly , but not unkindly . Get up ! Get up , instantly ! If you do n't , I 'll go away . He gets up . That 's right ! Crosses , L. Now , what were you saying ? Doub . Doublepenny It 's an awful bold thought , I know ; but I 've just admired you every waking minute since I saw you getting out of that cab . Of course , I know it 's blamed hard to get a girl to take the name of Doublepenny , but you could put on your cards , " nee Primrose . " Do think of the idea , wo n't you , and oblige me by making me the happiest of men . Rena . Well , I would like to oblige you in any little way , Mr. Doublepenny , but I could n't do that . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , maybe you 'll think it over . A rich son-in-law would be just the thing for your father in his present circumstances . Rena . Amazed . His present circumstances ? Doub . Doublepenny I do n't mean immediate necessities , of course . They 're provided for . But there 's his debts . Rena . Hardly comprehending . Poor papa ! In debt ? Sits , C. Doub . Doublepenny Over head and ears ! Drowned ! Gone to the bottom like a sinker ! Rena . Quickly . And is that why he gave up his house ? Why he sold everything to you ? Doub . Doublepenny That 's about the size of it Did n't he tell you ? But Lor , selling his house wo n't pay ten cents on the dollar  --  and the creditors are coming down on him like a thousand o ' brick ! Rena . Rises ; goes , L. A thousand bricks on papa ? Doub . Doublepenny Yes , like a thousand o ' brick ! He owes about a hundred and twenty-five thousand , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wringing her hands . Oh , dear  --  oh , dear ! Going to execute papa ! Doub . Doublepenny Half kneels in chair .

I 'm awful sorry our conversation took such a painful turn . But you know you 've only got to say a word and I 'll rush right here , ready to sacrifice everything for you . RENA shakes her head . No ! Well , I wo n't insist any longer  --  now . Good-by . But remember  --  only a word , and I 'll come . Ring me up on the telephone , if you like . Good-by ! Exits , L. C. Rena . Sinks on sofa . And I never knew a word of it  --  never suspected , never noticed anything ! Poor little fool ! And I worried him with my silly demands , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stab that must have given him ! Poor papa ! To think of him , so spoiled and so generous in such an awful scrape  --  Rises.  --  while that dreadful creature is quoted at 158 ! It 's a shame !

Tibbetts C. No , miss . But I can find him through the telephone . Rena . R. Quickly . Oh , then please do , Tibbetts ; and tell him I want to see him immediately . If he 's not at his office , find out where he lives , and ask him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Tibbetts ! perhaps you had better go for him and bring him with you . Tib . Tibbetts Yes , miss . I 'll have him here if anything can reach him . Exits , L. C. Rena . He 'll help me ! Oh , he 'll help me ! I know the way to make him . If I only whisper Aunt Venetia 's name , and just give him a little tiny hint of the happiness in store for him , he 'll do anything ! And I 'll make Aunt Venie happy , too  --  and everybody ! Suddenly . And yet  --  I 'm so miserable myself ! Sits , L. C. NED enters , L. C. , beaming , and full of hope . Ned . Here I am , Miss Rena . Hands her a bunch of roses .

No  --  I 'm in dead earnest . Ned . Sits beside her . Can I be of any assistance ? Rena . You ? Oh , no ! Turns away sadly  --  then suddenly turns again . Stop ! I 'm going to ask you a dreadfully serious question . Have you got anything of your own ? Ned . You mean money ? Rena . Impatiently . Do please tell me . I must know it . Ned . Doubtfully . Well , of course , I ought to have something . But I 've spent such a deuced lot ever since I had the use of it . But there 's enough left to build a comfortable little nest . Rena . That 's not the point  --  I must know exactly how much you 've got . Ned . Wonderingly . Oh ! well , if you must know . Well , I guess if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sell everything . Ned .

Business of tracing a dash beneath both figures . Naught from naught 's naught . Naught and carry naught ; naught , naught . Five from naught five  --  15,000 dollars .

If you had n't spent such a lot ! I guess the best thing for you to do is to go to Sandy Hook , after all . Ned . Go to Sandy Hook ? Rises and goes to her . Rena . Struggling with her tears . I mean go abroad , and you can telegraph from Sandy Hook . Ned . But why ? Rena . Crosses , R. And do n't ever come back again . Never ! Not even after I 'm married ! Ned . Married ? You do n't mean to say that you 're going to get married ? Rena . I must ! Ned . But to whom ? Rena . I do n't know yet . Somebody very wealthy . Do you think I could leave papa in misery , when it 's in my power to help him ? Ned . And is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love ? Ned . Your love for me . Rena . Mr. Candid ! Ned .

Only I had n't the courage before . But to-day , I had made up my mind  --  and planned just how to do it . Rena . Interested . Indeed ! And how would you have done it ? Ned . Sighs . But it 's all over now . Takes stage , R. , a few steps . Rena . Sadly . Anyway  --  you might tell me ! Ned . Well , you see , the hardest thing was to find the words . So after awhile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk . I must make myself understood in some other way . That 's why I got those roses . I thought you 'd accept them , and say " Thank you , " and then give me your hand . Rena . Offers her hand . Of course . Ned . Then I 'd take it very softly , and hold it , and then kiss it that way  --  Raises her hand to his lips.  --  and then I 'd wait to see if you 'd draw it away ; then I 'd press it and see if the pressure was returned  --  just as it is now . Rena . Well , and what then ? Ned . Then , of course , I 'd have been encouraged  --  Illustrates as he speaks  --  and quite unconsciously I would have put my arm around your waist , so you could n't get away , and then I would have drawn you closer to me , like this , and with the other hand I would have raised your darling head and looked into your lovely eyes , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a kiss  --  Kisses her.  --  like that ! That 's how I 'd have done it . Rena . Without moving away , very sadly . Yes . That would have been a good way . But it wo n't do now . Ned . No , it wo n't do now . Kisses her , sighs , and RENA sighs after him . Rena . Disengaging herself . The stars have decided differently . Do n't make the parting too hard for me . Good-by ! Holds his hand behind her . Ned .

It seems some speculating attorney has formed a syndicate of my creditors , and they 've combined to swoop on me . Ven . Venetia What do you propose to do ? Prim . Primrose There 's only one practical way out of it . I 'll take the next steamer to Havre , then the express to Monte Carlo . That 's my only chance . Ven . Venetia Nonsense !

You act like a boy out of school  --  and as for your heart , I believe it 's quite undeveloped , even yet . Sits , C. Now , what do you say to marrying again ?  --  for money , of course . Prim . Primrose Marrying again ? Thanks  --  not any . Ven . Venetia Why not ? Prim . Primrose I have n't the slightest talent for domestic bliss . Besides , I wo n't marry for money , and I ca n't marry for love . Ven . Venetia You undervalue your attractions . Prim . Primrose Warming up to the idea . Do I ? See here . You 're a woman of good taste  --  do you really think anyone  --  Suddenly.  --  could you imagine yourself , for instance . Sits , C. Ven . Venetia Laughing . I ? Aside . What an idea ! Prim . Primrose But do n't you  --  yourself  --  really think of  --  of  --  Ven . Venetia Of what ? Prim . Primrose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell the truth  --  Rises.  --  I 've been thinking a great deal about it for the last half hour  --  and for the first time in years . But to return to yourself  --  in sober earnest , I should really like to see you redeem yourself , and know that a woman did it . For Rena 's sake , and for your own sake . Think it over  --  seriously . Shaking his hand , exits , R. C. Prim . Primrose Looking at his hand , then opening and shutting his palm . Now , in the light of my vast experience , what kind of a squeeze was that ? It was no ordinary grip ! Going , L. It was a more fatal variety . One thing is certain , she is bent on marrying me off . Sits , L. Now , is she only preparing the way for somebody else  --  or is she manoeuvring for herself ? But why hit on me ? There are lots of men she could have ! Struck by an idea , looks at himself , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Rises , and bows in the direction of her exit . Madam , accept the assurance of my profoundest admiration ! It was a master-stroke ! Tibbetts . Ushering in GUTHRIE . I 'll tell my young lady at once , sir . Guth . Guthrie Yes , do , please . TIBBETTS exits , down C. ; sees PRIMROSE . You here ? Prim . Primrose Yes . Surprise you ? Guth . Guthrie Why , rather , since you took such pains to explain that you never called  --  Prim . Primrose Except with the greatest reluctance . I told you I had to come sometimes , because Rena is here , and merely to save appearances . Well , I confess , that was all humbug  --  to conceal the fact that I 've struck my flag . Guth . Guthrie Sits , C. Struck your flag ? Prim . Primrose Yes . Gone over to the enemy . Yes , sir ; I 'm here all the time now , and like it My fair sister-in-law is fairly spoiling me . I come early  --  go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days , perhaps , I sha' n't go away at all . Slapping him on the back . Guth . Guthrie That 's impossible  --  unless  --  Prim . Primrose Crosses L. , pokes him . Unless I were the master of the house  --  eh ? Well ? Guth . Guthrie What ! Do you really propose to  --  ? Prim . Primrose To propose ? With sundry nods and winks . As a matter-of-fact , the first proposal  --  if I may call it so  --  came from the lady herself . Guth . Guthrie From Venetia Primrose ? Prim . Primrose Yes . And if you look at the matter closely , it 's a mighty shrewd scheme on her part . It would give her the position in society she needs . On my arm  --  every door would fly open ? You see the combination ? Guth . Guthrie Down R. Oh ! plainly ! A few steps forward . So that was her scheme ! That is what all her liberality to this old imbecile meant ! Prim . Primrose What 's the matter ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprise . But I shall get used to it . Prim . Primrose Taking up his hat . To be sure you will . When you come to think , it 's quite natural , too . Of course I 'm no chicken , but I do n't look half my age ; she just told me so . I act like a boy out of school ; and as for my heart , egad ! I believe it 's actually undeveloped yet , in spite of it 's vast and varied experiences ! Bye-bye , old fellow , bye-bye ! Exits , L , C. , singing an air from the " Mikado . " Guth . Guthrie After departure of PRIMROSE , remains silent a moment , then rouses himself . What a fool I have been ! What a fool ! Sinks in a chair , C. , playing with his hat , and looking on the floor . To give my heart even in fancy to a woman who could spurn it twice for a marriage of speculation ! First , with physical decay , and now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about to go , when he is confronted with RENA , who has stolen in to watch her retreating father , and now faces him . Rena . Down L. C. You are not going away ? Guth . Guthrie R. C. I beg your pardon ! I almost forgot I am at your service . Rena . Oh , Mr. Guthrie , I 'm in such trouble ! It 's about papa ! Can nothing be done for him ? Guth . Guthrie Why , there 's not the slightest ground for alarm . Rena . But his creditors are coming down on him like a  --  bricks , are n't they ? Guth . Guthrie It 's nothing . Creditors always do that . Rena . But wo n't he perish in prison ? Guth . Guthrie Takes her hand . I pledge you my word that he sha' n't see even the outside of a prison . Rena . Then what can they do ? Guth . Guthrie It 's in their power to do various legal things with hard names , but a little patience will pull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from that . We must devise something . Guth . Guthrie I assure you I have been thinking , night and day . Rena . And I 'll think night and day , for I 'm sure I sha' n't sleep a wink . Will you protect him till I can think out a way to save him ? Guth . Guthrie Smiling . Rely upon me . He shall slumber undisturbed while we lie awake plotting his rescue . Rena . Oh , thank you , Mr. Guthrie . Gives both hands . You are such a comfort . With meaning . Now I know why Aunt Venetia thinks so much of you . He draws back reserved . Do n't you know she does ? Guth . Guthrie I can not allow you to talk in this way . If you have been made the confidant of  --  of  --  any person  --  Rena . Severely . Of any person ! There is only one person , and I begin to think that person is very much deceived in you . Guth . Guthrie In low tone , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel  --  not what you have been prompted by another to say . Rena . Prompted by another ? Guth . Guthrie Pardon the word . But you do not seem to be aware of the lady 's latest matrimonial project . Rena . Her latest ? What do you mean ? Guth . Guthrie If I refer to it  --  it 's only to let you understand how awkward all that you have said sounds to me . Sits , C. Rena . Her latest project ? It 's only this moment she heard how you had defended her  --  and you ought to have seen how happy she was . She could n't tell it in words  --  but you could have read it in her face . And now  --  GUTHRIE crosses , R. Quickly and imperiously.  --  what project do you mean ? She gets above him . What is her latest project ? VENETIA appears at the back as if she had been listening . Guth . Guthrie Bitterly . Oh , simply the development of her natural instinct for getting on in the world . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innocence for money ; now she barters her truth and womanhood for the miserable satisfaction of crossing the thresholds from which her first crime had barred her . But why do I waste a thought upon that woman who lost every title to respect when she sold herself . Rena . Sold herself ? Guth . Guthrie For money ! To the dotard she called her husband ! There may be some other name which women , who become hucksters of their youth and beauty , give the transaction  --  we know what the world calls it . Ven . Venetia Advancing with suppressed indignation . I understand you now ! Rena . Aunt Venie ! Guth . Guthrie You have heard ? Ven . Venetia Advancing . Everything , and I now know what you have thought  --  what you have believed of me . And the time has come when you shall know the truth . Guth . Guthrie What truth ? Ven . Venetia Goes to piano , and takes up child 's picture from it . Look at this little face . You knew her  --  our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house  --  an orphan and lonely  --  this was my constant companion in her rambles through the woody lanes , and by the waterfall that filled the deep pool hid by the willows . It was in this place we were one day playing at hide and seek . I left my tiny playmate on one side the bank and stole around to hide in the bushes below the other . When I called : " Now come "  --  there was no answer . Again I called  --  and all was silent . It was not fear  --  Rises.  --  it was a sudden feeling like awe that made me part the bushes and look out . As I did so , a peal of childish laughter seemed to come from the air above . I looked  --  and there , upon a hollow trunk , decayed and slippery , that crossed the pool , stood the baby ; and now as she saw me  --  clapped her little hands and took another step . She was just above the waterfall ! She could not go back without turning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cry . Quickly . I tried to encourage her with a smile and cheering words . Bending forward and stretching her hands as if to the child . Do n't cry , darling !  --  do n't cry ! Ca n't you come to me ! Yes ! Try , try , my darling ! Do n't look down  --  look at me . As if encouraging . So  --  that 's right  --  only a few more steps . With sudden terror . Oh , take care , it 's slippery ! Oh , darling , do n't fall  --  do n't . With a sudden scream . My God ! she 's gone ! RENA has sunk upon her knees , and covers her face with her hands . VENETIA turns aside for a moment . GUTHRIE tries to quiet her by a touch . She recovers instantly and half repulses him as she continues . With a shriek , I was about to throw myself headlong into the pool , when a hand held me back and an old man plunged in after the child . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though weak and feeble from a long and wasting illness . It seemed an age before I saw him rise again with the child safe and smiling . Then , from the over-excitement , I fainted . When I recovered , it was in the house  --  but all was strangely hushed and silent . The child  --  it was well . In a low tone . But another life was in peril  --  one of the bravest and noblest that ever lived . Guth . Guthrie Yes . Ven . Venetia I begged them to let me nurse and care for him . For many , many weeks I watched by his bed  --  and brought him back to life ; and at last I was able to help him walk again into the sunlight . Guth . Guthrie They wrote me so . Ven . Venetia On that day I fell upon my knees to him and asked his forgiveness for the fault and folly that had brought him to this ; said to him that my life was his for having saved me the eternal remorse that child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said he , " if that be so , give me the life , which you say is mine . I have not long to live , but the days will be happier and brighter if lived with you . " With emotion . What , then , was left me but to sacrifice my own dreams of happiness  --  of hope ! GUTHRIE sits . I owed a debt . I must pay this debt ! Indignantly . And for paying it with the sacrifice of every dream of happiness , of every hope  --  I get the world 's contempt , and yours ! Guth . Guthrie But I did not know  --  Ven . Venetia If you loved as I did , you would have known ! Guth . Guthrie Rises . But I do love . She crosses him with a gesture of contempt . Venetia , hear me ! Ven . Venetia I have heard you . I know what you thought of me . That you despised me ! Rena . Anxiously . No  --  no  --  he did not ! Ven . Venetia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel the weight of your own injustice , even for an hour ! Crosses , L. Guth . Guthrie Venetia , I beg of you ! Rena , plead for me ! Rena . Venie ! Ven . Venetia It is useless ! We shall meet no more ! Hurries out , L. 1 E. Guth . Guthrie All is over . Sits , C. Rena . No  --  no ! Nothing is over  --  if you love her . Do you ? Guth . Guthrie Yes , yes ! Rena . Then do n't give up ! Wait  --  suffer  --  let her hate you  --  let her have her way  --  but do n't give up ! It may take months  --  it may take years . But , if you love her  --  if you want her  --  she will be yours ! But do n't give up ! Will you promise ? Guth . Guthrie I promise . Will you help me ? Rena . I will . Guth . Guthrie What shall I do ? Rena . Do ? Never leave her ! Wear out her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wear out first ! Come here to-morrow  --  come the next day  --  come all the time ; but do n't give up ! Guth . Guthrie But if she wo n't see me ? Rena . Ask for me ! I 'll see you . I 'm going to perform a girl 's manifest destiny and make two people happy  --  even if I 'm not one of ' em . Will you come ? Guth . Guthrie I will ! I 'll wait ! And I wo n't give up ! Rena . No  --  no ! Never give up ! CURTAIN . ACT IV . The same scene . Evening . The chandelier lighted . Lamp lighted on the piano , at which RENA is discovered playing the air of an old ballad . The fire is burning brightly . TIBBETTS enters with a large cluster of cut flowers . Rena . Oh , Tibbetts ! What lovely flowers ! Are they for me ? Tib . Tibbetts No  --  miss . They are for your aunt  --  from your papa . Crosses , R. , to mantel-piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tib . Tibbetts Yes , miss . Rena . Down L. C. And yesterday he sent her a lovely bunch of violets . What 's coming over him ? And how extravagant ! Stops playing . Oh , Tibbetts  --  did you give Mr. Doublepenny my letter ? Tib . Tibbetts Yes , miss . Into his own hands . He read it right off . Rena . Did he , Tibbetts ? Brings him down . How did he look when he had finished it ? Tib . Tibbetts Ah , Miss Rena , it must have had good news . He fairly sparkled with joy ! Shook hands with me  --  shook both hands  --  over and over again , and said : " Thank you  --  thank you "  --  oh , so many times ,  --  and when I was going , he came running after me , and forced something into my hand . It was a five-dollar bill . Just think of it , miss . Five dollars ! He must be mighty rich  --  is n't he ? Rena . Oh , yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walks away , Well , it 's settled . I ca n't back out now . Sighs . Tib . Tibbetts Why , what 's the matter , Miss Rena ? Why do you look so sad ? And sigh so ? Rena . Do I , Tibbetts ! Oh , I must n't . And I wo n't sigh any more . Why should I ? I 'm sure I feel quite happy and contented  --  as a person ought to feel , you know , who has done something good , and noble , and generous  --  though it was hard . I ca n't tell you about it now , Tibbetts  --  but I will some time , when I 'm an old , old woman . Tib . Tibbetts If you wait for that , Miss Rena , I 'm afraid I sha' n't be here to hear it . Feeling his white hair . Rena . Brushing his hair with her hands . That 's true , dear old Tibbetts ! Never mind  --  I 'll tell my grand-children ! VENETIA enters , L. 1 E. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Venie , the lovely flowers papa has sent you . TIBBETTS hands them to VENETIA , and she goes to table , near fireplace , and places them in a vase . TIBBETTS exits , L. C. Ven . Venetia Crossing , R. , as she takes flowers . They are lovely ! Rena . C. I ca n't tell you how glad I am that you two are reconciled . But now there 's a cloud of grief to break up all that sunshine . I noticed how sadly you wandered about the house , all yesterday . VENETIA makes a gesture  --  and sinks into chair , R. , gazing at the flowers , and playing with one . No , I wo n't say anything more . Aside . If he 'd only come ! But he 's such a faint-hearted creature ! I suppose his courage all melted away as soon as I let him go . TIBBETTS returns and comes down to RENA . Tib . Tibbetts Whispers . Miss Rena . Rena . What is it , Tibbetts ? Tib . Tibbetts Same . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low tone . Is he ? Tib . Tibbetts Yes ; and he wishes to speak to you . He says it 's most urgent . Rena . Of course it is . Tib . Tibbetts C. Still whispering . But he does n't want Mrs. Primrose to know he 's here . So he asks when he may see you . Rena . When ? This minute . Show him right in . Tib . Tibbetts Pointing to VENETIA But  --  Rena . Crosses , R. Tell him I 'm alone . You understand ! TIBBETTS goes out , shaking his head . If I could only succeed ! Goes to fireplace . Venie , dear , will you do me a favor ? There 's somebody coming who wants to speak to me , alone . He has something important to tell me . I ca n't explain why ; but I would like you to hear what he has to say . Ven . Venetia Wiping her eyes . I can hardly receive anyone now , dear . Rises . Rena . You need n't . All you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are . Moves screen down , hiding sofa , or seat . There ! Now you ca n't be seen . Ven . Venetia About to rise . But , Rena  --  No , no ! Rena . Whispering , over screen . Sh !  --  here he is ! VENETIA sinks back in seat , as GUTHRIE enters , quickly and excitedly . Guth . Guthrie Thank you , Miss Rena , for giving me a few minutes . Since yesterday , I 've suffered such agonies of self-reproach . I ca n't go away , and I ca n't sit calmly and wait for this burden to be lifted from me . You must help me ! Rena . R. C. Impressively . There is no help for you , but the soothing influence of time ! Aside . I got that from a book . Guth . Guthrie I can not wait for time to undo the wrong that I have inflicted , and yet  --  there seems no atonement . The words I spoke , no woman can forget . But she shall know my shame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell her , for fear she should n't know . Guth . Guthrie Yes ; you must tell her . She loves and trusts you . She would never listen to me . Rena . Stealing a glance in direction of screen . Well , I do n't know . She is kindness itself ! Guth . Guthrie She is everything that is good ! She is an angel of help and sacrifice ! She is a martyr of calumny and oppression ! And I , who pride myself upon justice , I have not alone consented to her suffering ; I have cast the stone that struck the most cruel blow ! Rena . Yes ; you have ! And I never could understand why ! Guth . Guthrie Sits . No ; because you know nothing of love ! What do you know of a man 's heart  --  of its passions , and its rage ! What do you know of that jealousy which maddens ! I felt it when I saw the woman I had sought all my life , with whom I had pictured all my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiled upon me  --  returned the pressure of my hand , when I saw her about to give herself to another ! Rena . Oh , yes ; you said something about her designs . What did you mean by that ? VENETIA 'S curiosity is aroused . Guth . Guthrie It is useless to speak of that . I loved her ! I love her now , when she is lost to me forever ! I do not plead for the happiness I threw away ! I only beg the charity of her forgiveness ! Now , do you understand ? Rena . Glancing impatiently toward the screen , and tapping her foot . No ; I do not understand ! Guth . Guthrie But I have made it clear  --  Rena . Oh , do n't talk to me ! Do you suppose I 'm such a baby as to be touched by all this ? No ! I 'm simply furious that you , a lawyer , whose business it is to plead for criminals , and win their case , and set robbers , and everybody that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and put yourself in the dock , and accuse yourself  --  and try yourself  --  and ca n't even defend yourself , and get yourself convicted , and sentenced , and transported !  --  when , if you only had the sense and courage to run to the woman you love , and throw yourself at her feet , and talk to her as you talk to me  --  Turns suddenly in direction of the screen . And I 'm furious with you , too ! Slapping the screen with the flat of her hand . Yes ; I am ! You call yourself gentle and fair , and loving and kind , and there you sit and listen to a poor fellow pleading for his life in a way that would move a stone , and you do n't stir ! How long are you going to stay behind there , anyway ? Guth . Guthrie Amazed . To whom are you speaking ? Rena . To whom ? Man alive , ca n't you guess ? Draws screen aside . See here ! Guth . Guthrie L. C. Venetia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rena ! You 're a  --  you 're a  --  darling little angel ! Turns RENA R. PFRESH enters , C. Pfresh . I beg your pardon , Mrs. Primrose , for being late . Looks from one to the other . I am perhaps come at a wrong moment . You look disturbed ! And Miss Rena , she looks disturbed ; and Mr. Guthrie , he looks most disturbed as anybody ! No ? What has happened ? Ven . Venetia The fact is , Mr. Pfresh , you do find us rather flurried . This gentleman has made some very startling communications to us . Rena . Yes ; only fancy , somebody has come to life suddenly ! Pfresh . You do n't say ? I never beliefed as dat could be . Rena . Crosses to GUTHRIE . Oh , that is a fact . Is n't it , Mr. Guthrie ? Guth . Guthrie Kissing her hand . Yes . And you performed the miracle ! Ven . Venetia To GUTHRIE . But you have n't finished telling us everything you wished to say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand . If there is something more , come and dine with us , and perhaps , after dinner  --  Crosses , R. Guth . Guthrie How can I thank you ? Rena . L. Taking his arm . Now , you must hurry home . You have lots of packing to do , you know . Pushing him off . Guth . Guthrie Packing ? For what ? Rena . Rallying him . For Japan ! Then , softly . No !  --  no ! You 'll never leave now . Goes up . And I 'll tell you  --  Taking him up , and aside to him.  --  do n't wait till dinner-time . PFRESH crosses , L. You 've induced the Fortress to treat ; stay till you get a fun surrender . I 'll manage it ! They go off together , L. C. Pfresh . Looking after them . Ah , dere is sometings going on dere . So ? Ven . Venetia R. C. Calmly . Well , have you arranged everything about those old debts of my brother-in-law ? Pfresh . Ach , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected . There is difficulties in the way which Mr. Primrose must help us with . Ven . Venetia Well , then  --  see him . But of course he must n't know that you are acting for me . Pfresh . Oh , certainly not . Ven . Venetia And settle the matter as quickly as possible . I would like to spare him and my niece as much annoyance as I can . Crosses , L. Prim . Primrose Heard outside . Never mind announcing me , Tibbetts ; I 'll go right in . Ven . Venetia There he is now . You can talk to him at once . I 'll leave you together . PRIMROSE enters . How fortunate ! Mr. Pfresh says he wants to see you  --  I believe , on a matter of business , so I suppose I shall be in the way . Many thanks for the nice flowers . That was a charming attention . I quite appreciate it . Exits L. 1 E. Pfresh . As PRIMROSE gazes after VENETIA in ecstacy . I haf a little surprise for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off , and rubbing his hands . A surprise , eh ? Well , out with it . Pfresh . You were aware , berhaps , that your creditors have all put deir glaims togedder in the hands of a lawyer . Prim . Primrose Chopfallen . Yes . That shyster , Hornbellow , I know . I got a letter from him . Crosses , R. Pfresh . Yes ? Vell , brebare yourself for the surbrise . A friend of mine has given me de order to buy up all dose glaims . Prim . Primrose Amazed . What ? Somebody wants to buy up my notes ? Who is the lunatic ? Pfresh . I am not authorized to gif de name . My friend vishes to remain unknown . Prim . Primrose Oh , an anonymous benefactor . Then there is really such a being . I always supposed him a creature of fiction , having his origin in the " Arabian Nights . " Pfresh . Knowingly . May be dere iss more of a speculador dan a benefactor aboud him . Prim . Primrose Incredulously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a smard biece of pisiness . He probably expects to buy up your debts cheap , and den wait for you to pay dem in full . Prim . Primrose Then he 'll probably wait a long time . Well , what does Hornbellow say ? Pfresh . At de first , Hornbellow was all right . He said he would submit an offer of thirty per cent to his clients . Prim . Primrose What ! Thirty per cent for my notes ! It 's a regular insult ! Altogether too cheap ! Crosses , R. Pfresh . Oh , it 's cheap , certainly . But when you consider that there is no prospect of realizing anyding in de near future  --  Prim . Primrose That 's so ; it would n't do for a man in a hurry . It takes wind . Pfresh . So , of course , I tried to beat Hornbellow down . Prim . Primrose Beat him down from thirty ? Oh , come ! Pfresh . But when I called yesterday  --  would you belief it  --  de rascal had jumped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right , for trying to " bear " my securities ! Pfresh . Dot 's vot vos de matter ; for dis morning he vould n't sell even at dat brice . Prim . Primrose Then what the deuce is he going to do with them ? Pfresh . I do n't know . Prim . Primrose Perhaps the fellow has a mania for collecting . Perhaps he 's an autograph fiend ! But even then , my notes could hardly be considered objects of rarity . Crosses , L. Pfresh . He bretends dat dere is odder parties after de paper . Prim . Primrose That was only a dodge to run up the price . Pfresh . No , no ! Dey vas bona fide purchasers . Prim . Primrose For my notes ? Gad ! This is beginning to make me feel uncomfortable . What 's the matter with me ? Have I come in for something somewhere , and did n't know it ? Pfresh . Mysteriously . No . It all comes from some rumors about a rich marriage . Prim . Primrose What ? Has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's true ? Prim . Primrose I ca n't say that . Anyway , nothing is settled as yet . Pfresh . Well , if that 's the case , I must give up all ideas of getting the paper , cheap . But I must have them . I could n't disappoint my customer . Would you have any objection to write me a few lines , stating that you give me the preference over other purchasers ? Prim . Primrose Egad ! Pfresh , you do n't deserve it , for starting the bids at thirty per cent. ; but I 'll do it . NED CANDID enters , L. C. Ned . Oh , Mr. Primrose , I am so glad to find you at last . I 've been looking for you all over . Prim . Primrose L. C. Cynically . Have you ? Well , let me tell you one thing . Pointedly : You 'll always find me here when you call at this house , hereafter . Understand ? Ned . Down C. That 's all right ! But look here  --  just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I never expected to have another fellow 's debts bother me so . Prim . Primrose Struck . What debts ? Ned . Why , yours , of course ! A chap named Hornbellow has got all your notes , and when I tried to buy ' em , he 's raised the rates ! Prim . Primrose You 're trying to buy ' em , too ? Pfresh . Aha ! So you vas bidding against me ! Prim . Primrose What on earth do you want with my notes ? Ned . That 's my secret . Perhaps I want ' em to buy something else with . PRIMROSE and PFRESH look at each other . Oh , you 'll know soon enough . Well , anyhow , I made a break for my governor , last night . Perhaps you do n't know how hard it is to get money out of the gov'nor . The worse you want it , the less likely are you to get it . But I was too many for him this time . He came down with the ready in fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soft ; then he got so soft , he made me cry . Ca n't you see me cry ? Prim . Primrose Not unless we get as soft as you are . Ned . I rushed to Hornbellow , and plumped down the cash . " Here 's your sixty per cent. , " says I ; " hand over the notes . " What do you suppose the rascal said ? " Ca n't do it , my dear . Other parties in the field . " Prim . Primrose Crosses , C. Boastfully . I should think so  --  my paper 's in demand ! Oh , it 's gilt-edged , I tell you . To PFRESH . Eh ? At a premium , now , is n't it ? It 'll be a hundred and ten , yet ! Ned . Well , here 's a nice mess for me ! I want to pay your debts , and you have n't got any . It 's a downright fraud ! Prim . Primrose Look here , my young friend . I do n't know what your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you what to do with the money , now you 've got it  --  pay some of your own ! Ned . Oh , the gov'nor is going to take care of them . But yours are selling like hot cakes . Hornbellow says he wishes he had three times as much of ' em ! Prim . Primrose Struck . Does he ? There 's the suggestion of a brilliant idea in that . I 'll make use of it . TIBBETTS enters , L. C. Tib . Tibbetts Mr. Doublepenny would like to see you , sir ; most particular . Prim . Primrose Show him in . TIBBETTS exits . You 'll excuse me , gentlemen , for a minute or two . Everybody seems to want me " most particular ! " Goes up to meet DOUBLEPENNY . DOUBLEPENNY enters , L. C. Doub . Doublepenny Good-evening . Down R. , to others , as they are retiring . Good-evening . Takes PRIMROSE aside . I say , I 've got a favor to ask of you . Prim . Primrose R.C. What is it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a letter I got yesterday  --  a letter from an angel  --  that set my head whirling  --  I 've got into a regular snarl . Prim . Primrose No wonder , with your head whirling ! Doub . Doublepenny No , no !  --  that ai n't it . What do you think ? I 've got to buy up all your obligations ! PFRESH and NED come down . Prim . Primrose Great Scott  --  here 's number three ! By Jove ! everybody 's thinking of paying my debts  --  what I never thought of doing all my life ! Up C. Doub . Doublepenny There 's a fellow named Hornbellow , who 's got ' em all , and wants to bleed all he can . He says there 's another fellow after ' em . I suppose it 's some low shaver , wants to skin a percentage out of it . Pfresh . Indignant . Allow me  --  dere 's no shaver wants no skin . Crosses to DOUBLEPENNY . Doub . Doublepenny Oh , it 's you , is it ? Ned . PRIMROSE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm the person ! Pfresh . If dere 's anybody wants to make a profit , it must be yourself , Mr. Doublepenny . Skins , indeed ! Doub . Doublepenny Then why in thunder did you run the price up ? Pfresh . Who runs dot brice up ? Ned . Crosses to DOUBLEPENNY . You 're running it up ! Doub . Doublepenny In a rage . That 's all rot ! If you had n't interfered , I 'd have had everything for a mere song ! Ned . I beg your pardon , nobody can have them . I want them ! Pfresh . Crosses to NED . Allow me . It is indispensable  --  I haf got to get dem . Doub . Doublepenny Resolutely . Well , I tell you what it is , I wo n't budge an inch ! Ned . L. C. Very well , we shall see ! Pfresh . C. Yes , we shall see . De longest purse wins ! Doub . Doublepenny The longest purse ! Oh , oh , see here ! Ned . Oh , look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about to fly at each other . Now , gentlemen ! Gentlemen ! No quarrelling , or you 'll spoil the whole thing . Of course I 'd like to see those notes taken up . I 'm the person most interested  --  see ? And I do n't want you to lose sight of the main point in quarrelling ! To PFRESH . Now , Pfresh , you are the older  --  you give in . You 've had lots of good things all your life . Give the boys a chance . Aside to him . ' Pon my sacred word and honor , your customer wo n't lose anything . I 'll never be able to pay . Pfresh . Nonsense ! You 're fancy stock ! Prim . Primrose Oh , I am ! Crosses to DOUBLEPENNY . Look here , Doublepenny , you 'll listen to reason . Doub . Doublepenny No I wo n't ! Prim . Primrose To NED . Well then , dash it ! Ned , you 're not such a fool  --  look at this thing sensibly . Ned . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Well , since you wo n't either of you give in , I tell you what you do . Make a " combine , " and buy the stuff together ! Doub . Doublepenny Stuff ! Pfresh . Oh , no ! Ned . Not any ! Prim . Primrose To DOUBLEPENNY and NED . Well then , boys , let him have the old debts , and I 'll see you do n't suffer . I 'll make a lot of new ones for each of you . They turn away , indignant . That 's fair , ai n't it ? RENA enters , L. 1 E. Rena . Papa  --  I  --  oh , the gentlemen are still here . I thought they 'd  --  Prim . Primrose Crosses to her and draws her down , aside . What do you want , darling ? Looks apprehensively toward others . Rena . Do n't be angry with me , papa ; but as I heard you were talking about business , I want to tell you something that may affect your plans . Prim . Primrose What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get you out of your trouble . Prim . Primrose What trouble , daughter ? Rena . Those dreadful debts of your . Prim . Primrose Here 's number four ! Rena . Of course you 're delighted . Prim . Primrose Oh , very delighted . But , how are you going to do it ? The most rigorous saving of all that I am likely to be able to allow you as pocket-money  --  persevered in for the period of an uncommonly long life  --  wo n't even touch the interest of my indebtedness , you rogue ! Rena . Papa , I 'm talking seriously . I 'm on the eve of a sacrifice , a great sacrifice  --  to make you comfortable and happy . But I do it gladly  --  to make you comfortable and happy . I have made up my mind to marry a very wealthy person , and he has promised to arrange everything ? Is n't that nice of him ? Prim . Primrose Severely . Uncommonly nice ! Let me ask you one thing . Do you love this wealthy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you think I 'd give my hand unless my heart approved ? Crosses , R. Prim . Primrose Certainly , if you 're making a sacrifice . Come , now ! Out with the truth ! Sits on sofa , and draws her to him . Rena . Sinking at his feet . Well , I certainly respect him , because he 's going to be generous . I certainly do n't love him , but I do love you , papa , oh , ever so much ! Prim . Primrose Softens . Rena ! Brushes her hair , and pets her . Do you believe , for one single moment , I 'd accept ? No , my dear ! Old Primrose may not pay his debts ; but when he does , it wo n't be with the price of his daughter 's happiness ! No , no ! Rena , I ca n't use that kind of money ! Rises . Rena . Rising . But what 's to be done ? Distressed . Prim . Pr imrose NED gets R. , to fireplace ; DOUBLEPENNY anxious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you that at this moment a howling mob of capitalists is fighting to pay your father 's debts . You sha n't be sacrified , and you shall some day marry the man you love ! Rena . Really , papa ? Honor bright ? Prim . Primrose Honor bright ! You may take my word . Rena . Oh , you 've lifted such a load off my heart . But what am I to do with the other  --  the nice wealthy person ? Prim . Primrose I 'll arrange that for you . Who is it ? Rena . Looking across shyly , and pointing timidly to DOUBLEPENNY . That gentleman  --  over there . Seated on piano-stool . Prim . Primrose What ! The hairpin ? Now I understand his determination . So his letter was from you ! I say , Doublepenny , may I have a word with you ? Doub . Doublepenny Who , with NED , has stood aside , devouring RENA with his eyes , now advances . With pleasure ! Rena . Beckoning to NED . H 'm ! H 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching the two groups ; NED and RENA are on the sofa . Prim . Primrose I 'm really sorry , Doublepenny , but I ca n't allow you to remain under a delusion into which my daughter 's youthful enthusiasm has led you . Doub . Doublepenny Stiffly , rising . I do n't know what you mean , Mr. Primrose . Prim . Primrose Do n't rear up now , and do n't be angry . But I really could n't consent  --  you know to what  --  and you would do me a great favor by being satisfied with my decision , and sparing Rena  --  NED and RENA separate ; she sits , C.  --  the pain of a personal explanation . Doub . Doublepenny Dolefully . It 's too bad ! Crosses , C. But it might be worse . I have n't bought up your notes yet . Calls across stage . I say , Pfresh , I withdraw my bid . To PRIMROSE . It 's a regular upset ; yes , it is ! I only took you at your word . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ match . You know you did . Prim . Primrose L. I know , I know ; but a man like you ought to make a much fitter match  --  much fitter ! Doub . Doublepenny Goes , R. C. Well , you may be right . I may be able to find a few more parents with old debts , and young daughters . Goes up . Good-by , Miss Rena . She comes to him . I 'd have done it , I would . I 'd have outbid the lot of ' em for your Rena . Shakes his hand , warmly . I thank you ever so much . Good-by . I 'll never forget your kindness . Sits on sofa . Doub . Doublepenny Wo n't you ? Then I 'll never forget you as long as I live ; through thick and thin , up or down , and if you should ever need a friend  --  I say , just ring me up on the telephone ! Good-by ! Bows stiffly to NED . ' Evening ! Walks out with dignity , L. C. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sofa ; RENA repulses him with a gesture , and rises . Prim . Primrose Now , then , Pfresh , you 've got rid of one rival . Goes over to him . Ned . To RENA . That chap would n't have had a ghost of a chance ! I 'd have run the bids up until he staked his last hairpin ! Sits beside her . Look here ! Produces a pocket book . The gov'nor backed me to win , and I 'm going to ! Rena . But I tell you papa does n't want it any longer . He 's out of his troubles . Ned . Well , if you insist , I 'll step out , too . Advancing . I say , Pfresh , old man , I 've thought the matter over . I wo n't stand in your way any longer . You want the notes ; very well , you may have ' em . I withdraw . Prim . Primrose In derision . Two backed out ! I was afraid of it ; now , nobody will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you to crawfish.  --  Crab it ! Pfresh . No , no ! Make your mind easy . When Mrs. Primrose say she do ting  --  she never back down ! Prim . Primrose Mrs. Primrose ? Pfresh . Oh , I beg pardon  --  it was a slip  --  a mistake ! Prim . Primrose No , no ! You said Mrs. Primrose , and now I insist upon knowing . Was it my sister-in-law who sent you to buy up my debts ? Pfresh . It vos . But she would never forgive me if she knew I  --  Prim . Primrose Make your mind easy . She sha' n't hear a word on the subject from me . Pfresh . Thank you . Going . Dat vos a shlump ! I guess I leave before she come in . Bows . Good-evenings ! To PRIMROSE . Good-evening ! Exits , L. C. Prim . Primrose What a woman ! Primrose , my boy , if you let that incomparable creature escape you , you 're an ass ? But you never were an ass , and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What 's the matter , papa ? You seem quite excited . Prim . Primrose With importance . My dear child , an event is about to occur which will change my whole existence , and , of course , yours . Do n't ask me what ; the matter will be settled to-day . For the present , content yourself with knowing that your parent is happy beyond expression . And my only present care is  --  what 's to become of you ! Rena . Of me ? Prim . Primrose As matters stand now , I could wish  --  hard as the thought must be to a devoted father  --  to see you happily married ! Rena . Do you ? To the man I love ? Prim . Primrose Of course ! Rena . Demurely . Well , papa , if you are really so anxious about it , I might fix an earlier day ! Prim . Primrose Earlier day for what ? Rena . For my wedding ! What do you say , Neddy ? He rises , down R. Prim . Primrose Neddy ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do with it ? Rena . Well , papa , he has some say in the matter . Prim . Primrose In what capacity , I 'd like to know ? Rena . Why , as the bridegroom . Prim . Primrose The what ? Whose bridegroom ? Rena . Mine ! I 've just engaged him to fill the situation . Prim . Primrose Well , of all the  --  ! Is this a joke ? Rena . Locks arms with NED . Oh , no , papa . Ned . We 're in dead earnest . Prim . Primrose Eying group . Then , of course , it 's no use for me to say no ! Rena . No , papa ; not a bit of use . Prim . Primrose Well , children , since you 've gone and got engaged without my permission , let me tell you a secret . I am as good as engaged myself . Rena . Papa ! You ? Ned . Going to try it again , sir ? Prim . Primrose Gayly . Yes , sir ; with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Papa ! Who is she ! Prim . Primrose You 'll be delighted . Guess ! Ca n't ? What do you say to your aunt  --  Venetia ! Rena . Aunt Venie ! Why , papa , do n't you know  --  ? Stops suddenly . Prim . Primrose Know what ? Rena . Well , I ought n't to betray it  --  but you 've got a dangerous rival ! Prim . Primrose Rival ?  --  pooh ! pooh ! Who ? Rena . Mr. Guthrie . Prim . Primrose Guthrie ? Why , he hates the woman . Hates the very ground she walks on ! Rena . On the contrary , he loves her to distraction ! Ned . That 's so , gov'nor . Prim . Primrose Resolutely buttoning his coat . Does he ? Then I 'll settle his business in no time . I 'm glad you told me . VENETIA enters , L. 1 E. Oh , ah ! My dear Mrs. Primrose , I quite forgot , awhile ago , to deliver you a message . Aside to others . Keep your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ? From whom ? Prim . Primrose Oh , from that lawyer  --  Guthrie . Ven . Venetia Indeed ? Prim . Primrose After a wink at the others . Yes , he 's gone away , you know , for years . You must n't be surprised at his not calling to say good-by ; you see , entre nous , he bears you a bit of a grudge ! Winks at others . Ven . Venetia Amused . A grudge ? What for ? Prim . Primrose Nothing ! Merely prejudices !  --  and all that kind of thing , you know . But , then , he 's a regular crank ! Good thing he 's gone ! Sailed yesterday . Sent me a letter from Sandy Hook , by the pilot . Just about this time , he 's on the broad Atlantic ! RENA has been trying to stop her father by signs and nods , and NED now beckons off to GUTHRIE , who appears in doorway , and stands unseen by PRIMROSE . Ven . Venetia With a glance at back . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dear , one word about a subject on which you were lately so eloquent . You pictured in such en chanting colors the joys of home , that I have resolved to follow your advice , and marry . Ven . Venetia I am truly glad to hear it . Prim . Primrose And it occurred to me that to make our present happy relations permanent , we needed only a trifling formality . Ven . Venetia I hardly comprehend  --  Prim . Primrose Our past quarrels are buried . There is a difference in our ages , to be sure . I 'm no longer what you 'd call young , but you are in the first bloom of youth ; and as a man is no older than his wife looks  --  why  --  Pauses . Ven . Venetia His wife ? Prim . Primrose In one word , I have the honor to propose for your hand . Ven . Venetia I am greatly honored by your preference , and flattered ; but I ca n't accept unless this gentleman is willing to re lease me . Points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward . Venetia , how can you jest about that ? Prim . Primrose Who has stood rooted and dazed by the refusal , and finally overcome by GUTHRIE 'S appearance . I thought you had gone to Japan ! GUTHRIE and VENETIA go up stage . Rena . I say , papa ! You do n't have any luck with the people you send off . They come right back on your hands . Prim . Primrose So it seems . Well , there 's nothing left for me but to start myself . My last attempt to settle down has failed . To RENA . My love  --  Ned  --  everybody  --  I wo n't say good-by  --  I 'll send a telegram from Sandy Hook ! Takes NED 'S and RENA 'S hands ; is between them . My boy , you 've got our Miss Million ; make her happy . I hope you wo n't miss the million , for she has n't got it . Ned . But she 's worth a million in herself . Give her to me , willingly , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times a million , in solid cash . For she and my governor are the only people who ever said , " I 'll trust you ! " Prim . Primrose You forget your creditors . Rena . ' Sh !  --  papa ! To NED . Never mind him . We 'll all trust you . And I say to all fathers , trust your children  --  Prim . Primrose Especially your girls ! Epilogue.  --  Spoken by RENA . It is when troubles threaten with their worst , Then trust your children  --  always trust them first . We oftenest wrong our loved ones , I believe  --  Simply by loving efforts to deceive . And girls  --  a word ! They say a cherub sits Aloft , and watches o'er poor Jack ; now it 's But fair to reason ( so girls may n't come to ill ) Another cherub watches o'er poor Jill ! And if she truly does a daughter 's part , Will see she gets the wishes of her heart ! Back matter CURTAIN .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
