A WORD FROM THE ADAPTER . Those novels and plays in which the author is understood to depict his own life , must possess an ever-living interest far above all their other and even better works . For some such reason do CHARLOTTE BRONT 'S admirers turn to " Jane Eyre , " and the lovers of CHARLES DICKENS devour " David Copperfield . " And the fact that FARQUHAR was supposed to have depicted scenes and incidents of his own career in " The Recruiting Officer , " has always invested that piece with the liveliest interest ; perhaps a livelier interest than followed his " Beaux Stratagem , " " The Constant Couple , " or even " The Inconstant . " Captain Plume was generally recognized by FARQUHAR 'S own contemporaries as a portrait of himself . The dramatist dedicated his play " To all Friends round the welkin , " as a graceful compliment for " the hospitality and politeness which the author experienced when he was on the recruiting service at Shrewsbury , " the scene of his comedy ; from this fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Recruiting Officer " as a picture of the times and manners in which FARQUHAR lived . In retouching the old picture , in order that it might find an agreeable place among the works of our modern masters who occupy the stage to-day , MR . DALY has restricted himself mainly to the elimination of a few of the grosser touches of the original , and to the repression of some of those minor sketches of character which only served to crowd the canvas , and might have made the representation at least tiresome . The transposition of some of the scenes was also thought necessary to make the story intelligible , or to put the audience into the secret of the plot : a wise measure in comedy , which was not so well understood in FARQUHAR 'S times , when the art of dramatic construction was not yet fully developed , as it is to-day . Every essential point , character , and scene , has been retained , however , as FARQUHAR designed them , with those mere modifications of expressions which were thought absolutely necessary to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ original play , as written by CAPTAIN FARQUHAR , was produced for the first time in 1705 at Drury Lane Theatre . The cast of that occasion will be found in its proper place . The play seems to have become an immediate favorite , and the part of Sylvia , for at least half a century afterward , was considered one of the test parts of the English stage . It was as Sylvia that PEG WOFFINGTON made her dbut in London , in 1739 , and until her singular and very tragic last appearance in 1757 , it was one of her most popular performances . David Garrick very often acted the part of Plume with her . " The Recruiting Officer " is the seventh piece which we find named as being acted on the New York stage . This was in 1750 , at the theatre in Nassau Street . It was frequently given in this city afterward , and we have casts of its production as far back as 1792 . The last time this comedy was given in New York , was in 1843 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sylvia was played by MRS . JOHN DREW ( then known as MISS HUNT ) . The rest of that cast included Thomas Barry , as Plume ; Abbott , as Brazen ; Shaw , as Kite ; Bellamy , as Balance ; H. Placide , as Appletree ; W. H. Williams ( " Billy Villiams of the Vells " ) , as Costar ; Mrs. Buloid , as Melinda ; Mrs. Knight , as Rose ; and Mrs. Vernon ( afterward famous for her " old women " ) as Lucy . A droll story is related of Quin , the comedian , who played Balance to Mrs. Woffington 's Sylvia . " Sylvia , " he exclaimed ( one evening after he had been dining out and found his memory playing him false ) , " how old were you when your mother was married ? " " What sir ? " rejoined Peg , both merry and amazed at the puzzling question . " Psha ! " grumbled the inimitable actor  --  " I mean , how old were you when your mother was born ? " This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by replying , with great humor and presence of mind , " I regret , sir , that I can not answer you precisely on either of these questions ; but I can tell you , if that be necessary , how old I was when my mother died ! " The revival of this famous English comedy by MR . DALY adds a third to his very successful and interesting Old Comedy Series : " She Would and She Would Not , " and " The Country Girl " having preceded it . COLLEY CIBBER , WYCHERLY , and FARQUHAR constitute a trio of rare writers of comedy whose works seldom find their way to the stage to-day . MR . DALY 'S company , however , has not only made these fine plays genuinely entertaining to American play-goers , but their London audiences were roused to a pitch of absolute enthusiasm during MR . DALY 'S brief season in the world 's metropolis , in the summer of 1884 . The leading New York critics were unanimous in their praise of the performance of the " Recruiting Officer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Human nature has not much changed . Mr. Daly 's audience was as fashionable an audience as could be gathered in the city . Yet the few suggestive lines which he has left in the piece excited the loudest laugh . Americans are not squeamish with these old plays . They know that the comedies of the Restoration were not models of propriety . They know that George Farquhar , the rollicking Irish captain , was not a preacher of morality . And if the piece hung fire at times , if it seemed a trifle heavy and monotonous , it was because the spectators had been , credited with a prudery which they did not seem to possess . " William Winter wrote in the columns of the Tribune of Miss Ada Rehan as the " animating spirit of the performance and a delight to her audience . " The critic of the Times wrote that " Miss Rehan was not only successful in catching the spirit of the piece and transmitting it to the audience , so far as her own part was concerned , but she invested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more meaning into a few important lines of the text than appears on the surface . As Sylvia herself she was the affectionate and dutiful daughter , who felt more sorrow for her brother 's death , doubtless , than the author intended ; as Master Jack Wilful , and his alter ego , Captain Pinch , who took snuff with a pinch , and , in short , could do anything at a pinch , her imitation of the foppish manners and languid nonchalance of the London buck was deliciously droll and seemed not a bit incongruous , though it is not likely that it was so pronounced as Mistress Ann Oldfield 's treatment of the same passages . Miss Rehan , in short , was thoroughly at home in the old comedy . If her work was not strictly in keeping with traditions , it was still delightful and artistic . She interpreted Farquhar in her own way , but without missing his meaning , except where his meaning would not be tasteful to a modern audience . Her treatment of the scenes with Rose , for instance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actress were needed in these in spite of careful " editing " and expunging . THE RECRUITING OFFICER . CAST OF CHARACTERS .

Plume . A very elegant reception , indeed , Mr. Kite . I find you are fairly entered into your recruiting strain ; pray , what success ? Kite . I 've been here a week , and I 've recruited five . Plume . Five ! Pray , what are they ? Kite . I have listed the strong man of Kent , the king of the gypsies , a Scotch pedler , a scoundrel attorney , and a Welsh parson . Plume . An attorney !

Kite . Sir , the mob are so pleased with your honor ; and the justices and better sort of people are so delighted with me , that we shall soon do your business ? Plume . Jackanapes ! And have you had any occasion , since your arrival , to make use of the German astrologer 's habit , which you brought away ? Kite . Yes , sir , and through it my fame has spread all about the country for the most faithful fortune-teller that ever told a lie ,  --  this device , sir , will get you men , and me money , which , I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes your friend , Mr. Worthy .

You must not think to surmount her pride by your humility . Let me see  --  the very first thing that I would do , should be to make love to her nearest friend ; or , what if we made a ball , and forgot to invite her , with one or two of the ugliest ? Wor . Worthy These would be mortifications , I must confess , but we live in such a precise , dull place , that we can have no balls . Plume . What ! and so many recruiting officers in town , and Mistress Sylvia to lead ? Wor . Worthy I began to fancy you had forgot poor Sylvia . Plume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head . ' T is true , Sylvia and I might have been man and wife , but her father and I could not agree upon the preliminaries . She was a pert , obstinate coquette , and stood by the old man  --  and so we cried quits . Crosses , R. Wor . Worthy And do you intend never to marry ? Plume . Your pardon ! I 'll marry , when I may examine my goods , before I buy . I 'm resolved never to bind myself to any woman for my whole life , till I know whether I shall like her company for half an hour . The Chinese fashion is a good one ; and if people would but try one another 's dispositions before they engaged  --  say , take each other on a month 's trial , before the wedding  --  it would prevent all these elopements , divorces , and the devil knows what !

Enter JUSTICE , BALANCE , and SYLVIA , R. U. E. Balance . With an open letter in his hand . This is ill news from London , my girl , very ill news . Syl . Sylvia While there is life there is hope , sir ; perhaps my brother may recover . Bal . Balance We have but little reason to expect it ; the doctor acquaints me here , that before this comes to my hands he fears I shall have no son . Poor Owen ! but the decree is just ; I was pleased with the death of my father , because he left me an estate ; and now I am punished with the loss of an heir to inherit mine . I must now look upon you as the only hopes of my family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will give you fresh thoughts and new prospects . Syl . Sylvia My desire to be punctual in my obedience requires that you would be plain in your commands , sir . Bal . Balance The death of your brother will make you sole heiress to my estate ; this fortune gives you a fair claim to quality and a title : you must set a just value upon yourself , and , in plain terms , think no more of Captain Plume . Syl . Sylvia You have often commended the gentleman , sir . Bal . Balance And I do so still ; he 's a very pretty fellow ; but , though I liked him well enough for a bare son-in-law , I do n't approve of him for an heir to my estate and family : fifteen hundred pounds , indeed , I might trust in his hands , and it might do the young fellow a kindness ; but  --  ods my life ! two thousand pounds a year would turn him , quite turn his brain . Enter WILLIAM , R. L. U. E. Wm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your house from London , with a letter for your Worship , but he will deliver it into no hands but your own . Bal .

Sylvia Make the dispute between love and duty , and I am Prince Prettyman exactly . If my brother dies , ah , poor brother ! if he lives , ah , poor sister ! It is bad both ways . I 'll try it again  --  Follow my own inclinations , and break my father 's heart ; or obey his commands , and break my own ? Worse and worse .  --  Suppose I take it thus : a moderate fortune , a pretty fellow , and a hack ; or a fine estate , a coach and six , and an ass . That will never do neither . Enter from L. MELINDA , in a sedan-chair , she hails SYLVIA from the chair . Melinda . Why , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair , and the men carry it aside at a sign from her . Welcome to town , cousin Sylvia ! I envied you your retreat in the country ; here we have smoke , noise , scandal , affectation , and pretension : in short , everything to give the spleen , and nothing to divert it  --  then , the air is intolerable . Syl . Sylvia Why , cousin , I have heard the town of Shrewsbury commended for its air . Mel . Melinda But you do n't consider , Sylvia , how long I have lived in it : to a lady the least nice in her constitution , no air can be good above half a year . Change of air I take to be the most agreeable of any variety in life . Syl . Sylvia As you say , cousin , there are several sorts of airs . Mel . Melinda Psha ! I talk only of the air we breathe , or , more properly , of that we taste .  --  Have not you , Sylvia , found a vast difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cousin , are not vapors and bad humors a sort of air ? Taste air ! you might as well tell me I may feed upon air ! but , pr'ythee , dear Melinda , do n't put on such an air to me . Your education and mine were just the same , and I remember the time when we never troubled our heads about air , but when the sharp breezes from the Welsh mountains made our fingers ache in a cold morning , at boarding-school . Mel . Melinda Our education , cousin , was the same , but our temperaments had nothing alike ; you have the constitution of a horse . Syl . Sylvia So far as to be troubled neither with spleen , colic , nor vapors . I need no hartshorn for my head , nor wash for my complexion ; I can gallop all the morning after the hunting-horn , and all the evening to the tune of a fiddle . Mel . Melinda I am told your captain is come to town . Syl . Sylvia Ay , he is come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without a companion , if I have to don his uniform , and join his regiment . Mel . Melinda You are certainly mad , cousin ! Syl . Sylvia " And there 's a pleasure , sure , in being mad , Which none but madmen know . " Crosses , L. Mel . Melinda Thou poor romantic Quixote ! hast thou the vanity to imagine that a young sprightly officer , that rambles o'er half the globe , in half a year , can confine his thoughts to the daughter of a country justice ? Syl . Sylvia Psha ! what care I for his thoughts ? I should not like a man with confined thoughts ; it shows a narrowness in soul . Mel . Melinda O ' my conscience , Sylvia , hadst thou been a man , thou hadst been the greatest rake in Christendom . Syl . Sylvia I should have endeavored to know the world . But , now I think o n't , how stands your affair with Mr. Worthy ? Mel . Melinda He 's my aversion . Syl . Sylvia Vapors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sylvia I say , that you should not use that honest fellow so inhumanly ; he 's a gentleman of arts and fortune , and , besides that , my captain 's friend ; and , by all that 's sacred ! if you do not use him better , I shall expect satisfaction . Mel . Melinda Satisfaction ! you begin to fancy yourself a man , in good earnest . But , to be plain with you , I like Worthy the worse for being so intimate with your captain ; for I take him to be a loose , idle , unmannerly coxcomb . Syl . Sylvia Indeed , madam ! you never saw him , perhaps , since you were mistress of twenty thousand pounds ; you only knew him when you were capitulating with Worthy . Mel . Melinda What do you mean , madam ? Syl . Sylvia My meaning needs no interpretation , madam . Mel . Melinda Better it had , madam ; for , methinks , you are too plain . Syl . Sylvia If you mean the plainness of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am , to the full . Mel . Melinda Indeed ! Well , if I were , I 'd be as glad as you are , to take up with a rakish young officer . Syl . Sylvia Turning short on her . Look'ye , cousin , abuse me if you will , but let my officer alone . You saluted me first , and if you can be no more civil  --  Mel . Melinda Enough , madam ! If you had n't come into my path , I should n't have fallen across yours . Syl . Sylvia Do n't be troubled , madam , I sha n't desire to have any further acquaintance with you . Mel . Melinda Very well , madam ! The sooner you make an end of this , the better . Crosses , C. Syl . Sylvia Oh , madam  --  I 'm easily persuaded to follow my own inclinations  --  and so , my very dear cousin  --  I am your ladyship 's very  --  very humble servant ! Madam ! Sweeps out , L. U. E.

Come , bring me where I can have pen and ink . Going into chair . Lucy . To write an answer to this letter , I hope , madam . Mel . Melinda Who sent it ? Lucy . Mr. Worthy , madam . Mel .

Thomas We do n't know ; the noble sergeant is pleased to be in a passion , sir ; but  --  Kite . They disobey command ; they deny their being listed . Tho . Thomas Nay , sergeant , we do n't downright deny it , neither ; that we dare not do , for fear of being shot ; but we humbly conceive , in a civil way , and begging your worship 's pardon , that we may go home . Plume . That 's easily known . Have either of you received any of the king 's money ? Cos . Costar Not a brass farthing , sir . Kite .

A dog , to abuse two such honest fellows as you .  --  Look ye , gentlemen , I come among you as an officer to list soldiers , not as a kidnapper to steal slaves . Cos . Costar Mind that , Tummas . Plume . I desire no man to go with me but as I went myself . I went a volunteer , as you or you may do ; for a little time carried a musket , and now I command a company . Tho .

Balance Have four horses put to the family coach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Exit WILLIAM . And now let me examine the contents of this letter a little nearer . Reads . Sir  --  My intimacy with Mr. Worthy has drawn a secret from him , that he had from his friend Captain Plume ; and my friendship and relation to your family oblige me to give you timely notice of it . The captain is trifling with my cousin Sylvia . Evils of this nature are more easily prevented than amended ; and that you would immediately send my cousin into the country , is the advice of , Sir , your humble servant , MELINDA . Why , the devil 's in the young fellows of this age , they are ten times worse than they were in my time .  --  Hang it ! I can fetch down a woodcock or a snipe , and why not a hat and feather ? I have a case of good pistols , and have a good mind to try . SYLVIA enters , R. Syl . Sylvia You sent for me , sir ? Bal . Balance How old were you when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't remember I ever had one , and you have been so careful , so indulgent to me since , that indeed I never wanted one . Bal . Balance Have I ever denied you anything you asked of me ? Syl . Sylvia Never , that I remember . Bal . Balance Then , Sylvia , I must beg that once in your life you would grant me a favor . Syl . Sylvia Why should you question it , sir ? Bal . Balance I do n't ; but I would rather counsel than command . I do n't propose this with the authority of a parent , but as the advice of your friend , that you would take the coach this moment , and go into the country . Syl . Sylvia Does this advice , sir , proceed from the contents of the letter you received just now ? Bal . Balance No matter ; I will be with you in three or four days , and then give my reasons : but , before you go , I expect you will make me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sir . Bal . Balance That you will never dispose of yourself to any man without my consent . Syl . Sylvia I promise . He kisses her . Bal . Balance Very well ; and , to be even with you , I promise I never will dispose of you without your own consent . SYLVIA embraces and kisses him . Syl . Sylvia But , papa , have you met Captain Plume , since he 's returned to town ? Bal . Balance Ah ! Captain Plume  --  what would a Marshal of the army do with a country Squire , or his country daughter ? Come . It is agreed between us :  --  you set out at once ! Syl . Sylvia Yes , papa , but has not the captain called yet ? Bal . Balance Tut , tut ! Still upon the captain : the captain , child , is engaged elsewhere  --  wedded  --  married to Mars ; wedded to the war . He owns no mistress but Victory ; ' t is beneath a captain to think of any other . Come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! You must turn your back upon the military ! The coach is ready ; go at once ; farewell ! Leads her to the door , R. Now she 's gone , let me think what next move to make . Reopens the letter to read , WORTHY enters , L. 1 E. Who now ? Ah ! Mr. Worthy ? Humph ! your servant , Mr. Worthy ! Wor . Worthy I am sorry to be the messenger of ill news . Bal . Balance I apprehend it , sir ; you have heard that my son is past recovery . Wor . Worthy My letters say he 's dead , sir . Takes his hand . Bal . Balance After a pause of emotion . He 's happy , and I must be satisfied : the stroke of heaven I can bear ; but injuries from men , Mr. Worthy , are not so easily supported . Wor . Worthy I hope sir , that you are under no apprehension of wrong from any body . Bal . Balance You know I ought to be . Wor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know anything to your prejudice , without resenting it as much as you should . Bal . Balance This letter , sir , which I tear in pieces , to conceal the person that sent it , informs me that Plume has a design upon Sylvia , and that you are privy to it . Wor . Worthy Nay , then , sir , I must do myself justice , and endeavor to find out the author . Takes up a bit . Sir , I know the hand , and , if you refuse to discover the contents , Melinda shall tell me . Going , L. Bal . Balance Hold , sir ; the contents I have told you already ; only with this circumstance  --  that her intimacy with Mr. Worthy had drawn the secret from him . Wor . Worthy Her intimacy with me ! Dear sir , let me pick up the pieces of this letter : ' twill give me such a power over her pride to have her own an intimacy under her hand .  --  This was the luckiest accident ! Gathering up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but malice ; the effect of a little quarrel between her and Miss Sylvia . Bal . Balance Are you sure of that , sir ? Wor . Worthy Her maid gave me the history of part of the battle just now , as she overheard it : but I hope , sir , your daughter has suffered nothing upon the account . Bal . Balance No , no , poor girl ! she 's so afflicted with the news of her brother 's illness , that , to avoid company , she begged leave to go into the country . Wor . Worthy And is she gone ? Bal . Balance I could not refuse her , she was so pressing . Wor . Worthy So pressing to be gone , sir ?  --  I find her sudden fall into fortune will give her the same airs as Melinda , and that Plume and I may laugh at one another . Bal . Balance Like enough : women are as subject to pride as men are ; and why may n't great women as well as great men forget their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellow ? I love him so well , it would break the heart of me to think him a rascal .  --  I am glad my daughter 's gone fairly off , though . Aside . Where does the captain quarter ? Wor . Worthy At the Raven . I am to meet him there two hours hence , and we should be glad of your company . Bal . Balance Your pardon , dear Worthy ! I must allow a day or two to the death of my son . The decorum of mourning is what we owe the world , because they pay it to us ; afterward I 'm yours whenever you will . They exeunt , L. 1 E. NELL , SYLVIA 'S maid , enters , R. 1 E. , with a bundle , watching BALANCE off . Nell . Going to door . They 've gone , madam ! Enter SYLVIA , hooded for a journey . I have everything here . Syl .

I have often heard , that soldiers were sincere ! My venture will test the truth of public report . And yet , sincerity is a sort of glory soldiers can afford to do without  --  for it seldom benefits a man till he dies .

Plume . ( L. ) And leave us here to mourn upon the shore .  --  What shall we do ? Wor . Worthy I have a trick for mine : the letter , you know , and the fortune-teller , which your sergeant Kite shall personate . Plume . And I have a trick for mine . Wor . Worthy What is't ? Plume . I 'll never think of her again . Wor . Worthy No ! Plume . No ; I am above administering to the pride of any woman , were she worth twelve thousand a year ; and I ha'nt the vanity to believe I shall gain a lady worth twelve . The generous , good-natured Sylvia , penniless , I admire ; but the haughty and scornful Sylvia , with her fortune , I despise .  --  What ! sneak out of town , and not so much as a word .  --  ' Sdeath ! how far off does she live ?

Buy chickens ! chickens ! chickens ! Who 'll buy ? Plume . A rustic beauty , by Jove ! But what is that country fellow with her ? KITE enters hurriedly . Kite . Captain , captain , another recruit , or I 'm a Dutchman !

Come , I must examine your basket to the bottom , my dear ! Rose . Nay , for that matter , I warrant my ware is as good as any in the market . Plume . And I 'll buy it all , child , were it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furnish you . Plume . Come , then , we wo n't quarrel about the price ; they 're fine birds .  --  Pray , what 's your name , pretty name , my pretty creature ? Rose . Rose , sir . My father is a farmer within three short miles o ' the town : I sell chickens , eggs , butter , and nosegays ; and my brother Bullock there sells pigs and corn . Bul . Bullock Come , sister , haste  --  we shall be late home . Whistles about the stage . Plume . Kite ! Tips him the wink , he returns it . Pretty Mrs. Rose  --  you have  --  let me see  --  how many ? Rose . A dozen , sir , and they are richly worth two crowns . Bul . Bullock Come , Rose ; I sold fifty strake of barley to-day in half this time ; but you will higgle and higgle for a penny more than the commodity is worth . Rose . What 's that to you , oaf ? I can make as much out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm sure .  --  The gentleman bids fair , and , when I meet with a chapman , I know how to make the best of him .  --  And so , sir , I say for a two-crown piece the bargain 's yours . Plume . Here 's a guinea , my dear ! Rose . I ca n't change your money , sir . Plume . Indeed ! my lodging is hard by , chicken ! and we 'll get change there . Goes off , she follows him . Kite . Advancing with BULLOCK , L. So , sir , as I was telling you , I have seen one of these hussars eat a fortification for his breakfast , and afterward , pick his teeth with a palisado . Bul . Bullock ( R. ) Ay , you soldiers see very strange things ; but pray , sir , what is a fortification ? Kite . Why , ' t is like a modern minc 'd pie , but the crust is confounded tough , and the plums are somewhat hard of digestion . Bul . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?  --  Come , Rouse , pray ha ' done . Kite . Your palisado is a pretty sort of bodkin , about the thickness of my leg . Looks round . Bul . Bullock That 's a lie , I believe . Aside . Eh ! where 's Rouse ? Rouse ! Rouse ! ' Sflesh ! where 's Rouse gone ? Kite . She 's gone with the captain . Bul . Bullock The captain ! wauns ! there 's no pressing of women , sure . Kite . But there is , sure . Bul . Bullock If the captain should press Rouse , I should be ruined  --  which way went she ? Oh ! the devil take your fortifications and palisadoes ! Running across , exit , L. Kite . You shall be better acquainted with them , honest Bullock , or I shall miss of my aim . Enter WORTHY , L. Wor . Worthy Why , thou art the most useful fellow in nature to your captain , I find . Kite . Yes , sir , I understand my business , I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ qualified ? Kite . You must know , sir , I was born a gipsy , and bred among that crew till I was ten years old ; there I learned canting ; I was bought from my mother by a certain nobleman for three guineas ; there I learned impudence ; then I turned bailiff 's follower ; there I learned sneaking ; at last I got into the army ; there I learned bullying and boozing ; so that , if your worship pleases to cast up the whole sum , viz. , canting , sneaking , impudence , bullying , boozing , and a halberd , you will find the sum total amount to a recruiting sergeant . Wor . Worthy And pray what induced you to turn soldier ? Kite . Hunger and ambition . But look ! yonder comes Justice Balance and our lout . That looks like mischief ahead ! Enter BALANCE and BULLOCK , L. U. E. Bal . Balance ( L. C. ) Here , you sergeant , where 's your captain ? Here 's a poor foolish fellow comes clamoring to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do you know anything of this matter , Worthy ? Wor . Worthy ( R. C. ) I know his sister is gone with Plume to his lodging , to sell him some chickens . Bal . Balance Is that all ? The fellow 's a fool . Bul . Bullock ( L. ) I know that , a n't like your worship ; but , if your worship pleases to grant me a warrant to bring her before your worship  --  Bal . Balance Thou'rt mad , fellow ; thy sister 's safe enough . Wor . Worthy Hast thou no more sense , fellow , than to believe that the captain can list women ? Bal . Balance How came you not to go along with your sister ? Bul . Bullock Lord , sir , I thought no more of her going than I do of the day I shall die : but this gentleman here , not suspecting any hurt neither , I believe  --  you thought no harm , sir , did you ? Kite . Lack-a-day , sir ! not I. Bal . Balance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but what did that gentleman with you . Bul . Bullock Why , sir , he entertained me with a fine story of a great sea-fight between the Hibernians and Lowbernians . Kite . And so , sir , while we were in the heat of the battle  --  the captain carried off the baggage . Bal . Balance Sergeant , go along with this fellow to your captain ; give him my humble service , and desire him to discharge the girl , though he has listed her . Bul . Bullock Ay , and if she be n't free for that , he shall have another man in her place . Kite . Come , honest friend , Crosses , L. you shall go to my quarters instead of the captain 's . Aside . Exeunt KITE and BULLOCK , L. Bal . Balance ( L. ) We must get this mad captain his complement of men , and send him packing ; else he 'll overrun the country . Wor . Worthy ( R. ) You see , sir , how little he values your daughter 's disdain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was just such another fellow at his age : but how goes your affair with Melinda ? Wor . Worthy Very slowly . Cupid had formerly wings , but I think , in this case , he hobbles ! My mistress has got a captain , too , but such a captain !  --  as I live , yonder he comes ! Bal . Balance Who , that bluff fellow ? I do n't know him . Wor . Worthy But I engage he knows you ; he has the most universal acquaintance of any man living , for he wo n't be alone , and nobody will keep him company twice : then he 's a Csar among the ladies  --  veni , vidi , vici , and all that ! If he has but talked with the maid , he swears the mistress is in love with him ; but the most surprising part of his character is his memory , which is most prodigious .

I am your servant , and so forth  --  your name ? Bal . Balance ( To WORTHY . ) Very laconic , faith ! Bra . Brazen Laconic ! a very good name , truly . I have known several of the Laconics abroad . Poor Jack Laconic ! he was killed in battle . I remember that he had a blue ribbon in his hat that very day .

Brazen Brazen , at your service . Bal . Balance Oh , Brazen ! a very good name . I have known several of the Brazens , abroad , and at home , too ! Wor . Worthy Do you know one Captain Plume , sir ? Bra . Brazen Is he anything related to Frank Plume in Northamptonshire ?  --  Honest Frank ! many , many a dry bottle have we cracked hand to fist . You must have known his brother Charles , that was concerned in the India Company : he married the daughter of old Tongue-pad , the master in Chancery , a very pretty woman , only she squinted a little ; she died , left a daughter , but whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I ca n't remember .

Rose . He 's to have my brother for a soldier , and two or three sweethearts I have in the country ; they shall all go with the captain . Oh ! he 's the finest man , and the humblest withal ! Would you believe it , sir ? he treated me with as much fam-mam-mil-yararality , as if I had been the best lady in the land . Bal . Balance Oh ! he 's a mighty familiar gentleman as can be .

Indeed , madam , the last bribe I had from the captain , was only a small piece of Flanders lace , for a cap . Mel . Melinda Ay , Flanders lace is a constant present from officers . They bring over a cargo of lace , to cheat the king of his duty , and his subjects of their honesty . Lucy . They only barter one sort of prohibited goods for another , madam . Mel . Melinda Has any of them been bartering with you , Mrs. Pert , that you talk so like a trader ?

Mel . Melinda And from all the men I ever saw , I never had so fine a compliment : but you soldiers are the best-bred men , that we must allow . Bra . Brazen Some of us , madam ; but there are brutes among us , too , very sad brutes : for my own part , I have always had the good luck to prove agreeable .

Do  --  do you know the gentleman ? Bra . Brazen No  --  but I will presently . Your name , my dear ? Syl . Sylvia Wilful , Jack Wilful , at your service . Bra . Brazen What , the Kentish Wilfuls , or those of Staffordshire ? Syl . Sylvia Both , sir , both ; I 'm related to all the Wilfuls in Europe , and I 'm head of the family at present . Crosses , C. Plume . Do you live in the country , sir ? Syl . Sylvia Yes , sir , I live where I stand ; I have neither home , house , nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brazen What are you , sir ? Syl . Sylvia Nothing in particular . Plume . In the army , I presume . Syl . Sylvia No , but I intend to list immediately . Look ye , gentlemen , he that bids the fairest , has me . Bra . Brazen Sir , I 'll bid ! I 'll make you a corporal this minute . Plume . ( L. ) Corporal ! I 'll make you my companion ; you shall eat with me . Bra . Brazen ( R. ) You shall drink with me , receive your pay , and do no duty . Syl . Sylvia ( C. ) Then you must make me a field-officer . Plume . Pooh , pooh , pooh ! I 'll do more than all this . Bra . Brazen Can you read and write , sir ? Syl . Sylvia Yes . Bra . Brazen Then your business is done  --  I 'll make you chaplain to the regiment . Syl . Sylvia Your promises are so equal , that I 'm at a loss to choose . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town ; pray which of you is Captain Plume ? Plume . I am Captain Plume . Bra . Brazen No , no , I am Captain Plume . Syl . Sylvia Heyday ! Plume . Captain Plume , I 'm your servant , my dear ! Bra . Brazen Captain Brazen , I 'm yours !  --  The fellow dares not fight . Aside . Enter KITE , R. Kite . Sir , if you please  --  Goes to whisper Plume . Plume . No , no , there 's your captain . Captain Plume , your sergeant has got so drunk , he mistakes me for you . Bra . Brazen He 's an incorrigible sot . Here , my Hector of Holborn , here 's forty shillings for you . Plume . I forbid the bans . Look ye , friend , you shall list with Captain Brazen . Syl . Sylvia I will see Captain Brazen hanged first ; I will list with Captain Plume : I am a free-born Englishman , and will be a slave my own way . Look ye , sir , will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brazen I warrant you , my lad . Syl . Sylvia Then I tell you , Captain Brazen , To Plume. that you are an ignorant , pretending , impudent cox-comb . Bra . Brazen Ay , ay , a sad dog . Syl . Sylvia A very sad dog . Give me the money , noble Captain Plume . Plume . Then you wo n't list with Captain Brazen ? Syl . Sylvia I wo n't . Bra . Brazen Never mind him , child ; I 'll end the dispute presently . Hark ye , my dear ! Takes Plume up the stage , and entertains him in dumb show . Kite . Sir , he in the red coat is Captain Plume ; I am his sergeant , and will take my oath o n't . Syl . Sylvia ( R. ) What ! are you Sergeant Kite ? Kite . At your service . Syl . Sylvia ( R. ) Then I would not take your oath for a farthing . Kite . ( L. ) A very understanding youth of his age ! Pray , sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sylvia Well , sir , what have you to say to my face ? Kite . The very image of my brother ; two bullets of the same caliver were never so like ,  --  sure it must be Charley ! Charley ! Syl . Sylvia What d'ye mean by Charley ? Kite . The voice , too ! My dear brother , for I must call you so , I bespeak you for a comrade . Syl . Sylvia Pushing him away . No sir , I 'll be the Captain 's comrade , if anybody 's . Kite . Ambition again ! but I see a storm coming . PLUME and BRAZEN appear wrangling . Syl . Sylvia Now , sergeant , I shall see who is your captain , by your knocking down the other . Kite . My captain scorns assistance , sir . Bra . Brazen Advancing with PLUME . How dare you contend for anything , and not dare to draw your sword ? But you are a young fellow , and have not been much abroad ; so give up the boy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me off ? I 'll let daylight into you ! Draws . BRAZEN draws and tries to protect himself behind SYLVIA . KITE sounds to arms with his mouth . Bra . Brazen ( R. ) Hold , hold ! did not you refuse to fight for the lady ? Retiring , R. Plume . ( L. C. ) I always do , but for a man I 'll fight knee-deep ; so you lie again ! Between the two swords KITE and SYLVIA are hit . MELINDA and WORTHY enter separately , and BRAZEN hides behind both . In the midst of the scuffle the CURTAIN FALLS . END OF ACT II . ACT III . SCENE I.  --  A chamber with dark draperies , on which some astrological hieroglyphics are worked . An arch C. , curtained . Behind this , a table on which are a globe and other astrological paraphernalia . A loud rap heard as curtain rises . Enter quickly PLUME and WORTHY , L. I. E. Plume . Quick , Worthy  --  enter ! This is the mystic cabinet , in which Sergeant Kite dons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Where is the rascal ? Kite ! KITE enters , R. Look alive , man ! On with your robes ! customers are at your door . Knocking heard . Wor . Worthy It 's Melinda and her maid . Kite . Have you seen the lady since her last visit to me , sir ? Wor . Worthy Ay , but it wo n't do  --  Have you showed her her name , that I tore off from the bottom of the letter ? Kite . No , sir ; I reserve that for the last stroke . Plume . What letter ? Wor . Worthy One that I would not let you see , for fear that you should break windows in good earnest . Here , it is in scraps now , but put it into your pocketbook , and put it together upon occasion . Knocking at the door , L. Kite . Officers , to your posts ! Tycho , mind the door . He pushes PLUME and WORTHY off , R. , and he goes behind the curtains , C. TYCHO , a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high hat , enters , ushering in MELINDA and LUCY . He pantomimes mysteriously to the curtains , puts his fingers to his lips , and exits , C. , with an elfish cry , which makes both start . Lucy . After a shudder and a pause . What place is this , madam , and why have we come here ? Mel . Melinda ' T is the greatest misfortune in nature for a woman to want a confidant . I am at this minute so sick of a secret , that I am ready to faint away . Lucy . Bless me , madam ! what 's the matter ? Mel . Melinda Looking around , and then mysteriously . Well , you must know that , hearing of a famous fortune-teller in town , I came to this place disguised to satisfy a curiosity which has cost me dear . The fellow is certainly the evil one , or one of his bosom-favorites : he has told me the most surprising thing of my past life . Lucy . Things past , madam , can hardly be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to come . Mel . Melinda One thing very surprising ; he said I should die a maid ! Lucy . Die a maid ! Dear madam , if you should believe him , it might come to pass ; for the bare thought o n't might kill one in four-and-twenty hours .  --  And did you ask him any questions about me ? Mel . Melinda You ! why I passed for you . Lucy . So ' t is I that am to die a maid ! Blubbers . Mel . Melinda I do but jest . I would have passed for you , and called myself Lucy ; but he presently told me my name , my quality , my fortune , and gave me the whole history of my life . He told me of a lover I had in this country , and described Worthy exactly , but in nothing so well as in his present indifference . S'death , I could kill him or myself , I am so mad . Lucy . Do n't exasperate Mr. Worthy , ma'am . Consider what the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as times go , anybody 's better than nobody . Mel . Melinda I see my confidence has made you saucy . Goes aside . Lucy . Aside . I find ' t is tit for tat between us . My mistress takes my name with the conjurer , and I use hers with that deliciously impudent Captain Brazen , and if my little plot do n't miscarry  --  Three mysterious raps are heard behind the curtain . Mel . Melinda Hush ! That 's his signal ! Lucy . The evil one ? The curtains are drawn and discover KITE , in conjurer 's costume , seated at a table before a huge book . He does not seem to notice the others . Kite . Rising . By the position of the heavens , gained from my observation upon these celestial globes , I find that Luna was a politician ; Sol , a surveyor ; Mercury , a thief ; Saturn , an alderman ; Jupiter , a millionaire ; and Mars , a sergeant of grenadiers ; and this is the system of the learned Copernicus . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't disturb him ! Kite . Ah , visitors ! Tycho , chairs ! Where is the brat ? Advances . Mel . Melinda Do n't trouble yourself , we sha n't stay long , doctor . Kite . Your ladyship is to stay much longer than you imagine . Mel . Melinda For what ? Kite . For a husband . Lucy . Pray , doctor , do you converse with the stars , or with Old Nick ? Kite . With both ; when I have the destinies of men in search , I consult the stars ; when the affairs of women come under my hands , I advise with my t' other friend . Mel . Melinda And have you raised him upon my account ? Kite . Yes , madam , and he 's now under the table . Lucy . Screams . Oh ! madam , let 's be gone . Kite . If you be afraid of him , why do ye come to consult him ? Mel . Melinda Do n't fear , fool : do you think , sir , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be fooled out of my reason , or frighted out of my senses ? Come , show me this bugbear . Kite . He 's a little busy at present ; but when he has done , he shall wait on you . Mel . Melinda What is he doing ? Kite . Writing your name in his pocketbook . Mel . Melinda Ha , ha ! my name ! pray what have he or you to do with my name ? Kite . Look ye , fair lady ! the devil is a very modest person ; he seeks nobody unless they seek him first . Now , to convince you , I 'll show you a trial of my skill . Here , you Cacodemo del Plumo , exert your power , draw me this lady 's name , the word Melinda , in proper letters and characters of her own handwriting  --  do it at three motions  --  one  --  two  --  three  --  ' t is done .  --  Now , madam , will you please to send your maid to fetch it ? Lucy . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Mel . Melinda My name  --  in my own handwriting ! that would be convincing , indeed ! Kite . Seeing is believing . Goes to the table , and lifts up the carpet  --  TYCHO , dressed as a little imp , gives him the piece of paper . Here , Tre , Tre , poor Tre , give me the bone , sirrah ! There 's your name upon that square piece of paper . Behold  --  Gives MELINDA the paper . Mel . Melinda ' T is wonderful ! my very letters to a tittle ! Lucy . ' T is like your hand , madam  --  but not so like your hand , neither ; and , now I look nearer , ' t is not like your hand at all . Kite . Here 's a chambermaid , now , will outface the sun and moon and all the stars ! Lucy . Look'ye , madam , they sha n't impose upon us ; people ca n't remember their hands no more than they can their faces  --  Come , madam , let us be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'll compare the two hands . Takes out a paper and folds it . Kite . Anything for your satisfaction , madam  --  here is pen and ink . MELINDA writes , LUCY holds the paper . Lucy . Let me see it , madam ; ' t is the same  --  the very same .  --  But I 'll secure one copy for my own affairs . Aside . Mel . Melinda This is demonstration . Kite . ' T is so , madam  --  the word demonstration comes from Dmon , the father of lies . Mel . Melinda Well , doctor , I 'm convinced ; and now , pray , what account can you give of my future fortune ? Kite . Before the sun has made one course round this earthly globe , your fortune will be fixed for happiness or misery . Mel . Melinda What ! so near the crisis of my fate ? Kite . Let me see  --  about the hour of ten you will be saluted by a gentleman who will come to take his leave of you , being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sudden , and the occasion a woman .  --  In short , if the gentleman travels , he will die abroad , and if he does you will die before he comes home . Mel . Melinda What sort of a man is he ? Kite . Madam , he 's a fine gentleman , and a lover ; that is , a man of very good sense , and a very great fool . Mel . Melinda Ten o'clock , you say ? Kite . Ten  --  about the hour of tea-drinking throughout the kingdom . Mel . Melinda Here , doctor . Gives money . Lucy , have you any questions to ask ? Lucy . Oh , madam ! a thousand . Knocks heard outside . Kite . I must beg your patience till another time , for I expect more company this minute ; besides , I must discharge the gentleman under the table . Lucy . O , pray , sir , discharge us first ! Kite . Tycho , wait on the ladies down-stairs . Exeunt MELINDA and LUCY , L. , preceded by TYCHO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking after her . Plume . Remember the hour of your meeting . Wor . Worthy Ten o'clock it is to be ? Kite . Ten , sir ! Knocks heard . But , away to your ambuscade ! Here 's more visitors . Exeunt PLUME and WORTHY , R. Enter BRAZEN , L. Bra . Brazen Your servant , my dear ! Kite . Stand off , I have my familiar already . Bra . Brazen Are you bewitched , my dear ? Kite . Yes , my dear ! but mine is a peaceable spirit , and hates gunpowder . Thus I fortify myself : Draws a circle round him . Leo ! Sagittarius ! Forceps ! Tom Foolibus ! Copernicus ! and Soforth ! and now , captain , have a care how you force my lines . Bra . Brazen Lines ! what dost talk of lines ! I come to be acquainted with you , man .  --  What 's your name , my dear ? Kite . Conundrum . Bra . Brazen Conundrum ? rat me ! I knew a famous doctor in London of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was born in Algebra . Bra . Brazen Algebra ! Oh ! in Asia Minor , I recollect . Kite . I thought you would ! Bra . Brazen Well , sir ! I am going to be married  --  I have had two letters from a lady of fortune , that loves me to madness ; shall I marry her in four and twenty hours , ay or no ? Kite . Certainly . Bra . Brazen Ay ?  --  Kite . Ay or no.  --  But I must have the year and the day of the month when these letters were dated . Bra . Brazen Did you ever hear of love-letters dated with the year and day of the month ? do you think billetdoux are like bills ? Kite . They are not so good , my dear  --  but , if they bear no date , I must examine the contents . Bra . Brazen Contents ! that you shall , old boy ! here they be both . Kite . Only the last you received , if you please . Takes the letter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consult my books for a minute , I 'll send this letter enclosed to you , with the determination of the stars upon it , to your lodgings . Bra . Brazen With all my heart  --  I must give him some Algebra !  --  Puts his hands in his pockets . Doctor , here ! Gives him money . And , if I succeed , I 'll build a watchtower on the top of the highest mountain in Palestine , for the study of astrology , and the benefit of the Conundrums . Exit , L. Enter PLUME and WORTHY , R. Wor . Worthy O doctor ! that letter 's worth a million ; let me see it : and now I have it , I 'm afraid to open it . Plume . Oho ! let me see it . Opening the letter . If she be a jilt  --  hang her , she is one  --  there 's her name at the bottom o n't . Wor . Worthy By all my hopes , ' t is Lucy 's hand ! Plume . Lucy 's ! Wor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Melinda 's character than black is to white . Plume . Then ' t is certainly Lucy 's contrivance to draw in Brazen for a husband . But are you sure ' t is not Melinda 's hand ? Wor . Worthy You shall see . Where 's the bit of paper I gave you just now , that the devil wrote Melinda upon ? Kite . Here , sir . Plume . ' T is plain they are not the same . And is this the malicious name that was subscribed to the letter , which made Mr. Balance send his daughter into the country ? Wor . Worthy The very same . The other fragments I gave you just now . Plume . Poor Sylvia ! Wor . Worthy Poor Sylvia ? Rich Sylvia ! Come , my friend , Melinda is true , and shall be mine ; Sylvia is constant , and may be yours . Plume . No , she 's above my hopes ; but , for her sake , I 'll recant my opinion of her sex . Exeunt , L. SCENE II . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The glow of sunset is upon the foliage . BULLOCK enters , L. U. E. , sulkily swinging a great club , ROSE following . Rose . Where have you been , you great booby ? You are always out of the way in the time of preferment . Bul . Bullock Preferment ! who should prefer me ? Rose . I would prefer you ! who should prefer a man , but a woman ? Come , throw away that great club , hold up your head , cock your hat , and look big . I 'm a great woman , and will provide for my relations ; I told the captain how finely you played upon the tabor and pipe , so he sat you down for drum-major . Bul . Bullock Aye , sister , you know I have always loved to be drumming , if it were but on a table , or on a quart-pot . But he 's fooling thee ! I know he 's fooling thee : all of them sojer men be fooling thee , and me , too ! If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ club . Rose . ' Sh ! here 's another captain coming this way . Jiminy ! what a spry young ' un he be ! They retire up C. Enter SYLVIA , R. , in military costume . Syl . Sylvia Had I but a commission in my pocket , I fancy my uniform would become me as well as any ranting fellow of them all ; for I take a bold step , a rakish toss , and an impudent air , to be the principal ingredients in the composition of a captain . What 's here ? Rose , my nurse 's daughter ! Crosses , C. I 'll go and practise . Hark ye , my dear ! come here , and kiss me . Kisses her . And her brother , too ! Well , honest pitchfork , do you know the difference between a horse and cart and a cart-horse , eh ? Bul . Bullock ( R. ) I presume that your worship is a captain , by your clothes and your courage . Syl . Sylvia ( C. ) Suppose I were , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( L. ) No , no ; though your worship be a handsome man , there be others as fine as you . My brother is engaged to Captain Plume . Syl . Sylvia Plume ! do you know Captain Plume ? Rose . Yes , I do ; and he knows me . I can do anything with the captain . Bul . Bullock That is , in a modest way , sir . Have a care what you say , Rouse ; do n't shame your parentage . Syl . Sylvia So !  --  And , pray , what do you expect from this captain , child ? Rose . I expect , sir !  --  I expect  --  but he ordered me to tell nobody  --  but suppose he should propose to marry me ? Syl . Sylvia You should have a care , my dear ! men will promise anything . Rose . I know that , but he vowed to marry me after I  --  Syl . Sylvia After you ? after what ! Rose . After I had sold my chickens  --  I hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ L. Plume . What , Mr. Wilful , so close with my chicken pedler ! Syl . Sylvia I 'll try if he loves her . Aside . Close sir , aye , and closer yet , sir . Come , my pretty maid , you and I will take a stroll . Plume . No , no , friend . Crosses , L. C. Syl . Sylvia I have as good a right as you have . Plume . Thou art a very impudent fellow ! Syl . Sylvia Sir , I would qualify myself for the service . Plume . Hast thou really a mind to the service ? Syl . Sylvia Yes , sir ; so let her go . Rose . ( L. ) Pray , gentlemen , do n't be so violent . Plume . Come , leave it to the girl 's own choice . Will you belong to me , or to that gentleman ? Rose . Let me consider .  --  Crosses , C. You are both very handsome  --  Plume . Now the natural inconsistency of her sex begins to work . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ? To SYLVIA . Bul . Bullock Dunna be angry , sir , that my sister should be mercenary , for she 's but young . Strike him for a drum major , sis ! Syl . Sylvia Give thee , child ! I 'll set thee above scandal : you shall have a carriage and pair . Plume . Pho ! that 's easily done : I 'll buy you a new pelisse , and give you a ticket to see a play . Bul . Bullock ( R. ) A play ! wauns ! Rouse , take the ticket , let 's see the show . Syl . Sylvia Look ye , captain , if you wo n't resign , I 'll go list with Captain Brazen this minute . Plume . Will you list with me if I give up my title ? Syl . Sylvia I will . Plume . Take her ; I 'll change a woman for a man at any time . Rose . I have heard before , indeed , that you captains used to sell your men . Bul . Bullock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ send Rouse to the Western Indies . Plume . ( L. ) Ha , ha , ha ! West Indies ! No , no , my honest lad , give me thy hand ; nor you , nor she , shall move a step farther than I do . This gentleman is one of us , and will be kind to you , Mrs. Rose . Rose . ( R. C. ) But will you be so kind to me , sir , as the captain would ? Syl . Sylvia I ca n't ; my circumstances are not so good as the captain 's ; but I 'll take care of you , upon my word . Plume . Ay , ay , we 'll all take care of her ; she shall live like a princess , and her brother , here , shall be  --  drum major , so run along to the inn yonder and I 'll find you presently ! Rose . Come , brother ! They exeunt , L. U. E. She giggling , and throwing kisses back to SYLVIA . He drumming , etc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your forty shillings . Syl . Sylvia Captain Plume , I despise your listing-money ; if I do serve , ' t is purely for love  --  of that girl , I mean , and unless she prefers you  --  or you her !  --  Said to draw him out . Plume . Ha , ha ! I have no other designs , I promise , than drawing in one or two of her followers to my regiment . The women , you know , are the loadstones everywhere ! Gain the wives , and you have the husbands ; please the mistress , and you win the gallant ; and kiss the prettiest country damsels , and you are sure of listing the lustiest fellows . Syl . Sylvia Well , sir , I 'm satisfied as to the point in debate . but now let me beg you to lay aside your recruiting airs , put on the man of honor , and tell me plainly what usage I may expect when I am under your command ? Plume . Your usage will chiefly depend upon your behavior ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small fault , I will excuse it ; if a great one , I 'll discharge you ; for something tells me I shall not be able to punish you . Syl . Sylvia And something tells me that , if you do discharge me , ' twill be the greatest punishment you can inflict ; for , were we this moment to go upon the greatest dangers in your profession , they would be less terrible to me than stay behind you .  --  And now , your hand , this lists me  --  and now you are my captain . Plume . Your friend . Will you lodge at my quarters ? Syl . Sylvia No , no , captain ; you forget Rose ; she 's to be my companion , you know . Plume . I had forgot Rose . Well , may you find that rose without a thorn ! Exit . Syl . Sylvia The world is all a cheat ! Only I take mine to have this excuse : I hurt nobody but myself . So much for you , my brave Plume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me remember the promise , which he exacted from me , " never to dispose of myself without his consent . " That he shall give this very night ; and , to that end , Rose shall help me . I 'll reveal my identity to her  --  the lout , her brother , shall have me brought before my father , on a charge of decoying his sister , and then the law and the military shall have a tug for my person . Consent , if mutual , saves the lawyer 's fee ; Consent is law enough for me . Exit , L. SCENE III .  --  Another part of the wood . BRAZEN enters , reading a letter , R. Bra . Brazen " Um  --  um  --  um ! " Looks at his watch . The canonical hour ! Reads . " Um  --  um  --  um ! " Looks around . This is the spot ! Reads again .

And hither she trips along ! Ah ! Brazen , you dog  --  you were made for conquest ! Twenty thousand pounds in a lump , and a lovely woman , too ! Goes to L. and meets LUCY , who enters , in cloak , hood , and mask , L. The boat is just below here , my charming dear . Enter WORTHY , with a case of pistols under his arm , R. Wor . Worthy Here , sir , take your choice . Going between them , and offering pistols . Bra . Brazen What , pistols ! are they charged , my dear ? Wor . Worthy With a brace of bullets each . Bra . Brazen But I 'm a foot officer , my dear , and never use pistols ; the sword is my way . Pray oblige me , and let me have a bout at sharps ; damn it , there 's no parrying these bullets . Wor . Worthy Sir , if you ha'nt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in for second course . Bra . Brazen Why , then , fire and fury ! I have eaten smoke from the mouth of a cannon , sir ; do n't think I fear powder , for I live upo n't . Takes one . And now , sir , how many paces distant shall we fire ? Wor . Worthy Fire you when you please ; I 'll reserve my shot till I am sure of you . Lucy . Unmasking . Come , gentlemen , I 'll end the strife ! Wor . Worthy Lucy ! Oh , you may take her ! Bra . Brazen The devil take me if I do . Exit , L. Wor . Worthy To LUCY . And was Melinda privy to this trick ? How came her journey put off ? Lucy . No , sir . She wrote her name upon a piece of paper at the conjurer 's , last night , which I put in my pocket , and writ above it , in my own hand , to the captain . Wor . Worthy And where 's your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Sylvia , but at the town 's end she met Mr. Balance 's steward , who told her that Mrs. Sylvia was gone from her father 's , and nobody could tell whither . Wor . Worthy Sylvia gone from her father 's ! this will be news to Plume . Go home , and tell your lady how near I was being shot for her . He is pushing her off , R. , when he stops , and sends her the other way . Stop ! here comes one whom I 'll swear to be thy mistress ! You go your way  --  leave her to me . Goes , L. , as LUCY runs out , L. , and MELINDA enters , R. Mel . Melinda So far , the conjurer was right . The predicted hour has just been struck by the clock . This is said aside , as she sees WORTHY . Wor . Worthy I must strike while the iron 's hot , and give Plume 's receipt a trial . They walk by one another , he with his hat cocked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her his box  --  she strikes it out of his hand . You 've a great deal of courage , madam , to venture where you were so lately frightened . Mel . Melinda And you have a great quantity of impudence , to appear before me , that you so lately have affronted . Wor . Worthy I had no design to affront you , nor appear before you either , madam ; I came hither thinking to meet another person before going abroad . Mel . Melinda Aside . Going abroad ! The conjurer 's right again . Aloud . And pray , sir , how long have you been in this travelling humor ? Wor . Worthy ' T is natural , madam , for us to avoid what disturbs our quiet . Mel . Melinda Rather the love of change , which is more natural , may be the occasion of it . Wor . Worthy To be sure , madam , there must be charms in variety , else neither you nor I should be so fond of it . Mel . Melinda You mistake , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to travel for it ; nor do I think it prudent in you to run yourself into a certain expense and danger , in hopes of precarious pleasure . Wor . Worthy What pleasure I may receive abroad is , indeed , uncertain ; but this I am sure of  --  I shall meet with less cruelty among the most barbarous of nations , than I have found at home . Mel . Melinda Come , sir , you and I have been jangling a great while ; I fancy , if we made up our accounts , we should the sooner come to an agreement . Wor . Worthy Sure , madam , you wo n't dispute your being in my debt . My fears , sighs , vows , promises , assiduities , anxieties , jealousies , have run on for a whole year without any payment . You may remember , madam , that  --  Mel . Melinda Sir , I 'll remember nothing .

Now , if you will begin upon a new score , and behave yourself handsomely till Lent be over , here 's my hand  --  I 'll use you as a gentleman should be used . Wor .

I 've done her an injury , and ca n't be easy till I 've asked her pardon . Exeunt , R. A pause ; then ROSE is heard crying off L. I. E. Then BULLOCK enters . Bul . Bullock Calling back . Fetch him along ! Do n't let'e gi'e thee t ' slip ! SYLVIA enters in custody , with the constable , followed by ROSE , and two other villagers . Syl .

You shall find that my innocence is upon equal foot with your authority . Const . Constable Innocence ! Have n't you tried to humbug that young girl with a false marriage ? Bul . Bullock There was n't no marriage ! He said , as we were all soldiers , they did n't want no minister ; so they were married by the Articles of War ! Const . Constable Hold thy prating , fool ! What does this fellow mean ? Syl . Sylvia Why , marriage is so odd a thing , that no two peoples under the sun agree on the ceremony . Among we soldiers , you know , our sword is our altar ! That we lay down , the hero jumps over it first , and the amazon after ; the drum beats a ruff  --  that 's all .  --  The ceremony is concise . Const . Constable Are you a soldier ? Bul . Bullock Ay , that I am . Will your worship lend me your cane , and I 'll show you how I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the head .  --  Exit Bullock , L. , roaring out . Pray , sir , what commission may you bear ? To Sylvia . Syl . Sylvia I am called captain , sir , by all the drawers and groom-porters in London ; for I wear a red coat , a sword , a hat bien trouss , a martial twist in my cravat , a fierce knot in my periwig , a cane upon my button , piquet in my head , and dice in my pocket . Const . Constable Your name , pray , sir ? Syl . Sylvia Captain Pinch . I take snuff with a pinch ; I cock my hat at a pinch ; in short , I can do anything at a pinch . Const . Constable Well , Captain Pinch  --  I 'll take you at a pinch  --  and you shall give the rest of your pedigree to Justice Balance . Syl . Sylvia Aside . Before my father ! Now impudence and love sustain me ! She is carried off , ROSE following , blubbering . Rose . Pray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he 's the most harmless man in the world , for all he talks so ! Exeunt . SCENE IV .  --  A Hall at Justice BALANCE 'S . Large fireplace . Before this a large table , full of books and papers . Justice SCRUPLE is seated at the table ; KITE and soldiers are at back . The Recruits are at R. , and Villagers are at L. File of soldiers at C. Enter BALANCE and STEWARD , L. Ste. Steward We did not miss her till the evening , sir ; and then , searching for her in the chamber that was my young master 's , we found her clothes there ; but the suit that your son left in the loft , when he went to London , was gone . Bal . Balance ( R. ) You ha'nt told that circumstance to any body ? Ste. Steward ( L. ) To none but your worship . Bal . Balance And be sure you do n't . Go into the dining-room , and tell Captain Plume that I beg to speak with him . Ste. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If he have any hand in her disappearance , we 'll soon know it . Enter Justice SCALE . Scale . ' T is not to be borne , Mr. Balance ! ' T is not to be borne ! Good morning , Mr. Scruple ! SCRUPLE comes forward . Bal . Balance What 's not to be borne , Mr. Scale ? Good morning , Justice Scruple ! Scale . These military scapegraces are not to be borne with , Mr. Balance . Here , without , your constable has one in custody for a villainous imposition on a poor girl . Her father is my tenant ,  --  and , if I mistake not , her mother nursed your Sylvia . Scr . Scruple Look ye , Mr. Scale , I shall be very tender in what regards the officers of the army ! They expose their lives to so many dangers abroad , we may give them some grains of allowance at home ! Scale . Allowance ! allowance ! Scr . Scruple Well , well , I only speak in reference to Captain Plume ; this spark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enters , R. Bal . Balance Captain , you 're welcome . Plume . Gentlemen , I thank you . Scr . Scruple Come , honest captain , sit by me . PLUME sits upon the bench , L. Now produce your prisoners . Scale . Now , captain , we 'll furnish you with a recruit just fit for the wars : a young jackanapes , that 's not fit for peaceable society . Enter CONSTABLE , with SYLVIA , C. , followed by BULLOCK and ROSE . Const . Constable Come in , friend Pinch . Syl . Sylvia Well , I 'm here ! What then ? Const . Constable What then ? Is that your respect to his Majesty 's bench of justices ? Syl . Sylvia Sir , I do n't care a farthing for you , nor your bench of justices , neither . Scr . Scruple Look ye , gentlemen , that 's enough ; he 's a very impudent fellow , and fit for a soldier . Scale . A notorious rogue , I say , and very fit for a soldier . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I think he 's a very pretty fellow , and therefore fit for a soldier . Bal . Balance Pray , captain , read the articles of war ; we 'll see him listed immediately . Plume . Reads . " Articles of war , against mutiny , desertion , etc . " Syl . Sylvia Hold , sir . Once more , gentlemen , have a care what you do ; for you shall severely smart for any violence you offer to me ; and you , Mr. Balance  --  I speak to you particularly  --  you shall heartily repent it . Plume . Rises . Look ye , young spark  --  Syl . Sylvia ( L. ) Good Captain Huff-cap ! you had better be quiet ; I shall find a way to cool your courage . Bal . Balance He 's certainly mad . Pray , captain , read the articles of war . Syl . Sylvia Hold , once more ! Pray , Mr. Justice Balance , to you I speak ! Bal . Balance Rising and coming forward . To me ? Aside . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short , as he seems to recognize her . Syl . Sylvia My father is as good a man as any upon your bench ! Bal . Balance Aside . The hussy ! What trick is this ? Syl . Sylvia Suppose , sir , I were your child , would you use me at this rate ? Bal . Balance Affecting rage . My child ! I ' faith , were you mine , I 'd send ye to Bedlam first , and to the army afterward ! Syl . Sylvia But consider my father , sir : I 'm his only child ; perhaps the loss of me may break his heart . Bal . Balance He 's a very great fool , if it does . Captain , if you do n't list him this minute , I 'll leave the court . Plume . Kite , do you distribute the levy-money to the men , while I read . Kite . Ay , sir . Silence , gentlemen ! Gives money to Recruits . PLUME reads the articles of war . Plume . Reads . " Articles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who shall presume to quit his post , without orders from his commanding officer , shall suffer death . " KITE gives money . Syl . Sylvia In alarm . Suffer death ! Plume . " Secondly  --  Any soldier who shall presume to indulge in Claret , Burgundy , and Champagne , out of his private pay , shall suffer death . " Syl . Sylvia More alarmed . Two deaths ! Plume . " Thirdly  --  Any soldier who shall presume to erect churches , hospitals , or other public buildings , out of his private pay , shall suffer death . " Syl . Sylvia Still more alarmed . What , three deaths ! Bal . Balance Very well ; now , captain , let me beg the favor of you not to discharge this fellow , upon any account whatsoever . Bring in the rest . Kite . There are no more , a n't please your worship . Bal . Balance No more ! There were five , two hours ago . Kite . ' T is true , sir ; but this rogue of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eleven shillings a man , because , he said , the act allowed him but ten , so the odd shilling was clear gains . Bal . Balance Then ' t is my opinion , that this constable be put into the captain 's hands . Scale &; Scr . Scruple Agreed , agreed . Plume . Mr. Kite , take the constable into custody . Kite . Aye , aye , sir ! Fall in , you rascals ! Fall in ! Give us your Grenadier 's March , Mr. Fife and Drummer ! Forward , march ! Recruits fall in between the file of soldiers and march out , SYLVIA trying to elude them and appealing to the Justices , who exit R. ; shakes her finger at PLUME , who goes out after them ; kissing her hand to ROSE , and shaking her finger at BALANCE , who is left alone and sits buried in thought , as all leave the scene . Bal . Balance Was ever man so imposed upon ! I had her promise , indeed , that she would never dispose of herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , given her away as my act and my deed ; and this , I warrant , the captain thinks will pass . No , I shall never pardon him the villany . Her extravagant passion might encourage her in the attempt , but the contrivance must be his . He returns ! Cunning for cunning ! Let me smother my just resentment ! Re-enter PLUME , R. Pray , captain , what have you done with your young gentleman soldier ? Plume . Why , he 's at my quarters by this time , I suppose , with the rest of my men . Bal . Balance With the rest of your men ! Hem ! Shall he keep company with the common soldiers ? Plume . Well , not exactly ; but the young rogue fell in love with Rose , and has been with her , I think , since she came to town . Bal . Balance All 's safe , I find .  --  Now , captain , you must know , that the young fellow 's impudence in court was well grounded ; he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do from my soul . Plume . Ay ! for what reason ? Bal . Balance Because he was no less than what he said he was ,  --  born of as good a family as any in this country ; and he is heir to twenty thousand pounds a year . Plume . I am very glad to hear it , for I wanted but a man of that quality to make my company a perfect representative of the whole commons of England . Bal . Balance Wo n't you discharge him ? Plume . Not under a hundred pounds sterling . Bal . Balance You shall have it , for his father is my most intimate friend . Plume . Then you shall have him for nothing . Bal . Balance Nay , sir , you shall have your price . Plume . Not a penny , sir ; I value an obligation to you much above a hundred pounds . Bal . Balance Perhaps , sir , you sha n't repent your generosity . Will you please to write his discharge in my pocketbook ? In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waits there ? Enter WILLIAM , C. Go to the captain 's lodging , and inquire for Mr. Wilful : tell him his captain wants him here immediately . Wil . William Sir , the gentleman 's below yet . He has not left the house . Plume . Bid him come up . Exit WILLIAM , R. Here 's the discharge , sir . Bal . Balance Sir , I thank you ; ' t is plain he had no hand in it . Enter SYLVIA , C. Syl . Sylvia I think , captain , you might have used me better than to leave me yonder among your swearing drunken crew ; and you , Mr. Justice , might have been so civil as to have invited me to dinner , for I have eaten with as good a man as your worship . Plume . Sir , you must charge our want of respect upon our ignorance of your quality ; but now you are at liberty ,  --  I have discharged you . Syl . Sylvia Discharged me ? Bal . Balance Yes , sir ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Syl . Sylvia My father ! then I am discovered . Oh , sir , I expect no pardon . Kneeling . Bal . Balance Pardon ! no , no , child , your crime shall be your punishment : here , captain Puts SILVIA over to C. , I deliver her over to the conjugal power for her chastisement . Since she will be a wife , be you a husband , a very husband ;  --  when she tells you of her love , upbraid her with her folly : be modishly ungrateful , because she has been unfashionably kind ; and use her worse than you would any body else , because you ca n't use her so well as she deserves . Plume . ( L. ) And are you Sylvia , in good earnest ? Syl . Sylvia ( C. ) Earnest ! I have gone too far to make it jest , sir . Plume . And do you give her to me in good earnest ? Bal . Balance ( R. ) If you please to take her , sir . Plume . Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resign my freedom  --  and to your beauty , my ambition ; greater in obeying at your feet , than commanding at the head of an army . Enter WORTHY and MELINDA , C. Wor . Worthy I am sorry to hear , Mr. Balance , that your daughter is lost . Bal . Balance So am not I , sir , since an honest gentleman has found her . Mel . Melinda Pray , Mr. Balance , what 's become of my cousin Sylvia ? Bal . Balance Your cousin Sylvia is talking yonder with your cousin Plume . Mel . and Wor . Melinda and Worthy How ! Syl . Sylvia Do you think it strange , cousin , that a woman should change ? I altered my outside , because I was the same within , and only laid by the woman , to make sure of my man . Mel . Melinda A good example , sir , will go a great way . When my cousin is pleased to surrender , ' t is probable I sha' n't hold out much longer . Gives her hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Captain ! Captain ! I ca n't find our last recruit anywhere , and here 's his wife crying her eyes out after him . Plume . Search no further , sergeant , I 've captured the rogue ,  --  and as for this girl , my dear , I have promised to take care of her ! Syl . Sylvia She shall be my charge . You may find it business enough to take care of me ! Rose . Then I 'll be well provided , for Sergeant Kite , he has promised to take care of me too . Enter BRAZEN , R. Bra . Brazen ( R. ) Gentlemen , I am yours  --  madam , I am not yours . Mel . Melinda I 'm glad o n't , sir . Bra . Brazen So am I  --  Ah ! Mr. Laconic ! Crosses to BALANCE . Bal . Balance ' T is time to right all mistakes .  --  My name , sir , is Balance . Bra . Brazen Balance ! sir , I 'm your most obedient  --  I know the Brazens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you 're just in time to share my good fortune . Yes  --  instead of the twenty thousand pounds you have lost , you shall have the twenty thousand recruits I have raised . My commission I lay down , to be taken up by some braver fellow , that has more merit , and less good fortune . Wor . Worthy But now , my dear Plume , that we have retrieved our wives  --  yours from the army , and mine from herself  --  how shall we keep ' em , think ye ? Plume . How ? EPILOGUE . Syl . Sy lvia By being good husbands ! The great secret for keeping matters right in wedlock , is never to quarrel with your wives for trifles ; for we are but babes at best , and must have our playthings , our longings , our fashions , and our vapors ! Therefore I say , ' t is better to let a woman play the fool , than provoke her to play the devil ! By some the sex is blam 'd without design , Others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secure in her all-conquering charms , Laughs at the vain efforts of false alarms . He magnifies their conquests , who complains , For none would struggle , were they not in chains . CURTAIN . Back matter END .
