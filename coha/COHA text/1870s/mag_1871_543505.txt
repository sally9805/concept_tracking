MOUNTAINEERING IN THE SIERRA NEVADA . III . THE ASCENT OF MOUNT TYNDALL . MORNING dawned brightly upon our bivouac among a cluster of dark firs in the mountain corridor , opened by an ancient glacier of King 's River into the heart of the Sierras . It dawned a trifle sooner than we could bave wished , but Professor Brewer and Hoffman had breakfasted before sunrise , and were off with barometer and theodolite upon their shoulders , purposing to ascend our amphitheatre to its bead and climb a great pyramidal peak which swelled up against the eastern sky , closing the view in that direction . We who remained in camp spent the day in overhauling campaign materials and preparing for a grand assault upon the summits . For a couple of hours we could descry our friends through the field-glasses , their minute black forms moving slowly on among piles of giant debris ; now and then lost , again coming into view , and at last disappearing altogether . It was twilight , and almost eight o'clock , when they came back to camp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they sat down by our fire without uttering a word , we read upon their faces terrible fatigue . So we hastened to give them supper of coffee and soup , bread and venison ; which resulted , after a time , in our getting in return the story of the day . For eight whole hours they had worked up over granite and snow , mounting ridge after ridge , till the summit was made about two o'clock . These snowy crests bounding our view at the eastward we had all along taken to be the summits of the Sierra , and Brewer had supposed himself to be climbing a dominant peak , from which he might look eastward over Owen 's Valley and out upon leagues of desert . Instead of this a vast wall of mountains , lifted still higher than his peak , rose beyond a tremendous cai*on which lay like a trough between the two parallel ranks of peaks . Hoffman showed us on his sketch-book the profile of this new range , and I instantly recognized the peaks which I had seen from Mariposa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them the highest points of California . For a couple of months my friends had made me the target of plenty of pleasant banter about my " highest land , " which they lost faith in as we climbed from Thomas 's Mill , - I too becoming a trifle anxious about it ; but now that the truth had burst upon Brewer and Hoffman they could not find words to describe the terribleness and grandeur of the deep caf*on , nor for picturing those huge crags towering in line at the east . Their peak , as indicated by the barometer , was in the region of thirteen thousand four hundred feet , and a level across to the farther range showed its crests to be at least fifteen hundred feet higher . They had spent hours upon the summit scanning the eastern horizon , and ranging downward into the labyrinth of gulfs below , and had come at last with reluctance to the belief that to cross this gorge and ascend the eastern wall of peaks was utterly impossible . Brewer and Hoffman were old climbers , and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it ; but early next morning I had made up my mind , and , taking Cotter aside , I asked him in an easy manner whether he would like to penetrate the Terra Incognita with me at the risk of our necks , provided Brewer should consent . In a frank , courageous tone he answered , after his usual mode , " Why not ? " Stout of limb , stronger yet of // 65 heart , of iron endurance , and a quiet , unexcited temperament , and , better yet , deeply devoted to me , I felt that Cotter was the one comrade I would choose to face death with , for I believed there was in his manhood no room for fear or shirking . It was a trying moment for Brewer when we found him and volunteered to attempt a campaign for the top of California , because he felt a certain fatherly responsibility , a natural desire that we should not deposit our triturated remains in some undiscoverable hole among the feldspathic granites ; but , like a true disciple of science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know more of the unexplored region . He freely confessed that he believed the plan madness , and Hoffman , too , told us we might as well attempt to get on a cloud as to try the peak . As Brewer gradually yielded his consent , I knew by his conversation that there was a possibility of success ; so we spent the rest of the day in making preparations . Our walking-shoes were in excellent condition , the hobnails firm and new . We laid out a barometer , a compass , a pocket-level , a set of wet and dry thermometers , note-books , with bread , cooked beans , and venison enough to last a week , and rolled them all in blankets , making two knapsack-shaped packs ( strapped firmly together with loops for the arms ) , which , by Brewer 's estimate , weighed forty pounds apiece . Gardner declared he would accompany us to the summit of the first range to look over into the gulf we were to cross , and at last Brewer and Hoffman also concluded to go up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all betook ourselves to bed , vainly hoping to get a long refreshing sleep from which we should rise ready for our tramp . Never did a man welcome those first gray streaks in the east more gladly than I , unless it may be Cotter , who has in later years confessed that he did not go to sleep that night . Long VOL . XXVIII. - NO. i6*. 5 before sunrise we had done our breakfast and were under way , Hoffman kindly bearing my pack , and Brewer carrying Cotter 's . Our way led due east up the amphitheatre and toward Mount Brewer , as we had named the great pyramidal peak . Awhile after leaving camp , slant sunlight streamed in among gilded pinnacles along the slope of Mount Brewer , touching here and there , in broad dashes of yellow , the gray walls , which rose sweeping up on either hand like the sides of a ship . Our way along the valley 's middle ascended over a number of huge steps , rounded and abrupt , at whose bases were pools of transparent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scattered companies of alpine firs , of red bark and having cypresslike darkness of foliage , fields of snow under shelt*ring cliffs , and bits of softest velvet meadow clouded with minute blue and white fbwers . As we climbed , the gorge grew narrow and sharp , both sides wilder ; and the spurs which projected from them , nearly overhanging the middle of the valley , towered above us with sculpture more and more severe . We frequently crossed deep fields of snow , and at last reached the level of the highest pines , where long slopes of dibris swept down from either cliff , meeting in the middle . Over and among these immense blocks , often twenty and thirty feet high , we were obliged to climb , hearing far below us the subterranean gurgle of streams . Interlocking spurs nearly closed the gorge behind us ; our last view was through a granite gateway formed of two nearly vertical precipices , sharpedged , jutting buttress-like , and plunging down into a field of angular boulders which fill the valley bottom . The eye ranged out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with its moraine-terraced walls the domes of granite upon Big Meadows , and the undulating stretch of forest which descends to the plain . // The gorge turning southward , we rounded a sort of mountain promontory , which , closing the view behind us , shut us up in the bottom of a perfect basin . In front lay a placid lake reflecting the intense black-blue of the sky . Granite , stained with purple and red , sank into it upon one side , and a broad , spotless field of snow came down to its margin upon the other . From a pile of large granite blocks , forty or fifty feet up above the lake margin , we could look down fully a hundred feet through the transparent water to where boulders and pebbles were strewn upon the stone bottom . We had now reached the base of Mount Brewer and were skirting its southern spurs in a wide open corridor surrounded in all directions by lofty granite crags from two to four thousand feet high ; above the limits of vegetation , rocks , lakes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closely about us . Two sounds - a sharp little cry of martens , and occasional heavy crashes of falling rock - saluted us . Climbing became exceedingly difficult , light air - for we had already reached twelve thousand five hundred feet - beginning to tell upon our lungs to such an extent that my friend , who had taken turns with me in carrying my pack , was unable to do so any longer , and I adjusted it to my own shoulders for the rest of the day . After four hours of slow , laborious work we made the base of the de*bris slope which rose about a thousand feet to a saddle-pass in the western mountain wall , - that range upon which Mount Brewer is so prominent a point . We were nearly an hour in toiling up this slope over an uncertain footing which gave way at almost every step . At last , when almost at the top , we paused to take breath , and then all walked out upon the crest , laid off our packs , and sat down together upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a word was spoken . The Sierras are here two parallel summit ranges . We were upon the crest of the western ridge , and looked down into a gulf five thousand feet deep , sinking from our feet nearly or quite two thousand feet in abrupt cliffs whose base plunged into a broad field of snow lying steep and smooth for a great distance , but broken near its foot by craggy steps often a thousand feet high . Vague blue haze obscured the lost depths , hiding details , and giving a bottomless distance , out of which , like the breath of wind , floated up a faint tremor , vibrating upon the senses , yet never clearly heard . Rising on the other side , cliff above cliff , precipice piled upon precipice , rock over rock , up against the sky , towered the most gigantic mountain-wall in America , culminating in a noble pile of Gothic-finished granite and enamellike snow . How grand and inviting looked its white form , its untrodden , unknown crest , so high and pure in the clear strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his life ; and for just one moment I would have rather liked to dodge that purpose , or to have waited , or have found some excellent reason why I might not go ; but all this quickly vanished , leaving a cheerful resolve to go ahead . From the two opposing mountainwalls singular , thin , knife-blade ridges of stone jutted out , dividing the sides of the gulf into a series of amphitheatres , each one a labyrinth of ice and rock . Piercing thick beds of snow , sprang up knobs and straight isolated spires of rock , mere obelisks curiously carved by frost , their rigid , slender forms casting a blue , sharp shadow upon the snow . Embosomed in depressions of ice , or resting on broken ledges , were azure lakes , deeper in tone than the sky , which at this altitude , even at midday , has a violet duskiness . To the south , not more than eight miles , a wall of peaks stood across the gulg dividing the King 's , which flowed north at our feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trough in the opposite direction . I did not wonder that Brewer and Hoffman pronounced our undertaking impossible ; but when I looked at Cotter there was such complete bravery in his eye that I asked him if he was ready to start . His old answer , " Why not ? " left the initiative with me ; so I told Professor Brewer that we would bid him good by . Our friends helped us on with our packs and we shook hands in silence . Before he released my hand Professor Brewer asked me for my plan , and I had to own that I had but one , which was to reach the highest peak in the range . After looking in every direction I was obliged to confess that I saw as yet no practicable way . We bade them a good by , receiving their " God bless you " in return , and started southward along the range to look for some cliff possible to descend . Brewer , Gardner , and Hoffman turned north to push upward to the summit of Mount Brewer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we halted , until at last , on the very summit , their microscopic forms were for the last time discernible . With very great difficulty we climbed a peak which surmounted our wall just to the south of the pass , and , looking over the eastern brink , found that the precipice was still sheer and unbroken . In one place , where the snow lay against it to the very top , we went to its edge and contemplated the slide . About three thousand feet of unbroken white , at a fearfully steep angle , lay below us . We threw a stone over and watched it bound until it was lost in the distance ; after fearful leaps we could only detect it by the flashings of snow where it struck , and as these were , in some instances , three hundred feet apart , we decided not to launch our own valuable bodies , and the still more precious barometer , after it . There seemed but one possible way to reach our goal ; that was to make our way along the summit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This divide sprang out from our Mount Brewer wall , about four miles to the south of us . To reach it we must climb up and down over the indented edge of the Mount Brewer wall . In attempting to do this we had a rather lively time scaling a sharp granite needle , where we found our course completely stopped by precipices four and live hundred feet in height . Ahead of us the summit continued to be broken into fantastic pinnacles , leaving us no hope of making our way along it ; so we sought the most broken part of the eastern descent , and began to climb down . The heavy knapsacks , beside wearing our shoulders gradually into a black-and-blue state , overbalanced us terribly , and kept us in constant danger of pitching headlong . At last , taking them off Cotter climbed down until he had found a resting-place upon a cleft of rock ; then I lowered them to him with our lasso , afterwards descending cautiously to his side , and taking my turn in pioneering downward , received the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manner we consumed more than half the afternoon in descending a thousand feet of broken , precipitous slope ; and it was almost sunset when we found ourselves upon the fields of level snow which lay white and thick over the whole interior slope of the amphitheatre . The gorge below us seemed utterly impassable . At our backs the Mount Brewer wall either rose in sheer cliffs or in broken , rugged stairway , such as had offered us our descent . From this cruel dilemma the cross divide furnished the only hope , and the sole chance of scaling that was at its junction with the Mount Brewer wall . Toward this point we directed our course , marching wearily over stretches of dense frozen snow , and regions of d65ris , and reaching about sunset the last alcove of the amphitheatre , just at the foot of the Mount Brewer wall . It was evidenfly impossible for us to climb it that evening , and we looked about the desolate recesses for a sheltered camping-spot . A high // b three oranite wa surrounded us upon sides , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the summit being less than two thousand feet above us , and the higher crags not unfrequently reaching three thousand feet . A single field of snow swept around the base of the rock , and covered the whole amphitheatre , except where a few spikes and rounded masses of granite rose through it , and where two frozen lakes , with their blue icedisks , broke the monotonous surface . Through the white snow-gate of our amphitheatre , as through a fame , we looked eastward upon the summit group ; not a tree , not a vestige of vegetation in sight ,  --  sky , snow , and granite the only elements in this wild picture . After searching for * shelter we at last found a granite crevice near the margin of one of the frozen lakes , - a sort of shelf just large enough for Cotter and me , - where we hastened to make our bed , having first filled the canteen from a small stream that trickled over the ice , knowing that in a few moments the rapid chill would freeze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bread , and whittled from the sides of the wooden barometer-case shavings enough to warm water for a cup of miserably tepid tea , and then , packing our provisions and instruments away at the head of the shelf , rolled ourselves in our blankets and lay down to enjoy the view . After such fatiguing exercises the mind has an almost abnormal clearness : whether this is wholly from within , or due to the intensely vitalizing mountain air , I am not sure ; probably both contribute to the state of exaltation in which all alpine climbers find themselves . The solid granite gave me a luxurious repose , and I lay on the edge of our little rock niche and watched the strange yet brilliant scene . All the know of our recess lay in the shadow of the high granite wall to the west , but the Kern divide which curved around us from the southeast was in full light ; its broken sky-line , battlemented and adorned with innumerable rough-hewn spires and pinnacles , was a mass of glowing orange intensely defined against the deep violet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to the east , the floor of snow rounded in a smooth brink , overhanging precipi*s , which sank two thousand feet into the King 's Cafion . Across the gulf rose the whole procession of sum.mit peaks , their lower halves rooted in a deep sombre shadow cast by the western wall , the heights bathed in a warm purple haze , in which the irregular marbling of snow burned with a pure crimson light . A few fleecy clouds , dyed fiery-orange , drifted slowly eastward across the narrow zone of sky which stretched from summit to summit like a roof . At times the sound of waterfalls , faint and mingled with echoes , floated up through the still air . The snow near by lay in cold ghastly shade , warmed here and there in strange flushes by light reflected downward from drifting clouds . The sombre waste about us ; the deep violet vault overhead ; those far summits , glowing with reflected rose ; the deep impenetrable gloom which filled the gorge , and slowly and with vaporlike stealth climbed the mountain-wall extinguishing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may not be described ; nor can I more than hint at the contrast between the brilliancy of the scene under full light , and the cold , deathlike repose which followed when the wan cliffs and pallid snow were all overshadowed with ghostly gray . A sudden chill enveloped us . Stars in a moment crowded through the dark heaven , flashing with a frosty splendor . The snow congealed , the brooks ceased to flow , and , under the powerful sudden leverage of frost , immense blocks were dislodged all along the mountain summits and came thundering down the slopes , booming upon the ice , dashing wildly upon the rocks . Under the lee of our shelf we felt quite safe , but neither Cotter nor I could help being startled , // and jumping just a little , as these missiles , weighing often many tons , struck the ledge over our heads and whizzed down the gorge , their stroke resounding fainter and fainter , until at last only a confused echo reached us . The thermometer at nine o'clock marked twenty degrees above zero @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together for the night . The longer I lay the less I liked that shelf of granite ; it grew hard in time and cold also , my hones seeming to approach actual contact with the chilled rock ; moreover , I found that even so vigorous a circulation as mine was not sufficient to warm up the ledge to anything like a comfortable temperature . A single thickness of blanket is a better mattress than none , but the larger crystals of orthoclase , protruding plentifully , punched my back and caused me to revolve on a horizontal axis with precision and frequency . How I loved Cotter ! how I hugged him and got warm , while our backs gradually petrified , till we whirled over and thawed them out together ! The slant of that bed was diagonal and excessive ; down it we slid till the ice chilled us awake , and we crawled back and chocked ourselves up with bits of granite inserted under my ribs and shoulders . In this pleasant position we dozed again , and there stole over me a most comfortable ease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and sank into an industrious slumber which lasted with great soundness till four , when we rose and ate our breakfast of frozen venison . The thermometer stood at two above zero ; everything was frozen tight except the canteen , which we had prudently kept between us all night . Stars still blazed brightly , and the moon , hidden from us by western cliffs , shone in pale reflection upon the rocky heights to the east , which rose , dimly white , up from the impenetrable shadows of the cafion . Silence , - cold , ghastly dimness , in which loomed huge forms , - and the biting frostiness of the air , wrought upon our feelings as we shoul dered our packs and started with slow pace to climb toward the divide . Soon , to our dismay , we found the straps had so chafed our shoulders that the weight gave us great pain , and obliged us to pad them with our handkerchiefs and extra socks , which remedy did not wholly relieve us from the constant wearing pain of the heavy load @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall which bounded us only half a mile distant , we travelled over a continuous snow-field frozen so densely as scarcely to yield at all to our tread , at the same time compressing enough to make that crisp frosty sound which we all used to enjoy , even before we knew from the books that it had something to do with the severe name of regelation . As we advanced , the snow sloped more and more steeply up toward the crags , till by and by it became quite dangerous , causing us to cut steps with Cotter 's large bowie-k nife , - a slow , tedious operation , requiring patience of a pretty permanent kind . In this way we spent a quiet social hour or so . The sun had not yet reached us , being shut out by the high amphitheatre wall ; but its cheerful light reflected downward from a number of higher crags , filling the recess with the brightness of day , and putting out of existence those shadows which so sombrely darkened the earlier hours . To look back when we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that smooth swift slope of ice carrying the eye down a thousand feet to the margin of a frozen mirror of ice ; ribs and needles of rock piercing up through the snow , so closely grouped that , had we fallen , a miracle only might save us from being dashed against them . This led to rather deeper steps , and greater care that our burdens should be held more nearly over the centre of gravity , and it was a pleasant relief when we got to the top of the snow and sat down on a block of granite to breathe and look in search of a way up the thousand-foot cliff of broken surface among the lines of frac // ture and the galleries winding along the face . It would have disheartened us to gaze up the hard , sheer front of precipices , and search among splintered projections , crevices and shelves , . and snow-patches for an inviting route , had we not been animated by a faith that the mountains could not baffle us . Choosing what looked like the least impossible way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work with packs on , resumed the yesterday s plan , - Cotter taking the lead , climbing about fifty feet ahead , and hoisting up the knapsacks and barometer as I tied them to the end of the lasso . Constantly closing up in hopeless difficulty before us the way opened again and again to our gymnastics , till we stood together upon a mere shelg not more than two feet wide , which led diagonally up the smooth cliff . Edging along in careful steps , our backs flattened upon the granite , we moved slowly to a broad platform , where we stopped for breath . There was no foothold above us . Looking down over the course we had come , it seemed , and I really believe it was , an impossible descent ; for one can climb upward with safety where he can not climb downward . To turn back was to give up in defeat and we sat at least half an hour , suggesting all possible routes to the summit , accepting none , and feeling woful . About thirty feet directly over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach , seemed to offer at least a temporary way upward . On its edge were two or three spikes of granite ; whether firmly connected with the cliff or merely blocks of debris we could not tell from below . I said to Cotter I thought of but one possible plan : it was to lasso one of these blocks , and to climb , sailor-fashion , hand over hand , up the rope . In the lasso I had perfect confidence , for I had seen more than one Spanish bull throw his whole weight against it without parting a strand . The shelf was so narrow that throwing the coil of rope was a very difficult undertaking . I tried three times , and Cotter spent July , five minutes vainly whirling the loop up at the granite spikes . At last I made a lucky throw , and it tightened upon one of the smaller protuberances . I drew the noose close , and very gradually threw my hundred and fifty pounds upon the rope ; then Cotter joined me , and for a moment we both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved slightly or whether the lasso stretched a little , we were unable to decide ; but the trial must be made , and I began to climb slowly . The smooth precipice - face against which my body swung offered no foothold , and the whole climb had therefore to be done by the arms , an effort requiring all one 's determination . When about half-way up I was obliged to rest , and , curling my feet in the rope , managed to relieve my arms for a moment . In this position I could not resist the fascinating temptation of a survey downward . Straight down , nearly a thousand feet below , at the foot of the rocks , began the snow , whose steep , roof-like slope , exaggerated in to an almost vertical angle , curved down in a long white field , broken far away by rocks and round polished lakes of ice . Cotter looked up cheerfully and asked h'ow I was making it ; to which I answered that I had plenty of wind left . At that moment , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfaction to look down at the wild gulf of desolation beneath , and up to unknown dangers ahead , and feel my nerves cool and unshaken . A few pulls hand over hand brought me to the edge of the shelf , when , throwing an arm around the granite spike , I swung my body upon the shelf and lay down to rest , shouting to Cotter that I was all right , and that the prospects upward were capital . After a few mQments ' breathing I looked over the brink and directed my comrade to tie the barometer to the lower end of the lasso , which he did , and that precious instrument was hoisted to my station , and the lasso sent down twice for knapsacks , after which Cotter came Mountaineering in the Sierra Nevada . // up the rope in his very muscular way , without once stopping to rest . We took our loads in our hands , swinging the barometer over my shoulder , and climbed up a shelf which led in a zigzag direction upward , and to the south , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ridge which connected a short distance above with the summit . It was formed of huge blocks , shattered , and ready , at a touch , to fall bounding and careening in a way that lent us new caution . So narrow and sharp was the upper slope , that we dared not walk , but got astride , and worked slowly along with our hands , pushing the knapsacks in advance , now and then holding our breath when loose masses rocked under our weight . Once upon the summit , a grand view burst upon us . Hastening to step upon the crest of the divide , which was never more than ten feet wide , frequently sharpened to a mere blade , we looked down the other side , and were astonished to find we had ascended the gentler slope , and that the rocks fell from our feet in almost vertical precipices for a thousand feet or more . A glance along the summit toward the highest group showed us that any advance in that direction was impossible , for the thin ridge was gashed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forming a procession of pillars , obelisks , and blocks piled upon each other , and looking terribly insecure . We then deposited our knapsacks in a safe place , and , finding that it was already noon , determined to rest a little while and take a lunch , at over thirteen thousand feet above the sea . West of us stretched the Mount Brewer wall with its succession of smooth precipices and amphithe*re ridges . To the north the great gorge of the King 's River yawned down five thousand feet . To the south the valley of the Kern , opening in the opposite direction , was broader , less deep , but more filled with broken masses of granite . Clustered about the foot of the divide were a dozen alpine lakes ; 71 the higher ones blue sheets of ice ? the lowest completery melted . Still lower in the depths of the two cafions we could see thin groups of foresttrees ; but they were so dim and so distant as never to relieve the prevalent masses of rock and snow . Our divide cast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue profile upon the broad sheets of sunny snow , from whose brightness the hard splintered cliffs caught reflections and wore an aspect of joy . Thousands of rills poured from the melting snow , filling the air with a musical tinkle as of many accordant bells . The Kern Valley opened below us with its smooth oval outline , the work of extinct glaciers , whose form and extent were evident from worn cliff- surface and rounded wall ; snow-fields , relics of the former n6vd , hung in white tapestries around its ancient birthplace ; and , as far as we could see , the broad , corrugated valley , for a breadth of fully ten miles , shone with burnishings , wherever its granite surface was not covered with lakelets or thickets of alpine vegetation . Through a deep cut in the Mount Brewer wall we gained our first view to the westward , and saw in the distance the wall of the South King 's Caflon , and the granite point which Cotter and I had climbed a fortnight before . But for the haze we might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were several points of the Coast Ranges , isolated like islands in the sea . The view was so grand , the mountain colors so brilliant , the immense snow-fields and the blue alpine lakes so charming , that we almost forgot we were ever to move , and it was only after a swift hour of this delight that we began to consider our future course . The King 's Cafion2 which headed against our wall , seemed untraversable , - no human being could climb along the divide ; we had then but one hope of reaching the peak , and our greatest difficulty lay at the start . If we could climb down to the Kern side of the Mountaineering in the Sierra Nevada . // divide , and succeed in reaching the base of the preeipices which fell from our feet , it really looked as if we might travel without difficulty among the roches moutonnies to the other side of the Kern Valley , and make our attempt upon the southward flank of the great peak . One look at the sublime white giant decided us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first could see no method of descent . Then we went back and looked at the road we had come up , to see if that were possibly not so bad ; but the broken surface of the rocks was evidently much better climbing-ground than anything ahead of us . Cotter , with danger , edged his way along the wall to the east , and I to the west , to see if there might not be some favorable point ; but we both returned with the belief that the precipice in front of us was as passable as any of it . Down it we must go . After lying on our faces , looking over the brink , ten or twenty minutes , I suggested that by lowering ourselves on the rope we might climb from crevice to crevice ; but we saw no shelf large enough for ourselves and the knapsucks too . However , we were not going to give it up without a trial ; and I made the rope fast round my breast , and , looping the noose over a firm point of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forty feet below . There was only room beside me for Cotter , so I made him send down the knapsacks first . I then tied these together by the straps with my silk handkerchiefs , and hung them off as far to the left as I could reach without losing my balance , looping the handkerchiefs over a point of rock . Cotter then slid down the rope , and , with considerable difficulty , we whipped the noose off its resting-place above , and cut off our connection with the upper world . " We re in for it now , King , " remarked my comrade , as he looked aloft , and then down ; but our blood was up , and danger added only an exhilarating thrill to the nerves . The shelf was hardly more than two feet wide , and the granite so smooth July , that we could find no place to fasten the lasso for the next descent ; so I determined to try the climb with only as little aid as possible . Tying the lasso round my breast again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he , bracing his back against the cliii ; found for himself as firm a foothold as he could , and promised to give me all the help in his power . I made up my mind to bear no weight unless it was absolutely necessary ; and for the first ten feet I found cracks and protuberances enough to support me , making every square inch of surface do friction duty , and hugging myself against the rocks as tightly as I could . When within about eight feet of the next shelf , 1 twisted myself round upon the face , hanging by two rough blocks of protruding feldspar , and looked vainly for some further hand-hold ; but the rock , beside being perfectly smooth , projected slightly , and my legs dangled in the air . I saw that the next cleft was over three feet broad , and I thought , possibly , I might , by a quick slide , reach it in safety without endangering Cotter . I shouted to him to be very careful , and let go in case I fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly down . My shoulder struck against the rock and threw me out of balance ; for an instant I reeled over upon the verge , in danger of falling , but , in the excitement , I thrust out m* hand and seized a small alpine gooseberry-bush , the first piece of vegetation we had seen . Its roots were so firmly fixed in the crevice that it held my weight and saved me . I could no longer see Cotter , but I talked to him , and heard the two knapsacks come bumping along till they slid over the eaves above me , and swung down to my station , when I seized the lasso 's end and braced myself as well as J ) OSsible , intending , if he slipped , to haul in slack and help him as best I might . As he came slowly down from crack to crack , I heard his hobnailed shoes grating on the granite ; presently they appeared dangling from the eaves above my head . I had gathered in the rope until Mountaineering in the Sierra Nevada @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told him to drop . He hesitated a moment and let go . Before he struck the rock I had him by the shoulder , and whirled him down upon his side , thus preventing his rolling overboard , - which friendly action he took quite coolly . The third descent was not a difficult one , nor the fourth ; but when we had climbed down about two hundred and fifty feet the rocks were so glacially polished and water-worn , that it seemed impossible to get any farther . To our tight was a crack penetrating the rock perhaps a foot deep , widening at the surface to three or four inches , which proved to be the only possible ladder . As the chances seemed rather desperate , we concluded to tie ourselves together , in order to share a common fate ; and with a slack of thirty feet between us , and our knapsacks upon our backs , we climbed into the crevice , and began descending with our faces to the cliff . This had to be done with unusual caution , for the foothold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slipped annoyingly on the smooth stone ; besides , the knapsacks and i*istruments kept a steady backward pull , tending to overbalance us . But we took pains to descend one at a time , and rest wherever the niches gave our feet a safe support . In this way we got down about eighty feet of smooth , nearly vertical wall , reaching the top of a rude granite stairway , which led to the snow ; and here we sat down to rest , and found to our astonishment that we had been three hours in coming from the summit . After breathing a half- minute we continued down , jumping from rock to rock , and having by practice become very expert in balancing ourselves , sprang on , never resting long enough to lose the aplomb , and in this manner made a quick descent over rugged dibris to the crest of a snow - field , which , for seven or eight hundred feet more , swept down in a smooth , even slope , of very high angle , to the borders of a frozen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we sprang upon the snow with a shout , and glissaded down splendidly , turning now and then a somersault , and shooting out like cannon-balls almost to the middle of the frozen lake ; I upon my back , and Cotter feet first , in a swimming position . The ice cracked in all directions . It was only a thin , transparent film , through which we could see deep into the lake . Untying ourselves , we hurried ashore in different directions , lest our combined weight should be too great a strain upon any point . With curiosity and wonder we scanned every shelf and niche of the last descent . It seemed quite impossible we could have come down there , and now it actually was beyond human power to get back again . But what cared we ? " Sufficient unto the day - " We were bound for that still distant , though gradually nearing , summit ; and we had come from a cold shadowed cliff into deliciously warm sunshine , and were jolly , shouting , singing songs , and calling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away , with no grave danger , no great difficulty , between us , lay the base of our grand mountain . Upon its skirts we saw a little grove of pines , an ideal bivouac , and toward this we bent our course . After the continued climbing of the day , walking was a delicious rest , and forward we pressed with considerable speed , our hobnails giving us firm footing on the glittering glacial surface . Every fluting of the great valley was in itself a considerable cation , into which we descended , climbing down the scored rocks , and swinging from block to block until we reached the level of the pines . Here , sheltered among rockes mou/onndes , began to appear little fields of alpine grass , pale yet sunny , soft under our feet , fragrantly jewelled with flowers of fairy delicacy , holding up amid thickly clustered blades chalices of turquoise and amethyst , white stars , and fiery little globes of red . Lakelets , small but innumerable , were held in the glacial // basins , the strke and grooves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One of these lakes , a sheet of pure beryl hue , gave us much pleasure from its lovely transparency , and we lay down in the necklace of grass about it and smelled the flowers , while tired muscles relaxed upon warm beds of verdure , and the pain in our burdened shoulders went away , leaving us delightfully comfortable . After the stern grandeur of granite and ice , and with the peaks and walls still in view , it was relief to find ourselves again in the region of life . I never felt for trees and flowers such a sense of intimate relationship and sympathy . When we had no longer excuse for resting , I invented the palpable subterfuge of measuring the altitude of the spot , since the few clumps of low , wideboughed pines near by were the highest living trees . So we lay longer with less and less will to rise , and when resolution called us to our feet the getting up was sorely like Rip Van Winkle 's in the third act . The deep glacial cafion - flutings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be great consumers of time ; indeed , it was sunset when we reached the eastern ascent , and began to toil up through scattered pines , and over trains of moraineal rocks , toward the great peak . Stars were already flashing brilliantly in the sky , and the low glowing arch in the west had almost vanished when we reached the upper trees , and threw down our knapsacks to camp . The forest grew on a sort of plateaushelf with a precipitous front to the west , - a level surface which stretched eastward and back to the foot of our mountain , whose lower spurs reached within a mile of camp . Within the shelter lay a huge fallen log , like all these alpine woods , one mass of resin , which flared up when we applied a match , illuminating the whole grove . By contrast with the darkness outside , we seemed to be in a vast , inany-pillared hall . The stream close by afforded water for our blessed teapot ; July , venison frizzled with mild , appetizing sound upon the ends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seductively crisp upon our tin plates . That supper seemed to me then the quintessence of gastronomy , and I am sure Cotter and I must have said some very good air ? s-diner things , though I long ago forgot them all . Within the ring of warmth , on elastic beds of pine-needles , we curled up , and fell swiftly into a sound sleep . I woke up once in the night to look at my watch , and observed that the sky was overcast with a thin film of cirrus cloud , to which the reflected moonlight lent the appearance of a glimmering tent stretched from mountain to mountain over cafions filled with impenetrable darkness , with only the vaguely lighted peaks and white snowfields distinctly seen . I closed my eyes and slept soundly until Cotter woke me at half past three , when we arose , breakfasted by the light of our fire , which still blazed brilliantly , and , leaving our knapsacks , started for the mountain with nothing but instruments , canteens , and luncheon . In the indistinct moonlight climbing was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our way along a plain which was literally covered with glacier boulders , and innumerable brooks which when we crossed were frozen solid . Howeyer , our march brought us to the base of the great mountain , which , rising high against the east , shut out the coming daylight , and kept us in profound shadow . From base to summit rose a series of broken crags , lifting themselves from a general slope of dtfbris . Toward the left the angle seemed to be rather gentler , and the surface less ragged ; and we hoped , by a long ditour round the base , to make an easy climb up this gentler face . So we toiled on for an hour over the debris , reaching at last the bottom of the north slope . Here our work began in good earnest . The rocks were of enormous size , and in every stage of unstable equilibrium , frequently rolling over as we jumped upon them , making it necessary for us to take a Moun**in*ering in the Sierra Nevada . // second leap and land where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the largest blocks , reaching a smaller size , which served us as a sort of stairway . The advancing daylight revealed to us a very long , comparatively even snow-slope , whose surface was pierced by many knobs and granite heads , giving it the aspect of an ice-roofing fastened on with bolts of stone . It stretched in far perspective to the summit , where already the rose of sunrise reflected gloriously , kindling a fresh enthusiaswi within us . Immense boulders were partly imbedded in the ice just above us , whose constant melting left them trembling on the edge of a fall . It communicated no very pleasant sensation to see above you these immense missiles hanging by a mere band , and knowing that , as soon as the sun rose , you would be exposed to a constant cannonade . The east side of the peak , which we could now partially see , was too precipitous to think of climbing . The slope toward our camp was too much broken into pinnacles and crags to offer us any hope , or to divert us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ice , and among fragments of granite . The sun rose upon us while we were climbing the lower part of this snow , and in less than half an hour began to liberate huge blocks , which thundered down past us , gathering and growing into small avalanches below . We did not dare climb one above another , according to our ordinary mode , but kept about an equal level , a hundred feet apart , lest , dislodging the blocks , one should hurl them down upon the other . We climbed alternately up smooth faces of granite , clinging simply by the cracks and protruding crystals of feldspar , and then hewed steps up fearfully steep slopes of ice , zigzagging to the right and left to avoid the flying boulders . When midway up this slope we reached a place where the granite rose in perfectly smooth bluffs , on either side of a gorge , - a narrow cut , 75 or walled way , leading up to the flat summit of the cliff . This we scaled by cutting ice-steps , only to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ice sloped from its front at too steep an angle for us to follow , but had melted in contact with it , leaving a space of three feet wide between the ice and the rock . We entered this crevice and climbed along its bottom , with a wall of rock rising a hundred feet above us on one side , and a thirtyfoot face of ice on the other , through which light of an intense blue penetrated . Reaching the upper end , we had to cut our footsteps upon the ice again , and , having braced our backs against the granite , climb up to the surface . We were now in a dangerous position ; to fall into the crevasse upon one side was to be wedged to death between rock and ice ; to make a slip was to be shot down five hundred feet , and then hurled over the brink of a precipice . In the friendly seat which this wedge gave me I stopped to take wet and dry observations with the thermometer , - this being an absolute preventive of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The wall of our mountain sank abruptly to the left , opening for the first time an outlook to the eastward . Deep - it seemed almost vertically - beneath us we could see the blue water of Owen 's Lake , ten thousand feet down . The summit peaks to the north were piled in Titanic confusion , their ridges overhanging the eastern slope with terrible abruptness . Clustered upon the shelves and plateaus below were several frozen lakes , and in all directions swept magnificent fields of snow . The summit was now not over five hundred feet distant , and we started onagain with the exhilarating hope of success . But if Nature had intended to secure the summit from all assailants , she could not have planned her defences better ; for the smooth granite wall which rose above the snow-slope continued , apparently , quite round the peak , and we looked in great anxiety to see if there was not Mountaineering in the Sierra Nevada . // one place where it might be climbed . It was all blank , except in one place ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rose in a long point to the summit of the wall , - a great icicle-column frozen in a niche of the bluff , - its base about ten feet wide , narrowing to two feet at the top . We climbed to the base of this spire of ice , and , with the utmost care , began to cut our stairway . The material was an exceedingly compacted snow , passing into clear ice as it neared the rock . We climbed the first half of it with comparative ease ; after that it was almost vertical , and so thin that we did not dare to cut the footsteps deep enough to make them absolutely safe . There was a constant dread lest our ladder should break off , and we be thrown either down the snow-slope or into the bottom of the crevasse . At last , in order to prevent myself from falling over backwards , I was obliged to thrust my hand into the crack between the ice and the wall , and the spire became so narrow that I could do this on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon a tree , cutting mere toe-holes and embracing the whole column of ice in my arms . At last I reached the top , and , with the greatest caution , wormed my body over the brink , and , rolling out upon the smooth surface of the granite , looked over and watched Cotter make his climb . He came steadily up , with no sense of nervousness , until he got to the narrow part of the ice , and here he stopped and looked up with a forlorn face to me ; but as he climbed up over the edge the broad smile came back to his face , and he asked me if it had occurred to me that we had , by and by , to go down again . We had now an easy slope to the summit , and hurried up over rocks and ice , reaching the crest at exactly twelve o'clock . I rang my hammer upon the topmost rock ; we grasped hands , and I reverently named the grand peak MOUNT TYNDALL . Clarence King .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
