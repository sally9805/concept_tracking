txt The progress of the Greenback Party in Maine from about 600 votes in 1876 to 13,000 in the recent town elections , with a threat of 20,000 or 25,000 next Pall , shows how much can be done by the persistent and vigorous efforts of one man . New-England does not afford a favorable field for the propagation of financial delusions . There is a good deal of commonschool education and not a - little hard common sense distributed among the people , and they are not easily led into heresies which require a person to take leave of his judgment . Ordinarily , they are very tenacious of the principles and ideas in which they have been politically educated , and hence the loyalty to party which has been characteristic of the : rustic population of Maine and New-Hampshire for so many years . But now the old issues have passed away , and there has been too much of a tendency in politics to degenerate into contests between the personal supporters of the old-time leaders . The people are getting tired of having their votes counted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or HALE or FRYE , or the Democratic " war horses " who are opposing them . They want ail idea for which they can rally , an issue to fight neon , and they are ready to break away and follow almost any leader who presents something besides his personal claims or his own schemes of ambition for their support . They are ready to divide on the live questions of the hour , and it is not to be wondered at if a bold and vigorous champion , even of the wrong side , should bring together a considerable following . There is little doubt that the vitality of the Greenback movement " away down East " is mainly due to the leadership of SOLON CHASE , of Turner 's Falls , in Androscoggin County . Mr. CHASE is comparatively unknown* to fame , but he has more native talent and quite as much education as the prominent Greenback leaders who have made so much noise in the West . If ho had lived in Indiana , he would probably have been Governor and member of Congress before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasionally found in rural regions , who , by dint of more than ordinary mental vigor , considerable reading , and a talent for controversy , come to be regarded as oracles among the wondering rustics . He is one of their own class , but with a sort of superiority that leads them to look upon him as a genius , and to accept him readily as a leader . Like the more illiterate Mr. WILLIAMS , of Indiana , ho take ! : pride in his homespun garb and rude country manners . Ho goes about , whenever , the rigorous climate of his latitude will permit , with bare feet and barn head , and if his venerable cranium is shielded by a hat , it is of the style and . pattern designated as " shocking bad . " Mr. CHASE is a loud-voiced and freespoken miller , who knows all the people for many miles around , and is known of many more . He is always ready for a discussion , and for some years past has edited a local weekly paper , in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language whose homely vigor and shrewd argument are relished by them . Mr. CHASE believes that it is the proper . function of . the Government to " make money . " *He believes that whatever the Government sees fit to put out , stamped as dollars , is money , and that if it puts out plenty of it , there will be no difficulty in paying debts , getting good wages and good profits , and being generally in a prosperous and happy condition . It is an alluring notion , and its absurdity does not prevent ifs being accepted in downright earnest by a considerable class of people who think they are intelligent and sensible . by persistent andplausible argument in his paper , in the village groceries , and in frequent local debates and discussions , in which his skill has been too much for the untaught antagonists who ventured to oppose him , Mr. CHASE has evidently made au impression and set a party going which can no longer be ignored by the politicians . ' The people are running off after flies() strange doctrines , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaders have presumed too much on holding them to their allegiance without occupying their minds with living questions or : appealing to their convictions in regard to the prkiciples and policies which affect the well-being of the country . They know there are such questions and such principles , and are , instinctively , eager to bring them into their political . contests . There is no probability that the Greenback sentiment , pure and simple , can ever reach even a strong minority of the whole people of Maine , but in districts where the two political parties are nearly equally divided , it may easily turn the scale or compel the surrender of the Democrats to its claims for the sake of a local victory . It may work , like the National movement in the West , as a political leaven which shall produce a ferment in the parties and compel them to take , a more clearly-defined position on financial ' questions . It is possible that it may induce them to drop dead-and-gone controversies , give over their merely factious contests , and take up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We do not imagine that SOLON CHASE 'S party is going to accomplish much in and of itself , but it is awakening the people and stirring up the sluggish elements , and will result in more good than harm if it arouses the believers in sound finance to earnest action .
