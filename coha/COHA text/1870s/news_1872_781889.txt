txt Austria end the North-West Passage . Austria , of all civilized countries in the world , is to become a candidate for distinction in geographical discovery . In May she sends forth her own particular Polar expedition , and . hopes to do her share toward makine useful the elorious. but . save as stepping-stones , fruitless researches of Ross , Fiterrxrmi and PARRY . One gentleman , Count WmasoilEog , lute given sixteen thousand dollars to the-expedition , and . promises ninety thousand . dollars more if the Government , or other private individuals , fail to contribute it . The Vienna journals say , however , that there will not be the least difficulty on this score , and the requisite preparations are going on swimmingly . Such an effort as this is the more creditable since Austria can not , in any event , hope to profit by Arctic discovery in the same degree as more maritime nations ; while the scientific benefits that may result from success must necessarily be shared by the whole world in common . It will be remembered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of like nature was made in 1869-70 , and described in these columns . This expedition was led by tDr . PETERMANN and Herr ICOLDEIVEY , of Gotha . It consisted of two steamers , well provided for the daring experiment , but was unattended with success . The conclusion of the explorers was that the ice , forming an almost perpetual " pack " on the east coast of Greenland , rendered passage across the Arctic region by the North-west impossible . Dr. PETERZdANN was , however , persuaded that , although his steamers could not get into it , there is a north-west passage , and that his observations , as published , have demonstrated its locality . The Austrian savans believe that between Nova Zembla and Spitzbergen there exists a vast open sea , and their Expedition means to try to get into it . This retreat is supposed to be filled with whales , who have there sought refuge from man 's destructive rapacity , and that discovery is counted upon as one of the chief material advantages to be derived from the proposed attempt . Thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the long line of efforts to traverse the Pole is extended , and man , unterrified by hardship , or even by the most cruel and desolate of deaths , still obstinately persists in leaving no part of the planet he lives on unknown and unexplored . That these efforts will ultimately be crowned with success there is good reason to believe . First , because perseverance in almost anything except the search for the philosopher 's stone or perpetual motion , usually does succeed ; second , because each expedition that fails supplies the next with profitable data ; and third , because the progress of science , notably in shipbuilding , the application of steam , the use of condensed food , &c..; renders the facilities for penetrating into those frozen regions so much more extensive . Success may , indeed , be long deferred ; but it is tolerably sure to be . attained at last ; and . stranger things have happened . in the world than would be the meeting this Autumn of the Austrian and American eagles in the open Polar Sea .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
