txt At Brownsville , Ind. , there is a large and flourishing school , attended by nearly fifty boys of various sizes and sorts . Years ago the boys organized the " George Washington Debating , Natural Historical , and Baseball Temperance Society , " for the cultivation ? as the preamble to the constitution declares ? " of the bodies , minds , and souls of the members " thereof . The society met three evenings every week , and played base-ball every Saturday afternoon , and was at first a prosperous and orderly organization . In time , however , the spirit of discord made its appearance . The debates became unpleasantly personal , the base-ball matches often ended in violent quarrels , and the proprieties of natural history were violated by the riotous throwing of specimens at the heads of members of the society from whom other members differed in opinion . A few months ago a large party of disorderly boys announced that they-intended to break up the society and start a new one of their own . They , therefore , seized upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and organized their new society . The original George Washington Debating , Natural Historical , and Baseball Temperance boys demanded the return of the stolen articles , and were impudently told to take them if they could . The result was a hard-fought battle , in which many eyes were blacked and much clothing torn , but which ended in the rGcovery of the stolen property and the complete defeat of the seceders . The latter were kindly allowed to return to the society which they had endeavored to break up , and it was hoped that the society would resume its original peaceful and beneficent character . Before very long , however , it was discovered that the disorderly members were by no means repentant . It so happened that in the school-room , where the society met , the smallest boys were seated among the bad boys , and the latter constantly pulled the hair , pinched the , legs , and thrust pins into the tender portions of their helpless neighbors . This caused a good deal of disorder , and excited the indignation of the earnest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indignant opinion had no effect on the rioters . The President of the society , who was a remarkably good boy , and had taken several prizes at the Sundayschool , ventured to say that his heart bled for the persecuted little boys , but one of the persecutors made an able speech showing that , according to the constitution , the President 's heart could not lawfully bleed , and that in no circumstances could he interfere to protect the oppressed small-boys . The society , as he clearly proved , was organized in the interests of debating , natural history , base-ball , and temperance , and the President could not honestly claim that the protection of the hair and legs of little boys came under any one of those four heads . So cunning was the argument that the President humbly begged pardon , and promised that his heart should not bleed any more , and that he would not interfere in private hair-pulling under any pretense whatever . Growing bolder with impunity , the bad boys announced that , as the treasury of the society was full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dues for ' many months  --  they thought it only right that an appropriation should be made to pay for the collars and coat-tails that they had lost during the fight in which they were defeated . They also insisted that the society should supply them with pocketknives and marbles , and should furnish them with a weekly supply of pocketmoney . They proposed a dozen or more resolutions of this objectionable character , and debated them at such length that no other business could be transacted . Temperance , base-ball , and natural history were no longer so much as mentioned at the meetings . Every time the society met the struggle between the boys who wanted to get hold of the money in the treasury and the boys who wanted to defend it raged , to the utter exclusion of all other affairs . Fortunately , the bad boys have so far been unsuccessful , but there is to be an election next week , and every one concedes that if the disorderly party elects the President , the control of the society will pass into the hands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now , one would naturally think that in these circumstances the true friends of the society would try to elect a President whom they coul ' .1 . trust ; some cool , independent , fearless boy , who would:do his duty , protect the treasury , and put a stop to disorder , no matter at what risk . But , strange as it may seem , some worthy school-teachers , who profess to take a warm interest in the society , urge the boys to elect an entirely different sort of boy . They solemnly warn their young friends that if they elect a President on the ground that he is fit for the place , they will ruin the society . Such a course will be , so they pretend , a confession that the society does not deserve to exist . " Select , dear boys , " recently remarked one of the teachers , " the weakest boy you can find . To elect such a boy is a proof that you think the society strong enough to survive any attack . The moment you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confess that you need a competent leader . A more degrading confession could not be imagined . What you want is a President who either has no mind of his own , or who , in case he has a mind , does not dare to mention Elect him , and you give the strongest possible evidence of your faith in your excellent society . " Powerful as these arguments are , the boys do not seem to see their force . It is pretty well understood that they have decided to elect the boy who led them in their memorable fight with the rioters who stole the base-ball bats . That he is very far - from being a weak boy is conceded , and there is not the least doubt that he will keep order , protect the little boys from outrage , and save the treasury from plunder . The teachers protest that he is notoriously fit for the place , and that it will therefore be a shameful confession of weakness to elect him , but the boys prefer the safety of their society to all other considerations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the weakest boy alone deserves to be selected as a leader .
