DANIEL WEBSTER AND THE COMPROMISE MEASURES OF 1850 . Is it not time we reconsidered our verdict on Daniel XVebster  --  the Daniel Webster , I mean , of 1850 and the compromise measures ? But there have been two verdicts  --  a verdict of the few , in his favor , and a verdict of the many , against him . It is the verdict of the many against him concerning which I raise the question , whether it should not be revised and reversed . I herewith move to re-open the case . Speaking in the name of the majority , grown since the death of the man , until now , as it seems to me , it comprises almost the whole new American nation ; speaking in this col lective name , I ask , Were we not passionate and hasty ? We have outlived our haste and our passion , but our condemnation still rests on the man whom we condemned . Have we not done Webster wrong ? Was he guilty ? We had reason , but had we good reason ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curse on the innocent head . Let us call back our scapegoat from the wilderness , and consider whether we shall not unpronounce our curse . Let us do more . Let us make ready to change our curse into a blessing , if Webster deserves it  --  a blessing tardy , indeed , but full-hearted at last , and forty million strong . // It may be a not unsuitable act of justice , on our part , with which to celebrate and signalize this memorial year of the nation . if it was not a fall ignominiously suffered , it may have been a stand heroically maintained-that speech of the seventh of March eighteen hundred fifty . Then , too , the cycle of l ) opuIar harangues with which , during the two following years that preceded his death , he supported his speech in the Senate , will appear to have been a long agony of Laocoon , on Webster 's part , in which Laocoon stood , and did not fall ; in which he stood , and , standing , upheld the falling state of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , indeed , the fact , I devote the present paper . I accordingly invite the reader to enter with me upon a summary examination of Webster 's public course in connection with the memorable compromise measures , so called , of eighteen hundred fifty . He supported those measures in Congress and before the people . I should say , perhaps , supported the principle of those measures rather than those measures themselves . For Webster was not in the Senate when the measures were adopted , and he never pretended to approve them entirely in the form which they finally assumed . Still it is not too much , probably , to say that his influence carried them in Congress ; and it is certainly not too much to say that his influence procured their acceptance by the country . His responsibility for them is thus seen to be very large . It is quite just , therefore , that he should , in a great degree , be judged by his part in these momentous transactions . He has himself put on record his own opinion , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1850 , in the United States Senate , was probably to be regarded as the most important speech of his life . As respects , at least , his own subsequent fame , it has , thus far , proved , indeed , to be of pregnant and disastrous importance . But he expected , as also he elected , to be judged by it . He made that speech , as he made all his speeches , after full and ripe deliberation of his course . He never afterward repented of his words . Nay , he said his words over and over again , with august eloquence , with solemn emphasis , in a series of the most remarkable popular addresses that have ever passed into literature , during the brief critical period that intervened before his death , in 1852 . Let us judge Daniel Webster , fairly and strictly , by his relation to the compromise measures of i8*o . We shall but be giving to him the judgment that he himself invoked . We may conveniently pursue our examination , by considering successively , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , well enough cover the whole extent of the case : i . Did Webster act conscientiously ? 2 . Did he act consistently ? * . Did he act patriotically ? * . Did he act wisely ? * . Did he act right ? First , then , Was Webster conscientious in supporting the compromise measures of i8*o ? Those measures included as a conspicuous feature , the famous , or infamous , or famous and infamous , Fugitive Slave Law . This , certainly , looks bad . That was a shocking law . It was shocking in two aspects . It was shocking for the thing it sought to do , and it was shocking for the way in which it sought to do that thing . It sought to remand the fugitive slave to his slavery . In course of doing this , it claimed to make , at the simple beck of the marshal who was pursuing the alleged fugitive , a slave-catcher of every freeman that chanced to be at hand , and it virtually tendered to the judicial officer engaged a petty bribe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . In a word , it proposed to do a shocking work in a gratuitously shocking way . This must not be disguised . Indeed , it can not be . Any statesman might well pray to be delivered from the dire supposed necessity of sustaining such a law . For the Fugitive Slave Law was , iii itself , an almost irredeemably odious enactment . But let us candidly consider Webster 's actual part in sustaining this odious law . What was his part ? Did he originate it ? No . Did he speak , as a legislator , in favor of adopting it ? No . Did he , as a legislator , vote for the law ? No . What then did he do respecting it ? After its enactment , he advised and persuaded his countrymen to accept it and abide by it . That was Webster 's actual public part in the support of the Fugitive Slave Law . Large , therefore , as was Webster 's just responsibility for the compromise measures of i8*o , his responsibility was not that of the legislator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was chiefly the responsibility of a citizen , and of an administrative officer , who counseled to his countrymen good faith in accepting legisla // tion once accomplished , objectionable though it was , as the prudent choice , and , therefore , the morally right choice , among necessary evils . But did not the seventh of March speech , by anticipation , cover the Fugitive Slave Bill that was to be , or something even worse than that , with Webster 's explicit and emphatic approval ? So Theodore Parker asserts in his celebrated discourse . But Theodore Parker is mistaken . Webster was , indeed , misreported by the newspapers of the time , to have used the following language : " My friend at the head of the Judiciary Committee Mr. Mason has a bill on the subject now before the Senate with some amendments to it , which I propose to support , with all its provisions , to the fullest extent . " The relative " which " was here misplaced . The sentence should have read : " A bill on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amendments to it , I propose to support , " etc . So the words stand in the text of the speech , as printed in Webster 's Works* The correction was promptly and publicly made at the time . It is hard , therefore , to understand how a man of conscience , as Theodore Parker certainly was , could reconcile it with his sense of honesty , to repeat this injurious accusation two years afterward , over the great statesman 's freshmade grave . The fact seems to be , that Theodore Parker 's fiery zeal for human freedom became a furnace , in which , too often , charity and scruple alike were consumed . What , then , Webster really did , in his seventh of March speech , respecting the return of fugitive slaves , was to pledge his support as legislator to some law supposed to be effective for that purpose . But was not even this inexcusable on XVebster 's part ? Could any law for a purpose so revolting deserve Webster 's support as a national legislator ? Irrespective of bad features that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law bad in its essential purpose ? Yes , certainly , regarded absolutely , such a law , however framed , was bad . But badness is always relative-that is to say , some things are worse than others . That which is absolutely bad maybe relatively good-which is precisely what is true concerning a suitable fugitive slave law . Absolutely , such a law was bad-bad , exactly as the Federal Constitution itself was bad , being accurately on the same moral level with that instrument , Wol. v. , pp. 354-355. neither better nor worse . The Federal Constitution expressly provided for the return to their masters of absconding slaves . This Constitution every national , and , indeed , every State legislator took an oath to support . To favor , in good faith , therefore , some effective law for the purpose , was only to do what every member of the national councils , in becoming such member , had implicitly sworn to do . Was not , then , the Federal Constitution itself bad ? To this question the same answer as before must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The constituting of the Union among these States , however bad in some respects , was , on the whole , better than the alternative . It was so at the beginning . It remained so in 1850 . It remained so , we thought , in i86x , and we did not give up thinking so during four disastrous years of fratricidal war . We have thus briefly answered the question , Why should Webster , acting as national legislator , have volunteered to support any fugitive slave law ? It was his plain duty to do so  --  a duty implicitly acknowledged by him , and by all his fellow-legislators in common with him , in the very oath itself by which they and he became part of the public councils of the nation . Besides , the Supreme Court of the United States , Justice Story concurring , and himself preparing the decision , had before decided , contrary to Webster 's long-cherished , and then still cherished , conviction of constitutional propriety , that the active duty of discharging the obligation respecting fugitive slaves belonged to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as matter of history , many of the Northern States , gratifying an irresponsible fondness for empty demonstration of the instinct of liberty , had enacted obstructive laws , some of them denouncing penalties to any of their officials who should participate in the recovery of fugitive slaves . It thus happened that there was left to the national legislator absolutely no honorable way of escape from the hateful obligation to provide a fugitive slave law . Good faith required that the obligation be frankly acknowledged and honestly fulfilled-required it of Webster , and required it of Webster 's associates and successors as well-unless , indeed ( for I must be careful myself to observe the considerate charity which Webster 's own constant example enjoins ) - unless , indeed , I say , their conscientious views were different from his . " Now , sir , " said Webster , in a speech on the Compromise measures , de // livered in the Senate , July 17 , i8*o , " I ascribe nothing but the best and purest motives to any of the gentlemen , on either side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take a view of this subject which differs from my own . * * * They are just as highminded , as patriotic , as pure , and every way as well-intentioned as I am . " Again at Buffalo , in 1851 , he used a similar strain of language . Such noble self-restraint and generosity on Webster 's own part imposes obligations on Webster 's defender . But now a further question remains : Why should Webster , as citizen , have supported the actual fugitive slave law of history ? To this question a twofold answer may be given . First , it was a law , and law-abiding was of the deepest instinct and most seated habit of Webster 's mind . He may be said to have given his whole life , in the main , to the one work of teaching his countrymen the value to them of their institutions of government . He had won his greatest fame , on a signal former occasion of deliberative strife , in vindicating the obligation of Federal law against the brilliant and subtle sophistications of Hayne and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the South was the party feeling aggrieved . Here a matter arose , in which the party feeling aggrieved was the North . What kind of broad national statesmanship , what kind of consistent fair dealing , would that be , which should itself take to " nullifying " now , having memorably demonstrated the folly of " nullification " then ? As Webster said of himself in his own grand way , m that great platform speech of his delivered at Buffalo , in May , 1851 ( which I would have every young countryman of niine study , for its manly popular eloquence , for its ripe historical wisdom , conspicuous by the clear analysis and perspective in which it is displayed , and last , for its noble and ennobling moral tone ) , he was made a whole man , and he did not mean to make himself half a one . The consideration that the Fugitive Slave Bill had been enacted-that it was now part of the supreme law of the land , would alone have been sufficient to determine Webster in its favor . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still . He thought that some fair law for the purpose , and the enacted law , since it had been enacted , was essential to the preservation of the national Union . I do not say now that Webster was xvise in thinking this-for I am not yet discussing the wisdom of his course-I only say that he thought it . He further thought that the preservation of the Union was the true paramount moral , as well as political , interest of the American people . Again , I do not say that , in holding this view , he was right , for I am not yet discussing the ethics of his course . I only say that he held this view . I am defending Webster 's honesty now . His consistency , his patriotism , his wisdom , his abstract ethical correctness even , are just now , and for the immediate purpose in hand , matters of secondary and subordinate interest . I do not care how consistent he was , nor how patriotic , nor how wise , nor even how right , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but without conscious purpose , have happened to be-if he was not honest . If Webster was hollow and insincere , if he played the hypocrite , if he lied , let him remain damned , say I , in the general esteem , and let his memory stink . I would , not cast a sprig of rosemary on his dishonored and dishonorable grave . But , if Webster meant well , however he erred grievously in judgment , why , then , we may continue to have , at least , a mighty fragment left to us from a broken fame-something better than a torso , being not beheaded and bereft of the chief glory and crown , its sky-beholding front unashamed-for our sobered but still delighted admiration . Charles Francis Adams was the first " Free Soil " candidate for Vice-President of the United States . He was an ardent antislavery partisan . He differed with Daniel XVebster in i8*o . He perhaps inherited something of an ancestral prepossession against Daniel Webster . At any rate , he identified himself with the rapidly developing political organization that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ length , elected Abraham Lincoln . Ten years had now elapsed ; the Compromise measures were still standing undisturbed as laws , on the statute-book of the nation . The Missouri Compromise , meantime , had been abrogated , and Kansas had , in consequence , been made the theater of most disgraceful border strife in the interest of slavery propagandism . The Constitution , notwithstanding , was ostensibly maintained . The peace had not yet been broken by any act of war . Menaces , however , of secession in Congress , ordinances of secession in slave State Legislatures , were the order of the day . Whole delegations of senators and representatives from several seceding States had ostentatiously and defiantly withdrawn from // 415 their seats in the council chambers of the Capitol at XVashington . In one word , EIGHTEEN HUNDRED FIFTY had returned again , and worse . Under these circumstances , after a whole decade of years spent in sleepless antislavery agitation at the North , always resounding with " rubadub " defamation of Webster for his treachery to freedom-what spectacle then did the Republican majority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why , they passed , by an overwhelming vote , joint resolutions of the two houses , substantially affirming the position of Webster in 1850 ! The name of Mr. Charles Francis Adams , then in Congress from Massachusetts , heads the list of AYES . Here are the resolutions , abridged for want of space , but not misrepresented : Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled , That all attempts on the parts of the Legislatures of any of the States to obstruct or hinder the recovery and surrender of fugitives from service or labor , are in derogation of the Constitution of the United States , inconsistent with the comity and good neighborhood that should prevail among the several States , and dangerous to the peace of the Union . R'solved , That the several States be respectfully requested to cause their statutes to be revised , with a view to ascertain if any of them are in conflict with , or tend to embarrass or hinder the execution of the laws of the United States , made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Constitution of the United States , for the delivering up of persons held to labor by the laws of any State and escaping therefrom ; and the Senate and House of Representatives earnestly request that all enactments having such tendency be forthwith repealed . Resolved , That we recognize the justice and propriety of a faithful execution of the Constitution and laws made in pursuance thereof , on the subject of fugitive slaves , or fugitives from service or labor , and discountenance all mobs or hinderances to the execution of such laws , and that citizens of each State shall be entitled to all the privileges and immunities of citizens in the several States . Mark , when these resolutions were passed , the Fugitive Slave Law , that " bill of abominations , " was unrepealed and unamended ; the Territories remained unprotected by that " ordinance of freedom , " the XVilmot Proviso ; and still , what Webster was denounced without measure , not simply as unwise , not simply as inconsistent , but as disko ; zes4 for doing in 1850 , that same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headlong Republican majonty mn both houses of Congress were at unseemly and ridiculous pains to do in i86i . Now , I suppose it will hardly be claimed that it was consistent for eager Abolitionists to pass such resolutions as these . But , does it follow that Mr. Adams and the rest were all of them dishonest ? That they were hypocrites , apostates ? No ; these gentlemen were frightened , and not without reason . Disunion loomed near at hand and it looked dreadful . It was a specter that they wanted to lay at any cost . Who can blame them ? The whole country stood aghast , on the brink of disunion and war . From Boston , fourteen thousand one hundred twenty-seven legal voters , out of nineteen thousand that exercised the right of suffrage , at the preceding election , sent to Congress a memorial , signed within two days ' space , in favor of adopting measures of ( Oll*/rornzse / The Crittenden compromise , which went far beyond the compromise of 185o in yielding to Southern demands , was urged upon Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invaded the halls of Congress . Men who had performed gallantly in the part of agitation and of opposition before , now found themselves brought face to face with the solemn responsibilities of administration and of power . The situation sobered them . They acted as it was natural to act . They acted inconsistently , but they did not act dishonestly . And , if Webster , too , of whose sagacity it was to foresee what they at last saw with their eyes , if Webster was inconsistent , let it be frankly confessed that he was also not more dishonest than they . For the very same behavior , to damn him , while we clear them ,  --  is this justice ? ButWas Webster inconsistent ? That question is our second topic . The heads under which inconsistency is alleged against Webster for his seventh of March speech , are the following : i . His declaring in favor of the restoration of fugitive slaves ; 2 . His avowal respecting new States to be formed out of Texas ; 3 . His refusal to vote for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organized . The first one of these heads has already been treated . It need only be added that Webster never previously expressed himself in a sense hostile to restoring fugitive slaves , and that he had often expressed himself in a sense favorable to it . As to the second one of these heads , Webster undoubtedly , though not then in Congress , opposed the annexation of Texas , when that project was in contemplation . The project notwithstanding succeeded . It succeeded by the votes of Northern men , who then immediately became pioneer " Free // Soilers , " that is , political Abolitionists . The consummating act took the form of a series of joint resolutions on the part of Congress , sealing a compact with the republic of Texas . One feature of the compact was this : " New States of convenient size , not exceeding four in number , in addition to said State of Texas , and having sufficient population , may hereafter , by the consent of the said State , be formed out of the territory thereof , which shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Constitution . And such States as may be formed out of that portion of said territory lying south of 360 30 ' north latitude , commonly known as the Missouri Compromise line , shall be admitted into the Union with or without slavery , as the people of each State asking admission may desire ; and in such State or States as shall be formed out of said territory north of said Missouri Compromise line , slavery or involuntary servitude ( except for crime ) shall be prohibited . " The meaning of this is as plain as language can well make it . Now , in his seventh of March speech , Mr. Webster , as befitted his capacity of statesman , very guardedly , but very firmly , expressed himself in favor of fulfilling the solemn State obligation thus created . It was a remote and contingent matter , but , hypothetically , Webster subscribed his name , and his fame , and his authority  --  to what ? Why , to the observance of governmental honor and good faith . That was the whole of it . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now fully accomplished . It was past and complete . Webster thought that statesmanship and state morality alike were concerned in recognizing it accordingly . Is such a view of the fact , accomplished , at all oppugnant to his previously urged objections to the accomplishing of the fact ? What inconsistency is there between resolving , on the one hand , not to vote for annexation while annexation was in process , and resolving , on the other hand , to carry out the pledge of the Government implied in the act of annexation , when annexation was a fact ? The third bead of allegation against the consistency of Webster may soon be dismissed . In the first place , it must candidly be admitted that a formal inconsistency does here exist . But the inconsistency is merely formal . Webster had , undoubtedly , often expressed himself in favor of the principle of prohibiting slavery by law in the Territories . On the seventh of March he waived , not the principle , but the application of the principle to Territories where he was satisfied the application was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for , in this very speech , he used the following language : " Wherever there is a particular good to be done ; wherever there is a foot of land to be stayed back from becoming slave territory , I am ready to assert the principle of the exclusion of slavery . " It was consistent for Webster to sacrifice consistency as to a matter of form , for the sake of that interest which he always regarded as paramount , namely , the safety and peace of the Union . Whether he acted wisely in doing as he did , I do not here consider . It is enough that , in the very article , and by the very fact , of consenting to be inconsistent in form , he , in substance , remained most truly consistent . In the absence of direct proof that Webster was inconsistent or insincere , why , it will be natural to ask , should any one have had the face to accuse him of insincerity or inconsistency ? What motive was imputed to Webster by his enemies for being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself ? To this inquiry there could be but one answer : The motive imputed was selfishness . Webster , they say , wanted to be President . This leads us to our third topic , the question , Did Webster act patriotically ? Patriotically , that is , with reference to the Compron*xise measures of 1850 . As respects his previous life , patriotism is conceded to Webster . On the seventh of March , however , it is charged that he fell-fell by ambition . His desire to be President proved too strong for his virtue . Let us candidly consider the charge . In the first place , suppose it granted that Webster wished to be President . This , it is urged , was a weakness . Well , suppose that too yielded . It was not yet a baseness . It was the last infirmity of noble mind . Nothing is made out to Webster 's discredit , except that he was human . The material point is untouched , What wrong thing did his weak wish lead him to do ? The reply is prompt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what was there wrong in that ? If he was to be President at all , ought he not to have sought Southern support ? Not to receive Southern support would have been to be President of a section of the country , and to enter a wedge for the riving of the Union . True patriotism , Websterian patriotism certainly , required him to seek Southern support , if he sought to be President . The material point would still be , What wrong thing did he do to invite Southern support ? The reply is , He did several wrong things . First , he offered to // the South a fugitive slave law . Yes , but that offer was in the Constitution and in the decisions of the Supreme Court , before it was in Webster 's speech . He offered to the South nothing that was not clearly its due . He simply gave it its own . But he upheld a worse fugitive slave law than it was necessary or wise to have . Yes , he did ; but , at the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the law was different from what he would have chosen , and that it was , in its nature , subject to amendment . Meantime , he urged , it ought to be executed . Well , there was the Wilmot Proviso ; he offered to waive that in application to New Mexico and Utah . This he undoubtedly did ; but in the same breath he explained that it was only because he thought slavery to be already , in another way , more certainly excluded . What offer was this to the South , except an offer magnanimously to forbear using superior strength for insult to the weak , where to use it for protection to the strong was not needful ? But he offered to divide Texas into additional States , to be devoted to slavery . Yes , Webster did , indeed , with great caution of statement , volunteer to say that , in a certain necessarily remote , and probably quite impossible , future contingency , distinctly described in a solemn legislative pledge of the national faith , he would vote for admitting new slave-holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present themselves with szq2icient population . In other words , he stood forwar ( l as an honorable legislator should have done , and avowed himself ready to give to the South exactly what was nominated in the bond . With characteristic frankness and characteristic astuteness , he accompanied the avowal with a hint to the South that , in the word " sufficient , " was hidden a just reserve , that might prove to be of great value to freedom . What else is charged against Webster for his seventh of March speech ? Nothing else worth particular mention . On these grounds , almost exclusively , Webster 's defamer* build their accusations against Webster 's patriotism . With such offers as these to the South , Webster hoped , they say , to buy Southern support . And at what cost ? Why , at the cost of losing the support of the North , capable of outvoting the South nearly two to one . XVhat a desperate game ! The South withheld its support . That simple fact is the best confutation of the charge . XVebster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not disguise his chagrin . VOL . XII. - 27 . But his chagrin was the chagrin of a patriot , and not that of a traitor . He was sorry , he said , to have a false chapter of history written . He believed that he had done the South justice , and he fully believed that justice would satisfy the South . it grieved him that the record should appear contrary to the fact , as he , perhaps too generously , assumed the fact to be . He probably hoped to see the South , by its action , convince the North that he had rightly represented its opinion and feeling . His patriotism was , in this instance , too sanguine , but it was not , therefore , the less noble nor the less saving . But the record , contrary or conformable to fact , is Webster 's true vindication . The truth is , Webster was conciliatory in temper , and tone , and expression , in his seventh of March speech ; but , in point of substantial advantage , he conceded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that was all . He was fully warranted in saying , as he said , with his peculiar inimitable Websterian emphasis , at Buffalo , in 1851 : " if the South wish any concession from me , they will not get it ; not one hair 's breadth of it . if they come to my house for it , they will not find it , and the door will be shut ; I concede nothing . " Remember , that Webster could not say one word in public , that did not immediately make the circuit of the nation . He might as well have said these things in Charleston , as to have said them at Buffalo . The South read this speech , almost before the words ceased to burn from those fervent lips . And this , too , the South read , said in the same speech : I am a Northern man . I was born at the North , educated at the North , have lived all my days at the North . I know five hundred Northern men to one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my love of liberty for all mankind of every color , are the same as yours . * * * * You will find me true to the North , because all my sympathies are with the North . My affections , my children , my hope , my everything , are with the North . " Let it be borne in mind that these things were said previous to the Presidential election , that they were said as publicly as if they had been said in the Senate on the seventh of March , and that they were said to the South as much as to the North . And now , let candid men answer : What kind of bidding for Southern votes is this ? What kind of subserviency to the South ? Let our young men read the whole speech , and // judge for themselves whether it was made by a patriot , or by a poltroon ,  --  judge for themselves , whether a vast concourse of people stood two hours on a spring day , unsheltered , in a drenching rain , to let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though in feeble health , debauch their conscience , and stultify their common sense . It may well be doubted if a statesman was ever placed in circumstances to undergo a severer test of the temper of his patriotism , than that which Webster underwent in x8*o . Imagine the situation . North and South were balanced against each other , like the stem and the stern of a great ship , resting by her middle on a reef . The waves rocked the vessel of state and threatened to break her in two amidships . The utmost strain that she seemed able to bear , was wrenching her already , and still the storm increased . Every moment , she appeared about to go asunder . There was one hope of safety . That hope lay in measures of compromise . But a Northern statesman might well have said to himself , My section will not approve such measures . True , there is no other salvation . But that salvation , the North will never accept . My vote should not be wanting ; but of what use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vote is spurned by my constituents ? I shall merely damn myself in the opinion of those who , after the inevitable breach shall have come , must thenceforward be my countrymen . The breach , I shall not avert . My country is ruined , whatever I do , but why should I needlessly ruin myself ? I will not vote for these measures . This would have been perfectly natural language for a statesman in Webster 's situation to use . But Webster did not use it . He had no wish or thought to survive his country . " I have a part to act , not for my own security or safety , " is his lofty and pathetic language of the seventh of March ; " for I am looking out for no fragment on which to float away from the wreck , if wreck there must be ; but for the good of the whole and the preservation of all , and there is that which will keep me to my duty during the struggle , whether the sun and the stars shall appear or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the preservation of the Union . * * * * These are the motives and the sole motives that influence me , in the wish to communicate my opinions to the Senate and the country . " But Webster saw , no one more plainly , the course that mere consulting of his own safety would recommend . " Suppose , " he says , in his Buffalo speech- " suppose I had taken such a course . How could I be blamed for it ? Was I not a Northern man ? Did I not know Massachusetts feelings and prejudices ? But what of that ? I am an American . I was made a whole man , and I did not mean to make myself half a one . " But Webster 's high fidelity was but half , it was hardly half , of the great round of his patriotism . To be hopeful is , sometimes , almost more than to be simply true . And the hope that , through every extreme of her fortune , Webster held on behalf of his country , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than was his mere stark fidelity . He spoke in the Senate to save his country , and then he resolved upon the Herculean labor of persuading his countrymen to let their country be saved . He accomplished both tasks , but he perished in accomplishing them . He faced two perils and did not blench . He faced the peril of being rejected politically , as he was , and he faced the peril of being written into literature , as he has been , a traitor to liberty . It was a vast effort of patriotism to be proposed to a man , every pulse of whose blood beat for humanity and for freedom , that , for the sake of his country , he should consent to appear in the vivid but wronging literary portraiture of his time , a recreant to the cause of freedom , and a traitor to the cause of humanity . This effort of patriotism , Webster recognized as proposed to himself ,  --  proposed , while it was yet uncertain whether there would be a future generation of his countrymen to redress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Theodore Parker notes it of Webster , that , on the morning of the seventh of March , he said to a fellow-senator , " I have my doubts that the speech I am going to make will ruin me . " To a clergyman , afterward , he said , " It seemed to me , at the time , that the country demanded a human victim , and I saw no reason why the victim should not be myself . " " Mr. Webster 's manner evinced such sincerity and deep patriotic disinterestedness , that he the clergyman was moved to tears , which do not cease to start at every recollection of the interview . " * I have seemed to concede that Daniel Webster indulged the desire to be President . It is probably true that he did . From the principles of human nature in general , it is // safe to conclude , also , that his motives in the desire were not entirely unselfish . Beyond doubt , he was ambitious . But to doubt , on the other hand , that his motives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater degree unselfish , than selfish , would be blindness to the true character of Daniel Webster , as an individuai man . It was his instinct and his habit to identify himself with his country ; but this does not mean that he identified his country with himself . He desired , first , to make his country ever more glorious than she was , and , secondary , subordinate , inseparable , was his desire to be glorified himself in his country . His patriotism may not have been perfectly pure . It probably was not . But that a purer patriotism than Daniel Webster 's ever burned in any human breast , it would be venturesome to maintain . He had an extraordinary travailing sense of vicarious responsibility on behalf of his country ,  --  its good behavior , and its permanent well-being . He thought that he could serve her , and he wanted to serve her . To serve her most effectually , place was much . Men say , He ought to have been satisfied . It was more to be Webster , than it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could magnify the office of President , far beyond the measure to which the office of President could magnify him . And , if all were now said , then , undoubtedly , Webster 's wish to be President would have to be counted a weakness-xveakness venial , indeed , but weakness still . But all is not said . To be President would not have made Webster a greater patriot , a greater statesman , a greater orator , than he already was ; but it would have enabled him to confer immensely greater benefits upon his country . It is a mistake , and a mischievous mistake , to suppose that we lose nothing , as a nation , by having a vulgar man , or an indifferent man , or , indeed , any man less good than the best , for our President . The Presidency is not merely a name , it is a thing . It is , in fact as well as in name , the chief place of power and service at the disposal of the American people . The President 's character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are his choice and his appointment . Directly , or indirectly , every department of affairs , from the highest official to the humblest , feels the hand of the President . It is an incalculable misfortune to the nation to elect an infer man to the place . Imagine the difference that it might have made to this people , if Webster had survived to be President , in the place of Franklin Pierce . It was , therefore , no baseness ; it was not , necessarily , even a mere weakness ; it may have been chiefly , I believe it was chiefly , true patriotism in Daniel Webster , to desire to be President . A man may possibly be timid and selfish , as much as modest , in abdicating , or declining , or avoiding , arduous responsibility . On the other hand , a man may possibly be unselfish and generous , even more than ambitious and greedy , in seeking responsible place . There was no other position possible to Daniel Webster , in which he could be as serviceable to the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power , of so many kinds , belongs to the President apart from the man , that can not belong to the man apart from the President , that Webster , who had known Presidents and who knew himself may well be forgiven for wishing that he could work on behalf of his country with the long leverage in his favor that the chief magistracy of the republic , playing on the whole stability of the State for its fulcrum , would have given him . It must , of course , remain always a somewhat barren matter of mere differing opinion , as to what motives , how mingled , actuated Webster 's public life . It is difficult , however , and it would seem not very magnanimous , to read the record of how he acted , both in the popular eye and in the eye of confidential friendship , during forty conspicuous and strenuous years , and believe that he was otherwise than patriotic . More difficult still ,  --  one might confidently challenge the generous and enlightened young American public of to-day , to try the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to begin , without prepossession , and read the printed volumes of his eloquence , and not take the irresistible impression , that here spoke a man to whom sordid aims were strange , abhorrent , impossible . Let us do as Webster himself did , when any one spoke slightingly in his presence of John Milton 's poetry . He would take down " Paradise Lost , " and read a passage of the poem aloud . If they cry down Daniel Webster to you , read him , and say , " This man , not a patriot ? ( redat Jiidceus/ " Webster 's printed works are the sufficient vindication of the patriotism of Webster . If we have now saved to ourselves the right to hold by Daniel Webster as , upon the whole , an honest , a consistent , and a patriotic man , it is of less consequence that we make him out also a xvise statesman . // But that question comes next in order , forming our fourth topic . Did Webster act wisely ? Wisdom consists , first , in choosing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good means . The end that Webster chose was the preservation of the Union . Was this a good end for American statesmanship ? If it was not , then certainly Webster failed as a statesman ; for , to the preservation of the Union , he dedicated and devoted his public life . It has sometimes been urged against the statesmanlike genius and achievement of Webster , that he never originated any great measures of state . This is true , I suppose . But thence to conclude that Webster was not a great statesman , would be seriously to mistake the true function of statesmanship . Statesmanship is not innovation ,  --  it is conservation . The statesman watches the progress of public opinion , and adopts ideas into his system as fast as they are ripe and fit to be conserved . If he stimulates progress , otherwise than by the prompt , but not too prompt , recognition and adoption of the safe results of progress accomplished , he ceases , so far , to be a statesman , and becomes a reformer . But the reformer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statesman . The Union of these American States continued to be , during the whole of Webster 's career , a great good not yet certainly assured . Besides this , it was a good , such , in its nature , as always to be somewhat remote from the popular appreciation . It was , at once , a great education to affairs , a valuable lesson in political virtue ( and political virtue in the last analysis is perhaps nothing more nor less than self-control ) , when the American community should be trained to perceive the inestimable worth to them , in every way , of their Federal Union . To make this perception a national tradition , required time . Mere continuance of the government was an indispensable condition . A half century , a decade of years , even a single year , was an incalculable gain to the cause of the Union . The people of the States , governments and peoples abroad , must become familiar with the Union as a fact . In comparison with this , everything else in American politics was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were devising their experiments in policy , or were using the strength yet untried of the State as a purchase for the accomplishment of moral reforms , the State itself might crumble and dissolve , and disappear , under the stress , like a fulcrum of sand . If the people , if statesmen themselves , did not see this , why , then , the problem of true statesmanship for America did not therefore become the less necessary , but only the more difficult , to be solved . Webster , from his youth , took in the situation with something of the ken of a prophet . More . He bore his country on his conscience and his heart , in something of the spirit of a father . His hope and his fear for the republic were , both of them , in the highest degree , helpful to save it . If his fear had not been balanced by his hope , he would have been an augur of ill , contributing all the time to accomplish his own augury , by depressing the spirit of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fear , he would have hurried the country on to its destiny , before its destiny was ready for it , in the womb of time . This was Seward 's mistake . Seward seemed not to lack breadth of view and reach of foresight . But his temperament was too sanguine . He trusted too much , and did not sufficiently provide . He was not , like Sumner , chiefly a reformer . But he introduced the unmeasured and scarce measurable forces of reform into politics before the time . He should have waited for the results . of reform , finished and safe , and not have ventured to harness the unbridled forces of reform , restive , and heady , and plunging , to the delicately balanced and already swaying political car . Sumner sought moral ends by political means . Seward sought political ends by moral means . Both men erred . Seward erred by too much buoyancy of political hope , unballasted with the grave sense of political responsibility . " Be it known , then , " said Seward , in that large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the occasion of Clay 's death , in 1852- " be it known , then , and I am sure that history will confirm the instruction , that Conservatism was the interest of the nation and the responsibility of its rulers , during the period in which he Clay flourished . " Seward was right in this . He was wrong only in assuming that the period of just Conservatism in American politics was over . The State was not long enough out of its gristle , to go safely through its struggle with the Hydra . Webster , accordingly , sought to establish the Union by keeping the Union established . It needed to grow strong by growing old . Time would compact it , if it would only stand , to be compacted by time . Webster 's // end was to preserve the Union . His means was , to avert the strain that might rend it . If the strain could not be averted , then he at least would postpone the strain . To postpone it , might be to avert it . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its means . A crisis threatened in 1830 , again in 1832 , once more in 1850 , and Webster , each time , effected a postponement . Two more postponements , of like length with the last , would probably have averted the crisis altogether . It was not to be , but , meantime , the Republic had grown strong enough to stand the inevitable strain . Then Venit sumina dies Ct ineluctabile tempus Dardaniax So it looked , but her strength was proportioned to her days , and Dardania survived . In 1856 , Mr. T. W. Higginson headed the list of signatures to a call for a convention to assemble at Worcester , with the ostensible object of considering measures for the dissolution of the Union. * The motives of the call , no doubt , were conscientious . The subscribers " believed the existing Union to be a failure . " It was a movement in the interest of " humanity " rather than of patriotism-humanity under the form of abolition , a cause , however , it is to be presumed , sincerely regarded by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the true paramount moral and political interest of the country . Still , the object was probably humanitarian directly , and indirectly patriotic . It is not unlikely , however , that , underneath the ostensible object of the movement was concealed a purpose , not dishonorable though concealed , to strengthen the radical and progressive component , judged by the movers to be disproportionately feeble , in the polygon of political forces at that time acting upon the American community . The sentiment of union , it may be supposed , was calculated by these gentlemen to be stable enough to bear being made the point of support for a pry to help launch the cause of abolition , still hanging , and too long , in the ways . I beg to disclaim imputing , by conjecture , any motives not consistent with honesty on the part of the signers to this call . The motive that I have ventured to guess for them , is one that a philanthropic and , subordinately , patriotic man need not be ashamed to confess . It was consistent with honor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be , Theodore Parker addressed , on this occasion , to Mr. Higginson a letter , frankly disavowing any wish on his part to see the Union dissolved . He used a homely but apt illustration , to set forth what he believed would unquestionably be the result of a conflict , if a conflict should occur , between the North and the South . The North , he said in substance , was a steer that weighed seventeen millions , and was weak only in the head and neck . The South , on the contrary , while strong in these parts , was weak in the whole hind-quarters , weighing but eleven millions in all . If the two steers should lock horns , it was but a question of avoirdupois which steer went into the ditch . In this rustic comparison , though its author was not statesman to see it , lay the whole secret of wise statesmanship respecting the sectional questions in difference between the North and the South . The disparity of strength between the two sections was daily increasing . The census was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ count of polls and dollars . The time was near when a shock of arms , should one occur , between the North and the South , would be so inevitably and so obviously certain in its issue , that a shock , provoked by the weaker party , would never take place . The South saw this , and the hotter-spirited among her sons were eager to precipitate a decision . Wise statesmen and patient patriots had but to wait . In x8*o they waited . Northern extremists and Southern extremists were equally disappointed . The compromises of that year disgusted both parties alike . So affronted were the extreme party at the South , that the Senators of several Southern States ( including Virginia ) issued a solemn protest , which they sought , though vainly , to have spread out at large on the records of the Senate , inveighing against the injustice to the slave-holding interest involved in the Compromise measures . When the extremists in both parties concerned in a measure of mutual settlement are dissatisfied together , it is pretty good evidence that neither party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the case , not less important than the one already presented . Not only was the North , or , to name the cause in a way more accordant with the Websterian spirit , not only was Freedom , gaining every moment in ascendency of numbers and strength over Slavery , but , what was of at least equal consequence , *A*neid , ii. , 324 . Life and Correspondence of Theodore Parker , vol. ii. , pp. 191 , if . // Freedom was every moment gaining in unanimity and steadiness of purpose . In 1850 , notwithstanding that the argument of avoirdupois was so clearly in favor of Freedom , still that apparent advantage was not quite to be trusted . Public opinion at the North was not yet solid and decisive cnough for Freedom . An attempt to use the majority would result in dissolving the majority . There can be no reasonable doubt that a conflict joined in i8*o would have issued in immeasurable disaster , if not in irretrievable ruin , to the cause alike of Union , of Freedom , and of Civilization . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far ifl ( licated . In an issue joined on the basis of opposition from the North to the Compromise measures of 1850 , Freedom would have suffered the incalculable disadvantage of being , technically and substantially , in the wrong . There were hundreds and hundreds of thousands of the best and most patriotic citizens of the North who could never have been brought to support , by war , a construc tion of the Constitution so palpably against justice and common sense as that construction would be which should deny to the South the right of recovering fugitive slaves . The men of i86i saw this plainly . enough , and hence those joint resolutions , repetitiously , solicitously , and even almost humbly , acknowledging this constitutional right of the South , which , in specimen at least , my readers have had the opportunity to see . The revolt against coercion would have been almost as wide-spread at the North as at the South , if in 1850 the Government had attempted coercion , on the principle of refusing to the slave-holding States the measure of justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anarchy , and a cycle of unimaginably disastrous history , would have been the certain result . But not only was it of the utmost moment to the best cause that the arbitrament of arms should be postponed till the right side was surely the superior , and till the right side was also surely and clearly the right ; hut it was of the utmost moment , besides , that the shock of violent conflict should , if possible , be wholly and ultimately avoided and averted . Peace without war was inestimably more precious than peace after war , won by means of war . There never was a case in which harmony was so needful to harmony . It would have been almost infinitely better for all of us that one section should never find out by experiment its own superior or its own inferior strength . The mischiefs of such a consciousness , mutually rife between the two sections , were already great enough , before they had embodied and obtruded themselves in a history of brute triumph on the one side , and of grinding discomfiture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Those mischiefs , once so illustrated , became a long entail of sequel and tradition , the end and oblivion of which it was , and it is , impossible to foresee . The memory and example will , indeed , always act as a terror to intimidate rebellion ; but the same influence will , always , too , act as a damp to unsolder harmony , and to cool the ardors of l ) patriotism . Did not the statesmanship of Webster and Clay do wisely , to seek the continuous preservation of the Union , rather that to risk its restoration after the chances of disruption by war ? As to Webster 's correctness of view respecting the necessity of applying the Wilmot Proviso to New Mexico and Utah , a word will suffice . Ten peaceful years ensued after the organization of these Territories , during which time they were without legal protection against slavery . Within those peaceful years the population of New Mexico advanced from 0.29 ( persons to a square mile ) in i8*o , to 0.36 in i86o . During the same period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credited to New Mexico , small as it may appear , appears , nevertheless , greater than it actually was . For , meantime , Colorado and Arizona had been set off from her territory , and their percentage of increase was yet smaller than hers . Mr. C. F. Adams , accordingly , in i86i , was quite warranted in treating the whole question of possible future slavery in New Mexico , to use his own term , as purely an " abstraction . " He said that more than ten years ' Governmental care of the " bantling " had resulted in introducing only twenty-two slaves , of whom ten were nonresidents , into the Territory . Webster , then , and Mr. Adams thought alike on this subject . The only difference is , that Webster was ten years earlier in expressing his opinion . Why , pray , should Webster alone continue to be blamed ? Why , indeed , should he he blamed at all ? But let Webster have been thus conscientious , consistent , patriotic , wise , as you maintain , does it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an absolute right and wrong in the world ? And can not a man find something better worth swearing his faith to than country ? Is not humanity more than // native land ? Is not justice greater than statesmanship ? XVe thus come to our final topic , the question , Did Webster act right ? Webster thought that all the chief goods to us as a nation were best obtainable through the Union . With the Union and Constitution established and preserved , he thought that every other political blessing was possible . He foresaw Freedom prevalent at last throughout the nation as the peaceful result of the operation of moral forces . Webster never thought otherwise than that slavery was a moral , political , social , and economical evil . He never expected otherwise than that slavery would finally disappear from the country . He knew-as who that was exempt from the moral and intellectual obliquity incident to practical complication with slavery could fail to know ? - that the permanent union of free States with slave States was impossible . Such a union was like the binding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was evident enough that the forces of life were swiftly and surely gaining the ascendant over the forces of death . Freedom was winning and slavery was losing every day . And freedom was winning more , as slavery was also losing more , while the Union subsisted , than could be the case on either side if the Union should cease . To break up the Union would weaken freedom , and would strengthen slavery . The political Abolitionists , of whom Sumner may , without injustice , be named as representative , seemed to have won a great triumph for their cause , when emancipation was proclaimed and effected . But observe the conditions under which that apparent triumph was won . It was won solely through the force and persistency of the sentiment of union , which Daniel Webster , by eminence , had succeeded in instilling into the understanding , and conscience , and heart of the American people . Without that sentiment of union , the decree of emancipation could never have been issued , or , issued , must , perforce , have remained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ridiculous demonstration , without the accompanying thunderbolt of even a formidable attempt at practical enforcement . Webster 's statesmanship provided the fulcrum which gave to Sumner 's reformatory force all the leverage that it had for exerting itself to effect the overthrow of slavery . If the fulcrum planted by Webster had not stood , Sumner 's strength would have gone , simply and only , to split the Union , and not in the least to unsettle slavery . Indeed , with the Union divided , slavery would have been necessarily more cruel , more resistant , and more stable than before . The decree of emancipation , and the fact of emancipation , often mistakenly credited to the Abolitionists , were far more truly the work of Webster , than the work of the antislavery agitators . Emancipation was an incident of the war for the U , no ; * , as emancipation was sure , sooner or later , to have been a peaceful fruit of union , if the war had been averted . But union , rather than abolition , was the true chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for reasons that may be briefly thuc summarized . Union was the means to *:ltimate abolition , while political abolition was the means to ultimate and permanent disunion . If disunion could have been secure ( l by any peaceful measures , slavery in the South would have remained intact , and have been no less alert and jealous in selfdefense than before . The two separated republics , supposing two republics to have been formed , would have remained in the same local juxtaposition . Slaves would have been no less likely to attempt escape . Attempt at recovery would have been as inevitable . There would have been an undiminished disposition to resist recapture . The result would have been this inexorable alternative , either , first , a treaty stipulation between the two republics for extradition of fugitive slaves , and so a fugitive slave law in effect , like that which even *bertyloving England , through her AdmiraltyCourt , administers to this day ; or , secondly , border incursions , and , by consequence , a chronic state of war . The first branch of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the second branch would involve consequences of bane to every conceivable human interest , not to be contemplated as having been escaped , without an outcry of thankfulness ; not to be contemplated as imminent , without a shudder of horror . Such considerations as these compel us to decide that the course which Webster pursued in x8*o was , in the largest view , not merely wise , but right ,  --  that is , agreeable to the highest and widest morality . Respecting , then , Webster 's course of public conduct in the matter of the compromises of 1850 , as it is for this that he still chiefly suffers in the popular esteem , so for this , I fully believe , he deserves our unmingled admiration and gratitude . There was some palliation for injustice on the part of // abolitionists toward Webster , at a time when they passionately believed that his vast influence was what chiefly obstructed the progress of their cause-as , no doubt , it truly was what chiefly obstructed their mischosen pathway of progress for their cause . It was necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the judgment and conscience of the people , before they could hope effectively to further the ends which they honestly and ardently held to be first in importance for the good of humanity . In the passion of their conviction and zeal , they easily thought that Webster really was the criminal man that , accordingly , they loudly pronounced him to be . But the fight now is fought , and the victory , somehow , has been won . In the truce of antislavery strife that has happily succeeded at last , and with us become , it may be trusted , a perpetual peace , it is no longer excusable if we let the unjust reproach against Webster grow traditional and inveterate . But this can not happen . Posterity , at least , will not suffer it . However minded still may be the new American nation that now is , the new American nation that is soon to be will surely do him justice . His own great words come back . They seem chosen for our needs in speaking of him . XVe give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ XVebster , The future , at least , is secure . For his renown , is it not of the treasures of the whole country ? The tree sent it3 top high , it spread its branches wide , hut it can not fall , for it cast its roots deep . It sunk them clean through the globe . No storm , not of force to burst the orb , can overturn it . It certainly is not less safe to stand than is the republic itself . Perhaps it is safer . What he spoke lives , while what was spoken against him perishes , and his own speech , in the end , will effectually defend him . Already the rage of defamation breaks and disperses itself , vainly beating against that monumental rock to his fame . " Their surging charges foam themselves away . " When the storm has fully spent itself ; when the fury is quite overpast , the candid weather will quickly drink up the drench of mist and of cloud that still stains it . Then Webster 's works will be seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , standing there , like Mont Blanc , severe and serene , to attest , " how silently ! " but with none left to gainsay the greatness of the man , the pureness of the patriot , But thus far to anticipate , and not to anticipate farther , would be scarce half to have guessed the recompense of acknowledgment that surely awaits Daniel Webster . History will sit down by and by to meditate his words , and , *visely comparing events , make up her final award . She then will perceive , and proclaim , that , not once , nor twice , in an hour of darkness for his country , this man , not merely in barren wish and endeavor , but in fruitful force and accomplishment as well , stood forth sole , or without rival eminent , vindicator and savior of the republic . She will see , and she will say , that , especially in 1850 , while many clear and pure spirits were accepting , amid applause , the glorious bribe of instant enrollment among ostensible and confessed defenders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and majestic mold , capable of putting this brilliant lure aside , to choose , almost alone , amid obloquy , and scorn , and loss , a different bribe  --  a bribe which turned sternly toward its chooser an obverse of rejection for himself , but which bore , concealed from other , less deeply beholding eyes than his , a reverse of real eventual rescue for liberty , involved in necessary precedent redemption for his country . That chief selected spirit 's name , history will write in the name of Daniel Webster . Nor will she omit to point out that , in thus choosing bravely for country , he did not less choose wisely for liberty . But history will go farther . She will avouch that not even with death did Webster cease being savior to his country . It was Webster still , she will say , that saved us yet again in i86i . Illuminating her sober page with a picture of that sudden and sple : *did display of patriotism which followed Fort Sumter , she will write under the representation her legend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I have pondered his words , she will say , I have studied his life , and this apparition is none other than he . Sleeping wakefully even in death for her sake , he hearkened to hear the call of his country . He heard it in the guns of Fort Sumter . Resurgent at the sound , that solemn figure once more , and now , for the last and the sufficing occasion , re-appeared on the scene , standing visibly , during four perilous years , relieved , in colossal strength and repose , against her dark and troubled sky , the Jupiter Stator of his country . For that magnificent popular enthusiasm // for the Union-an enthusiasm , the like of which , for blended fury and intelligence enlisted on behalf of an idea , the world had never before beheld , this , as history will explain , was by no means the birth of a moment .

These men might scoW and those men might jeer , but none the less , through jeer and scoff , the harried Titan kept steadily to his task . Three generations , at least , of his countrymen he impregnated , mind and conscience and heart , with the sentiment of devotion to the Union . This , in great part , accounts for the miracle of eighteen hundred sixty-one . Thus was engendered and stored in the American character the matchless spirit of patriotism which slept till Fort Sumter , but which , with Fort Sumter , flamed out in that sudden , that augu*t , that awful illustration all over the loyal land . One flame-who forgets it ? - one flame of indignation and wrath , like a joyful sword from its sheath , leaping forth , released at last , from the patient but passionate heart of the people ! That monster Union meeting , for example , in New York city on the twentieth of April , filling Union Square from side to side , and from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , history will inquire , but Daniel Webster , come again , in endlessly multiplied count , but in scarce augmented volume of personal power ? Such is certain to be the final sentence of history .

Should some share , perchance , of this confident prediction fail , history , at least , must decide that , comprehensively surveyed in its relation to the whole of his own life , and in its relation to the life of the republic , Webster 's part in the affairs of eighteen hundred fifty was the part of an honest , a consistent , a wise , and an upright , patriot and statesman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late haste to pacify now his indignant fame .
