txt Yesterday , a statue of WASHINGTON IRVING was unvailed in Prospect Park . Next Saturday , the Commissioners announce the inauguration of weekly open-air concerts , which will be continued during the Summer , the necessary amount having already been subscribed by citizens of Brooklyn . Thus , the Park which our neighbors have so long regarded with mingled pride , hope and . anxiety , is at last in a condition in which the ideal of the Commissioners is nearly attained . Not that it is yet complete by any means , but there have been gradually added to it so many and so varied attractions , that . it both shows what a beautiful Park it will be . and already confers great benefit to the city . There are no statistics , and could not well be any , to show to what extent the Park is visited by all classes in the- community . In one sense , indeed , there are , happily , no classes to be distinguished . But one needs only to spend an hour in the Park every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a Park-for the rich alone , nor for the rich mainly . The vehicles met there are , to a considerably more obvious extent than in Central Park , such as may be called family establishments . In their style , and in that of the animals drawing , and in the appearance of their inmates , there is abundant proof that the carriage is kept for comfort , and not for show . A great many conveyances , of modest and inexpensive character , drawn by steady and not obviously high-bred horses , are occupied . by ladies . Along the walks , this prominence of persons who resort to the Park , not only purely for pleasure . but as the only place where they can afford to take it , is still more striking . The car routes , which converge here from every direction , bring multitudes of children , the younger in the care of the older , and it is plain that many a family finds health and pleasure along the shaded walks and on the free lawn , which would be utterly unattainable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost thus far , in round numbers , nine millions of dollars . Another million will be required to complete it , making its total cost ten millions of dollars . Of this amount , about three millions will be replaced by assessments levied on the surrounding property for benefit arising from the neighborhood of the Park ; about two and a half millions will be obtained from the sale of the portion of the Park grounds lying east of Flatbush-avenue , the sale of which was authorized by the Legislature in 1870 ; and some four hundred thousand dollars will accrue from compensation for land taken from the Park grounds to open various streets along its borders . This will leave the amount to be paid by the first twelve and . the Twentieth , Twenty-first and Twentysecond Wards of the city , about four millions of dollars . It is estimated by the Commissioners , that the proceeds of the tax for benefit , and those of the sale of the east side , with the money from street openings , - will , properly invested , meet the Park @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of taxable property in the three wards bordering on the Park has advanced , since work was commenced , over thirty-six millions of dollars , and the taxes yielded by this advance in valuation more than meet the interest on the Park bonds and the cost of maintenance . These facts make the character of the Park as an investment of municipal funds very evident , just as the facts noticed at first , prove its inestimable value to the great mass of citizens by whom it is used . There is another way in which the Park might be of immense advantage to Brooklyn , but which is rendered unavailable by the ineffectiveness of our Tax laws . There , is no doubt that the Park bad added very largely to the personal property of the/city . It has attracted a great many personsato the beautiful streets in its neighborhood . who would never have come without it . Ton years since , there were but two or three very limited quarters of Brooklyn considered desirable as residences by wealthy people . Now there are as many dozen , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selected for fine residences , are all within easy reach of the Park , and are precisely similar , in every respect but this , to other sections that have progressed slowly in growth , and that only by the erection of a cheaper class of dwellings . Besides those sections which wealth has chosen for itself , the east side of the Park , about to be sold by the Commissioners , will be subject to conditions as to improvement , which will make it the site of a class of houses uniformly owned and occupied by rich men . However this may strike the unthinking as an encouragement of exclesiveness , it is unquestionably a measure that will attract wealth to the city , and proportionately relieve the burdens of taxpayers less able to bear them . Under our present Assessment laws , however , the personal property thus brought into the city will be substantially valueless for taxation .
