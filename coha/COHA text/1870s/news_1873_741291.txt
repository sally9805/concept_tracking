txt On Friday evening the Republicans of Newark will hold a convention for the nomination of candidates for Mayor , Water Commissioner , Tax Commissioner , Trustee of the Reform School , and two surveyors of highways . The present incumbents , for the most part , if not all , are Republicans , and it is important that their successors shall not only be staunch adherents of the same political party , but that they shall , in addition , be gentlemen who enjoy the confidence of the entire community . During the past year , more than usual interest has been evinced by Newarkers of different shades of opinion , in the temperance , Sabbath observance , finance , and other questions ; and as a consequence , divisions have been created that may , if not prevented , cause an entire change in the . complexion of the city Government . The men in office at the present time , it must be confessed , lack judgment . For weeks their actions have been made the subject of severe articles in the opposition press . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to produce a very unfavorable impression in the public mind . As a result , a committee of one hundred citizens was appointed to examine their accounts . The Receiver of Taxes became a defaulter , and his crime so astonished and confused his fellow-officials that they failed to do what they ought to have done to clear themselves from suspicion . Instead of waiting for the citizens to institute an investigation of the charges that have been made against them , they . should have immediately prepared and published . a clear statement of this finances . It is sometimes , wo know , not very easy for public servants to answer . in detail the direct and indirect charges of au enemy hungry for the spoils of office ; and if the circumstances were different , we should not expect so much of the Newark officials . As it so happened , the defalcation of the Tax Receiver was brought to light on the eve of an election , and the opposition press very shrewdly took advantage of the opening it afforded for raising a cry of fraud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city and State . Whether this will succeed or not will depend , in some measure , on the action of the Convention on Friday . evening . Nothing in the shape of pledges to this or that candidate should be allowed to prevent the nomination of a man for the Mayoralty whose ? armor is without flaws , and whose very name will be in itself a tower of strength . It will not be difficult for the Convention to find a man of this character . Above all things , it is necessary that the men put in nomination shall be free from the slightest taint of suspicion . If this course be strictly pursued there will be no cause to fear for the result . The Democrats , acting on the advice of their chief organ , have nominated their best men for the offices enumerated , and are making very great efforts to induce the majority of the voters to believe that the honor of Newark can only be saved by their election . The voters , of course ; will judge for themselves as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a return to Democratic rule , and , we think , may be depended upon to look twice before precipitating such a misfortune upon the city . The cry of fraud , if carried into the State canvass with the news of a Republican defeat at Newark , would , Without doubt , have a very unfavorablo effect , and might cause some sturdy farmers to either stay away from the polls or vote for the wrong ticket ; but , as we said before , no.such cense induce can ensue if the leaders take our advice as to candidates . This is what may be termed an off year in New-Jersey politics , so that the forlorn condition of the Democrats in any event can not be very much bettered . State Senators are to be elected next month from Cape May , Durlingten ? gunterdon , Middlesex , Passaic , and Sussex Counties , and as the term of each will extend over the time for the election of a United States Senator to succeed Hon. Jonss P. STOCKTON , a Democrat , the contest in the several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full Assembly of sixty members will also be elected . Last year the Democrats were in such bad odor that they voted ' against their own candidates in what are known as the great strongholds of the party , and the result was that their representation at Trenton was the smallest known for many years . Without the aid of a cry of " Down with fraud "  --  a very unfortunate watchword , by the way , for . a purely Democratic campaign  --  it is possible that a fete of the oldtime Democratic districts may return to their first love , and give some of their rusty favorites a chance to brighten up a little . Fraud or no fraud , we ' should not be at all surprised if this were to occur . Now , although the election to be hold in the State this year will not be as important as the elections to occur next year , the work to be done by the Republican Patty is by no moans trifling . To be successful next year , it is absolutely necessary that the organization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the party shall not be imperiled in municipal elections because of the dishonesty or stupidity of persons for whom it may be considered to be responsible .
