txt The recent investigations which have been made into the expenditures of the Brooklyn Board of Supervisors have brought to light some curious facts . Attention was first turned to the amounts paid for articles supplied to the County Jail , and these were found to be so extravagant  --  the sum being in some cases three or four times the market value of the goods  --  that it was concluded to institute a general search for overcharges , and the result has fully shown the necessity for such an examination . When the accounts of the Printing and Stationery Committee were inquired into , the prices charged for the work were in several instances found to be four or five times greater than the ordinary rates , especially where the printing had been done in thejob office of the Eagle news paper . I bis discovery was the more surprising , because ever since the necessity of tax reform in Brooklyn became evident , the Eagle has proclaimed itself a strenuous advocate of economy in municipal expenditure , and attempted to show a variety of methods by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ philanthropists , however , not to let the right hand know what the left hand was doing , the right hand of the Eagle was indicting " editorials " on economy , while both hands of the business manager were plunged into the public purse . The way in which the Eagle carried on business with the Supervisors may be seen . from some of the items in its bill . For polllists the market price of which is twenty-five cents a copy , the Eagle charged $1 20 ; for 276 statements , worth $65 , it charges $303. and for subpoenas , worth $3 50 per thousand , $12 50 . The entire bill was $6,000 , made up of such items as the above . The Eagle 's reply to these accusations is amusing , to say the least of it . After the unimpeachable evidence of two or three well-known printers , it would be impossible to explain away the charges , and it does not attempt to do anything of the kind , but lays all the blame on its agent It claims to have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was charging for the public printing ; and because the paper has talked of economy , and has criticised the actions of the Board of Supervisors , the editor argues that it is impossible for it to have been in league with the Supervisors to defraud the City . It blusters about its " integrity " and " honor . " and says that it has done so much to check political jobbery that the present investigation is part of an effort to lessen its influence with the general public . The weak point about the Eagle 's talk is that , although it acknowledges that the city has been overcharged by its printing establishment , it is very careful not to say a word about restitution . It claims to be a Prosperous newspaper , but prefers to allow the charge of having defrauded the City remain against it unpalliated by an offer to refund the amount improperly obtained . It will not mend matters to discharge its agent , as the Eagle hints it may do , while retaining the money which it acknowledges was not lawfully its own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city , which , accord- , ing to its own admission , it never earned , it must stand forward as an acknowledged agent of corruption . If the Eagle were really in earnest , as it pretended . to be in its economical preachments , before these overcharges were dissevered , it would not now be so much disturbed over the thought of losing an influence which it never possessed . The Democratic Party , of which the Eagle is the organ , is responsible for the high rate of taxation in that city . Its Democratic officials have largely increased the salaries of the City Judges , although there are several more now than there were two years ago to perform the same work , for which they were liberally paid . The water rates are to be increased by the Democrats , who have charge of the Water Department ; a large appropriation is asked by the Fire Commissioners ; and about the only projected increase of expenditure which has not gone through is the proposed increase of policemen 's salaries  --  a result to which the Eagle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illgotten gains from the public printing , and do other works meet for repentance , before it publishes any more homilies on the subject of economical government .
