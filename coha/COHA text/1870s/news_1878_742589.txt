txt The bill reported by Representative Reagan from the Committee ou Commerce , for the regulation of inter  --  Stato commerce and to prevent unjust discrimination as to freights , charges , and facilities by railroads and other common carriers , is accompanied by an elaborate report in favor of its passage . It says , among other things , " When we consider the magnitude of the commerce of the United States , and the direct interest which the whole of our ? 15,000,00 people have in it , the broad extent of our cohntry as compared with other commercial countries , and that its internal ? . ommerco carried by railtuuds alone is estimated at about $18,000,000,000 in value , while it is supposed our whole internal commerce amounts to not loss than $25,000,000,000 in value , and when it is remembered that this com ? merge is carried on over ** miles of railroad , and by steam-boats and other vessels on our rivers , lakes , bays , and canals over a length of navigable waters probably exceeding half mhe length of all our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fostered and protected by this bill may be realized , and any measure which will materially benefit this vast commerce will not full to be sensibly felt in relieving the country from its present financial and industrial embarrassments . The most of this commerce is now carried by railroads and other corporations , each having , to some extent at least , a monopoly of the carrying business over its particular route , but in most , though not in all instances , the evils which might result from those monopolies are mitigated by competing lines of communication . Each of these corporations , when not restrained by legislativo authority , can discriminate in freight rates and charges in favor of and against whom they please , and may in this way benefit some persons and places while they injure relatively other persons and places as may suit their interests or inclinations . This , in fact:has been so often done with results so Injurious to many as to call for the passage of some law to prohibit and to punish such discriminations . One of the objects of the bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ho considered inter-State freights and commerce ; that is to say , property carried by railroads or other common carriers , which would include steam-boats and all other water craft , when wholly or partly carried by such railroads or other common carrier as part of one continuous carriage from or to any foreign nation or country , from or into any State or States or Territory or Territories of the United States , or in or through two or more States or Terri pries of the United States , or from within one Stale or Territory of the United States into or through one or more other States or Territories of the United States , and in order that the provisions of the act shall not be evaded or defeated , it is provided that it shall be unlanfful for such common carriers to make any combination , connection , contract , arrangement , or schedule , or to cause any delay in carriage , or do any other net or thing with intent to evade any provisions of the act , or mitt ' intent to prevent any such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is provided that as to such carriages of property the freight rates , facilities , and charges shall be equal to all shippers , and It is also provided that no more shall bo charged for such inter-State or through freights than is charged for freight in any State through which they are passing , having reference to identity of time and similarity of freights and services , and that equal facilities shall bo allowed to each . The bill also provides that as to such inter-State freights no more shall he charged for their carriage for a shorter than for a longer distance . In the competition of railroads especially , a practice is very general of charging very low rate for through freight on long roads and between remote centres of trade . These charges are often so low as to be 1u/remunerative , and the competition for such freight is one of the fruitful causes of what has been called the railroad wars , which have often proved so injurious , not to say disastrous , both to the competing railroads and the commercial interests of the communities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the correction of great and manifest abuses , and the prevention of unjust discriminations of common carriers against shippers who are entitled . to equality of terms . It imposes no unjust or , even inconvenient burdens on such common carriers . . It does not attempt to regulate and fix a maximum or minimum of rates of freight and charges , or to deal in matters of detail as to transportation . The bill requires , among other things , that all persons or corporations engaged in business as common carriers shall keep posted in at least five places in . every depot or station hi every city or village , having a population of 1,000 , through or to which their lines may run , a detailed schedule of tariff rates , which schedule shall not be changed without live days ' notice . The prohibitions against carrying ! night at loss than schedule rates are not to apply to GovernMent business , or to the transportation of articlds for public fairs or charitable purposes . The committee quote authority to show that Congress has the newer to enact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Congaess only can furnish the remedy for the evils cited , the time has come when this duty should be performed .
