txt On Wednesday morning , after a long and tedious session , in which the resources of Parliamentary management bad been taxed to their utmost to wear out the patience of the majority , the Amnesty bill was forced to vote in the United States Senate , and passed with only two dissenting voices . The work thus accomplished will be regarded with sincere approval by the ; treat body of the people of the country , whose feeling on the subject ie very justly represented . by the remarkable approach to unanimity in the vote . The bill which passed the Senate is the House bill of May 13 . It is very liberal in its provisions , and excepts only the following classes : Members of the Thirty-sixth and Thirty-seventh Congresses , officers in the judicial , military and naval service of the United States , heads of Departments and foreign Ministers of the United States . These exceptions , we have no doubt , will meet with cordial approval nearly as extensive as that bestowed on the principle of amnesty itself . For , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a practical and not a sentimental measure . As such it wisely leaves on those who betrayed the very highest trust the nation can repose in its citizens , the continued mark of their infidelity , that the fact may be made plain that if the country forgives them it does not again invite them to positions of honor . If any individual member of this class shall , by his personal conduct , give reason to believe that it is proper to remove his disabilities , Congress can still do so , And as there are , according to the most searching estimates , not more than 200 persons excepted from the bill , this may be done intelligently and safely . When the action of the Senate was reported to the House yesterday morning , an incident occurred which forcibly illustrates the spirit of petty partisanship in which this measure has been , to a shrprising extent , approached , and which now , let us hope may c &me; to an end . To the Democrats of the House of Representatives an opportun ? ty presented itself of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the bill it self , but in the way of the President 's at . taching his signature to it . Mr. RANDALL of Pennsylvania , was thehrilliant politician to whom this notion suggested itself. , and he accordingly made a point of order that the bill , since it required a two-thirds vote , would become a law without the President 's signature , and should not be sent to him . The point was not a point of order in any sense , and as a point of constitutional law it was absurd , . because . with reference to disabilities . the Constitution provides that they may be removed by " a two-thirds vote of each House ; " and as to " every order , resolution or vote to which the concurrence of the Senate and . House ef Representatives shall be necessary , " the Constitution provides that it " shall be presented to the President of the United States . " Of course , the objection was ignored , but in bringing it forward Mr. RANDALL only continued to the last the mean and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to deny to him any connection with the measure he has so heartily supported . The President signed the bill immediately upon its presentation to him . Perhaps the friends of Mr. GREELEY , who have made of amnesty the main plank to give strength to their rickety platform . will find some way to wipe out the record of yesterday 's work by the Republican Congress and the Republican President , but we doubt it . Of course , they will misrepresent it , and clamor for the credit of it , as due to their plots and threatenings . But they will not mislead many persons of sense in this way , and it is persons of sense , who quietly make up their minds on the facts in the career of a party or a President , that decide elections in this country . The utmost perversion , and the bitterest personal abuse of everybody connected with the measure , will not alter the fact that it was recommended and signed by the President , and passed . by the vote of every Republican Senator but two ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his Civil Rights bill . and Mr. NYB , who laboring under the disadvantage of an infinitesimal constituency , may be pardoned for not having felt the impulse of the overwhelming popular sentiment in favor of the measure . We need not now recite again the benefits which may fairly be hoped for from this crowning act of the session . If we have not utterly misinterpreted the temper and tendencies of the Southern people ; if the virtue of the principle of self-government has not been very grossly exaggerated ; if we are not mistaken in the extent of the silent revival of patriotism throughout the country , amnesty will prove not only a safe but a beneficent measure . It certainly will be many times more likely to work well , coming from the party that maintained . the nation against rebellion , on the recommendation of the General who led our armies to victory , than it would have done. ? ad it been initiated by a Democratic , or quasi Democratic Administration . The passage of the act , indeed , leaves no excuse for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be more absurd than his illusive promises made with the intent to divide and destroy the party that performs .
