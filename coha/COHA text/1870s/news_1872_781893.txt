On the night in question some thirty or forty ladies and gentlemen collected in front of the ferry-house to await the arrival of the Thomas Hunt . It was a dismal night . The rain fell in torrents , and there was a very high wind . The weary watch was maintained for an hour and a half after the advertised time for starting , but still the Hunt did not appear .
