txt A war panic has certainly begun in the European exchange markets , and the public mind , especially in England , is alarmed and aroused . But all this may well be without sufficient reason . A war between Russia and Turkey does not of necessity mean a war in which all Europe would bo engaged . One would think from the tone of the journalistic writers in London that a declaration of war between these two powers would be immediately followed by the attack on , and Russian possession of , Constantinople . But the season is late for any warlike operations in the " Balkan Peninsula " ? Winter will soon begin in those bleak mountains . It is doubtful if either Servia or Turkey can move their armies with much freedom after the 1st of November . Then , we all know that the arming and mobilizing the forces of a extensive country can not be accomplished in a day . To transport a hundred thousand men by railroads , with all their equipments , for thousands of miles , demands time . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move armies as Prussia moved them against France , and that by the let of January , next year , she concentrates a hundred and fifty thousand men on the Danube , we are then only at the opening of a long and slow campaign . Turkey has fought this same battle before . She is by no means a contemptible antagonist . She has held her own before this in the countries of the Danube for months against all the power of the Czar . The Turks fight well in defense . They have many strong places which they can hold , and difficult lines of defense . There would be no possible chance of any sudden march on Constantinople . In fact , the war could hardly open before Spring . Thos will relieve Europe from the sudden embarrassment of a struggle in which Constantinople must be protected . It is true that , according to the ancient notions of British policy and the believed necessity of keeping the way to India open , Great Britain could not permit the Turkish capital to be occupied by the Russians . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war does break out , England can wait before being involved in the protection of Constantinople . A fleet and a few corps of men can be sent there in the Spring as easily as now . A war in defense of Turkey would be now in the last degree unpopular in Great Britain . It is true that the recent movement of Russia is a godsend to the Tory leaders . They can summon Parliament now with unperturbed mind . There is no likelihood of any change of Ministry at present . Earl Derby will no doubt act as if the Government might be called upon to protect " the gates of the East . " This alone will increase the exchange panic . But even a British fleet in the Bosphorus does not , of course , mean an alliance , offensive and defensive , between Groat Britain and Turkey . It may merely mean a warning to the Czar . The rumors of an approaching alliance between Russia and . Italy seem in. the highest degree futile . The Liberals of Italy , it is true , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Christians , while the followers of the Pope with their usual fatuity , support the Mohammedan , though some of the sufferers are Roman Catholics . The Government of Italy desire to annex Southern Austria or Tyrol . But to obtain these provinces by violence would cost a terrific and expensive struggle , and Italy is poor . It does not seem credible that she would incur such tremendous risks with such doubtful results . France , every one regards as neutral , and as certain to remain neutral . The French press is plainly opposed to Russia and in sympathy with Turkey . Germany is in all probability , in secret alliance with Russia . The family relations of the two Emperors , the political necessity upon BISMARCK to secure an ally on the flank of the Empire , in case of another French war , and the absolute want of interest of Germany in whatever happens on the Danube , together with certain public indications , all make this more than probable . Still , this alliance may mean nothing perilous to the peace of Europe . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the projects of Russian ambition . The point upon which the whole position of affairs turns , is the probable course of Austria . As we have previously said , we do not believe that the Austrian Emperor will be drawn into this new alliance , at least to the extent of war . The press of Vienna of all parties , echoes the cry : " No war I no occupation l " Such a policy would bo opposed to all the traditions of the Empire . It would be dangerous both within and without . It would recall to Austrian statnamon that joint occupancy of Holstein , which ended in Sadowa . It might merely be taking the Russian chestnuts from their own fire . It would be au alliance and occupancy very expensive and very perilous . Still , on the other hand , it must be said that Russia , Germany , and Italy may be able to bring an extraordinary pressure to boar upon Austria . They may threaten her Italian , German , and Sclavonic Provinces . Count ANDRASSY may think it safer to occupy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hostility of those three powers .
