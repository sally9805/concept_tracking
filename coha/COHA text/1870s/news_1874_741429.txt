txt The reception of the Emperor of Russia by the people of England does not appear to have been so enthusiastic as the reports in the English papers would at first lead people to believe . It was probably not enthusiastic at all . The assemblage of a large crowd , and with it more or less shouting , is certain to take place when anything unusual is to be seen in the great metropolis of London ; but it is not at all a certain indication of popular admiration . The marriage of the Duke of EDINBURGH , and the visit of the Emperor , have for some time past kept the public mind in a state of excitement ; but this will now cool down , and when people come to look back calmly upon the two events , they will most likely recognize the extreme hollowness of both . It has become evident , now , that the Duke 's marriage with the Grand Duchess was never popular in England . It was accepted with the best grace , as an event that could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it was not approved by the people . It is now being regarded as the probable cause of much future trouble and inconvenience , and as the Grand Duchess does not appear to have any personal qualities likely to endear her to the populace , there is no compensating element to brighten the prospect . She has already given rise to unpleasant questions of precedence in the Queen 's family , and . if the suspicion should ever gain possession of the public mind that she exercises the slightest influence in matters of more general moment , her lasting unpopularity will be secured . Her removal into Germany , which in all likelihood will follow her husband 's accession to.the Duchy of Saxe-Coburg , will then probably be hailed with joy by the English people . The prejudices which prevented the popularity . of the Grand Duchess in England are the same as those which have cooled . the enthusiasm of the people for the Emperor . He was well received so far as consideration for his position went but his visit was no- where regarded as an omen of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the peace which he talked about . He was treated respectfully. as the Emperor of Russia , ' but be was also treated coldly as the avowed enemy of British policy , awl the reckless repudiator of international treaties . Within the last two years the Emperor of Russia has , in a manner the most offensive , broken two of his most sacred obligations . The first of these was the treaty which he signed to secure peace after the fall of Sebastopol ; the second was the undertaking to which he solemnly pledged his honor six months ago in connection with the military movement in Asia . It was not likely that these two things would be forgotten , but it is creditable to the crowds who assembled from day to day to see the Emperor during his stay in England . that , remembering them , their self-respect overcame the spirit of enthusiasm which the excitement of the moment might temporarily have aroused . Nor is it to be wondered that when he spoke of peace the people refused to believe in his sincerity ; especially when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uttered , his agents in the East were working and intriguing to accomplish purposes which , if attained , would make war inevitable . We were never among those who saw any important political result to follow from the union of the royal and imperial families of England and Russia , but such a result appears now to be more remote than ever . It seems more likely to promote difficulties ; but if it does not do that , there is a very marked indication that the confidence of the English people in Russian friendship is no greater to-day than it was . when the Black Sea treaty was repudiated . Neither the Duke 's marriage nor the Emperor 's visit has in any degree affected either the relations or the policy of England and Russia . The interest which attaches to the Eastern question , and to the movements of Russsia in Asia is , therefore , nowise diminished , nor are the future probabilities of peace or war at all modified .                 @ @ @ @
