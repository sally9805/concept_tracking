txt The people south of MASON and DIXON 'S line have latterly been reviving their memories of the Revolution by holding a few " tea parties " similar to those which delighted Boston some time since . The inhabitants of the goodly Commonwealth of Maryland gathered at Annapolis  --  the quaint old capital on the banks of the noble Chesapeake  --  on the 19th day of this month to commemorate the burning of the ship Peggy Stewart , Oct. 19 , 1774 , in Annapolis harbor . It so happened that the day was also the ninety-third anniversary of the surrender , of CORNWALLIS at Yorktown ; but the Marylanders cared very little for that . They were chiefly interested in celebrating an event which had no small influence in bringing the United States into existence as an independent nation , and they took a genuine pride in the knowledge that Maryland was one - of the foremost and bravest of the colonies in the struggle against the repressive and restrictive legislation of the mother country . In that great . conflict Boston and Baltimore stood shoulder to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of recent years , they stand so now . Some of the irreverent Maryland folk of to-day call the recent Annapolis celebration the " Peggy Stewart Centennial , " and so it seems likely to go down to history . The Peggy Stewart was a brig which arrived at Annapolis one hundred years ago , loaded with tea . About that time the colonists in Maryland had conceived an unconquerable aversion to the savory Chinese herb , . ' because it represented in their eyes what they considered unjust taxation by a Parliament remote from them in location and . sympathy . They , therefore , having before their eyes the example of the enraged Bostonians , who , in December of 1773 , threw into the bay several cargoes of the odious tea , concluded to burn the Pegg , / Stewart . But that did not wholly content them , so they determined to force the owner of the vessel , Mr. ANTHONY STEWART , who had . paid the duty on the tea , to destroy the brig with his own hands , and the chroniclers inform us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and set fire to it in presence of the multitude . " For months thereafter no good citizen of the revolting colony dared , even in the seclusion of his home , to drink a cup of tea . The populace , finding one man who had concealed a whole chest of the forbidden luxury , made him walk bareheaded , and , " with lighted torches in his hands , " set fire to his property . One hundred years have passed away , and Maryland has grown from a : dependent colony to a lusty Commonwealth , whose material progress is as vigorous as was her original protest against oppression . Her extent of territory has been reduced , but her influence on the outer world , her home trade , and her commerce with other nations , have increased with phenomenal rapidity . It is difficult to comprehend that the greater portion of her superb development has been attained within the last thirty years . One might readily fancy it the work of two centuries , so solid , abiding , and far extended is it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the centennial at Baltimore , as well as at the old capital . The quaint streets of Annapolis were thronged . by thousands from all the surrounding country , and under the venerable poplar planted two hundred . years ago , which still graces the lawn in front of St. John 's College , many orators made enthusiastic addresses . In Baltimore the streets were gay with decorations ; from thousands of public buildings and private mansIons fluttered the United States flag . The people of Maryland were rightly proud of their centennial and the memories it recalled . Though no invading army occupied . her soil during the Revolution , the brave Commonwealth contributed to the Continental Army more than fifteen thousand regulars , besides five thousand militia . The exploits of the " Maryland Line " are known . and praised wherever the history of American patriotism has been told . There was the right ring in the stirring words of one of the speakers at Annapolis on Monday , when he recalled the benefit of the common spirit which animated the hearts of the men of Massachusetts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem so far away , and whose struggles and vexations seem so slight when compared with the greater ones in our modern history . That common spirit is as necessary to-day as it was nearly a hundred years ago , and it is gratifying to see that the centennial memories revive it , and will keep it awake . As the time approaches when the first century of our national life is to be completed , it is good to see the States which formed the advance guard of th' " Old Thirteen " standing in friendliest relations to one another , even although they have long been . separated by sectional differences . It is pleasant to know that , as we approach 1876 , our brethren of Maryland and Virginia - will be drawn closer than ever before to us by the memory of a united struggle for the common good ; and it is but right to hope that ere the hundredth year is fully completed , all the citizens of North and South may be in sympathy with each other , and that recent as well as past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Every centennial celebration in South or North will aid in securing that result .
