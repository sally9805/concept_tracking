I. TJ*ROM " Roderick Random " to is Roderick Hudson " is a long way ; and the change which the novel has undergone since the days of Richardson , SmoLlett , and Fielding marks the difference between this century and the last more vividly and minutely than most things do . Upon the whole the change in the novel seems a development , and the romances of Henry James and Blackmore seem to surpass those of the Queen Anne men in manner and method as well as in morals . It is difficult to follow the theory of M. Tame with implicit trustfulness , and see cause and effect in all literary phenomena . So one exception ought to be made at once to every statement of a law in literature ; genius being bound by no law hitherto discovered or perhaps hereafter discoverable . Therefore , when one speaks of a development of manner and method in the novel since the publication of " Pamela , " and still perhaps in progress , one should not be understood to include Ficiding , Thackeray , Hawthorne , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have very slight relations to time and place . But aside from these instances , beginning with Richardson and following the succession of romancers , Smollett , Sterne , Goldsmith , Miss Austen , Scott , Bulwer , Lever , Charlotte Bronte , Collins , Reade , Trollope , Dickens , there is to be noticed this development of manner and method just mentioned . No one doubts the development in morals in the literature any more than in the life of the century and a third that has passed since Richardson began to write . And even if the moral superiority of ourselves over our fathers be ascribed more to outward show than to hidden feeling , the moral development of the novel can not . For one does not nowadays run across a book whereof the author displays twisted ideas of ethics whatever his characters may do or say ; whereas Fielding , for instance , does most manifestly delight in his sponging-house hero , of whom Fielding 's most genuine admirer can only say " he would not rob a church , but that is all . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and method , is open to more question than the development in morals . But it nevertheless has equally taken place . There is no reference here of course to the comparative merits of the modern and the older novel . " Clarissa I-Jarlowe " may be a more powerful work of fiction than " Lorna Doone , " the adventures of the famous Count Fathom may be more entrancing than the adventures of Mr. William Black 's pha6ton ; but still the latter work in either instance is a better work of art . It should be remembered that we are leaving out here the four giants of Anglo-Saxon romance , but even if there is question between them , it is settled by reflecting that the three most artistic novels yet written , " Henry Esmond , " " Romola , " and " The Blithedale Romance , " belong to this century , and that " Tom Jones " itself is inferior to them in this one regard at the least . Literary critics are now and then fond of using those verbal shuttlecocks of the metaphysicians " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly unanimous in holding that the demands of art in novel writing require " objectiveness . " So far as that undefinable word may here mean subordination of a writer 's personality , the consensus of critics is undoubtedly correct . Only in point of art , however . For example , the long list of Thackeray 's novels , " Esmond " excepted , are inartistic in this respect , though no admirer of Thackeray could be tortured into saying he would have it // otherwise , and thereby lose the weekday sermons of which the preacher was prouder than of any of his aesthetic touches . Still weekday sermons are hazardous to attempt . Everybody is pretty well agreed that Mr. Dickens 's are a trifle thin and watery , and even Thackeray 's do not at all suit the Gallic instincts of M. Tame , who is wearied by " The Neweomes , " and thinks it a great pity that morals have gained such an advocate at the expense of art . Here is the chief proof that the best of the later novelists display development in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a distinct moral to enforce , though certainly the reader may draw a hundred if he choose , in proportion to the breadth and catholicity of the story . Not one of them obtrudes himself as a teacher either of ethics or of a*sthetics . Not one of them but tells his story as straightforwardly as may be , if Mr. Black 's landscape painting be excepted , without turning aside on this hand or on that into strange regions and remote from the burden of the story . In objectiveness of form at least there is noticeable development . What we call subtlety is the second mark of artistic advancement . Possibly " subtlety " is as great a verbal shuttlecock among the literary critics as " subjective " and " objective " are among the metaphysicians*quite as difficult to define . But it is at all events well apprehended and recognizable , and no one fails to perceive the distinction between subtle humor and broad humor , for instance , or to appreciate the significance of the applied adjective , whatever vagueness may lie in the abstract quality . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the best of the later novelists than subtlety in manner and method . In by far the majority of instances there can be no doubt of the artistic advantage which is gained in this way ; for subtlety , whatever it may mean , does not mean obscurity , and one may say , in a general way at least , that it includes delicacy , 625 reflnement* intelligence , intellectual purity , and the perception of essential values , obvious or occult , and of the differences between them . Consequently the best of the later novelists are , asexcepting the giants  --  the earlier novelists were not , pretty deadly foes to sentimentality , or what the school of Sterne calls sensibility . Consequently Mr. Blackmore 's Lorna , for example , is depicted at once more vividly and more completely , at far less expenditure of words , than is the virtuous Clarissa of the elaborate and exhaustive Richardson . Consequently the complexity of emotions , the varying shades of human character , the passions and prejudices of human life , are portrayed with a nicer if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Black , Blackmore , and Hardy on the other side of the Atlantic , and by Messrs . Hawthorne , Howells , and James on this side ( notably by the two latter in either instance ) , than by the founders of modern fiction and their successors hitherto . So that in these two points , objectiveness of form and subtlety of expression , the modern novel does show a development in manner and method . IL O* the authors just mentioned , whose writings illustrate the development in manner and method , the three former one may take leave to call the best exponents of the most recent English fiction . Mr. William Black has been writing longer and is more widely known than either Mr. Blackmore or Mr. Hardy . For several years now his books have been read by all novelreaders , always with pleasure and sometimes with profit . One of the most fertile of romance writers he is , to say no more of him . The number of books he has published , even bearing in mind the proverbial fertility of novelists , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popularity and his fecundity , and considering // too the general evenness of his excellence , there is small difficulty in the way of getting at a pretty just estimate of his work . Such an estimate ought to assign to it an honorable position . In the first place , one may claim originality for it . To critics of candor and culture , such a claim to be sure may seem somewhat extravagant . And if " originality " be used in a very strict sense , it undoubtedly is extravagant . Nevertheless , when one considers very much of contemporary novelwriting and very much of that which has gone before , it is quite fair to call Mr. Black 's simplicity of style and statement , of manner and method , of aim and scope , original in a certain sense . Evidently when he began to write he made a new departure , started on a new line , and , cutting himself quite free from traditional trammels , set out to write a series of novels which should at all hazards be unpretentious-be simple , unaffected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and not strike very deeply into the mine of human feeling , or deal with much that is sacred and secret in the highest or at least in an ideal sense . Hitherto he has accomplished this in great measure , failing where he has failed by no means from lack of effort , but contrariwise from too much thereof . Simplicity is the word by which above all others to describe his books , from " A Princess of Thule , " which is undoubtedly the best , to " The Monarch of Mincing Lane , " which is perhaps the worst . He is the Robertson of novelists . Anything heroic , anything romantically remote , anything melodramatic , anything chivalric or picturesque that is not to be run across in the streets of London , or in the fields of Cornwall , or on the Hebridean coast by any casual traveller whose eyes are open , is not to be found in the books of Black any more than it is in the plays of Robertson . Like Robertson too , he escapes very generally the reproach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their sentiments are those one finds in one 's neighbors ; their purposes in life , their love , devotion , sacrifice , hypocrisy , and baseness , are the same qualities , displayed in the same way , aroused by the same causes , that every one has experience of in himself or in others . Nevertheless very little of their sayings and doings is conventional in the commonplace sense of the word . There is enough of plot to arouse some interest , and the interest is heightened by the sense of reality which pervades the whole and stimulates one 's sympathy of thought and emotion . This effort after simplicity has in most cases two especially happy results with Mr. Black . It is disastrous in the first place to sentimentality and in the second place to melodramatic absurdity . One recalls several exceptions ; there is a little of the former evil in the description of the quarrel and the reconciliation in " A Princess of Thule , " for instance , and a good deal of the latter in the nonsensical and unnatural complication which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mincing Lane , " and notably in the closing scene in " Three Feathers , " which is meant to be dramatic , and is only ridiculous . And it is not difficult to trace all of these exceptional blemishes to a kind of corruption of this same effort after simplicity . That is to say , when Mr. Black has to deal with anything outside of his regular line of business , so to speak-anything really dramatic or intense-his desire to make it consistent with the even placidity of its surroundings , added to its essential strangeness to him , makes his art unpleasantly evident . What is most noticeable then is his repression and endeavor after subtlety . He tells his reader very unconsciously , but very plainly , that he has now something romantic or something dramatic to describe ; that it is rather hard fr him to do , rather out of his line ; but " stay , " he adds ; " observe how easily I do it ; how I keep my head cool and my vision clear ; how I literally understate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result is that his art becomes artifice . Therefore he does lose at once the flavor of true romance and the sense of true power-does it by overdoing , by his evident effort at effortless effect . No one can fail to see how fatal this is to what we call the flavor of true romance . And it is equally fatal to the sense of true power . But there is another characteristic of Mr. Black 's writings which is still more fatal to this latter . What has won for their author more admiration than anything else has done is perhaps his ability in describing nature . Every nine of every ten readers of his novels , if forced to say without reflection for which of his characteristics they most delighted in him , would probably say his " descriptions " - meaning thereby for most part the luxuriance and abundance with which natural scenery figures in his writings . A fine field for this there is in the plot and plan of " A Princess of Thule , " and here as elsewhere Mr. Black has availed himself of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Three Feathers , " much the same with " A Monarch of Mincing Lane " even , and " In Silk Attire , " and " The Strange Adventures of a Pha*iton " has for its warp and woof literally nothing else . This tendency of novelists has probably reached its limit in Mr. Black . Mr. Blackmore is fond enough of it , and Mr. Hardy is too , but neither of them basks and bathes in it as Mr. Black does . And hitherto it has not been very noticeable in the best novels ; that is to say , at all events , it has been made subordinate to the main purpose with a good deal more sincerity and success than Mr. Black displays . It is not-artistically considered  --  a good thing , though it is easy to see why Mr. Black 's admirers should consider it a pleasant thing-apart from considerations of art . Furnished as Mr. Black furnishes it , doubtless it comes to most people , certainly to most Englishmen , with a delicious sense of freshness and freedom , as a kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an evidence of having shaken off the shackles of conventionality . Descriptions of the Hebridean winter , such as one looks for in Bayard Taylor ; of the cliffs of Cornwall and the fields of Kent , such as one expects in Ruskin ; of a bank of violets , a cloudless sky , " a world of heather , " an evening on the barrens , a trout brook , the little bridge at Henley-anything in which there is room for a landscape painter to luxuriateone runs across not only in every chapter but at every page almost in all Mr. Black 's books . And the evident delight which the painter takes in his pictures , the deep and broad love he has for nature in all its phases , render these " descriptions " of his by no means unpleasant contrasts to a great deal of the melodramatic or medical ( as Tame would say ) matter in which works of fiction do abound . Nevertheless one does tire of them after a time-after reading whole pages , whole chapters , entire volumes of them , as Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are quite distinct from Mr. Black 's business . Being not a landscape painter , nor a pastoral poet , nor a rhapsodical essayist , nor a complete angler , but a novelist , his business is , essentially and at bottom , with man , not with nature ; with character and incident , not with settings and surroundings ; with figures rather than with fields . Descriptious of natural scenery are , with extremely rare exceptions , out of place in novels . Those exceptions are when they are accessory to the main purpose of the book , when they are subordinate , illustrative , decorative . In broad terms the main object of the novel is the representation of human character , the depiction of human life and love in narrative prose . With this definition at all events few people will quarrel , but Mr. Black really does not seem to bh persuaded of its truth at all . His main object is to paint landscape in words . So far as that goes , it may be done , of course , well or ill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But it is not novel writing-that is quite clear ; and not being novel writing , being a violation of a nice sense of proportions , being in a word bad art , it is a cause of weakness in Mr. Black . And it operates in two ways . Positively it produces weakness by making prominent what is essentially subordinate , as just suggested , and negatively it prevents power by making subordinate what is essentially prominent . Mr. Black 's characters are in many instances only pegs upon which to hang his landscape pictures ; in most instances their elaboration does not occupy much of his mind and heart ; in only one instance does he seem fairly to have fallen in love with one of his creations-fallen in love either after the analytical manner of Balzac 's love for Valerie or after the emotional manner of Thackeray 's affectionate tenderness for Rachel Esmond-and that is the instance of his Princess Sheila . It results inevitably from this , that " A Princess of Thule " is Mr. Black 's best book . In that novel the distribution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the true relations between foreground , middle distance , and background are more properly pre*erved , and the landscape has more inseparable and inherent relations to the characters portrayed than one finds in the rest of Mr. Black 's novels . And yet even this , the fairest example that one can take , illustrates in no small degree this negative lack of power , characteristic of Mr. Black , and proceeding from his lack of perception of the true relations between subjects and their attributes . Even here Mr. Black delights quite as much in describing the wild and weird landscape lights and shades of the Orkneys as he does in portraying his Sheila or her father . Even here , these two characters excepted , we get relief from the woodenness of the rest only in the flights of seagulls , the mountain storms , and in pictures of the mystic northern twilight . Even here the romance of the story is subjected to the romance of the region in which for the most part its events occur . Never let a word of unmerited detraction be bestowed upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wearied with Bulwer and sickened with James , as a fresh breath of early spring time , and to readers of novels , exhausted by Collins and fatigued by Trollope , as an invigorating bath of sea air . It introduces one to an entirely new corner of the earth , hitherto wholly unexplored by romancers , and yet almost as fit a field for the romantic story-teller as the highlands of " Rob Roy " or the woods of " The iDeerslayer . " It makes one acquainted with two more friends in fiction worthy to have a place in that select and not too numerous assemblage , both of them altogether simple , unaffected , and valuable . And the story of it is healthful , fresh , and here and there touching to a degree . But at the same time this is very nearly all there is to be said for it . One does not recall an instance of the display of real power between its covers . Even the romance of it is due to its landscape rather than to its figures , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very little , still noticeably a little-of its delicacy and bloom-by the very fear the author has of overstepping the line and treading on the soil of melodrama . The plot is simplicity itself ; one can forecast it very early ; and yet it has clumsy workmanship here and there in it-deeds of too great moment springing from too trivial causes ; detours of interest , so to speak , without just reason ; quarrels and reconciliations a little strained ; and at the end a little slovenliness , intImating that the author sees the result so clearly himself as to be a trifle careless about the finishing strokes . Save the charming Princess and the quaint old King of Borva , the figures of the book have a certain woodenness and inelasticity of movement , and essentially considered , might have been taken from any one of a hundred novels . The imperturbable Ingram and // the volatile Lavender are reproductions of very well worn types ; the Lorraines are somewhat anomalous in point of art , to be sure , but fully as much so in point of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mosenberg , and the different London people , are vague outlines , sketches only , and not finished portraits . More than all , the book is lacking in purpose . It does not pretend to illustrate any principle or peculiarity of human life or character ; it does not reveal any of the hidden motives or passions of the human heart ; it does not show the relations between or the reciprocal influences of men and their fellows , of one character and those around it . It is a pretty strain , played upon a pleasant pipe by a graceful lover of nature , now and then varied with touches of something more vital , which make one wish them more frequent and better sustained . III . ONE gets into considerably deeper water in writing about Mr. R. D. Blackmore , in whose works , whatever else may be said of them , there is certainly genius , if not vast , at least unmistakable . It is surprising to see how disproportionate Mr. Blackmore 's fame is to his merits . He has written a half dozen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some have very extraordinary merits ; and yet , compared with a half dozen recent novelists , he has no fame at all-at all events no popularity at all . Beyond some newspaper notices , infrequent and brief , though uniformly complimentary if discerning , he has not hitherto been talked about at all ; and compared with the half dozen or more of men who are his contemporaries , but not his compeer* , just alluded to , he is not read at all . But on second thoughts , and recollecting the way in which " Pamela* ' once popularly outshone " Joseph Andrews " and " Oliver Twist " the " Novel Without a Hero , " 40 and the works of G. P. H. James , for instance , the earlier works of George Eliot , Mr. Blackmore 's lack of popular recognition at present , and his prospects of getting it some day , are not altogether discouraging . For Mr. Blackmore is entirely worthy of being ranked with these and other really noble writers , who have in cant phrase fought their way to fame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first place , if one can claim originality in a certain sense for Mr. Black , one can assert it of Mr. Blackmore in the fullest possible sense and in the most audible manner . What strikes one most forcibly in taking up his books , and what remains with one most abidingly after laying them down , is a vivid impression of their extreme freshness  --  the same kind of impression that Mr. Bret Harte made in an inferior way when he published his first sketches . " The Maid of Sker " and " Lorna Doone " are quite without precedent in style and scope , however one may find analogies to them here and there in the catalogue of novels . Their freshness , too , unlike that of Mr. Black 's books , is of a very positive character , and does not consist at all in the avoidance of both melodramatic absurdity and sentimentality , but rather in the directness at once and the subtlety of their author 's simplicity of statement . This simplicity of statement , which is characteristic of novel writing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottom paradoxical to call both subtle and direct , is unlike and superior to Mr. Black 's simplicity , because it is always sincere . There is not in all Mr. Blackmore 's writings a single instance of insincerity ; and consequently there are not to be found in them any of those exceptional blemishes -melodramatically absurd on the one hand and sentimental on the other-which are to be found in the best of Mr. Black 's books . Their author never seems careful to produce *n effect of one kind or another-least of all does he // display consciously or unconsciously any anxiety to conceal his carefulness . And when it is remembered that nothing is so intricate and complex as human character , which it is the main province of the novelist to illustrate and portray , this sincerity of simplicity in illustration and portraiture is seen to be a very admirable thing-to be a characteristic of novel writing of the very highest order  --  to be an evidence of genius . It characterizes everything Mr. Blackmore has to say . Mr. Black 's simplest and best writing is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Blackmore can paint landscape too-better beyond doubt than Mr. Black . But if his writing is better at one time than it is at another , it is when he is describing the peculiarities of character . Then , in simplicity , subtlety , flavor , charm , and real power , it is surprising . And in his two best books , " Lorna Doone " and " The Maid of Sker , " it is additionally surprising , because it aims , and in most instances aims successfully , to be archaic . Yet the archaic style of John Ridd of the seventeenth century seems well nigh as perfect as the archaic style of Colonel Henry Esmond of the eighteenth , and that of the illustrious Llewellyn is not far behind it . Moreover , it has besides this success in imitation a distinct and perfectly recognizable individuality which is Mr. Blackmore 's own as entirely as the individuality of Henry Esmond 's is Thackeray 's own . There is this one advantage which a novelist has in copying the language as well as the manners of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the use of an autobiographical form . Critics differ about the advantage of this form in novels that treat of the era in which they are written , but there can be no dispute about the value of its employment in archaic novels . Except Thackeray , no one ever made the most of this advantage , to be sure , and Mr. Blackmore forgets now and then , if indeed he bears in mind at all , that the autobiographer ought always to be a writer . This is in fact the chief fault that one has to find with him . His John Ridd had schooling in early youth , but not enough to warrant the extreme cultivation of his style , which is everywhere on a higher level than one looks for in an Exmoor sheepraiser of the days of King James . And the discrepancy between the education and position of Davy Llewellyn and the many subtleties of his expression is still more apparent-even glaring ; so that up to the middle of the book one is somewhat at a loss to determine whether or no the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the rest of the world . Still , this form enables Mr. Blackmore to portray more vividly and picturesquely , more charmingly at once and more powerfully , what it is the function of his highest powers to portray ; human character , namely . For not only his best writing , but his best work of any sort , is done in delineating men and manners . Whatever qualities one may admire in him , one easily recognizes his delicacy and power in the portrayal of human character as transcending them all . Delicate this portrayal always is . Fine and minute shades of character , the slight and subtle shifting of motives and emotions , the influences slow and secret of circumstances upon character , one does not find anywhere in contemporary fiction more delicately described than in " Lorna Doone . " The same work displays power equally rare and remarkable . Its strength stirs one 's susceptibility profoundly , as its delicacy charms one 's sense daintily and delightfully . Interest it has from the first chapter to the last . The prowess , the bravery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unaffected selfesteem of John Ridd are depicted powerfully enough to arouse one 's sentiments of admiration , amazement , real affection , and good-natured kindliness , as if Master Ridd were not at all in the realm of fiction , but a person of very authentic history . The quali // ties of the principal character in " The Maid of Sker " are drawn with an equally powerful hand , and the minor personages in either work are described and differentiated with almost the same discriminating delicacy and pungent power . Parson Chowne is an admirable portrait ; Carver Doone is still better ; Master Huckaback and his little Ruth , Old Sir Ensor , the fair Lorna herself , the various people that make up the Sker population and buy stale fish of the upright Llewellyn , are all drawn with a freedom and apparent ease , and at the same time a discernment of the subtle differences and diversities of human character , to be found only in the work of a master hand . It is to be noticed that success in this latter-in the perception of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of genius of a very high order . And this success Mr. Blackmore has achieved in very abundant measure . No two of his personages are so similar as to be essentially identical , and , at the same time , no one of them is a characteristic exaggerated into a character  --  a trait into a person . This , which is true in the widest sense of the portraits in " Lorna Doone " and in " The Maid of Sker , " the best of Mr. Blackmore 's books , is still true in a narrower sense of those in " Alice Lorraine " and " Cradock Nowell , " which are considerably below the other two in interest and in merit . In these novels , however , though one does not fail to recognize the genius which depicted so delicately and so powerfully John Ridd and Davy Llewellyn , one also can not help feeling in one cese the crudity and in the other the carelessness of its expression . " Alice Lorraine " is one of its author 's latest books , and like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written in the confident assurance of an audience already gained by more careful and thorough work . It bears the same relation to " Lorna Doone , " to take one example only , that Mr. Black 's " Three Feathers " does to his " A Princess of Thule . " Mr. Blackmore did n't consider his plan and plot quite maturely enough to realize before beginning to elaborate it that it was rather too slender , and a trifle too whimsical withal* to interest him throughout the telling of it , and he seems to have got a little tired of it a good while before he wrote its last chapter . Consequently it displays the same carelessness here and there which " Three Feathers " does-carelessness not only in the details of narration , but in the portrayal of character ; and this is a good deal less excusable in Mr. Blackmore than it is in Mr. Black . The book has merits many and manifold , and to most contemporary novelists it would be an extremely creditable work . But it is not to the author of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Cradock Nowell " and " Cripps the Carrier " are still less a credit to him . Returning to the best manifestations of Mr. Blackmore 's genius , one notices the natural result of this blending of power and delicacy in the charm of romance . These two qualities of style are not combined without this result in any work of fiction . They can not be employed to decorate and enforce what is essentially commonplace . One of them is always lacking both in melodramatic absurdity and in sentimentality-delicacy in the one instance and power in the other . And even Scott has not united them more happily in " Waverley " or in " Ivanhoe " or in " Rob Roy " than Mr. Blackmore has done in his own masterpiece of " Lorna Doone . " The strength of that work , given the plot and plan , in itself lends it a dramatic intensity and saves it from any suspicion of sentimentality on the one hand as the subtle delicacy of it prevents any flavor of melodramatic absurdity on the other . The visit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most romantic event which has taken place in the world of fiction since the visit of young Waverley to the famous Highland cave of Donald Bean Lean ; and in what is wild and // weird and awful it transcends even that and all similar romantic experiences of any of Scott 's men . Romantic incidents precede and follow it in as great abundance as the even and graceful flow of the narrative permitin greater abundance and of more purely romantic character than are to be found anywhere else in contemporary fiction . And at the same time , so ever present with Mr. Blackmore are these qualities of strength and refinement , that the blemishes of Bulwer 's romances , let us say , melodramatic absurdity and sentimentality , are always avoided . One other quality of Mr. Blackmore 's best work claims attention ; his humor , namely . The individuality of an author 's humor is as good a test of his originality as the quality of it is of his comparative rank . Both these tests result favorably in the instance of Mr. Blackmore . His humor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than any other quality of his work . And its quality s peculiarly subtle and refined . Withal it is humor distinctively , and not wit . It is pervasive rather than pointed . It characterizes Mr. Blackmore 's style rather than varies it . Like that style uniformly , it is the even flow of a limpid stream and not a sparkling congeries of crystals . It is always suggestive , and gcnerally it has what we call quaintness . Noticeably when Master John Ridd or Master Davy Llewellyn has occasion to chat with the reader about his own qualities of any kindhis discernment , his real nobility of character , or his physical prowessquaint is the word by which to describe his delicate humor ; it is quaint beyond the quaintness of " La Longue Carabine , " or of Major Dalgetty , or of our fine old friend the bailie Nicol Jarvie . So that , in their humor , their romance , their strength , and their vivid portrayal of character , the novels of Mr. Blackmore possess a charm which is not the less delightful in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IF in passing from Mr. Black to Mr. Blackmore one gets into deeper water , in passing from Mr. Blackmore to Mr. Thomas Hardy one gets into an entirely different atmosphere . Subtle Mr. Hardy certainly is , and his books are certainly as objective as any of the later English novels . It is in habit of mind rather than in form of expression that he differs from Mr. Blackmore , and equally from Mr. Black . A more introspective , reflective analyst there is not to be found among latter-day novelists . When his " Far From the Madding Crowd , " which was published as a serial , was half complete , no discerning person felt disposed to deride the London " Spectator " for attributing it to George Eliot herself . At all events , however such a judgment may have overweighted him by suggesting an unfavorable comparison of his breadth and range of vision with those of the other writer , there is no doubt about Mr. Hardy 's worthiness to be classed with her in point of subtlety of perception and depth of insight between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habit of mind there Th a similarity between the two which is more than striking . No one who has formed an adequate estimate of the commanding figure which George Eliot has become in English literature will dispute that this is praise of the very highest kind ; and equally no one who has read Mr. Hardy 's two best books , " A Pair of Blue Eyes " and that just mentioned , will dispute the justice of the eulogy . In the first chapter of " A Pair of Blue Eyes " there is an interesting indication of Mr. Hardy 's own aim in fiction and incidentally of his admiration for the author of " Romola " and " Middlemarch . " His heroine is reading a book , " The Mill on the Floss " evidently from what is said about it further on , which Mr. Hardy says contains the saddest contretemps contained in any novel , " since fiction has taken a turn , for better or worse , for analyzing rather than depicting charac // 1876. ter and emotion . " Whether or no fiction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matters of fact there is a good deal of debate , certain it is that this is precisely what Mr. Hardy has done . It is exceedingly difficult in most instances to define the limit after which delineation becomes dissection , but it is quite as apparent that Mr. Hardy has passed this limit as it is that it has been passed by George Eliot and by Hawthorne . After reaching that limit it becomes a question how far a writer may go without abandoning what have always been and are always to be regarded as the principles of all good art . But Mr. Hardy writes so well and displays such prodigious perceptions that one may easily lose sight of the aesthetic question so far as it applies to general manner and method in contemplating the extremely artistic treatment of detail in his work , just as one does in the instances of George Eliot and Hawthorne . In point of style at all events there is this artistic treatment to be noticed in Mr. Hardy . Remembering the complexity and subtlety of human motives which it is his special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he does dissect character within certain limits , the simplicity and terse clearness of his style is noteworthy . One does not run across the involved sentences , the obscure intimations , and the blind suggestions which one does not fail to find in novels whose aim is similar to the aim of Mr. Hardy 's books . In every sense of the word these books are well written - better written than the earlier works of George Eliot , or than a great deal of her two latest works . Of course there are none of the common blemishes of style in them-no stilted language , no mawkish sentimentality , no melodramatic hysteria . But aside from its freedom from ordinary faults , this style is positively admirable for its purity and its perfect subordination to the end of style , which in a novel certainly is the clearest and most effective setting for the story . 63*3 It is a totally different style to that of Mr. Black , which is pleasant only , or to that of Mr. Blackmore , which is poetic chiefly . Grace it has and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marked or unfailingly present . It is clear , terse , strong ; sparkling with epigrams and antitheses here and there ; abounding with widespreading generalization and comprehensive formulations of feeling now and then ; surprisingly incisive and subtle when dealing with the deeper motives of the human heart ; a product of intellect altogether and of susceptibility not at all ; quite without tenderness or emotional tremor ; characterized chiefly and in a word by strength . Strength , too , is the quality with which one is chiefly impressed in the story as well as in the setting . Strictly speaking , the story as such does not matter much to Mr. Hardy . Almost any kind of a plot suffices him . Even the incidents , many of which are humorous , and the situations , some of which are intensely dramatic , seem to be developed not from the necessities of the narrative , but from the necessities of the characters . Not that they are clumsily handled ; Mr. Hardy is far too clever a workman to do anything clumsily ; but their interest is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they illustrate and illumine . There is no difficulty here about the artistic principle involved ; certainly incident and situation should always be made subordinate to character , but they nevertheless should not become so far subordinate as to touch the integrity of the narrative of which they do form a part and which after all is a far from unimportant piece in the mechanism of the novel . It seems that Mr. Hardy does really overstep this line . Indeed the novel with him is not a story of life at all ; it is a study in character . As such , it is brought by him to a very high state of finish and perfection . " Far from the Madding Crowd " is in this respect very near a masterpiece . The heroine , Batlisheba , // NOVEMBER , farmer Oak , Troy , and Boidwood as portraits are not altogether unique or altogether perfect ; but as studies in character they are very nearly both perfect and unique . Not being creations in portraiture , they neither add greatly to one 's knowledge of human nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in portraiture never fail to do . But being acute and subtle studies in character , they invariably arouse the intellectual interest which waits on all clever analysis . In a given situation Mr. Hardy , with his great power of dissection and his quickness and accuracy of observation , will show you the mixed motives and hidden impulses of each character with authority . The two principal situations in " Far from the Madding Crowd " are instances in point . Nothing can be more intensely dramatic than either the scene between Troy and his wife over the body of Troy 's murdered mistress , or that between Boldwood and his affianced over the body of the murdered Troy . But each of these situations depends for its interest not upon itself at all-as artistically it should in great part  --  but given the situation , upon its vast and varied influence upon the minds , motives , and actions of the actors concerned in it . And properly speaking , these are not actors in a drama , but subjects for dissection . This happens because Mr. Hardy is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the power of sustaining a character through its suggested development . And for this reason , " Under the Greenwood Tree , " which attempts the least of any of his novels , is in some respects the most artistic-though in respect of form " A Pair of Blue Eyes " must be acknowledged to outrank it even artistically . Fancy has the personal vanity which is a strong if not an overmastering impulse in all Mr. Hardy 's women for instance ; but with her it is natural , integral , and inherent from the beginning to the end of her story , and to take it away would destroy her altogether . The artistic treatment in both of the other novels mentioned is different . To take two instances only : in " Far from the Madding Crowd " there is a refreshing but still awkwardly sudden shifting of the characters to a higher level perceptible about half way through the book ; and in the other work there is an absolute and unexplained absence of development in the heroine after her elopement , which , together with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something like a tricky , untruthful , and morally reckless woman . Perfectly natural as this conversion may be , it is not developed and graduated by Mr. Hardy  --  the successive steps are lacking . Mr. Hardy seems to feel this , and to attempt to supply them . And he very nearly succeeds , but not quite . Moreover , masterly as Mr. Hardy 's analysis is , it must be repeated that its range is limited . Here is wherein it differs from the analysis of George Eliot-with whom one is constantly reminded to contrast and compare Mr. Hardy . Curiously enough , his works seem to cbntain one woman only . He does not appear to discern the cssential differences between " Romola " and " Te*a , " let us say . That preference of Blfride 's for the earrings to the music is an exhibition of paltry vanity exactly worthy of Fancy , while Elfride 's vanity is , or should be , of an entirely different texture . Bathsheba , fascinated by a scarlet uniform and a soldier 's gayety , despite her admirable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three are the same woman . They , and their sisters in Mr. Hardy 's other books , are all elaborations of one conception , differentiated in details here and there , but all actuated by the same impulses , moved by the same influences , acting in the same way . Given the same temptation , Bathsheba , Elfride , Fancy succumb to it alike-succumb , too , it should be added ; for Mr. Hardy 's women are not very ideal beings . His fair readers , such of them at all events as are discerning whether candid or not , prob // ably regard him as a great cynic . And not discussing Mr. Congreve 's opinion , that " Nothing 's new except their faces , every woman is the same , " and laying aside the old and interminable controversy as to the moral characteristics of women-their lack of magnanimity , lack of conception of abstract justice , lack of this or that-one may without prejudice ask of Mr. Hardy not only a little more variety in " faces , " at all events , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher than an insti*ict , and whose sins are subject for condemnation as well as for curious inspection . This limit to Mr. Hardy 's powers in the line of their own best manifestation is not the only one . Even his men are divisible essentially into types and classes . His scenes are similar always . The hopes , fears , anxieties , joys , remorse , exaltation of his characters , are nearly identical in all his books ; all of which it is as unnecessary as it would be simple to show in detail . But within his limits he is well nigh not only unequalled , but unrivalled . Within his limits one may question if even Hawthorne is as subtle , or if even George Eliot is as sympathetic or as strong . W. C. BROWNELL.
