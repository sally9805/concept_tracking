TABLE-TALK . Oxu of the London journals calls for a treatise on " Conversation Openings ; " a work from which diffident men may learn how to get over the awkward pause that follows an introduction between strangers . Conversation , among people who have any thing in them , is a train that is pretty sure to go off safely when once fairly fired , but the first spark always requires effort , and sometimes skill . At an old-fashioned thanksgiving dinner , for instance , such as more people ate on the eighteenth of November last than on any previous day in human annals , who has not observed that it takes longer to start a live topic than to carve a turkey ; although , when cover is once broken , in either case , the work never stops till it is well done , and every body remembers only at parting how good it has been . So it is at this little table , around which we love to talk . Sometimes the company is all in one poor brain , and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ topic among themselves , after the fashion described by Gcorge Combe in one of his Essays on Phrenology ,  --  that mental science of fortune-tellers . Then there is no want of topics , no need of a specious opening ; for what man but is always enough at odds with himself to have something to dispute about internally ? But when friends drop in , the trouble comes . Here are four of them to-day sitting with me ; whom I call Conservative , Radical , Skeptic , and Woman , the last inclined , but not abandoned to strong-mindedness . These are not accurate descriptions , but the letters C. , IR. , S. , *and W. answer as well as any for initials ; adding E. which may stand for Ego the reporter . The want I feel is a topic ; after greetings , I therefore remark to all , by way of fishing for one : E. What dull times the newspapers have had for a month past . S. Yes , that is what makes them interesting to sensible men . In these times of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lasting interest , and so become brilliant . If a journal is still dull , in- spite of the dull times , the dulness must be innate and hopeless . if . Can any thing be duller than the writing of shallow men on deep themes ? I dread to see a serious subject handled in some newspapers , where the writers ' heads seem to run pure ink unmixed with brains . P. I could stand the dulness , were I sure of the honesty . But why do not the newspapers at once drive Mr. Jenckes 's Civil Service Bill through Congress , unless it be that they are as corrupt as the managing politicians-in fact , are with them ? S. You wrong them there . They can not harp on one thing forever . Most of them are certainly advocating the Bill after a fashion , perhaps not wisely 0 . But perhaps too well . Have yon considered what a profound change this Bill threatens to make in our government ? It will raise up a class of professional office-holders ; besides taking away half the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Can we afford to*weaken Congress , and make membership less desirable there ; or to form a sort of aristocracy by putting a permanent sqt of men in civil office ? P. We can certainly afford to take away all low motives for seeking a seat in Congress ; and thAt body would only // be strengthened by abolishing the curse of petty bargain and sale and intrigue now carried on in wielding this patronage . W. A terrible aristocracy , too , a few hundreds of clerks will be , working seven hours n-day for a thousand or twelve hundred dollars a-year ; and depending for their bread on hard work and good behavior. 1 ? . Yes ; if the Bill really weakened Congress , the Executive departments would press it strongly ; if it really looked to an aristocracy , Congress itself would at least give it a fair hearing and a direct vote . But unfortunately it is a measure which no one man seems to have more interest than another in adopting , except its author , to whom it will bring lasting honor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think they have , against it . There will never be a paid lobby for it ; and it can not pass , unless the people , whose Bill it is , resolve themselves into a sort of lobby of the whole , and demand it . E. They will do it , if petitions are actively circulated . I think the Bill has a good chance this year . It is sure to be a law before many years , and , once passed , can never be repealed , for it xviii at once make the government cheaper and more useful , and will help obviously to raise the public morals . S. How sanguine you are ! There must be a certain comfort in feeling so much faith in contrivances , legislative and other , to make governments and men cheap and good . E. Not at all : it is not a contrivance to make men good , but the removal of contrivances which now make them bad , that I commend in this Bill . The present system of patronage is corrupting to all concerned . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it away ? Why are men always ashamed to be caught believing , especially in anything good ? For my part , I believe that " contrivances , " as you call them , are just as capable of improving character as of harming it ; of exciting good motives as bad ones . Until you have people in politics who believe this , your " legislative contrivances " will not be worth much . * . The propensity to " meddle and muddle " is not exactly womanly , but is what men call womanish . When women vote , I suppose we shall have acts of Congress to make all mankind virtuous and happy . But so long as men have the social organization in charge , they will cling ever more to the let-alone doctrine . The people must work out their own life , in the simplest forms possible . S. Few in this country differ from you in the theory . But the trouble is to keep upour faith in it , through all slips and failures . You may make fun of the " Imperialist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institutions , but how does your doctrine of popular government get along under the load it has to carry , in the election frauds in New York and Brooklyn , for instance ? What is the use of voting , when the ballot-boxes are " stuffed " by gangs of unscrupulous men , or the returns manufactured , without regard to the votes really cast ? 1 ? . I have always regarded these frauds as scattered and local matters , which will stir the public conscience , and be put down , as soon as they become really important . S. The public conscience is more patient than Balaam 's ass , and says not a word , under blows that could scarcely be more terrible . IDo you know that this kind of cheating is growing every year ; that it already makes voting a mockery in these two great cities , and threatens to control the result in four of the largest States , should they be closely contested , in the next election for Pres-ident ? F. It is a cheap accusation for either party to bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? S. I have proof enough to put it beyond reasonable doubt that the official returns in New York , as finally made up , are the result , not of the votes of the people , but of the corrupt bargains of a few politicians . For instance , you know - : he is a republican , and is popularly said to // " swin* a ward , " and to know whatever is most worth knowing of " the inside of politics . " His circle of associates compliment him highly on the vote of his ward , which is unexpectedly favorable to his party . I asked him by what exertions he was able to do so well , and he told me , privately , this : " Why , you see , I had my own men among the Tammany mnnagers in our ward , who sold the whole concern out to me . I got a list of their repeaters ' names , and of the districts in which they would vote ; and so , early in the morning , I just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on all the names . When their gang came , it was too late ; their names had been voted on , and they dared not complain , lest their fraudulent registry be detected . " Again , in several election districts , where the boards of canvassers were made up from both parties , the returns were the result of mutual bargain and sale . Thus*in one place , the sole Republican canvasser had no interest in any local candidate , but wished " to take care of his State ticket . " But his Democratic associates were anxious for their Ward officers . Accordingly , they were permitted to " fix " the figures for all but the State offices ; then the Republican gave a large majority for his own candidates ; and did not blush to tell me so . These are but instances out of several that are familiar to all politicians of New York city . U. Why not enforce the law ? S. What do you suppose has become of the scores of " repeaters " caught on election-day ? What of the canvassers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Attorney to have forged their returns ? There is no court in these cities which will give the law a chance against such fellows ; for they act under the immediate direction of the men who make the judges . It is hard enough , at best , to convict of such a crime ; with the whole political power of the city and most of the judiciary in scarcely disguised sympathy with the rogues , it is impossible . P. I suppose then , we shall have to go on drifting away , with public morals corrupting and elections losing public confidence , until a crisis comes . Let a national election once be decided by such practices , or appear to have been so decided , and I suppose the people will find a way to stop them . Men who would rather fight than submit to a usurper , would probably not sit quietly under a ruler who had stolen his office . E. No ; but would you have party strife become actual war ? A great deal of letting alone is doubtless a very good thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now , I have a pet notion that the evil may be cured , not by complicated registry laws , and multiplied penalties which will never be enforced , but in the simplest way imaginable ; by making every fraud of the kind proclaim itself to the world . U. What do you mean ? E. I mean that the root of the trouble is in the secret ballot . Suppose each voter , instead of putting a paper into a box , had to speak up in a loud voice , in answer to his name , and say for whom he votes . This would check repeating by making it very dangerous . Every suspected voter would be watched by a greater number of men than now . There would be a motive to follow him up which does not now exist : for his vote , being on record , could be cast out , and the poll corrected , at any time , while , now that the voting is secret , his ballot can not be tracked , but once cast is in finally . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the forging of returns , the last and favorite way of cheating . Around each poll would be a number of citizens , the agents of each party , who would keep their private registry to check that of the canvassers , and false returns would be as impossible as they are in norainating conventions . U. Very fine , indeed ; but you must see objections enough . The Constitution of New York requi*res all elections to be by ballot . P. Yes , but the Constitution of the United States gives Congress the power to regulate the form , at least of national elections . U. That may be tine ; but a harder // task than defining a Constitution remains . How will you change the habits of the people ? Right or wrong , they cherish the ballot as a national institution , and will be slow to give it up . E. Why ? It is of no real value in this country . Nobody 's vote is really a secret ; if any employer were disposed to drive his men to vote with him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily as to speak cut under his dictation . But such compulsion is impossible in this country . S. No , it is not impossible in any country , but least of all where wealth has the unchecked authority in society and polities which it is gaining here . There is a certain instinct among the people , confirmed more and more every year by what they hear of the unavailing demand of the British laborer for the ballot , which tells them that the franchise is not worth much , if it can not be exercised in secret , on an emergency . Remember that these election frauds are really dreaded by but a handful of the voters , even of the great cities ; while all of four millions of citizens throughout the land know what a delicious thing it is to " scratch " a candidate or two , on occasion , without being suspected . You can not persuade them to give it up . 1 ? . Well , I should at least like to see a fair effort made . I think our people are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secrecy in this matter . Let them see the advantages of publicity , and they will accept it . If not , we . shall have to try Mr. Wendell Phillips 's panacea ; he insists that when women vote , elections will be pure . ( * . This is fortunately no longer an open question . A recent Act of Parliament , on Municipal Elections , was drawn up so carelessly that , with no such intention , it let the female sex through one of its ambiguities ; and they have just been voting in Nottingham . It was always a corrupt place ; a sort of rotten borough , famous for bribery . But , on this occasion , no secret was made of the market for vote the working-women evidently findin0 the sale of them the easiest imaginable way to get a good dinner  --  a rare luxury for them . Many of them sold their votes to both sides . JY . But you do not suppose that the bad conduct of the working-women hi Nottingham proves any thing against the women of the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notion that the mere presence of women is to purify politics . The only protection against bribery is character in the voter ; and unless women have a higher sense of their responsibility to society in voting than men have , they will be ju* as likely to sell out their franchise . Surely no one will claim that they have that sense now . E. You despair of any cure for cheating at elections , then ? S. I despair of any grand stroke of legislation , by which this is to be done , or any other great good that lies in character . Public opinion is the essential institution , out of which all others grow ; and the only men that are likely to fight successfully against corruption are those who keep hammering away at the public mind , quickening its conscien awakening its indignation , and then directing its efforts for reform into the simplest and easiest methods . Tinkering with forms of government is a fashionable vice of the day ; but in a republican country the particular forms do not really matter much . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the government can never be much better or much worse than that is. 1 ? . Your opinion of the French people , then , must be a very low one indeed ; for they have repeatedly tried to set up a popular government , but it always degenerates rapidly into a despotism ; and , I take it , that is the very worst tendency a government can have . Does it indicate that the French are the worst of people ? S. By no means . They are far behind the English or Americans in political education , and especially in that sense for law which is its best result . But they are on the road to its attainment , and have a good foundation for it in their thorough drill ; for it is not in their army // only , but In their literature and in all combined action , that the French are the best-drilled people in the world . Consider , too , how far ahead they are , even in politics , of every nation but t o or three . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fairly be said even of the Italians . Whether any nation on earth knows enough not only to desire it , but to keep it , is as yet unknown . 11 ? . I begin to have hope of the French , since they elected Rochefort , from Paris , to the Corps Legislatif . It shows that the democrats are really irreconcilable . The Emperor can not spare power enough to buy them . He must give up all he has , and be merely a man , before they will tolerate him . Even then , I believe , most of them would have him tried for the muiders of December ; and they are right . *J . That is just the spirit that is threatening France , and therefore Europe , with a social chaos . Admit that Napoleon is a usurper-was once a tyrant a murderer : what has any one to do with that , if he acts wisely now , and gives the French the best governineut attainable ? Shall mere personal hatred and revenge take the place of statesmanship ? " Echoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ill , And never let our ears have done with noise W What ! Let a man rule a great nation , stand forth before the world as its chief and spokesman , whose soul and life are red and black with every crime ? Surely not , if virtue can get strength enough to crush him ! It is bad enough for a people to be forced to endure his rule , but their supreme dcwradatien would be to accept it . S. It seems pretty safe to predict that they will not accept it . The Emperor 's speech , promising the largest liberty , has been received with enthusiasm by the Corps Legislatif , which is the French Congress ; and a very French Congress indeed . He is eloquent as well as powerful , and in France *th eloquence and power go further in controlling opinion than anywbeec else . But he really made VOL . Y.-9 no important concessions ; not a tithe of what the people demand , and the first discussions are likely to define sharply the antagonism between him and them . 0 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ danger from , below as well as fl-em above , and that a Paris mob may become a many-headed tyrmt , wos-se than the one they are attacking . When such men as Thncel and Ganshetta begin to deprecate revolution , you may be sure that shrewd ambition suspects a pretty obstinate life in the Empire yet . TV . But do not submit to be dazzled by the light of a crown , so as to condone a life that unites Belial and Moloch . I do n't like cursing , but I read Swinburne 's cursing sonnets on Napoleon as meant for the ruler , not for the man , and so get along with them as well as with David 's cursing Psalms . Let me read you one of them : " ITath he not deeds to do and days to see Yet ore the day that is to see him dead ? Beats there no brain yet in the poisonous he 'd , Throbs there no treason ? If o such thin8 there be , If no such thought , sorely this is cot he . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red ? What are the shadows about this soon 's bed ? Death , was not this the cup-bearer to thee ? Nay , let him live then till in this life 's stead Even he shall pray for that thou loast to give ; Till , seeing his hones and not his memories hoC , Even he shall cry upon thee a bitter cry , That life is worse than death ; then let him live , Till death seems worse than life ; then let loim die " S. Kochefort set to music ; Ia Lanterne lifted into the mists of verse , till it becomes a sham star . Sad will the night he in which it becomes the guiding star of France . Ladies may be excused for bi-inging moral judgments into politics , but men and nations are mined by it . Either religion or morality is sure to degrade and corrupt statesmanship , ot rather to destroy it . Church polities are always the worst in the world , and moral-sense politics not *ar behind them . Goveinment will not bear looking at in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Byron was right on this point , as we shall all agree : " Were things but only called by their right nat e , Cusar himself would be eshamned of fame . " E. You are fond of Byron , since the haitI st:ries about him . When do you // find time to read him ? And what sort of books do you keep at hand , to pick up in odd hours ? S. I have no rule about it . For five years I carried Tennyson in my pocket ; then fell back on Shakespeare for a year or two ; then to Goethe . But of late my leisure has gone to books of the hour , or to its reviews , magazines , and newspapers . C ' . Every body tells the same thing . Is it not unfortuna4e that even well-read men , as we call them , are so miscellaneous in this ? S. Not at all . That is what makes them well-read . System in study is good , but system in general reading is as undesirable as it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a capital blunder here . A regular training in a special line is necessary to mental efficiency , as it is to every other sort of efficiency , and a good writer or thinker or speaker must have it . But out of his line , what he wants is intelligence ; and intelligence never came yet by system . Read every thing ; if you ca n't do that , at least read a variety . 6 ' . But does not most of such reading 00 to waste ? S. That depends on what you mean by waste . Business is work ; study is the hardest kind of work ; but reading ought to be recreation . If eating , drinking , rest , and amusement are waste , general reading is so . It is the mind 's greatest luxury , and ought to be just the opposite of work , and is so in precisely the best professional workers . C. But there you run against Lord Coke , Mr. Warren , Professor Porter , and every other adviser of authority . Besides* how can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same mind ? For instance , how shall it be hard work for a reviewer to study up Mr. Lecky 's History of European Morals for review , and mere play for another man to read the same book , with the same attention , and of his own curiosity ? S. Just as a game of chess may be professional wor for Staunton or Anderssen , while you and I find rest in it . Systems always run in ruts , however well conceived they may be . The thing to avoid in reading is mere ruts ; narrowing one 's interest in the world by taking a few points of view , a few lines of thought , instead of keeping open to all . Intelligence means communion with the intellectual world in all its forms of activity . Intelligence means knowledge that is wide enough to afford sympathy and tolerance to every form of narrowness . C ' . A smattering of every thing is then to be preferred to thorough knowledge of one or a few subjects ? S. No ; but no reproach is easier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If a man slights his proper work , and fails to do that thoroughly , he is justly called a smatterer . So it is , too , if he blindly or weakly cuts himself off from the few great principles which underlie every subject of reading , and deals in isolated fragments of knowledge . The genera reader could not help doing this some ages ago , but now most subjects he *vi1l want to know lie in clear outline in the literature of the day around him . He fixes these principles in his mind the more by every bit of reading he really enjoys , and afterwards reads on in the light of them . W. You do not join in the abuse so many lavish on the rage for periodicals , which are supplanting standard books ? S. Not at all ; the fact is not that the taste of readers is lower , but that current literature is better . It has risennot all , but the best of it-far above the taste of old times ; and now there is no one who can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TV . This is comforting doctrine to most of us desultory readers . But " the classics " lie on our consciences still . S. Well , we had better throw them off . The less we have to do with them , except as inclination leads the way , the better . The golden rule is to follow one 's own curiosity , one 's own interest , the natural stimulus ; and this will bring us up to them whenever they are good for us . What good will a man get out of Shakespeare , who forces his mind to // him as a task ? He wrote to amuse ; *nd only the mind in search of amusement can really reach his . It is this importation of the impertinent idea of duty and responsibility into hours of intellectual enjoyment that destroys all geniality in our culture . Keep it for work , where it belongs ; and at other times , let the mind live and grow , as the river runs , " at its own sweet will . " ( * . But what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most of itself in any mood but " As ever in my great Taskmaster 's eye " ? Shall not a man live always under the pressure to make the most of himself ? S. No man ever made the most of himself . The best minds are but the fragments of the plan they are built on-the wrecks of what they might have been . But life has no economies ; intellectual life the least of all . It is lavish of its capabilities ; " of fifty seeds , it often brings but one to bear ; " and to husband them anxiously is the worst mistake of all . Let it grow ; leave the mystery of waste to the future that is " behind the veil ; " and enjoy freedom . Rely on it , only in the frolic freedom of its own impulses does mind gather the best power . 6* . This were good talk for the Middle Ages , but it is sowing thistles in a field of thorns to teach such doctrines now . We live in a desultory world , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and literature , at best , lies around us in little scraps . What grand old times they were when work was play ; when great men found rest enough in what they had to do , and if it made them tired , only inferred that it was a worthy task , and kept at it the longer . There was Milton , the model radical , six or seven generations ago . Almost all that we know of his life is , that he was never idle for a minute . In his book on EducAtion , he lays down a plan of study that fills every hour of life , and in the midst of it remarks that the student , in a few odd hours , will easily have picked up the Italian language . Why not ? A man of proper system would do that in a couple of years , while undressing , or in his bath . But study is unknown now , and the world of mind , instead of a round globe moving in a majestic orbit , is shattered into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little worth finding . P. What will not blindness conceal from a man ! If your eyes are shut , the sun is no more to you than a farthing dip . But all this grumbling is refuted by one fact , which is , that of all ages , this is the age of scholarship , of the highest as well as of the most diffused intelligence . For instance , no nation ever before could boast among its living men seven such names as Gladstone , Bright , Mill , Baine , Spencer , Huxley , and Tyndall ; and how many men there are , in England alone , who rank near them ! You hold , I suppose , that when " Light shall spread , and man be liker man Through all the circle of the golden year , " it will be by dragging down the great to the dead level . But not so ; it is only when the highest are still struggling upward that the whole mass of society is lifted . S. Assertion proves neither 's position ; and much is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly room for two opposite opinions as to the chance great minds have for the best culture in American society . IDe Tocqueville was a good observer , and he found public opinion in cur democracy a most watchful despot , and thought there was less intellectual freedom here than anywhere else . Yet somebody has said-no matter who , for it has become a proverb-. - that " nothing pays in America like heresy . " Which is right ? If . I do n't think this a contradiction . Society is a tyrant to any opinion that conflicts with its passions or convenience , but is tolerant enough otherwise . This was seen when Southern sympatliizers , so respectable before , suddenly became to us the enemies of mankind , in April , 1861 . So the movement for elevating woman has been better received here than it could possibly have been in any other country , with less bitterness and less ridicule . But let it once become an immediate practical question whether women shall vote or not , and // you will see passions nearly as strong as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if one may take his own feelings as an epitome of the nation's-and that is the only way to guess at these in advance . We all felt a large amount of compressed indignation against rebels before the war began , but we have no such explosive tendencies toward you and your ambitious designs . TV Yet when a few earnest women go to a medical school in Philadelphia , they are stared at like samples of the gorilla tribe , and pursued with gibes through the streets , by the men of science . 1 ? . Yes ; but the act has stirred up the whole world in favor of them . The cable report of it in Great Britain was followed within a week by the official invitation to women to study medicine in the University of Edinburgh . Here in New York public opinion is strong against excluding them from the schools , and the young men in some of these welcome them . C. Strong , hut unreasoning and unreasonable . There may be some need that women who act as nurses shall learn little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the notion of making practitioners of them will be labelled " poison , " and laid away , in another generation , side by side with such fancies of this age as the *iEcumenical Council and the Northwest Passage . 1 ? . You seem to me to retire a century further into prejudice every ten minutes . Thanks to free discussion , that question is settled ; and nothing is needed but time to educate enough women for the work , when you will see men driven entirely from those branches of medical practice which they ought never to have entered . E. We must all at least agree that , so far , women seem peculiarly fit for medical practitioners , and the public generally are now ready to see them undertake a great part of this work , and to trust them in it . C* . Well , you are all against me in this , but I know how to set you at odds . What do you expect will become of the emancipated blacks in the Southern States ? If the " suppressed sex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what is to be done for the suppressed race ? Do n't all speak at once ! S. You know my view . The happiest place laThe world for negroes is in tropical islands , such as the British West Indies ; yet after nearly thirty years of freedom there , they are poorer than they were the day they were emancipated , and there are fewer of them . Their numbers now diminish every year . I see no other future for any thoroughly inferior race that comes in contact with ours than gradual extermination . It is well for the world that it is so . W. You often talk extravagantly , when we are in doubt whether you mean it or not ; but this must be a jest . S. By no means . The hope of the world is in the possession of it by the best races , and the killing out of weaker and coarser ones . Anglo-Saxon blood is better undiluted . If every negro on earth should die to-day , humanity would be the richer for it to-morrow . E. But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world be poorer by millions of enjoying lives ? S. Life is the merest trifle , and the weakness of this age comes from the habit of looking at it through a microscope . Every body magnifies its value , and our ears are deafened by the clamor and twaddle of those who regard life as greater than its ends . The war taught us for a while that it is better to kill or be killed outright than to live or let live worthless days ; but now we are forgettifig all that , and the old sickly snuffle about the gallows , and judicial murders , and the infinite value of life and the sin of war , is coming back . We shall get over it when real work faces us again ; and there will never be any true civilization until " the individual withers , and the world is more and more " - until , that is , each man regards his own life , and his neighbor 's , too , as nothing but a means to the general good . ( * . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? S. I would do away with maudlin exaggeration , and not pretend to an optiin // ism no one really believes . What are the blacks good for ? They are idle , vicious , weak in body , passionate , with brains half org*nized ; and the effort and cost of bringin them up to the level it has taken us untold ages to reach , would hold us back for centuries . They will be a mere din0 on our nation , but I hope they will die out . W. The author of our " Sketches in Color " has seen them through and through , and knows better . She finds *n them qualities of greatness , and thinks they may yet work out somewhere a national life , worthy to compare with the best .

This quality may have helped enslave them , but freedom will purify it of subserviency , and leave it a rich element of greatness . It ss what made Paul chief of Christians in his day ; it is what made the age of chivalry the heroic age of Europe . The Anglo-Saxon race is wanting in it , and *ever excelled in the knightly virtues . if the negroes bring back this lost force into civilization , they will contribute the full share of one people to forming the Golden Age . II . I do n't know how that may be , but I see no less right to life and its joys under one form of skull or heel than another ; and do not care to ask what a man is worth , nor give him the right to ask the same of me .

Such doctrine is killing humanitarianism very fast . If natural selection has made men out of beasts , then scientific selection , which is much more rapid in its effects , can surely make angels out of men . We have only to preserve the children of the wise and good , killing off all the rest , and Plato , Shakespeare , Washington , will be the average man after a few generations .

Think of civil order in France , the peace of all Europe , waiting on his lips ; and of the amazing mental vigor that defied imminent revolution , and gathered around him to prevent it all except the least sane of his enemies . Is it not the finest victory a single effort of statesmanship has won in our times ? F. The modern Tiberius has certainly shown a flickering in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it can not last long ; nod it is laughable to call his cunning mixture of threats and promises , statesmanship . A vastly more interesting event was the report of Dr. Livingstone 's discovery of the real source and length of the river Nile . Only thiuk that the great geographer , Ptolemy , who died seventeen centuries ago , told the world that the Nile was three thousand miles long ; thot his autleority was dis // credited for ages , because , in part , of this very assertion ; and that now , for the first time it is ascertained that he was right , and knew more of the most famous river in the world than all generations of explorers . B. If mere discoveries are what you want , you may look nearer home . To me , the wonderful excavations the French have just made in Rome , on Mount Palatine , where they have unearthed the Cesars ' palace , and , in it , a new cycle of Roman art , or the curious architectural paintings just discovered in Pompeii , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest than where a particular watershed happens to cross a desert which it is mere madness to visit . But if it is an event really suggestive of interest to us , men and women of America , to-day , that we seek , there was nothing in the month to rival the shooting of Mr. A. ID . Richardson by McFarland , and his subsequent death . This stirs up live questions ; what the laws ought to be , for the protection of families , for divorce and remarriage ; what circumstances , if any , justify private revenge ; and the capital punishment trouble , too . C. Yes , and more than all , whether Christian ministers have a right to disregard law and public opinion on the subject of the marriage-tie , in obedience to their own private notions of sentimental justice . But I believe that there is not a person in the world , who is prominently known as slighting and despising marriage , who is not also an earnest advocate of " woman 's rights . " The two go logically and practically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hear more talk of Father ilyacinthe , the pure and beautiful soul who is about to take home the impression that America is one infinite and Protean bore , than about the social questions you name , and however important they are , I think it easy to find more interesting topics of the month , such as Wendell Phillips 's new lecture , or the Cardiff stone forgery , or the Yanderbi4t brass one-two things which have sounded the depths of human impudence and measured the possibilities of imposture . W. But what was the event of greatest interest to you ? S. Oh , beyond doubt , one that neither of you has heard of at all . It is the trifling fact , just published , that some scientific plodders have at last devised a plan by which they can bring up the bottom of the sea from great depths ; that they have actually brought up large amounts of earth from a depth of nearly three miles in the Mediterranean ; and that they find such strange things in it . There , in absolute and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below the freezing-point , is the same abundance of life as near the surface of the water , and in a rich variety of forms . This explodes a dozen old notions about the effects of pressure , of darkness , and of cold , which had made us suppose those depths the most utter desolation . But stranger than all , they find that the deep sea is everywhere depositing chalk ; and that many creatures living in its bed are the almost unchanged descendants of those found in the chalk-rocks of millions of ages ago ; so that this dredging fairly takes us back into the geological age of the secondary rocks* when the whole earth was inhabited only by kinds of beings that have hitherto been supposed to have disappeared while yet the sky was young . Suppose half of this to be guess-work , and disproved on closer study ; yet who can tell what the discovery will lead to , or how much it may yet . help us , in tracing the past history and present state of our globe ? E. We must wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which of us has hit on the event of most lasting interest to the world . Is it not likely that all have missed it , and that something right before our eyes , but to which we are blind , will hereafter overshadow all these ? It is where a seed is sown to-day , and not where the lightning strikes , that the coming ages will find a tree .
