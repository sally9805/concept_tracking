txt By the fortunate interception of a letter from one convict to another in the State Prison at Concord to-day a plot for a wholesale release of the prisoners was discovered , which for daring has not been equaled , in this part of the country , at least . The plan was to seize , at a given signal , upon three officers who had charge of two workshops , where 150 convicts are em ployed , take possession of their revolvers , ant thus release the men in these shops . Then the men in the other shops were to be at once com municated with , and thus the entire prison was to be emptied . Once out of the shops , the next step was to seize the railroad train which back ( into the prison-yard every day for freight , and use it as a battering-ram for the gates , thus opening the way for all . The plot u-at arranged on the 4th inst. , when the 700 convicts were together for an hour or two in celebration of the day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Friday being visiting day , when the Warden and two or three other officers are generally employed in the octagon receiving callers . The non-appearance on duty to-day of the three officers singled out for attack , and marked watchfulness on the part of those who relieved them . warned the leaders that their plot had been discovered and that their plans had failed . This is the second failure of an attempt to effect a wholesale jail delivery since the removal from Charlestown to the new State Prison . The first was a few months ago , and was engineered , in part , by outside friends of the Northampton Bank robbers . This scheme was to bring on from New-York a large gang of roughs , who were to attack the prison at night . This was discovered by Warden Chamberlain . Other and repeated troubles have been had . Only a few days ago there was a serious revolt , which resulted in the solitary confinement of 20 prisoners . There is a feeling within and without that the prison is insecure , and the convicts know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the country around the prison is thickly wooded and sparsely settled . A strict watch is on to-night , and will be kept on regularly , and everything is in readiness to prevent a second attempt .
