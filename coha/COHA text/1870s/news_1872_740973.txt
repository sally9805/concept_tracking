txt Conductors are not always surly and disobliging . On the oontrarv , some distinguish themselves by civility and attention to the comfort of the public , thus forming a sort of high aristooracy in their business . To these we ' respectfully suggest a change in the etiquette of the street-railway car that will win them much favor with ladies . and - even with gentlemen . It is now regarded as the correct , if not the elegant , thing for a conductor who wishes to collect a fare from a passenger who does not happen to be looking at him , to poke that passenger with the forefinger in the ribs , or on the arm , or in the back ; and if by chancethe Passenger supposes that this delicate attention comes from the elbow or the umbrella of somelellow-suflerer , with whom he is wedged into those comfortless boxes on wheels wherewith the companies accommodate the public . the thrust is repeated until the delinquent tarns round to see what 's the matter . Now , strange as it may seem to conductors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be poked in the abdomen , the torso or the limbs by strangers ; nor is this manipulation made a whit more agreeable , or , in their eyes , more proper , because the poker wants the pokes to pay five cents . Among the many disqualifications for the conductor 's place which seem to be insisted on in appointees by the managers of the companies , we have not yet heard that drunkenness was enumerated , although deafness ( to reasonable complaints ) does seem , at least , to-be in high favor . Therefore , we venture to suggest , meekly , as becomes the mouth-piece of a humble and . long-suffering public , that conductors , on those rare occasions when it is necessary to attract a passenger 's attention , shall speak and ask for what they want . This is done by all other persons who wish payment to be made ; why should conductors make themselves an exception to what is both customary and reasonable ? It is not pleasant to be handled intentionally by another person , a stranger ; and . in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due allowance for the general inclination to make words which are frequently repeated as brief as possible ; and we remember the Jew 's answer to COLERIDGE who asked him : " Jew , why do n't you say old clothes instead of o ' 010 ' 1 " " Christian , if you had to say old clothes as often as I have , you would say o ' do ' too . " But the word " fare " is short and easy of utterance ; nor is " fare . if you please " a difficult or ungraceful form of demand . Even the single word , however , need be uttered so rarely that it would not be a severe tax upon the vocal organs of any conductor . And . if the people who do n't like to be handled , who are largely in the majority , would just grumble a little , and thus let it be known that a word is as good . as a poke to a blind passenger , there would soon be a change of fashion in this respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other respect . Conductors are very generally in the habit of taking passengers by the arm and " passing them in " Lwe believe that is the phrase ? no less in the case of women than of men . Now it very rarely is the case that any such assistance is needed , or is at all agreeable , particularly with ladies . This custom should be stopped absolutely and as soon as ' Possible . " Hands off " is a good rule .
