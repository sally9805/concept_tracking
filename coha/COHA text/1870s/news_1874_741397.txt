txt What are the Sanborn contracts 9 This is a question which every newspaper reader must have often asked himself within the past few months . We shall undertake to answer it as fully and clearly as is possible from the information now accessible . These contracts were made under a provision of the act of May 8 , 1872 , which was an appropriation bill . The provision is as follows , and we quote it because it is necessary that it should be carefully read in order that the case may be properly understood : " From and after the passage of this act the Secretary of the Treasury shall hare power to employ not more than three persons to assist the proper officers of the Government in discovering and collecting any money belonging to the - United States whenever the same shall he withheld by any person or corporation , upon such terms and conditions as he shall deem best for the interests of the United Stales ; tut no compensation shall be paid to such persons except out of the money and property so secured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provisions of this clause who shall not have fully set forth in a written statement , under oath , addressed to the Secretary of the Treasury , the character of the claim out of which he proposes to recover , or assist in recovering , moneys for the United States , the laws by violation of which the same InIvc been withheld , and the name of the person , firm , or corporation having thus withheld such moneys ; and if any person so employed shall receive or attempt to receive any money or other consideration from any person , firm , or corporation alleged thus to have withheld money from the United States , except in pursuance of the written contract made m relation thereto with the Secretary of the Treasury , such person shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor , and upon conviction thereof shall be fined not less than e1,000 , or imprisoned not less than two years , or both , in the discretion of any court of the United States having jurisdiction ; and the person so employed shall be required to make report of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do so by the Secretary of the Treasuru . " It will be seen that this simply authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to employ additional assistants in discovering and . collecting debts due to - the Government , the assistants to be paid out of the money received . It has since been explained that the law was intended to relate only to debts not discoverable and collectable by ordinary agencies . This explanation is at least plausible ; because it is not likely that Congress would have intentionally authorized the employment of extraordinary means where ordinary means were sufficient . But if this was the intention of Congress , it was implied , not expressed . As a matter of fact , the law authorized the Secretary to employ assistants in discovering and collecting any taxes he might turn over to them , at any rate of compensation he might designate , on such terms as he deemed best for the Treasury , with only certain unimportant limitations . The origin of this provision in the act of May 8 , 1872 , is obscure . Several members of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Senate , though strongly criticised by the House Committee , and was finally accepted as a part of a compromise arrived at by a Conference Committee . A number of contracts were made under it , but only those with one JOHN D. , SANBORN , of Massachusetts , amounted to anything . How SANBORN came to get his contracts does not appear . He is a sharp , adventurous man  --  according to Collector SIMMONS , of Boston , a " mysterious man , " who " sort of managed things , you know " for railroads , in the Massachusetts Legislature . And the evidence shows him to have been a friend of Gen. BurnEn . So much seems to be visible through ' the fog which surrounds the subject . The first of SANBORN 'S contracts is dated Ang . 13 , 1872 , and relates to taxes on spirituous and fermented liquors in the cases of certain specified persons and firms . SANBowl 's application is dated July 15 , but is sworn to on the date of the contract . The contract provides that SANBORN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; that he shall have the assistance of the United States . attorneys , if legal proceedings are necessary , but only on the written consent of the Secretary ; that he shall pay all costs ; that he shall reportall proceedings when required ; that he shall have fifty per . cent . of the gross sums collected , and that the contract may be revoked at any time at the pleasure of the Secretary . The contract is signed by Mr. RICHARDSON , Acting Secretary of the Treasury . On the 25th of October , SANBORN applied for an extension of his contract , to embrace certain cases of taxes upon legacies and successions and income , about 800 in number . The application contains the names of persons , but only in a portion of the cases the places of their residence . Ir.was sworn to Nov. 18 , in Washington , nineteen days after the contract was signed . It was referred . to the Solicitor of the Treasury Oct. 31 . A contract was signed on the 30th of October by Mr. RICHARDSON , Acting Secretary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the previous one . On the 19th of March , 1873 , a third contract , or a second extension of the original contract , was made with SANBORN , embracing about 3,000 names . On the 1st of July a third extension was granted , embracing the cases of between 500 and 600 railways . These two last were signed by Mr. RICHARDSON , Secretary . Under all these contracts there was collected between the 21st of March , 1872 , and the 9th of February , 1874 , $427,030 49 , of which SANBORN received $213 , ? 205 15 , and the United States Treasury received $213,225 34 . These contracts , their origin , nature , and operation , are now under investigation by the Ways and Means Committee of the House of Representatives . We hope the committee will make the investigation much more searching and complete than it has yet been . It has already gone far enough to show that the law under which the contracts were made is a loese , bad law . Ostensibly providing extraordinary means to collect Government debts not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the means authorized to this class of cases . Even if it did , the policy would be one that is condemned in every department of the Government . The law , therefore , ought to be repealed . But what of the administration of the law ? That is the field for tho committee to exhaust . It is , in fact , the only field ; for di ? - cretion under the law is given so entirely to the Treasury Department , that the character of the whole procedure is fixed by the use made of that discretion . The turning point of the inquiry is , were the taxes of which SANBORN received onehalf for collecting them , such as should and could have been collected by the . regular revenue officers ? What precautions were taken to discover whether the taxes embraced . in SANBORN 'S applications could have been obtained by the usual met hods , before aranting the contracts ? The law contains no limitation . The contracts contain none . Were the applications inspected to see that only stale claims , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them As to the actual profit from the contracts , there is much conflicting testimony . Experts like Mr. Simmoxs , of Boston , think that the contracts secured ib ? the Government a great deal of money that would not otherwise have been got . Mr. Dout-tLass , Commissioner of Internal Revenue , who ought to be a better judge , thinks that the taxes on legacies and successions and on railroad dividends muighI have been obtained by the regular agencies . On this point his evidence , as we receive it , is apparently unqualified . As for Mr. RICHARDSON , he condemns the contracts and the law , and recommends the repeal of the latter , upon which he says he will cancel the former . lie has but little personal knowledge of what has been done in the matter , which seems to have been  --  necessarily , as lie contends ? in the hands of subordinates . In this part of the ease Mr. RicnAnnsox does not seem to show with much effect . But we trust the committee will find out who the subordinates are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they did . The matter is at this moment in a position to be very fruitful of exaggerated . charges and injurious insinuations . These can only be met by a full investigation , and . that we hope the committee will find time to make .
