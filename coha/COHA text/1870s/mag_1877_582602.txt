BEDS AND TABLES , STOOLS AND CANDLESTICKS . IX . STILL HARPING ON THE nEDROOM . WHAT pleasant places our mothers ' bedrooms used to be ! In the old-time American formal and pretentious ways of living ,  - -  with the dining-room in the basement and on the principal floor the grave-yard parlor , in which none of the ornaments could be touched nor the chairs and sofas sat upon ,  - -  it was good that there was one room in the 1*ouse where domestic feeling was allowed a chance to root itself at ease ; where the sun had leave to enter and stretch himself upon the carpet ; where the seats were comfortable , and lolling with a book delightful-a room where the soft-blooming fragrant flowers of the homely motherwort took the place of the testy " touch-me-not " that grew so prim and profuse in the handsome room below . Up to this room that with its open fire and slipshod neatness seemed always sunny even on dull days , ran the children " home from school " and stormed the maternal citadel for luncheon . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dearer to the hungry children than any " safe " with its metaphorical tin , and whose crisp inscription , " CAKE , " had been improved by a youthful adept at acrostics , into " Can a kitten eat ? " and the mildly delicious seed-cake it contained having been dealt out in generous hunks ( oh , expressive vocabulary of childhood ! ) , the pleasant , do-nothing , noonday hour was slipped along the rosary of time . No parlor , however free to let its luxuries or simple elegances be enjoyed ; no nursery , even , made to play in and sensibly kept rid of things that might be hurt ; no living-roo*n , with its furniture and fittings meant to be used ,  --  can take the place , J think , of the " mother 's bedroom , " which still exists , I hope , as of old , in many and many a home . It would be a pity such an " old shoe " of a room should ever be given up , for , in our undomestic American life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of herself and have , for a few hours of the day at least , " all things in common , " she will find herself knowing as little of her children as their father does ; and in America , it is a common experience that it is a very wise child indeed who has more than a speaking acquaintance with his own father . To be a really tempting place , however , the " mother 's room " should have an open VOL . XIIJ. - 42. fire in it and look toward the sun . Its freeand-easiness , moreover , should keep within the bounds of elegance , which need never be divorced from fitness and comfortableness . For the children 's eye is forever being educated , and ugly things ought not to be brought superfluously before them . I do not believe in surrounding children with luxuries ; on the contrary , their lives ought to be made as simple as possible , and the fortunate ones are they whose youth makes them acquainted with some hardship ; but , what they do see ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eye to harmonies of color and form , and insensibly help it to form standards of judgment . Nowadays , there is positively no excuse for having ugly things about . A few years ago , the carpets were almost all highly reprehensible . To say that they were barbarous would be to pay them a compliment , for no barbarous people ever made such crudities of line and color as the old " Brussels " and " ingrain " carpets showed us ; though the " ingrain designs were often better than those of the more expensive kinds . This was because fewer tricks were played with warp and woof in the cheap carpet , and the designs were more evidently structural . The objection to all the carpets of the former time , cheap and dear alike , was , that the patterns were too defined ; whether " set " or " flowing , " they could not be made to blend with what was placed upon them , but pushed themselves so impertinently to the fore , that the carpet became the chief thing in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , only a background for the rest . Of late years , there has been a great improvement in the designs of all carpets , from the most expensive Wilton to the cheapest ingrain . In the richer sorts , dark , soft tones with patterns-if patterns they can be called-of spots and stains , that now appear , now hide , but are never in the way , are to be bought in many of the shops . Some of the best English carpets are as thick and soft as the best of Persian make , and the designs , when they are not too daring , or when the makers are content with copying the quieter Eastern patterns , are a great improvement on the older manufactures . But one may as well spend his money for an // Eastern carpet outright , as buy one of these English carpets . There would be the certainty of getting a design that had no taint of South Kensington in it , and that would be sure not to be the same through any square foot of its space . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it rebukes at every turn our scientific love of precision and symmetry , shows us the charm of irregularity , and teaches us how to make two sides of a thing alike , while keeping them quite different . Whether we shall ever get this into our blood , I do n't know . It is an essential principle of all the best decorative art ; and necessarily so , because all such design is as far removed as possible from mechanical assistance , and has no other rule or measure than the eye acting through the hand . No two Ionic capitals of Greek workmanship even in the same temple are alike in anything , except general size and character . No more are any two Doric caps alike , nor any two moldings of any style , nor any two successive feet of any Greek ornament . The notion instilled into our minds that the Greek architecture is all monotony and repetition is of English or German origin . There needs to-day to be a protest made by some one against the mechanical character of our decoration , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , our furnishing , our jewelry , our porcelain , there has come an unexampled supply , and the manufacturers , of course , bring all the labor-saving appliances they can contrive to supply this demand . Immense furniture-mills are set up , and to such perfection has machinery attained , that the logs go in at one door , and come out at another fashioned in that remarkable style known here as " Eastlake , " and which has become so much the fashion that grace and elegance are in danger of being taboo before long . Then " rugs " being all the rage , and the beautiful ones being , as they always must be , expensive , the manufacturers are turning out cheap rugs by the acre , which are no whit better-nay , are much worsethan the carpets of thirty or forty years ago . So with pottery and porcelain ,  --  our china-shops are filled with things whose only recommendation to our novelty-loving people is their novelty and their loudness . And , all these things  --  the furniture , the rugs , the pottery-are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the smaller , decorafive things gets so many that our homes are overrun with things , encumbered with useless ugliness , and made to look more like museums or warerooms than like homes of thinking people and people of taste . I dare say , however , that all this **29;27;TOOLONG in the supply and superabundance in the buying-is necessary , and that not only good to trade and to manufacture , but good to art and taste , will come out of it . *Ihe way of it will be something like this : Exclusiveness being natural to human beings ( it comes simply and excusably enough from our dislike of monotony and of repetition ) , people will demand more than they do now things that show some individuality in design , that are not made " in quantities to suit purchasers , " - that are not even to be had in pairs . Then we shall find the makers of furniture producing single pieces or single sets , into which the workman has put some special design which he does not copy in the next piece , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finish , and serviceableness , will be most considered , and cheap display-the bane of almost all our fashionable furniture nowadays-will be avoided . When a few rich people , who have an educated taste besides , will *ncourage the production of furniture that is worth admiring and keeping for its own sake , not merely because it is in the fashion , we shall see the turn of the tide . At present , there is hardly anything at all of this done even by the richest people ( I mean , little that I hear of ) ; and as for the general run of us , we do n't so much as think of doing it . People naturally and reasonably count the cost , and when they find that it not only costs a good deal of money but a good deal of time and study to get a piece of furniture well designed , they just wont try to do it , and fare as well as they can without . At present , then , we are in this strait . The things we see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad or indifferent copies of old-fashioned things , or of Oriental things of to-day . Hardly anything with the stamp of our own time and country is to be had . What , then , are the young people to do who want to furnish their houses , and have comparatively little , or really little , money to do it with ? I say in the first place that there is no excuse nowadays for anybody having ugly things . If they have them , they are themselves to blame , for they must have chosen ugliness and rejected , if not beauty and elegance . then simplicity . " Wedding presents , " I hear some reader whisper . Yes , I know . But wedding presents are almost always of silver , or ornaments , or // small things that after a year 's display where they can catch the giver 's eye on reception days and " calls , " can be stowed away . Few people are cruel enough to send in furniture ; for that the young housekeepers are responsible , and if they will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mill , they would begin with only what is absolutely necessary , and make up their minds that , though they want but little here below , yet they want that little long ; they want to grow up with it , to use it , enjoy it , and make it a part of their domestic history . The main reason why people can not go to an architect or a designer and get their furniture made for them in special , is that they think they want much more furniture than they do , and there is not money enough to supply all their needs . At least , one or two things might be so procured , and , for the rest , a steady search kept up , until the needful pieces are found , at once useful and handsome . Here in New York , people go to the houses which supply the needs and cater to the whims of the rich-houses where you are told plainly that they can not afford , and do not propose , to sell cheap things . Then there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advice on the subject of furnishing are taxed with ministering to luxury and expense . But it may safely be said that many more people might become the owners of the things they admire , and justly too , at Herter 's or Cottier 's , if they would be content with one thing or two ; but they want all , or want everything " in keeping , " as the phrase is ,  --  a thing not necessary at all . If people will have anything , let them be content to earn it . I am not writing , nor ever have been , for people who can go to Cottier 's , Marcotte 's , or Herter 's , and buy what they want . Nor , do I see why anybody should think it necessary to spend a cent of money or a minute of time on furnishing his house with chairs and tables if he does n't wish to . Here 's an angry gentleman writes from Texas to complain that the prettily designed , delicately made sofa , of which a cut was given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not suited to his needs . " Where would such a sofa be , " he cries , " after four or five romping boys had played circus on it some rainy day ? " Where , to be sure ? But my Texan critic must reflect that he can not have his cake and eat it , too . If he has four or five romping boys who have no barn or nursery or shed to play circus in on rainy days , he must be content with furniture that will stand being run over rough-shod . And 1 , for one , should never think of insisting that , such being his plight , he should make misery for himself by having everything handsome about him. * It is not for such as this gentleman I am writing , nor for the rich who can do as they will ; but for those who have a desire to make their homes agreeable to the eye as well as comfortable , and yet who have to consider the cost at every step . * As this gentleman 's note was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sentence of it . " The furniture of 5776 is nice for those who like odd things , and have a mania for such collections ; hut , for actual use , I do n't like them . Most of them are square , angular , and spindling , ' looking as if they would not last-not solid enough . ' Now , considering that this furniture of 1776 has been in constant use since it was made , and is in these times of revival of old fashions starting on a new lease of life ,  --  what becomes of the doubts as to its solidity ? The truth is , it is almost all of it firstrate furniture ; well designed for use and good looks , and it is no mania for collecting that makes people snap it up wherever they see it for sale , but good sense and good taste . 150. 2 . FRENCH BUREAU , WITH FINE BEARS MOUNTS . // If carpets are not desirable in the living rooms of the house , much less are they desirable in the bedrooms . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bedside , which they call a " desce ; , t dii lit , " and in many houses this is all the concession made to comfort , but in our climate this is insufficient ; we must have more than this for No 3 A LOVE OF A BOoo**T-BOX. " looks , " even if we do not need it for " comfort . " A good rug at either side the bed , and one of the long narrow rugs stretched at the foot of the bed between it and the fire-place , and reaching from one side of the room to the other , will cover the floor generously , and will not hinder the thorough sweeping and cleaning of the room . The dearness and scarcity of handsome rugs have set our American wits to work to provide a substitute for them , and of course we have succeeded . In Boston , Philadelphia , and , I believe , in Providence , rugs are made of the ravelings of shawls and tapestry carpets , and they no pattern , of course , but they generally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no-color , but has a good deal of life and freshness in it . A prime merit these rugs have in being of pure wool ; they come in breadths like common carpeting and can be made into rugs of any size . They have no " right " side , but can be turned at pleasure , and the edges do not curl up , as rugs made of carpet are too apt to do. * If we like , we can lay a large square of this material down over nearly the whole floor and over it put our Eastern rugs , if we have them ; but , though I have seen this done , it seems to me superfluous , and for a bedroom the raveling-rugs alone are far more manageable than the thicker and heavier sort . I give this month two more drawings of " bureaus " or " chests of drawers , " as our ancestors used to call them . Cut No. i is a . lapanese affair , and in ten years ' use has proved itself a good friend . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough thing ; but that has nothing to do with its substantial merits . In its own land it was at once traveling-trunk and bureau ; and it is a good type of the article which in Japan serves both these needs , and which is , I believe , in effect , the only piece of furniture they can be said to have . Sometimes the affair is modified , and enriched with lacquer inlays and enamels until it becomes a splendid cabinet ; but it almost always retains , " In all its weal and in its moste pride , " the symbols of its vagabond nature in the poles by which , when need is , it is borne from place to place on the shoulders of coolies . In the richer cabinets , these poles are elegantly made and richly ornamented , to sort with the rest of the piece ; but I suppose that when these humbler bureautrunks are to be carried about , the coolies use poles of their own for the purpose . The present example is in two parts , one of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their being placed so , except the convenience of the owner . The arrangement of the irons at the ends indicates that the lower one rightly belongs above . For while either can be lifted and carried off separately , yet it may sometimes be desirable to carry both off together . In this case , put the upper of the two boxes below the lower , and turning up the end handle , suspend it from the two projecting knobs ; then pull up the other handles , * William Pollock , carpet manufacturer , 937 Market street , Philadelphia , second door below Tenth street , makes good rngs out of ravelings , either of carpet or of shawl . One of his make was the first of these rugs I saw . T was in the pretty house of a new-fledged pair of lovers who were sending admiring thrills through their staid society by not asking their neighbors how they should furnish their house . // one at each end , and slip the pole through , hoist to shoulder , and away ! The adjustment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The handle of the box that is to go on top , when the two are to be carried off together , is pulled up vertically , slipping up and down in its iron staples . But the handle of the lower one turns out , and then up , because only so can it be passed over the two iron knobs . When its American owner has occasion to move , each part is easily lifted by its handles like a trunk . Everybody knows how unmanageable a monster a well-filled four-story bureau is . My friend 's reason for putting the lower part of his bureau above , was to get the shallow drawer , where handkerchiefs and collars , gloves , etc. , are most easily kept , nearest the hand , and also to have the closet and the deep drawer for shirts , where they can be most easily reached . No one but a man knows what a blessing this shirtdrawer is . It will hold the week 's wash of shirts without tumbling or crowding , and nothing else need be allowed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is room for all one man 's linen ; and in the little closet , which contains three drawers and a hiding-place for money besides ( which the owner did not discover until after a year 's possession ) , there is room for all his trinkets and valuables . When the two boxes are placed together , the whole measures three feet one inch in length by three feet four high , and one foot five deep . This chest of drawers is made of a very soft and light wood , and it is , I think , only for protection against rough usage that it is so bound about with iron . This iron , however , is thin , and adds but little to the weight of the boxes . The handles are much heavier than they need be , but they are well shaped for the hand . Each drawer is provided with a lock , and one key opens all but the closet , which has its own . Taking only the body of this Japanese contrivance , and rejecting all the iron-work , why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good bureau have one made on this model , either of walnut , mahogany , or oak , and furnished with brass handles and key-plates , the door hung by brass strap hinges ? These brass handles and keyplates are made now in England very commonly , and the Household Art Company of Boston used to keep them on sale ; but there are plenty of ways of getting them . It is to be noticed that the boxes are made with absolute plainness ; there is not a molding nor a chamfer to be seen , much less any tiles let in , or any rosettes stuck on . When it is done , and set up in its polished plainness ( oiled and rubbed , not varnished ) , with its mild-shining brasses , my lady shall devise for the top a covering of plush or velvet hanging over a little at each end , and over this a strip of linen with fringed or embroidered ends ; and then , with the swing-glass in its place and the needful nothings of the toilet in theirs ,  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eye . The French piece ( Cut No. 2 ) is redeemed from commonplace by the fine brasses with which it is ornamented ; the general form is good , and many years ' use has proved the bureau a comfortable one ; not too high nor taking up too much room on the floor . The ornaments are of that fine brass in which the French of the early part of this century worked with so much elegance of taste and fineness of finish , and which we see very coarsely imitated in our own time . The handles of the drawers of this bureau are designed as the necks and heads of swans issuing from a wreath of leaves . They are good , serviceable handles that can not break nor come off , and they are besides elegant in form . No. 4 . SOUTH AMERICAN WATER-PITCHER . Very little of this early nineteenth century French furniture is met with in this country , nor is it often offered for sale even in Paris . But it is occasionally seen , and as it only gets to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruin and decay of families , // or a forty years ' wandering in the boardinghouse desert , in places where neither quails nor manners are to be had ,  --  it often presents a doubtful appearance to the rummaging eye . But if it prove to be a genuine piece , and if on close inspection the brass is seen to be as purely chased and sculptured as if it were gold or silver-buy it , by all means ( t is sure to cost but little ) , and when it has been polished up and set in its place , " I will warrant it to give satisfaction . " For , all the French furniture of the old time was well made , and their cheap furniture of to-day is much better made than ours , so long as it is kept at home . When it is brought to this country , however , it does not stand fire at all . Nor , for that matter , does even the foreign furniture that has been made a hundred years resist the furnace heat of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furniture-and the English too-begins to gape and yawn and stretch out its arms for home . Cut No. 3 is another combination lockup ; an antique this time , but with some serviceable modern points about it . It has three drawers on the lower half , which is furnished , as every such piece of furniture ought to be , with strong handles by which it can be drawn out from the wall on sweeping-days ; and the upper half has a flap which closes its whole front , and which opens down , stopped at the right angle by a horse-binge , or some one of the common contrivances for that purpose . A lady would find this a good place for her hats and furs ( if there were not too many of them ) ; or , if she were of a literary or financial turn of mind , here is the place for her account-books and her paper . Our people do not generally believe in pine , but I think that either of these chests ( Nos. 2 and 3 ) would look very pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good black , or simply left the self-color of the pine , and shellacked . I was , the other day , in one of Mr. McKim 's houses in which all the interior fittings were designed by him to be executed in common pine , and it is long since I have been in so cheerful and comfortable looking a house . The wood*O 5 . A HALF-WAY HOUSE . // work was not skimped , there was enough of it to make you aware of its presence , and to aid the liberally welcomed sunshine in giving a warm and hospitable look to the rooms . I think of this house just now because the owner had employed the village carpenter to make some pieces of furniture of pine-wood , and they had proved more fortunate than such ventures often do . But it is greatly to be wished that more people would risk the experiment . It is the only way I see to get cheap furniture that shall be well made . In this case some picture in a book or journa*l was shown to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it as he could , and , being a workman with some taste and sense of proportion , he managed to solve his problem with considerable success . The work is often in these cases done with thoroughness : the trouble begins when the thing is to be ornamented . Then the fatal facility of machine work , scroll sawing , knobs and rosettes stuck on , comes in to spoil what might otherwise have proved a sensible piece . Why would it not be a good plan for three or four or half a dozen people living in a country place , to club together , and , taking some one of the pictures in these SCRIBNER articles which they all agree to think well of , to ask some architect ,  --  Mr. McKim , Mr. Babb , or any other man of taste and sense ,  --  to make the necessary workingdrawings for the village carpenter ? Each contributor could then order his piece made of the wood he might prefer , and no two of the pieces need be exactly alike . This plan , I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to any carpenter , however clever , to translate one of these drawings into his vernacular . Cut No. 4 is a South American pitcher , members of whose family may be seen at china shops in this city , and which ought to find a readier sale than they do . They are made of red clay like that used for flower-pots ; the cover is removable and can be used or not , and for once I am able to say with a cheerful heart and a clear conscience , that here is something that may fairly be called cheap . " Cheap , call I it , for to define true cheapness , what is it but to be nothing else but your money 's worth ? " This pitcher cost a dollar and a half , there or there-about , " a little more than one , and less than two , " but it may be that no one *f my readers who shall go to look for one will like it when he finds it . The ware is too coarse to suit many ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to handle as the smooth French porcelain . I recommended this particular pitcher the other day to a lady who wanted a waterholder to go with one of the painted and lacquered wooden bowls of which there was mention and a picture in the January ScRIBNER . There is a good deal of South American and Spanish , Italian and Portuguese peasant-pottery , that would be very useful to us in this country where nothing but French and English wares are to be had . I wonder some traveler with time and money ( not much of the latter is needed ) , and wanting employment , does not go about Europe and collect a ship-load of the jolly water-vessels that are made by the hundred thousand in all the Mediterranean lands , and which we know would have a great popularity here , because every scrap that was sent to Philadelphia was caught up before the distracted owners had learned to translate maravedis into dollars . The wooden bowls just spoken of were mistakenly called by me Siamese , whereas I am assured that they are Russian . I find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncommon as I fancied them , and I am glad to be able to add them , too , to my small but hopeful list of cheap utilities and prettinesses . They are so handsome and so useful that I think many of my readers will thank me for letting them know about them . They come in sets of four , and sometimes more . The sets of four cost two dollars and a half ; or if the most ornamented ones are chosen , three dollars . They are to be had in New York and Boston. * As for the rest of the toilet furniture , there need be no difficulty , surely , in supplying one 's needs nowadays , for pretty and useful trays and small dishes may be found anywhere ,  --  at Collamore 's , at Vantine 's , at Drake 's , at Hawkins 's , at Cook 's ,  --  that is , provided the searcher does not insist upon The address of the Boston dealer who has the Russian bowls for sale is Frank B. Norris , successor to E. C. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Room No. 8 . The bowls I have lately seen were purchased of a New York dealer , and ranged smaller and larger than those bought in Boston . The smallest of the Boston bowls is six inches in diameter ; the largest is about a foot in diameter . The largest of the New York bowls , I should think , must be thirteen or fourteen inches across , and this makes a comfortable bowl for washing . Their decoration is in red and black on a dull gold ground . No two are alike in design ; the work is coarse but effective . These bowls will stand boiling water , and they are very light to handle . // having his soap-dish , his brush-tray , his bowl and pitcher all blood relations . Cut No. 5 will be recognized by many of the readers of this article as an indispensable part of the furniture of the bedroom in old-time days . These bedside chairs , with their great ears , and their ample breadth , and depth , and height , were a sort of half-way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be entered , and the world of active work . You slid out of bed into this hospitable lap , and having just put Satan behind you , with his multiform and multitudinous arguments against getting up in general , you now proceeded to meet a second series of objections to putting on your stockings . If my readers shall object to this chair as an encourager of laziness , I will change my commendation and speak of it as an excellent resting-place when one is tired , or convalescent . Having persuaded them to let me smuggle it into their rooms on this plea , I am sure they will end by agreeing with me as to the desirableness of having such a chair in the house . As for the making of it ,  --  I doubt if one could get such a thing made nowadays . It is not elegant enough . But there are plenty of them to be bought out of old houses in New England ; and once restuffed and covered with a flowered chintz , they are ready to serve a new generation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having a slight attack of the measles just for the pleasure of getting well and eating a baked apple out of an " old blue " saucer in front of a sea-coal fire , sitting in this chair . " For wash-stands , " as Lord Bacon would say , " they are better open than closed . " I think cupboards and shut-up places are to be avoided . The best for a wash-stand is a table , of a size appropriate to your room , with a drawer and a shelf below . Cut No. 6 is a good type of wash-stand ,  --  a French example ,  --  with perhaps more of a look of English comfortableness and enjoyment of the water-privilege than one associates with the French . In Paris , a large wash-basin is called an English basin , and certainly the basins provided for the French market by the manufacturers are of singular . smallness . But I am not intending to join No 6 . FRENCH WASH-STAND-JAPANESE TOWEL-RACK. // the sniffers at French cleanliness . I found them every whit as neat as ourselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their enormous appliances for " cleaning themselves , " and " tubbing , " - two odious phrases which they are fond of , and with which they make washing and bathing seem very vulgar employment . Paris is abundantly provided with baths , none of them free , I believe , but all very cheap , and they are much frequented . A French lady was once asked why the wash-basins in general use in Paris are so small . Her explanation was , that French ladies are always washed before they get up by their maids , and that little bowls are more handy than big ones , and can be often emptied and filled . At the time when this French wash-stand was made , English fashions were the fashion in Paris , and ever since they have rather gained than lost in favor . This wash-stand is an example more elegant than is commonly met with , of a style much used in Paris , and very little known here . In Paris they have great furniture establishments , on the same principle as our " Stewart 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find what he needs . Here are the most modest outfits , and , in the fashion of the day , the most expensive ; and here one can order made what he fancies . We have one vast establishment for the manufacture of furniture in this city , but it is only for the making of costly ( or seeming costly ) articles . No poor student , no young couple starting off in life with a purse that has a bottom , no people settling in the great city for a winter 's social enjoyment , need go to this place to get their wants supplied . It is a pity there were not such a place ; but in New York at least , if not in America , you are well enough off if you are miserably poor , and well enough off if you are comfortably rich ; but if you are neither one nor the other , Heaven help you ! Agar was not a New-Yorker ; had he been , he never would have prayed as he did . He would have said : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pert Nerissa , had she been born in Gotham instead of in Yenice , would never have uttered her lady-in-waiting wisdom : " It is no mean happiness , therefore , to be seated in the mean . " In New York , alas , it is very mean happiness indeed . In these great warehouses of the Faubourg St. Antoine , then , you find the jolliest little wash-stands , - the lower half a chest of drawers , and on top , a marble slab with holes cut in it for the different vessels : the basin , the water carafe , the tumblers , the soap-cup , and brush-tray , over No. 8 . A PLACE FOR EVERYTHING . all which apparatus shuts down a cover , that when opened and standing upright , bears a mirror , of no particular use that I could ever see , since it is not , of course , high enough to reflect one 's face ; but the French are plainly of the mind that a mirror can never come amiss . In order to allow of this cover shutting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pitcher is made of the most amusing fatness . It often looks as if it had been sat upon before it was baked ! But it does its duty like a man for all that ! Another Yankee contrivance in these washstands is to have the top slide out bodily , // so that it will project two or three inches from the face of the drawers below . This is in order to prevent the front of the piece from he in g spattered when we are washing our face o mornings . The towel-rack at the side of this stand is a Japanese affair made of wood stained black and lacquered , and mounted with No. 9. hrass . Such a wash-stand as this was once brought home to America and had its marble slab broken ( of course ) in being carried a short distance from New York on the railroad . To do the company justice , they paid damages ; but instead of attempting to replace the pretty French marble , its owner made a slab of tiles take its place . The tiles were small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laid in putty . The slab , when finished , was thicker than the marble one had been , for the French can cut their marble very thin , and I think the tiles alone were thicker than the original top . The wooden flooring on which from necessity they were placed , and the putty on which they were laid , made the whole thicker and heavier . But it cost a little less than to have replaced the marble , and the look of it when done was more attractive ; and then , the tiles will not stain with water , and are far less liable than marble to resent the bangs that patient furniture of the unwary servant takes . I have encouraged my little bamboo sofa , Cut No.7 , to believe that she will make many friends in society , and that all those who know how to value modest merit will invite her to visit them . She does not make the least pretense in the world ,  --  her only claim upon our hearts is , that she will do her best to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her by birth-right ; and in order to show that the seat is of bamboo also , Mr. Lathrop has taken off the cushion that covers the seat from end to end . There are three cushions that rest against the back , to which they are further tied by pieces of the stuff with which they are bound . This sofa came from Mr. Vantine 's . Cuts 8 and 9 are only hints of simple picturesqueness . The three corner shelves ,  --  the longest at the top instead of at the bottom ,  --  and the corner stand , with its rounded top shelf supporting a water-cistern and its rectangular lower stories , may please some people by their unexpectedness as well as by their usefulness . Mr. Lathrop devised as well as drew them .
