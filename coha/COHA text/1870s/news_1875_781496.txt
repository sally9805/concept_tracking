txt The question as to the effect of marriage upon the duration of life , and also upon . mental health , has been carefully eonsidiw ered by many scientific men , and according ) to the statistical tables the decision has been decidedly in favor of marriage . Thal is , it appears that a much larger proper . tion of married men and women than a bachelors and spinsters attain old age , and that a smaller proportion of the former thani of the latter become afflicted with the various kinds of insanity . The question was thus regarded as scientifically settled in favor of marriage . Mr. HERBERT SPENCER undertakes to reverse this decision . He says that greater longevity is not the consequence of marriage , but that a tendency to longevity leads to marriage . His law isthat of natural selection and survival or the fittest , by which we are now taught to account for the difference between a. whale and . a mosquito , or , indeed , between a man and an oyster . The rate of marriage , ho @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet its responsibilities ; and as that abil-1 ity depends upon intellectual and bodilr vigor , prudence and self-control , which are the qualities that favor long life , he . reaches the conclusion that the men and women , who marry are they who , married or unmarried , would , by reason of their bodily " and mental constitution , live the longest.i Besides , he says , men generally desire women , and . women generally prefer men , ? who are perfect and vigorous , refusing the . malformed , the diseased , and . the ill-developed types . This , like - most of what Mr. HERBERT ! SPENCER writes , is ingenious , and it has am element of truth . Men and women do . generally prefer the healthier and . higher types of either sex , but they very frequently do not get what they desire , and it is not yet established that among the men and women , and particularly the former , who go through life unmated there is a larger proportion of the malformed , the diseased , and . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men who marry may possibly carry off the finest women ; and moreover marriage seems more necessary to woman 's happiness than it is to man 's . But ' the chief defect in Mr. SPENCER 'S argument seems to be in its most important premise ? . that marriage is regulated by ability to meet its responsibilities . This has the air of an assumption or of an inference a priori , of the most unmistakable character . Doubtless marriage , regarded from the politico. economical point of view , should be reg-a ? lated by the ability to meet its responsi. bilities . But who that has observed life carefully will venture to say that it is so I It may be true among people who feel that they have a certain social position to maintain , and . who , in regard to all social matters , have been bred in habits of thought and feeling which lead them to set aside impulse and natural desire at the bidding of prudence . But , outside of that class , among men and women gen . Equity , prudence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great restraining influence . They marry , full of faith and hope , as well as of love , or mayhap without love they marry , they can hardly say why , thinking that- all will be well , and that they will get on somehow . And they do get on , most of them , somehow , and worry through life , taking their share of the joys and sorrows of marriage ; often sorely tried , sometimes almost despairing , but on tho whole and in the endbetter for it , with a part of their moral : nature developed of which before their marriage they had no consciousness , and which would surely have remained in a torpid and rudimentary state . Exceptions apart , there are very few married men and women who will not confess that marriage has made them better as well as happier , notwithstanding all their trials . This is one reason why the proportion of the married among the insane is smaller than that of the unmarried . And so also physicians know that , with all its physical trials , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is something in the fitness of things to the end for which they were created . What science seems to establish in one decade may be set aside by science in another , hub a greater man than HERBERT SPENCER must arise to convince the world that marriage is ziot iu all respects the best state for bothman and woman .
