txt That which would now be in order is a candid expression of the Democratic Party as to the effect of the extra session on its purposes , plans , and interests . Is the party , as such , satisfied with the record made by its Congressional majority Has the extra session fulfilled its expectations 7 Does it conclude that it has gained or lost by the events of the last three months and a half ? Frank answers to these inquiries are not probable . No party likes to confess that it has obstinately , blundered , and that its defeats are consequences of its folly ; and Democratic discipline suppresses unpalatable truth . There are indeed signs of a disposition to break the force of disaster by boasting , and to affect a satisfaction which can not possibly be felt . Mr. THURMAN , for instance , is credited with the saying " that one of the pleasantest things that I shall recollect in after-life , as occurring in my public service , will be the fact of this extra session . I think this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no small service for American liberty . " So sensible a journal as the New-Orleans Picayune talks of the " achievements " of the . extra session as " enough to justify the course of the majority in forcing the call . " And , doubtless , we shall hear much of this sort of talk from Congressmen who helped their party into its serape , and from newspapers whose idea of partisan fidelity forbids the expression of an unfavorable judgment . But all Democrats ' are not of this type . Mr. WATTERSON , for example , . is positive in his declaration of an adverse opinion . " There are not two opinions anywhere as to the situation , " he asserts . " In Kentucky , as elsewhere in the South , " he proceeds to say , " the people feel that the extra session was a mistake , and that we have lost with each day of it . " Other Democratic journals , not less influential than the Courier-Journal , use similar terms . They do not dissent from the purposes of their party , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its management as sure to injure Democratic interests . Mistakes in management might have been forgotten if the results aimed at had been , in the main , realized . The Democratic Party , however , can not conceal from itself that it has accomplished . none of the purposes with which it set out , that it has yielded all but one of the positions it assumed at various stages of the controversy , and that it has been driven by the exigencies of debate to the avowal of principles , and the advocacy of measures , which identify it with Southern extremists of the antewar period . Queer as are some of the features of Mr. a , HIIRMAN 'S political life , we can hardly believe that " one of the pleasantest things " in it will be a remembrance of the collapse of a policy with which he was prominently identified . It was a coercive policy , and it broke down as often as it was tried . The law-making power was compelled to abandon its attempt to coerce the Executive ; it was compelled to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the only way in which it can overcome resistance offered by the President in the line of his duty is the way prescribed in the Constitution , The failure of the policy involved another discovery , equally unwelcome . When coercion was adopted as a Democratic weapon , to be employed against a Republican Administration , the supposition was that the action of the party would be sustained by its adherents throughout the country . Had this supposition proved correct , the probability is that the collapse would have been less sudden , perhaps less complete . But the majority in Congress soon found that their threat to stop the supplies unless their demands were complied with did not receive the approval of their friends oat-of-doors . Instead of being urged on , they were told that they must stop . Instead of being encouraged in their plan for making the supplies conditional upon certain partisan advantages , they were informed that persistence would be ruin to the ' party . The Democratic Party in Congress , therefore , was not only unable to coerce the Executive , but was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it confidently relied for support . If the knowledge of this double humiliation be ' " one of the pleasantest things " in the life of a veteran Demo crat , we should like to hear his conception of unpleasantness . We would not have it understood that the session has been destitute of what the NewOrleans editor calls " achievements . " The things accomplished , however , were not the things promised ; and the things conceded were the things which the party pledged itself not to yield . Thus , two of the principal supply bills were to be withheld unless the FederalElection laws were virtually repealed , and the power of the Executive over the Army materially curtailed . The Election laws are not repealed . The power of the Executive over the Army remains in effect unchanged . In these particulars r the Democrats have not accomplished . anything . As to the appropriationson spite of the ? rejection of the Democratic demands , . the Government ? has got all the t money ? it wanted with . the exception of an insignificant amount required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , the solitary " achievement " of which Democrats can boast is the obstruction offered to the discharge of the Marshals ' duties in the civil and . criminal service of the Government . All the threatening and boasting with which the session began , and all the coercion exercised in its progress , resolved themselves into the withholding of $600,000 needed for the execution of the laws . If the Democratic Party is relleed so low that it parades as an achievement what rational men will consider a paltry abuse of power by way of avenging defeat , the - days . of its glory are gone . Whether= the record made , by the party during the session is to be deemed an achievement , Democrats must decide for themselves . To Republicans it looks like a case of self-destruction . For the Democratic Party , judged by its representation in Congress , is fully committed to that version of State rights which led to secession , and to that policy of restraining the Federal authority which implies that the Union is powerless as against individual States . , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conduct of the Democratic plans . The weakness . of the party management , ; has sometimes bordered on , imbecility . But the absence of skill has been in nothing more apparent than in the inability to curb the extremists in debate , and to keep the exposition of the party 's purposes free from the damaging theories of the old Southern school . It is impossible now to conceal from the country the drift of Democratic sentiment , as embodied in . Congressional action , or the tendency of the legislation which the firmness of the President has averted . When Democrats talk of the Election laws as an outrage , and of troops at the polls as . a usurpation , loyal men will understand that the party , having once more passed ' under Southern leader-1 ship , is in reality assailing the authority of the Union as vindicated by the war . Beyond the great achievement of keeping back the ' pay of the Marshals and their Deputies , employed in the execution of the laws , the chief result of the extra session is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Democratic Party , now that Southern politicians control its councils and Southern heresies give life to its policy .
