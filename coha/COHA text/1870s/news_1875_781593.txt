txt There was one element iu our recent political contest which has not been much commented upon , but which influenced , in a silent way , great numbers of voters . The Democratic Convention said nothing of sectarian schools , " while the Republicans had spoken out boldly against any injury to be dune to the public schools by admitting Church schools among their number , or giving them a share in the commonschool fund . Though the subject was very little discussed in tile public canvass , . the average voter throughout the State felt that one party was strongly pledged against any interference With the eounnon-school system , while the other was trilling with the question , if nothing worse . It was remembered at the polls that it was a Democratic Douse which had nearly placed the Church schools or St. Vincent do Paul among the " common schools , " 811 ( 1 passed the act , authorizing the " ( tray Nuns " to lie public  --  school teachers . It is true flint his party found it necessary to /lime Senator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brooklyn speech , by denying . any purpose amoitg . Denmerats to interfere the common schools . It is quite possible that these are the honest views of the Senator , who is reported to be of that class . so strongly rebuked by the Holy Father  --  a " I a here ' Catholic . " His views , however , have been anything but acceptable to the Catholic organs , who have abused him roundly fin. them ; anti we doubt , if ills Hanle were up for any office among the Roman Catholic voters of the State , whether he would poll a strong vote now . Nor did his disclaimers much influence the thousands of " independent " voters who transferred their ballots this year from the Democratic to the Republican ticket . The truth is , the majority of the Democratic Party of this State is largely made up of Roman Catholic voters . The ignorant among these are under the exclusive control of their priests . These as a class can not endure " Liberal Catholics , " and they hold a logical position on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They claim that the salvation of man 's soul is the first interest of all ; that there is no salvation extra ecclesiam ; that a school without the . Catholic religion is " godless " and therefore danirerous to the soul , and that consequently the first duty of the Catholic is to oppose all education in common schools where uo religion is taught . It is not because the Bible is read in our public schools , or the Lord 's Prayer said by a layman , that they object , but because the schools are " godless , " being destitute of the Catholic religion . With this view there is manifestly no truce or compromise possible on the part of American citizens . It is the doctrine of priesteraft . The object is to get possession by the priests of popular education , as they did once in Italy . The schools , the " bulwark of liberty , " would become no longer common schools , training each child for his duties as a citizen , but Clinrch schools , so educating him as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Modern science and modern improvements in teaching would soon faro here , as they do under the direct influence of the Pope . The Syllabus would speedily weed out most of the studies pursued in our schools and normal colleges . We should have education as it is now in French rural parishes , or under the eyes of the Holy Father . There would be a blank uniformity  --  history With Protestantism left out , science from the Standpoint of the Papal Syllabus , mental awakening as priests desire it , and republicanism as guided by a foreign priestly ruler , with the habit everywhere taught of implicit obedience to the priest and the Pope of Rome . Such an education is the last thing which the American people desire introduced into their political system . Fortunately , however unich the Irish Catholics may 1w muler the thumb of priest and bishop , the German Catholics are much more independent . They will stand with the American Protestants on this question . Aud it only needs vigilance during every session of the Legislature and at every election to prevent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best inheritance from Dutch Protestants  --  our common school system .
