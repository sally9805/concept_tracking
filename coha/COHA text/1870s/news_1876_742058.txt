txt The interest in Oriental carpets and . Vigil is of very recent origin in this country . ft is true that for many years they have figured .. in the occasional stock of brie- &-brae; shops , have been foundin the studios of some of our artists , and have graced the floors of a few of the more fastidious and tasteful of our citizens . But the , demand fort hem has been so slight that it is only within three years that they have formed a part of the regular stock of our larger deal-. ere in carpets , and only within one year that any considerable variety in them lias been introduced . Roughly speaking , the taste for them may be said to have become extensive enough . to form a fashion , only since the Vienna Exhibition in 187 . In England . and Europe they , have been known much more widely and have , found their way with considerable freed OM to the libraries , the boudoirs , and the " rooming rooms " of the rich .

How far the use of the various Oriental ' floor . coverings has now extended may be inferred . from the fact that at Philadelphia one can Sea ; not only the original and genuine carpets hub also carpets made in the Orient on European orders ; ' carpets made by native convicts in. the English prisons of Calcutta and Madras ; after the original mode , but in deli , as furnished from and with wool dyed is England. ; carpets made in Berlin and Holland to talita46 the genuine ones of Smyrna , rage nsee'le France to imitate those of Persia , and , finally , any number of Brussels patent Axminster and .

On the other hand , the prices asked in the Egyptian section are , on the average , somewhat lower than American prices ; and the quality of corresponding types of : tools is , if anything , rather better , while the variety of pure Oriental designs is etinsiderahlV wider and richer than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oriental carpets and rugs , but I should say that this is only a convenient mode . of indicating a very wide variety of species which have only one thing as a unifo:an characteristic , viz. , the manner of snaking , and even this is closely imitated in certain modern Western work . All genuine Oriental door coverings that can fairly be called carpets are made by hand , sometimes on one form of leen : ) . and sometimes on another , but always in a wa:e. which admits of a kind of design and a variation and multiplying of colors , quite ierpossible in the product of a power loom . Tire maker , almost invariably a woman or a young girl. , is in front of a frame over which is stretched the web that terms the back of the carpet . She takes a smaller or larger bunch of yarn in her needle , according as the web is coarse or fine , and passing it around one or two threads of the web , forms a loop , through which : the two ends of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is tightened , and the ends et the yarn are cut . Thus , stitch by stitch , she proceeds across the carpet , and having completed one row , or as she passes on after each stitch , she slips in and out a cross thread of the web . and draws it tight , thus securely fastening the yarn . This is substantially the mode of working in all cases , according to the accounts of the Orientals themselves at PhiladLphia , . and a close examination of all varieties of ear . pets shown here , or in New-York , has failed to disclose any probable error in the description . Each carpet consists , whatever its fineness or coarseness , of a mass of knots of wool or silk tied on a back of hemp , cotton , or wool . From the finest cashmere , in silk , andemints . ing 10,000 of these knots to the square foot , to the loosely made and rough-piled Smyrna with perhaps not more than 1,000 , the knots may be easily traced . The material may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the soft surface of satin or ' oak as if it had been gnawed off by rats with defective teeth ; it may be stiff and close or it may be as pliable as dress goods , but it is always tied in knots , and this fact is intimately connected with and an invariable condition of all that is most beautiful in Eastcra carpets . It will readily be seen that there is no limit to the number of shades that may be used , and no bound to the changes of form . The carpet may be made as regular and as hideous as our finest French moquettes ; the sprawling bouquets and medallions and the sweeuiag festoons and garlands of the Louis Quinze style are quite practicable , if one eau ' find a work- ' man ( or rather work woman ) patient enough to fashion them ; and indeed some of the genuine Eastern-made carpets , intended for the European markets , are not to be surpassed me badness by the tapestry brussels of Mancheste ? . But while the Eastern carnets call have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wholly beyond the reach of the latter . There is room in their biaking for the play of fancy , the expression of changing purpose and impulse , in a word . for characteristic design which no steam-driven loom will allow . The leisurely Oriental , seated before the loom in her own house , earning easily enough . to satisfy her simple wants , watches the growth of her carpet with the eye Oa , born artist . Taking her colors , knot by knot , as the painter touches the canvas with his pencil , she works out slowly the fabric of Ler design . Whether she follows a pattern set for her or makes her own as she goes on , the slowness of her progress and the absence of all restraint enforced by machinery are such that It is possible to get from her a result wholly without character . If I am not , in common with all , lovers of Oriental design , altogether wrong , is this inevitable individually which makes the Eastern carpets so peculiarly beautiful and so satisfying and lasting in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful of the Oriental goods seem to mo to be the old Persian rugs . Of those the best in Philadelphia are to bo found in the exhibit of Haim , Vidal &; Co. , in the Turkish section of the Main Building , and in the British section on the north side of the north aisle . I must say , however , that I have seen some quite as Cum and even finer in au out of the way drug importer 's in the heart of the busiuess part of New-York , where no one would think of looking tor them . These rugs are mostly all wool , including the bank , though the latter is sometimes of a very coarse and harsh texture , and very rarely is of hemp , a woolen batik being on the whole a fairly unvarying characteristic . The pile is neually soft , not very long , rather closely , and Sometimes very closely , tied , and the whole fabrio yielding and pliable . The rugs may be long but are seldom wide , the widest I have ever seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foot anti four inches . The length varies from about eix feet to twelve . In appearance they are characterized by a pe-culiar softness of surface , the colors being toned to harmony by wear , and this quality is in the best designs something quite distinct find inimitable . I can not begin to describe it , but any one who has seen it often enough to acquire a strong enjoyment in it can not easily enetake it . I suspect , though I do not feel wholly convinced , that au attempt is sometimes made by unscrupulous dealers to imitate this effect , though I am unable to detect the means . It may be by rolling or by artificial fading of the colors. 1 am led to this suspicion by the fact that in some of the most beautiful old rugs there is an unmistakable though very slight change in the dye of the thread below the surface , where the pile is , say , three-sixteenths of en inch in length , such as wear would neoeseerily produce , while there are others , offered as old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not show this difference . The latter , I remark , are not equal to the former in design . The old Persian rugs  --  i. e. , from fifty years cid backward , taking the figures of the dealers  --  afford the very best examples of pure Eastern carpet design . Some of the finest elements of this design are peculiar to them , though they share others with the modern Oriental carpets , and are especially nearly approached by the carpets made now in the villages of Persia and Turkistan , and in the interior of India . The ( genuine ) Smyrna carpets and the run of Madras are not wholly unlike them , and may be said to have an Oriental flavor ; but they are very much inferior . It is very difficult to say in what the excellence of this design consists , because , in the Oast place , any verbal description of optical eeneations is barren and apt to be misleading ; arid , in the second place , because there is a subtle eh riff in the way in which the various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite impossible to indicate in words . It is to be noted , however , that in all the old rugs there is nothing like arbitrary regularity in form or in arrangement ot colors . Forms are sometimes repeated , and subjected to an arrangement generally symmetrical , but always there is to be seen , on closer looking , a wholly peculiar variation , a constant freedom . The same is true of the colors . The designer is evidently no slave to technical rules . He does not bother himself with balancing his dark and Ins light . He might define the rules he follows , but it is doubtful it be could , and no imitator bas been able to discover or apply them . What one sees is a rich and almost inexhaustible store of harmonies in color , scattered over a varied surface , with the same kind of continual change that one finds in foliage , and a good deal of the same strength and vitality . The forms are mostly geometric , but they have neither the poverty of line which modern geometric design @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Itioresque or " Alhambra " geometric forms . They are at once varied and distinct . There is a strong tendency to the diamond shape in the larger figures of the centres of the rugs , and to diagonal lines and a blossom-like arrangement of small spots in the subordinate figures anti in the borders . Some of these forms are determined by the use . The long rugs with diamond figures in the centre were originally intended for the floors of mosques or private chapels , and the diamonds indicate the positions of the incense vases . In some small rugs , a peculiar pattern across one end designates the points where the faithful places his hands and touches his forehead when bowing in prayer . In the ground are found largely a dull but soft brick red , a dark and rich but not pure blue , a mustard yellow , an olive green ; and in the figures these colors with light blue , canary , dull rrimsou , white , and a peculiar tawny brown , as near the color of a lion 's skin as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to convey an impression of the effect of these colors by cataloguing them . The names of the prismatic time do not describe a rainbow to one who has set fixed the rainbow in his mind . But it is perhaps worth noting a few facts . First , these colors are always arranged to produce an impression of flatness . There is no attempt to suggest relict or perspective , and this goes a great way toward explaining the satisfactory quality of Oriental carpets as floor covering . Second , the colors are never , in themselves , pure and brilliant ; any one of them would look dull beside a similar one made by a modern aniline dye . The blues are modified with greens , with browns , with reds . The yellows shade on orange or red , but always on some warm combination . The whites are creamy . The extreme brilliancy which is occasionally seen is the result of the neighborhood of other colors . Third , and this is very important , every mass of color composed of more than one or two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a narrow lino of come third ' color , usually made of a single series of knots . It is in the selection of these connecting and defining lines of color that the artistic genius of the Oricutals displays itself . A similar practice is noted by Viollet le Duo in the decoration by the French architects of the thirteenth century , and he discovers in it the secret of the splendor of the coloring of that remarkable  --  age . To illustrate roughly , I will indicate the colors of a figure in the border of an old Pereian rug in the exhibit of Messrs . Haim , Vidal &; Co. in the Turkish section . In the mitre a diamond of dark blue , with a line of dull red ; then au irregular figure of mustard yellow , with a line of dark blue ; then en octagon of deep rod , with a line ot dark blue ; then the ground of the main flatus ) in slim white , separated by a line of red Irons the ground of the border , which is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may seem confused to the reader , is exceedingly rich . As a further illustration I note that in this same rug red is divided from neighboring colors as follows : By white from dark blue , by yellow from olive green , by pale blue from olive green , by white from olive green , by pale green from dark blue , by black from pale blue , by black from yellow , by black from lion 's skin , by dark green from pale green , and by pale green from yellow . Such an enumeration , of course , conveys no clear impression , but it may servo to show the extent to which the opportunity for freedom and variety is given by the mode Of making which I have already dos scribed . Next to the old Persian rugs in the characters Asti ? Quality at their colorise. though inferior in beauty , are the larger carpets generally known to the trade as Khorassan . These usually show brighter colors , stronger contrasts , larger masses , and a frequent occurrence of animal forms , some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carpets are well tied on a firm back , usually woolen , with a longish pile and a comparatively soft material . They stand well with the dealers , are much sought after , and command . the highest prices of any of what are known as the " regular " grades . They are supposed to come from the northern part of the Province of Khorassan , which lies south-oast ot the Caspian Sea , and is traversed by the mighty ranges of the Elburz Mountains , through whose deep valleys caravan routes pass to Teheran . But it may as well be said here , that all names of provinces attached to Oriental carpets by dealers are apt to be misleading . At best they give only a general notion , and the classification of the products of different localities is very imperfect . The Khorassau carpets range in the New-York market , at retail , from $17 to Sal per square yard , and in Exhibition prices , from $22 to $27 . Beside the Khorassan must be classed the so-called " India " carpets . These are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variety in quality , design , and material . They arc , as a rule , inferior to Persian goods , more monotonous in color , more regular in pattern , harsher in material , and more loosely tied . Occasionally one meets , under this name , very beautiful products of the interior villages of India ; but I am informed that this particular class of goods is monopolized by a single house in London ? Messrs . Watson , Boater &; Co. , of Bond street . Even these village-made goods show the taming and corrupting influence of Western standards . Under the general name of India may be placed also certain very heavy and coarse carpets , said by good authority to be made in the British prisons of India by native convicts . These are marked by heavy and muddy colors , by the repetition of figures  --  the pattern sometimes being wholly made up of a figure , say a square foot in area , indefinitely multiplied ? and by awkward borders , wholly wanting in the beauty and simplicity of the native designs . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am told that Oriental carpets generally are sold on the docks at London by the bale , averaging , perhaps , 2s. to 2e. 3d. per square foot , to the jobber . They are then assorted and sold at retail at prices all the way from 15s. to ? 3 per square yard , with higher rates for special qualities . There are other grades and varieties of Oriental carpets which may be inspected witti profit , as showing the features which run through all of them , and those which distinguish one from another . The rich and splendid but quite modern Portrera. the loose and coarse but often highly characteristic Zyhordie , the heavy and rudely-designed Smyrna , the harsh-feeling but often brilliant Mirzapore , and the thick , closely-made , and generally valuable Masulipatam , and the very exceptional Cashmere carpets , all can be compared with interest . But .1 should weary rather than enlighten the reader by referring to them in detail .
