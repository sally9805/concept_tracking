txt " I stand squarely on the platform , " said Senator THURMAN , at Hamilton , Ohio , on Tuesday . " I have advocated its principles heretofore , and I shall continue to advocate thein. * * * I confidently defy my critics , one and all , to name any vote that I have given during the nine years that I have sat in the Senate that was inconsistent with those principles . " It seems , then , that we have all of us done Mr. THURMAN a great deal more than justice in the past . He has always been in favor of the gradual substitution of greenbacks for national bank-notes , opposed to contraction , and in favor of unlimited coinage of the silver dollar ; in other words , while we have supposed him to be an intelligent man , holding back the hands of his fanatical brethren , he has been as one of them , ready to go with them to the furthest extreme of crazy finance . If it is a pleasure to the Senator to establish the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in him in the past , we shall not deny it to him , though it is not without regret that we see him surrender to a tide that can not carry him to success , though it may be strong enough to bring much evil to the country . " The principal feature " of the Ohio platform , says Mr , THURMAN , " is the proposed substitution of greenbacks for national bank-notes , " and there is no doubt , as we long ago pointed out , that this is the form which the soft-money movement must eventually take . It does not follow that , unless we substitute legal tenders for banknotes , we must have a currency of banknotes alone , nor is the latter the aim of the Republican Party . If the legal tenders are redeemed according to law , the currency would consist of the redeemable Government notes , the redeemable bank-notes , and coin , and under the existing statutes , the latter two elements could be indefinitely increased , according to the legitimate demands of business , while the former remained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men involves a very different state of things . They would reduce the currency to Government legal-tender notes and coiu , and it is to be remembered that , by the Ohio platform , on which Mr. THURMAN , " squarely stands , " there is no provision to be made for the redemption of the greenbacks . On the contrary , the platform demands the repeal of the Resumption act , which is the only law requiring their specific redemption . Now , there is one feature in this project which Mr. THURMAN does not deign to notice , but which is of the highest importance . It is , that for the substitution of greenbacks for bank-notes , that is , for the issue of some $320,000,000 of legal-tender notes , there is not the slightest constitutional authority . Their issue would , indeed , be in direct violation of the Constitution as construed by the highest tribunal of the land and as regarded by the ablest constitutional lawyers ever since the question has been under discussion . The original legal-tender act was always of doubtful constitutionality . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after it had been once condemned , and the only ground for sustaining it was the dangerous one of " overwhelming necessity . " The decision was an application on the extremost scale of the maxim that the law is silent in war . To reach the same conclusion now would be , to any reasonable . jurist , entirely im-possible . Whatever may have boon the necessity at the time for the passage of the legal-tender act , there is ' none now , Though we might silence law in of war , and strain the Constitution to prevent its absolute overthrow . We can not afford to silence it now . That would be equivalent to its destruction at our own-hands . The issue of legal tenders to replace the bank-notes is demanded solely on the ground of expediency . The expediency is more than doubtful , but it is not pretended by any one that there is anything else to sustain the proposition . What are we to think of a statesman who wants to be President and who poses in the diameter of the leader of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for certain financial theories , can lightly brush aside the Constitution as of no weight in the premises The Democrats , and Air . THURMAN , chief among them , delight to call themselves conservatives . But this is not conservatism , it is dostrudtiveneSs . It is striking at the root of not ' only stable finance , but of stable government . If we are to cast the Constitution Overboard when any little band of reckless ' adventurers choose to demand au " experiment of their senseless theories , what shall we have left to guard or maintain the central principle of our Government , which is respect for the fundamental law I. The appearance of Mr. THURMAN as the champion of such a policy , and the ' careless manner in which he passes by its utter - inconsistency with the Constitution , is a curious sign of the tendencies of the Democratic Party . There was a time when that party was regarded by itself and conceded by its opponents to be in favor of a strict construction of the Constitution , and when its leaders would at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Constitution . But the later-day Democrats are troubled with no such scruples ; They are quite willing to take up the wildest cry that seems to promise to bring or to keep a few votes , without regard to what their lawful power may be . From Cass and MARCY to THURMAN is a long way , and , curiously enough , the man who is nearest looks just now infinitely the smallest .
