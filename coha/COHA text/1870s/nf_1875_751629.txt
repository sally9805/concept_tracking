As a certain poet says of himself , she " lisped in numbers , for the numbers ix:12 came . " Certain essays written at that early date are still in circulation among her first pupils ; but they are feeble attempts to state the Principle and practice of ix:15 Christian healing , and are not complete nor satisfac-tory expositions of Truth .

Before writing this work , SCIENCE AND HEALTH , she ix:27 made copious notes of Scriptural exposition , which have never been published . This was during the years 1867 and 1868 .

By thousands of well-authenticated cases of healing , she and her students have proved the worth of her teachings . These cases for the most part x:18 have been abandoned as hopeless by regular medical attendants . Few invalids will turn to God till all physical supports have failed , because there is so little x:21 faith in His disposition and power to heal disease . The divine Principle of healing is proved in the personal experience of any sincere seeker of Truth .

No intellectual proficiency is req-uisite in the learner , but sound morals are most de-sirable. xi:1 Many imagine that the phenomena of physical heal-ing in Christian Science present only a phase of the xi:3 action of the human mind , which action in some unex-plained way results in the cure of disease . On the con-trary , Christian Science rationally explains that all xi:6 other pathological methods are the fruits of human faith in matter , faith in the workings , not of Spirit , but of the fleshly mind which must yield to Science . xi:9 The physical healing of Christian Science results now , as in Jesus ' time , from the operation of divine Principle , before which sin and disease lose their real-xi:12 ity in human consciousness and disappear as naturally and as necessarily as darkness gives place to light and sin to reformation . Now , as then , these mighty works xi:15 are not supernatural , but supremely natural .

When God called the author to proclaim His Gospel to this age , there came also the charge to plant and xi:24 water His vineyard . The first school of Christian Science Mind-healing was started by the author with only one student in xi:27 Lynn , Massachusetts , about the year 1867 . In 1881 , she opened the Massachusetts Metaphysical College in Boston , under the seal of the Commonwealth , a law xi:30 relative to colleges having been passed , which enabled her to get this institution chartered for medical pur-xii:1 poses . No charters were granted to Christian Scien-tists for such institutions after 1883 , and up to that xii:3 date , hers was the only College of this character which had been established in the United States , where Christian Science was first introduced . xii:6 During seven years over four thousand students were taught by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first established Church of xii:9 Christ , Scientist ; President of the first Christian Sci-entist Association , convening monthly ; publisher of her own works ; and ( for a portion of this time ) sole xii:12 editor and publisher of the Christian Science Journal , the first periodical issued by Christian Scientists . She closed her College , October 29 , 1889 , in the height of xii:15 its prosperity with a deep-lying conviction that the next two years of her life should be given to the prep-aration of the revision of SCIENCE AND HEALTH , which xii:18 was published in 1891 . She retained her charter , and as its President , reopened the College in 1899 as auxil-iary to her church . Until June 10 , 1907 , she had never xii:21 read this book throughout consecutively in order to elu-cidate her idealism .

CHAPTER I - PRAYER For verily I say unto you , That whosoever shall say unto this mountain , Be thou removed , and be thou cast into the sea ; and shall not doubt in his heart , but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass ; he shall have whatsoever he saith . Therefore I say unto you , What things soever ye desire when ye pray , believe that ye receive them , and ye shall have them . Your Father knoweth what things ye have need of , before ye ask Him . - CHRIST JESUS . 1:1 THE prayer that reforms the sinner and heals the sick is an absolute faith that all things are 1:3 possible to God , - a spiritual understanding of Him , an unselfed love . Regardless of what another may say or think on this subject , I speak from experience . 1:6 Prayer , watching , and working , combined with self-im-molation , are God 's gracious means for accomplishing whatever has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thoughts unspoken are not unknown to the divine Mind . Desire is prayer ; and no loss can occur from 1:12 trusting God with our desires , that they may be moulded and exalted before they take form in words and in deeds . Right motives 2:1 What are the motives for prayer ? Do we pray to make ourselves better or to benefit those who hear us , 2:3 to enlighten the infinite or to be heard of men ? Are we benefited by praying ? Yes , the desire which goes forth hungering after righteous-2:6 ness is blessed of our Father , and it does not return unto us void . Deity unchangeable God is not moved by the breath of praise to do more 2:9 than He has already done , nor can the infinite do less than bestow all good , since He is unchang-ing wisdom and Love . We can do more for 2:12 ourselves by humble fervent petitions , but the All-lov-ing does not grant them simply on the ground of lip-service , for He already knows all . 2:15 Prayer can not change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us into harmony with it . Goodness at-tains the demonstration of Truth . A request that 2:18 God will save us is not all that is required . The mere habit of pleading with the divine Mind , as one pleads with a human being , perpetuates the belief in God as 2:21 humanly circumscribed , - an error which impedes spiritual growth . God 's standard God is Love . Can we ask Him to be more ? God is 2:24 intelligence . Can we inform the infinite Mind of any-thing He does not already comprehend ? Do we expect to change perfection ? Shall 2:27 we plead for more at the open fount , which is pour-ing forth more than we accept ? The unspoken desire does bring us nearer the source of all existence and 2:30 blessedness . Asking God to be God is a vain repetition . God is " the same yesterday , and to-day , and forever ; " and 3:1 He who is immutably right will do right without being reminded of His province . The wisdom of man is not 3:3 sufficient to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would stand before a blackboard , and pray the principle of mathematics to solve the problem ? The 3:6 rule is already established , and it is our task to work out the solution . Shall we ask the divine Principle of all goodness to do His own 3:9 work ? His work is done , and we have only to avail ourselves of God 's rule in order to receive His bless-ing , which enables us to work out our own salvation . 3:12 The Divine Being must be reflected by man , - else man is not the image and likeness of the patient , tender , and true , the One " altogether lovely ; " but to 3:15 understand God is the work of eternity , and demands absolute consecration of thought , energy , and desire . Prayerful ingratitude How empty are our conceptions of Deity ! We admit 3:18 theoretically that God is good , omnipotent , omni-present , infinite , and then we try to give information to this infinite Mind . We plead 3:21 for unmerited pardon and for a liberal outpouring of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received ? Then we shall avail ourselves of the 3:24 blessings we have , and thus be fitted to receive more . Gratitude is much more than a verbal expression of thanks . Action expresses more gratitude than speech . 3:27 If we are ungrateful for Life , Truth , and Love , and yet return thanks to God for all blessings , we are in-sincere and incur the sharp censure our Master pro-3:30 nounces on hypocrites . In such a case , the only acceptable prayer is to put the finger on the lips and remember our blessings . While the heart is far from 4:1 divine Truth and Love , we can not conceal the ingrati-tude of barren lives . Efficacious petitions 4:3 What we most need is the prayer of fervent desire for growth in grace , expressed in patience , meekness , love , and good deeds . To keep the com-4:6 mandments of our Master and follow his example , is our proper debt to him and the only worthy evidence of our gratitude for all that he has 4:9 done . Outward worship is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since he has said : " If ye love me , keep my commandments . " 4:12 The habitual struggle to be always good is unceas-ing prayer . Its motives are made manifest in the blessings they bring , - blessings which , even if not 4:15 acknowledged in audible words , attest our worthiness to be partakers of Love . Watchfulness requisite Simply asking that we may love God will never 4:18 make us love Him ; but the longing to be better and holier , expressed in daily watchful-ness and in striving to assimilate more of 4:21 the divine character , will mould and fashion us anew , until we awake in His likeness . We reach the Science of Christianity through demonstration of the 4:24 divine nature ; but in this wicked world goodness will " be evil spoken of , " and patience must bring experience . Veritable devotion 4:27 Audible prayer can never do the works of spiritual understanding , which regenerates ; but silent prayer , watchfulness , and devout obedience enable 4:30 us to follow Jesus ' example . Long prayers , superstition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothe religion in human forms . Whatever mate-5:1 rializes worship hinders man 's spiritual growth and keeps him from demonstrating his power over error . Sorrow and reformation 5:3 Sorrow for wrong-doing is but one step towards reform and the very easiest step . The next and great step re-quired by wisdom is the test of our sincerity , 5:6 - namely , reformation . To this end we are placed under the stress of circumstances . Temptation bids us repeat the offence , and woe comes in return for 5:9 what is done . So it will ever be , till we learn that there is no discount in the law of justice and that we must pay " the uttermost farthing . " The measure ye mete " shall 5:12 be measured to you again , " and it will be full " and run-ning over . " Saints and sinners get their full award , but not always 5:15 in this world . The followers of Christ drank his cup . Ingratitude and persecution filled it to the brim ; but God pours the riches of His love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to our day . Sin-ners flourish " like a green bay tree ; " but , looking farther , the Psalmist could see their end , - the destruction of sin 5:21 through suffering . Cancellation of human sin Prayer is not to be used as a confessional to cancel sin . Such an error would impede true religion . Sin is forgiven 5:24 only as it is destroyed by Christ , - Truth and Life . If prayer nourishes the belief that sin is cancelled , and that man is made better merely by praying , 5:27 prayer is an evil . He grows worse who continues in sin because he fancies himself forgiven . Diabolism destroyed An apostle says that the Son of God Christ came to 5:30 " destroy the works of the devil . " We should follow our divine Exemplar , and seek the de-struction of all evil works , error and disease included . 6:1 We can not escape the penalty due for sin . The Scrip-tures say , that if we deny Christ , " he also will deny us . " Pardon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Men may pardon , but this divine Principle alone reforms the sinner . God is not separate from the wis-6:6 dom He bestows . The talents He gives we must improve . Calling on Him to forgive our work badly done or left undone , implies the vain supposition 6:9 that we have nothing to do but to ask pardon , and that afterwards we shall be free to repeat the offence . To cause suffering as the result of sin , is the means 6:12 of destroying sin . Every supposed pleasure in sin will furnish more than its equivalent of pain , until belief in material life and sin is destroyed . To reach 6:15 heaven , the harmony of being , we must understand the divine Principle of being . Mercy without partiality " God is Love . " More than this we can not ask , 6:18 higher we can not look , farther we can not go . To suppose that God forgives or punishes sin according as His mercy is sought or un-6:21 sought , is to misunderstand Love and to make prayer the safety-valve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before he cast it 6:24 out . Of a sick woman he said that Satan had bound her , and to Peter he said , " Thou art an of-fence unto me . " He came teaching and 6:27 showing men how to destroy sin , sickness , and death . He said of the fruitless tree , " It is hewn down . " It is believed by many that a certain magistrate , 6:30 who lived in the time of Jesus , left this record : " His rebuke is fearful . " The strong language of our Mas-ter confirms this description . 7:1 The only civil sentence which he had for error was , " Get thee behind me , Satan . " Still stronger evidence 7:3 that Jesus ' reproof was pointed and pungent is found in his own words , - showing the necessity for such forcible utterance , when he cast out devils and healed 7:6 the sick and sinning . The relinquishment of error de-prives material sense of its false claims . Audible praying Audible prayer is impressive ; it gives momentary 7:9 solemnity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lasting benefit ? Looking deeply into these things , we find that " a zeal . . . 7:12 not according to knowledge " gives occasion for reac-tion unfavorable to spiritual growth , sober resolve , and wholesome perception of God 's requirements . The mo-7:15 tives for verbal prayer may embrace too much love of applause to induce or encourage Christian sentiment . Emotional utterances Physical sensation , not Soul , produces material ec-7:18 stasy and emotion . If spiritual sense always guided men , there would grow out of ecstatic mo-ments a higher experience and a better life 7:21 with more devout self-abnegation and purity . A self-satisfied ventilation of fervent sentiments never makes a Christian . God is not influenced by man . The " di-7:24 vine ear " is not an auditory nerve . It is the all-hearing and all-knowing Mind , to whom each need of man is always known and by whom it will be supplied . Danger from audible prayer 7:27 The danger from prayer is that it may lead us into temp-tation . By it we may become involuntary hypocrites , ut-tering desires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ midst of sin with the recollection that we have prayed over it or mean to ask for-giveness at some later day . Hypocrisy is fatal to religion . 8:1 A wordy prayer may afford a quiet sense of self-justification , though it makes the sinner a hypocrite. 8:3 We never need to despair of an honest heart ; but there is little hope for those who come only spasmodi-cally face to face with their wickedness and then seek to 8:6 hide it . Their prayers are indexes which do not correspond with their character . They hold secret fellowship with sin , and such externals are spoken of by Jesus as " like 8:9 unto whited sepulchres . . . full . . . of all uncleanness . " Aspiration and love If a man , though apparently fervent and prayerful , is impure and therefore insincere , what must be the 8:12 comment upon him ? If he reached the loftiness of his prayer , there would be no occasion for comment . If we feel the aspiration , hu-8:15 mility , gratitude , and love which our words express @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to try to deceive ourselves or others , for " there is nothing covered that 8:18 shall not be revealed . " Professions and audible pray-ers are like charity in one respect , - they " cover the multitude of sins . " Praying for humility with what-8:21 ever fervency of expression does not always mean a desire for it . If we turn away from the poor , we are not ready to receive the reward of Him who blesses 8:24 the poor . We confess to having a very wicked heart and ask that it may be laid bare before us , but do we not already know more of this heart than we are 8:27 willing to have our neighbor see ? Searching the heart We should examine ourselves and learn what is the affection and purpose of the heart , for in this way 8:30 only can we learn what we honestly are . If a friend informs us of a fault , do we listen pa-tiently to the rebuke and credit what is said ? Do we not 9:1 rather give thanks that we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the author has been most grateful 9:3 for merited rebuke . The wrong lies in unmerited cen-sure , - in the falsehood which does no one any good . Summit of aspiration The test of all prayer lies in the answer to these 9:6 questions : Do we love our neighbor better because of this asking ? Do we pursue the old selfish-ness , satisfied with having prayed for some-9:9 thing better , though we give no evidence of the sin-cerity of our requests by living consistently with our prayer ? If selfishness has given place to kindness , 9:12 we shall regard our neighbor unselfishly , and bless them that curse us ; but we shall never meet this great duty simply by asking that it may be done . There is 9:15 a cross to be taken up before we can enjoy the fruition of our hope and faith . Practical religion Dost thou " love the Lord thy God with all thy 9:18 heart , and with all thy soul , and with all thy mind " ? This command includes much , even the sur-render of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is the El Dorado of Christianity . It involves the Science of Life , and recognizes only the divine control of Spirit , in which Soul is our master , 9:24 and material sense and human will have no place . The chalice sacrificial Are you willing to leave all for Christ , for Truth , and so be counted among sinners ? No ! Do you really desire 9:27 to attain this point ? No ! Then why make long prayers about it and ask to be Christians , since you do not care to tread in the footsteps of our 9:30 dear Master ? If unwilling to follow his example , why pray with the lips that you may be partakers of his nature ? Consistent prayer is the desire to do right . 10:1 Prayer means that we desire to walk and will walk in the light so far as we receive it , even though with bleed-10:3 ing footsteps , and that waiting patiently on the Lord , we will leave our real desires to be rewarded by Him . The world must grow to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profit by Jesus ' cup of earthly sorrows , God will sustain us under these sor-rows . Until we are thus divinely qualified and are 10:9 willing to drink his cup , millions of vain repetitions will never pour into prayer the unction of Spirit in demonstration of power and " with signs following . " 10:12 Christian Science reveals a necessity for overcoming the world , the flesh , and evil , and thus destroying all error . Seeking is not sufficient . It is striving that enables 10:15 us to enter . Spiritual attainments open the door to a higher understanding of the divine Life . Perfunctory prayers One of the forms of worship in Thibet is to carry a 10:18 praying-machine through the streets , and stop at the doors to earn a penny by grinding out a prayer . But the advance guard of progress has 10:21 paid for the privilege of prayer the price of persecution . Asking amiss Experience teaches us that we do not always receive the blessings we ask for in prayer . There is some mis-10:24 apprehension of the source and means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receive that for which we ask . The Scrip-10:27 tures say : " Ye ask , and receive not , because ye ask amiss , that ye may consume it upon your lusts . " That which we desire and for which we ask , it is not always 10:30 best for us to receive . In this case infinite Love will not grant the request . Do you ask wisdom to be mer-ciful and not to punish sin ? Then " ye ask amiss . " 11:1 Without punishment , sin would multiply . Jesus ' prayer , " Forgive us our debts , " specified also the terms of 11:3 forgiveness . When forgiving the adulterous woman he said , " Go , and sin no more . " Remission of penalty A magistrate sometimes remits the penalty , but this 11:6 may be no moral benefit to the criminal , and at best , it only saves the criminal from one form of punishment . The moral law , which has the 11:9 right to acquit or condemn , always demands restitu-tion before mortals can " go up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compel this progress . Truth annihilates error 11:12 Mere legal pardon ( and there is no other , for divine Principle never pardons our sins or mistakes till they are corrected ) leaves the offender free to re-11:15 peat the offence , if indeed , he has not already suffered sufficiently from vice to make him turn from it with loathing . Truth bestows no pardon upon error , but 11:18 wipes it out in the most effectual manner . Jesus suffered for our sins , not to annul the divine sentence for an in-dividual 's sin , but because sin brings inevitable suffering . Desire for holiness 11:21 Petitions bring to mortals only the results of mor-tals ' own faith . We know that a desire for holiness is requisite in order to gain holiness ; but if we 11:24 desire holiness above all else , we shall sac-rifice everything for it . We must be willing to do this , that we may walk securely in the only practical road 11:27 to holiness . Prayer can not change the unalterable Truth , nor can prayer alone give us an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fervent habitual 11:30 desire to know and do the will of God , will bring us into all Truth . Such a desire has little need of audible expression . It is best expressed in thought and in life . Prayer for the sick 12:1 " The prayer of faith shall save the sick , " says the Scripture . What is this healing prayer ? A mere re-12:3 quest that God will heal the sick has no power to gain more of the divine presence than is always at hand . The beneficial effect of 12:6 such prayer for the sick is on the human mind , mak-ing it act more powerfully on the body through a blind faith in God . This , however , is one belief casting out 12:9 another , - a belief in the unknown casting out a belief in sickness . It is neither Science nor Truth which acts through blind belief , nor is it the human under-12:12 standing of the divine healing Principle as manifested in Jesus , whose humble prayers were deep and con-scientious protests of Truth , - of man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Truth and Love . Prayer to a corporeal God affects the sick like a drug , which has no efficacy of its own but borrows its 12:18 power from human faith and belief . The drug does nothing , because it has no intelligence . It is a mortal belief , not divine Principle or Love , which causes a 12:21 drug to be apparently either poisonous or sanative . The common custom of praying for the recovery of the sick finds help in blind belief , whereas help should come 12:24 from the enlightened understanding . Changes in belief may go on indefinitely , but they are the merchandise of human thought and not the outgrowth of divine Science . Love impartial and universal 12:27 Does Deity interpose in behalf of one worshipper , and not help another who offers the same measure of prayer ? If the sick recover because they 12:30 pray or are prayed for audibly , only peti-tioners ( per se or by proxy ) should get well . In divine Science , where prayers are mental , all may avail them-13:1 selves of God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Love is impartial and universal in its adaptation and 13:3 bestowals . It is the open fount which cries , " Ho , every one that thirsteth , come ye to the waters . " Public exaggerations In public prayer we often go beyond our convictions , 13:6 beyond the honest standpoint of fervent desire . If we are not secretly yearning and openly striv-ing for the accomplishment of all we ask , 13:9 our prayers are " vain repetitions , " such as the heathen use . If our petitions are sincere , we labor for what we ask ; and our Father , who seeth in secret , will reward 13:12 us openly . Can the mere public expression of our de-sires increase them ? Do we gain the omnipotent ear sooner by words than by thoughts ? Even if prayer is 13:15 sincere , God knows our need before we tell Him or our fellow-beings about it . If we cherish the desire hon-estly and silently and humbly , God will bless it , and 13:18 we shall incur less risk of overwhelming our real wishes with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God as a corporeal person , this will 13:21 prevent us from relinquishing the human doubts and fears which attend such a belief , and so we can not grasp the wonders wrought by infi-13:24 nite , incorporeal Love , to whom all things are possible . Because of human ignorance of the divine Principle , Love , the Father of all is represented as a corporeal 13:27 creator ; hence men recognize themselves as merely physical , and are ignorant of man as God 's image or re-flection and of man 's eternal incorporeal existence . The 13:30 world of error is ignorant of the world of Truth , - blind to the reality of man 's existence , - for the world of sen-sation is not cognizant of life in Soul , not in body . Bodily presence 14:1 If we are sensibly with the body and regard omnipo-tence as a corporeal , material person , whose ear we 14:3 would gain , we are not " absent from the body " and " present with the Lord " in the demonstration of Spirit . We can not " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Lord " is to have , not mere emotional ecstasy or faith , but the actual demonstration and understanding of Life as revealed in 14:9 Christian Science . To be " with the Lord " is to be in obedience to the law of God , to be absolutely governed by divine Love , - by Spirit , not by matter . Spiritualized consciousness 14:12 Become conscious for a single moment that Life and intelligence are purely spiritual , - neither in nor of matter , - and the body will then utter no 14:15 complaints . If suffering from a belief in sickness , you will find yourself suddenly well . Sorrow is turned into joy when the body is controlled by spir-14:18 itual Life , Truth , and Love . Hence the hope of the promise Jesus bestows : " He that believeth on me , the works that I do shall he do also ; . . . because I 14:21 go unto my Father , " - because the Ego is absent from the body , and present with Truth and Love . The Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ material 14:24 sense . Entirely separate from the belief and dream of mate-rial living , is the Life divine , revealing spiritual under-14:27 standing and the consciousness of man 's dominion over the whole earth . This understanding casts out error and heals the sick , and with it you can speak 14:30 " as one having authority . " " When thou prayest , enter into thy closet , and , when thou hast shut thy door , pray to thy Father 15:1 which is in secret ; and thy Father , which seeth in secret , shall reward thee openly . " Spiritual sanctuary 15:3 So spake Jesus . The closet typifies the sanctuary of Spirit , the door of which shuts out sinful sense but lets in Truth , Life , and Love . Closed to 15:6 error , it is open to Truth , and vice versa .

Effectual invocation In order to pray aright , we must enter into the 15:15 closet and shut the door . We must close the lips and silence the material senses . In the quiet sanctuary of earnest longings , we must 15:18 deny sin and plead God 's allness . We must resolve to take up the cross , and go forth with honest hearts to work and watch for wisdom , Truth , and Love . We 15:21 must " pray without ceasing . " Such prayer is an-swered , in so far as we put our desires into practice . The Master 's injunction is , that we pray in secret and 15:24 let our lives attest our sincerity .

Practice not profession , understanding not belief , gain the ear and right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blessings . Trustworthi-ness is the foundation of enlightened faith . Without a fitness for holiness , we can not receive holiness . Loftiest adoration 16:1 A great sacrifice of material things must precede this advanced spiritual understanding . The highest prayer 16:3 is not one of faith merely ; it is demonstra-tion . Such prayer heals sickness , and must destroy sin and death . It distinguishes between Truth 16:6 that is sinless and the falsity of sinful sense . The prayer of Jesus Christ Our Master taught his disciples one brief prayer , which we name after him the Lord 's Prayer . Our Mas-16:9 ter said , " After this manner therefore pray ye , " and then he gave that prayer which covers all human needs . There is indeed some doubt 16:12 among Bible scholars , whether the last line is not an addition to the prayer by a later copyist ; but this does not affect the meaning of the prayer itself . 16:15 In the phrase , " Deliver us from evil , " the original properly reads , " Deliver us from the evil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the peti-16:18 tion , for Christian Science teaches us that " the evil one , " or one evil , is but another name for the first lie and all liars . Only as we rise above all material sensuousness and 16:21 sin , can we reach the heaven-born aspiration and spiritual consciousness , which is indicated in the Lord 's Prayer and which instantaneously heals the sick . 16:24 Here let me give what I understand to be the spiritual sense of the Lord 's Prayer : Our Father which art in heaven , 16:27 Our Father-Mother God , all-harmonious , Hallowed be Thy name . Adorable One. 16:30 Thy kingdom come . Thy kingdom is come ; Thou art ever-present. 17:1 Thy will be done in earth , as it is in heaven . Enable us to know , - as in heaven , so on earth , - God is 17:3 omnipotent , supreme . Give us this day our daily bread ; Give us grace for to-day ; feed the famished affections ; 17:6 And forgive us our debts , as we forgive our debtors . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into temptation , but deliver us from 17:9 evil ; And God leadeth us not into temptation , but delivereth us from sin , disease , and death. 17:12 For Thine is the kingdom , and the power , and the glory , forever . For God is infinite , all-power , all Life , Truth , Love , over all , and All . CHAPTER II - ATONEMENT AND EUCHARIST And they that are Christ 's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts. - PAUL . For Christ sent me not to baptize , but to preach the gospel . - PAUL . For I say unto you , I will not drink of the fruit of the vine , until the kingdom of God shall come . - JESUS . Divine oneness 18:1 ATONEMENT is the exemplification of man 's unity with God , whereby man reflects divine Truth , Life , 18:3 and Love . Jesus of Nazareth taught and demonstrated man 's oneness with the Father , and for this we owe him endless homage . His mission was both in-18:6 dividual and collective . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to himself , but in mercy to mortals , - to show them how to do theirs , but not to do 18:9 it for them nor to relieve them of a single responsibility . Jesus acted boldly , against the accredited evidence of the senses , against Pharisaical creeds and practices , and he 18:12 refuted all opponents with his healing power . Human reconciliation The atonement of Christ reconciles man to God , not God to man ; for the divine Principle of Christ is God , 18:15 and how can God propitiate Himself ? Christ is Truth , which reaches no higher than itself . The fountain can rise no higher than its source . Christ , 18:18 Truth , could conciliate no nature above his own , derived 19:1 from the eternal Love . It was therefore Christ 's purpose to reconcile man to God , not God to man . Love and 19:3 Truth are not at war with God 's image and likeness . Man can not exceed divine Love , and so atone for him-self . Even Christ can not reconcile Truth to error @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aided in recon-ciling man to God by giving man a truer sense of Love , the divine Principle of Jesus ' teachings , and this truer 19:9 sense of Love redeems man from the law of matter , sin , and death by the law of Spirit , - the law of divine Love . 19:12 The Master forbore not to speak the whole truth , declaring precisely what would destroy sickness , sin , and death , although his teaching set households at variance , 19:15 and brought to material beliefs not peace , but a sword . Efficacious repentance Every pang of repentance and suffering , every effort 19:18 for reform , every good thought and deed , will help us to understand Jesus ' atonement for sin and aid its efficacy ; but if the sinner continues to pray 19:21 and repent , sin and be sorry , he has little part in the atone-ment , - in the at-one-ment with God , - for he lacks the practical repentance , which reforms the heart and enables 19:24 man to do the will of wisdom . Those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divine Principle of the teach-ings and practice of our Master have no part in God . If 19:27 living in disobedience to Him , we ought to feel no secur-ity , although God is good . Jesus ' sinless career Jesus urged the commandment , " Thou shalt have no 19:30 other gods before me , " which may be ren-dered : Thou shalt have no belief of Life as mortal ; thou shalt not know evil , for there is one Life , - 20:1 even God , good . He rendered " unto Caesar the things which are Caesar 's ; and unto God the things that are 20:3 God 's . " He at last paid no homage to forms of doctrine or to theories of man , but acted and spake as he was moved , not by spirits but by Spirit . 20:6 To the ritualistic priest and hypocritical Pharisee Jesus said , " The publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you . " Jesus ' history made a 20:9 new calendar , which we call the Christian era ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be baptized , partake of the Eucharist , support the 20:12 clergy , observe the Sabbath , make long prayers , and yet be sensual and sinful . Perfect example Jesus bore our infirmities ; he knew the error of mortal 20:15 belief , and " with his stripes the rejection of error we are healed . " " Despised and rejected of men , " returning blessing for cursing , he taught mor-20:18 tals the opposite of themselves , even the nature of God ; and when error felt the power of Truth , the scourge and the cross awaited the great Teacher . Yet he swerved not , 20:21 well knowing that to obey the divine order and trust God , saves retracing and traversing anew the path from sin to holiness . Behest of the cross 20:24 Material belief is slow to acknowledge what the spiritual fact implies . The truth is the centre of all religion . It commands sure entrance into 20:27 the realm of Love . St. Paul wrote , " Let us lay aside every weight , and the sin which doth so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the race that 20:30 is set before us ; " that is , let us put aside material self and sense , and seek the divine Principle and Science of all healing . Moral victory 21:1 If Truth is overcoming error in your daily walk and conversation , you can finally say , " I have fought a 21:3 good fight . . . I have kept the faith , " be-cause you are a better man . This is having our part in the at-one-ment with Truth and Love . 21:6 Christians do not continue to labor and pray , expecting because of another 's goodness , suffering , and triumph , that they shall reach his harmony and reward . 21:9 If the disciple is advancing spiritually , he is striv-ing to enter in . He constantly turns away from ma-terial sense , and looks towards the imperishable things 21:12 of Spirit . If honest , he will be in earnest from the start , and gain a little each day in the right direction , till at last he finishes his course with joy . Inharmonious travellers 21:15 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am en route for California , we are not journeying together . We have separate time-tables to consult , 21:18 different routes to pursue . Our paths have diverged at the very outset , and we have little oppor-tunity to help each other . On the contrary , if my 21:21 friends pursue my course , we have the same railroad guides , and our mutual interests are identical ; or , if I take up their line of travel , they help me on , and our 21:24 companionship may continue . Zigzag course Being in sympathy with matter , the worldly man is at the beck and call of error , and will be attracted thither-21:27 ward . He is like a traveller going westward for a pleasure-trip . The company is alluring and the pleasures exciting . After following the sun for 21:30 six days , he turns east on the seventh , satisfied if he can only imagine himself drifting in the right direction . By-and-by , ashamed of his zigzag course , he would borrow 22:1 the passport of some wiser pilgrim , thinking with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Moral retrogression 22:3 Vibrating like a pendulum between sin and the hope of forgiveness , - selfishness and sensuality causing con-stant retrogression , - our moral progress will 22:6 be slow . Waking to Christ 's demand , mortals experience suffering . This causes them , even as drown-ing men , to make vigorous efforts to save themselves ; and 22:9 through Christ 's precious love these efforts are crowned with success . Wait for reward " Work out your own salvation , " is the demand of 22:12 Life and Love , for to this end God worketh with you . " Occupy till I come ! " Wait for your re-ward , and " be not weary in well doing . " If 22:15 your endeavors are beset by fearful odds , and you receive no present reward , go not back to error , nor become a sluggard in the race . 22:18 When the smoke of battle clears away , you will dis-cern the good you have done , and receive according to your deserving . Love is not hasty to deliver us from 22:21 temptation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purified . Deliverance not vicarious Final deliverance from error , whereby we rejoice in 22:24 immortality , boundless freedom , and sinless sense , is not reached through paths of flowers nor by pinning one 's faith without works to another 's vicarious 22:27 effort . Whosoever believeth that wrath is righteous or that divinity is appeased by human suffering , does not understand God . Justice and substitution 22:30 Justice requires reformation of the sinner . Mercy cancels the debt only when justice approves . Revenge is inadmissible . Wrath which is only appeased is not 23:1 destroyed , but partially indulged . Wisdom and Love may require many sacrifices of self to save us from sin . 23:3 One sacrifice , however great , is insufficient to pay the debt of sin . The atonement requires constant self-immolation on the sinner 's part . That 23:6 God 's wrath should be vented upon His beloved Son , is divinely unnatural . Such a theory is man-made . The atonement is a hard problem in theology , but its scien-23:9 tific explanation is , that suffering is an error of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sin and suf-fering will fall at the feet of everlasting Love . Doctrines and faith 23:12 Rabbinical lore said : " He that taketh one doctrine , firm in faith , has the Holy Ghost dwelling in him . " This preaching receives a strong rebuke in 23:15 the Scripture , " Faith without works is dead . " Faith , if it be mere belief , is as a pendulum swinging be-tween nothing and something , having no fixity . Faith , 23:18 advanced to spiritual understanding , is the evidence gained from Spirit , which rebukes sin of every kind and estab-lishes the claims of God . Self-reliance and confidence 23:21 In Hebrew , Greek , Latin , and English , faith and the words corresponding thereto have these two defini-tions , trustfulness and trustworthiness . One 23:24 kind of faith trusts one 's welfare to others . Another kind of faith understands divine Love and how to work out one 's " own salvation , with fear and trem-23:27 bling . " " Lord , I believe ; help thou mine unbelief ! " expresses the helplessness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . and thou shalt be saved ! " 23:30 demands self-reliant trustworthiness , which includes spiritual understanding and confides all to God . The Hebrew verb to believe means also to be firm or 24:1 to be constant . This certainly applies to Truth and Love understood and practised . Firmness in error will never 24:3 save from sin , disease , and death . Life 's healing currents Acquaintance with the original texts , and willingness to give up human beliefs ( established by hierarchies , and 24:6 instigated sometimes by the worst passions of men ) , open the way for Christian Science to be understood , and make the Bible the chart of life , where 24:9 the buoys and healing currents of Truth are pointed out . Radical changes He to whom " the arm of the Lord " is revealed will 24:12 believe our report , and rise into newness of life with re-generation . This is having part in the atone-ment ; this is the understanding , in which 24:15 Jesus suffered and triumphed . The time is not distant when the ordinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - a change as radical as that 24:18 which has come over popular opinions in regard to pre-destination and future punishment . Purpose of crucifixion Does erudite theology regard the crucifixion of Jesus 24:21 chiefly as providing a ready pardon for all sinners who ask for it and are willing to be forgiven ? Does spiritualism find Jesus ' death necessary 24:24 only for the presentation , after death , of the material Jesus , as a proof that spirits can return to earth ? Then we must differ from them both . 24:27 The efficacy of the crucifixion lay in the practical af-fection and goodness it demonstrated for mankind . The truth had been lived among men ; but until they saw that 24:30 it enabled their Master to triumph over the grave , his own disciples could not admit such an event to be possible . After the resurrection , even the unbelieving Thomas was 25:1 forced to acknowledge how complete was the great proof of Truth and Love . True flesh and blood 25:3 The spiritual essence of blood is sacrifice . The effi-cacy of Jesus ' spiritual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense of human 25:6 blood . The material blood of Jesus was no more efficacious to cleanse from sin when it was shed upon " the accursed tree , " than when it was flowing in 25:9 his veins as he went daily about his Father 's business . His true flesh and blood were his Life ; and they truly eat his flesh and drink his blood , who partake of that divine 25:12 Life . Effective triumph Jesus taught the way of Life by demonstration , that we may understand how this divine Principle heals 25:15 the sick , casts out error , and triumphs over death . Jesus presented the ideal of God better than could any man whose origin was less spiritual . By 25:18 his obedience to God , he demonstrated more spiritu-ally than all others the Principle of being . Hence the force of his admonition , " If ye love me , keep my com-25:21 mandments . " Though demonstrating his control over sin and disease , the great Teacher by no means relieved others from giving 25:24 the requisite proofs of their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might demonstrate this power as he did and understand its divine Principle . Implicit faith 25:27 in the Teacher and all the emotional love we can bestow on him , will never alone make us imitators of him . We must go and do likewise , else we are not improving the 25:30 great blessings which our Master worked and suffered to bestow upon us . The divinity of the Christ was made manifest in the humanity of Jesus . Individual experience 26:1 While we adore Jesus , and the heart overflows with gratitude for what he did for mortals , - treading alone 26:3 his loving pathway up to the throne of glory , in speechless agony exploring the way for us , - yet Jesus spares us not one individual expe-26:6 rience , if we follow his commands faithfully ; and all have the cup of sorrowful effort to drink in proportion to their demonstration of his love , till all are redeemed 26:9 through divine Love . Christ 's demonstration The Christ was the Spirit which Jesus implied in his own statements : " I am the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I and my Father are one . " This Christ , or divinity of the man Jesus , was his divine nature , the godliness which animated him . Divine Truth , 26:15 Life , and Love gave Jesus authority over sin , sickness , and death . His mission was to reveal the Science of celestial being , to prove what God is and what He does 26:18 for man . Proof in practice A musician demonstrates the beauty of the music he teaches in order to show the learner the way by prac-26:21 tice as well as precept . Jesus ' teaching and practice of Truth involved such a sacrifice as makes us admit its Principle to be Love . This was 26:24 the precious import of our Master 's sinless career and of his demonstration of power over death . He proved by his deeds that Christian Science destroys sickness , sin , 26:27 and death . Our Master taught no mere theory , doctrine , or belief . It was the divine Principle of all real being which he 26:30 taught and practised . His proof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worship , but Christian Science , working out the harmony of Life and Love . 27:1 Jesus sent a message to John the Baptist , which was in-tended to prove beyond a question that the Christ had 27:3 come : " Go your way , and tell John what things ye have seen and heard ; how that the blind see , the lame walk , the lepers are cleansed , the deaf hear , the dead are raised , 27:6 to the poor the gospel is preached . " In other words : Tell John what the demonstration of divine power is , and he will at once perceive that God is the power in 27:9 the Messianic work . Living temple That Life is God , Jesus proved by his reappearance after the crucifixion in strict accordance with his scien-27:12 tific statement : " Destroy this temple body , and in three days I Spirit will raise it up . " It is as if he had said : The I - the Life , substance , 27:15 and intelligence of the universe - is not in matter to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mingling with 27:18 sin and death . He laid the axe of Science at the root of material knowledge , that it might be ready to cut down the false doctrine of pantheism , - that God , or 27:21 Life , is in or of matter . Recreant disciples Jesus sent forth seventy students at one time , but only eleven left a desirable historic record . Tradition credits 27:24 him with two or three hundred other disciples who have left no name . " Many are called , but few are chosen . " They fell away from grace because 27:27 they never truly understood their Master 's instruction . Why do those who profess to follow Christ reject the essential religion he came to establish ? Jesus ' persecu-27:30 tors made their strongest attack upon this very point . They endeavored to hold him at the mercy of matter and to kill him according to certain assumed material laws . Help and hindrance 28:1 The Pharisees claimed to know and to teach the di-vine will , but they only hindered the success of Jesus ' 28:3 mission . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If the Master had not taken a student and taught the unseen verities of God , he would 28:6 not have been crucified . The determination to hold Spirit in the grasp of matter is the persecutor of Truth and Love . 28:9 While respecting all that is good in the Church or out of it , one 's consecration to Christ is more on the ground of demonstration than of profession . In conscience , we 28:12 can not hold to beliefs outgrown ; and by understanding more of the divine Principle of the deathless Christ , we are enabled to heal the sick and to triumph over sin . Misleading conceptions 28:15 Neither the origin , the character , nor the work of Jesus was generally understood . Not a single compo-nent part of his nature did the material 28:18 world measure aright . Even his righteous-less and purity did not hinder men from saying : He is a glutton and a friend of the impure , and Beelzebub is 28:21 his patron . Persecution prolonged Remember , thou Christian martyr , it is enough if thou art found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet ! To suppose that persecution for righteousness ' sake belongs to the past , and that Christianity to-day is at peace with the world 28:27 because it is honored by sects and societies , is to mis-take the very nature of religion . Error repeats itself . The trials encountered by prophet , disciple , and apostle , 28:30 " of whom the world was not worthy , " await , in some form , every pioneer of truth . Christian warfare There is too much animal courage in society and not 29:1 sufficient moral courage . Christians must take up arms against error at home and abroad . They must grapple 29:3 with sin in themselves and in others , and continue this warfare until they have finished their course . If they keep the faith , they will have the 29:6 crown of rejoicing . Christian experience teaches faith in the right and dis-belief in the wrong . It bids us work the more earnestly 29:9 in times of persecution , because then our labor is more needed . Great is the reward of self-sacrifice , though we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of God 29:12 There is a tradition that Publius Lentulus wrote to the authorities at Rome : " The disciples of Jesus be-lieve him the Son of God . " Those instructed 29:15 in Christian Science have reached the glori-ous perception that God is the only author of man . The Virgin-mother conceived this idea of God , and 29:18 gave to her ideal the name of Jesus - that is , Joshua , or Saviour . Spiritual conception The illumination of Mary 's spiritual sense put to 29:21 silence material law and its order of generation , and brought forth her child by the revelation of Truth , demonstrating God as the Father of 29:24 men . The Holy Ghost , or divine Spirit , overshadowed the pure sense of the Virgin-mother with the full recog-nition that being is Spirit . The Christ dwelt forever 29:27 an idea in the bosom of God , the divine Principle of the man Jesus , and woman perceived this spiritual idea , though at first faintly developed . 29:30 Man as the offspring of God , as the idea of Spirit , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jesus was the offspring of Mary 's self-30:1 conscious communion with God . Hence he could give a more spiritual idea of life than other men , and could 30:3 demonstrate the Science of Love - his Father or divine Principle . Jesus the way-shower Born of a woman , Jesus ' advent in the flesh partook 30:6 partly of Mary 's earthly condition , although he was en-dowed with the Christ , the divine Spirit , with-out measure . This accounts for his struggles 30:9 in Gethsemane and on Calvary , and this enabled him to be the mediator , or way-shower , between God and men . Had his origin and birth been wholly apart from mortal 30:12 usage , Jesus would not have been appreciable to mortal mind as " the way . " Rabbi and priest taught the Mosaic law , which said : 30:15 " An eye for an eye , " and " Whoso sheddeth man 's blood , by man shall his blood be shed . " Not so did Jesus , the new executor for God , present the divine law of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Rebukes helpful As the individual ideal of Truth , Christ Jesus came to rebuke rabbinical error and all sin , sickness , and death , - 30:21 to point out the way of Truth and Life . This ideal was demonstrated throughout the whole earthly career of Jesus , showing the difference between 30:24 the offspring of Soul and of material sense , of Truth and of error . If we have triumphed sufficiently over the errors of 30:27 material sense to allow Soul to hold the control , we shall loathe sin and rebuke it under every mask . Only in this way can we bless our enemies , though they 30:30 may not so construe our words . We can not choose for ourselves , but must work out our salvation in the way Jesus taught . In meekness and might , he was found 31:1 preaching the gospel to the poor . Pride and fear are unfit to bear the standard of Truth , and God will never place 31:3 it in such hands . Fleshly ties temporal Jesus acknowledged no ties of the flesh . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth : for one is your Father , 31:6 which is in heaven . " Again he asked : " Who is my mother , and who are my brethren , " im-plying that it is they who do the will of his Father . We 31:9 have no record of his calling any man by the name of father . He recognized Spirit , God , as the only creator , and therefore as the Father of all . Healing primary 31:12 First in the list of Christian duties , he taught his fol-lowers the healing power of Truth and Love . He attached no importance to dead ceremonies . It is the 31:15 living Christ , the practical Truth , which makes Jesus " the resurrection and the life " to all who follow him in deed . Obeying his precious precepts , - following his 31:18 demonstration so far as we apprehend it , - we drink of his cup , partake of his bread , are baptized with his pu-rity ; and at last we shall rest , sit down with him , in a full 31:21 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For what says Paul ? " As often as ye eat this bread , and drink this cup , ye do show the Lord 's 31:24 death till he come . " Painful prospect Referring to the materiality of the age , Jesus said : " The hour cometh , and now is , when the true wor-31:27 shippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth . " Again , foreseeing the perse-cution which would attend the Science of Spirit , Jesus 31:30 said : " They shall put you out of the synagogues ; yea , the time cometh , that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service ; and these things will they 32:1 do unto you , because they have not known the Father nor me . " Sacred sacrament 32:3 In ancient Rome a soldier was required to swear allegiance to his general . The Latin word for this oath was sacramentum , and our English word 32:6 sacrament is derived from it . Among the Jews it was an ancient custom for the master of a feast to pass each guest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not commemorate a Roman soldier 's oath , nor was the wine , used on convivial occasions and in Jewish rites , the cup of our Lord . The cup shows 32:12 forth his bitter experience , - the cup which he prayed might pass from him , though he bowed in holy submis-sion to the divine decree . 32:15 " As they were eating , Jesus took bread , and blessed it and brake it , and gave it to the disciples , and said , Take , eat ; this is my body . And he took the cup , and 32:18 gave thanks , and gave it to them saying , Drink ye all of it . " Spiritual refreshment The true sense is spiritually lost , if the sacrament is 32:21 confined to the use of bread and wine . The disciples had eaten , yet Jesus prayed and gave them bread . This would have been foolish in a 32:24 literal sense ; but in its spiritual signification , it was nat-ural and beautiful . Jesus prayed ; he withdrew from the material senses to refresh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jesus ' sad repast The Passover , which Jesus ate with his disciples in the month Nisan on the night before his crucifixion , 32:30 was a mournful occasion , a sad supper taken at the close of day , in the twilight of a glorious career with shadows fast falling around ; and 33:1 this supper closed forever Jesus ' ritualism or concessions to matter . Heavenly supplies 33:3 His followers , sorrowful and silent , anticipating the hour of their Master 's betrayal , partook of the heavenly manna , which of old had fed in the wilderness the 33:6 persecuted followers of Truth . Their bread indeed came down from heaven . It was the great truth of spiritual being , healing the sick and casting out error . 33:9 Their Master had explained it all before , and now this bread was feeding and sustaining them . They had borne this bread from house to house , breaking ( explaining ) it to 33:12 others , and now it comforted themselves . For this truth of spiritual being , their Master was about to suffer violence and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He must leave them . With the great glory of an everlast-ing victory overshadowing him , he gave thanks and said , " Drink ye all of it . " The holy struggle 33:18 When the human element in him struggled with the divine , our great Teacher said : " Not my will , but Thine , be done ! " - that is , Let not the flesh , 33:21 but the Spirit , be represented in me . This is the new understanding of spiritual Love . It gives all for Christ , or Truth . It blesses its enemies , heals the 33:24 sick , casts out error , raises the dead from trespasses and sins , and preaches the gospel to the poor , the meek in heart . Incisive questions 33:27 Christians , are you drinking his cup ? Have you shared the blood of the New Covenant , the persecutions which attend a new and higher understand-33:30 ing of God ? If not , can you then say that you have commemorated Jesus in his cup ? Are all who eat bread and drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his cup , take his cross , and leave all for the Christ-principle ? Then why ascribe this inspira-34:3 tion to a dead rite , instead of showing , by casting out error and making the body " holy , acceptable unto God , " that Truth has come to the understanding ? If Christ , 34:6 Truth , has come to us in demonstration , no other com-memoration is requisite , for demonstration is Immanuel , or God with us ; and if a friend be with us , why need we 34:9 memorials of that friend ? Millennial glory If all who ever partook of the sacrament had really commemorated the sufferings of Jesus and drunk of 34:12 his cup , they would have revolutionized the world . If all who seek his commemoration through material symbols will take up the cross , heal 34:15 the sick , cast out evils , and preach Christ , or Truth , to the poor , - the receptive thought , - they will bring in the millennium . Fellowship with Christ 34:18 Through all the disciples experienced , they became more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His resurrection was also their resur-34:21 rection . It helped them to raise themselves and others from spiritual dulness and blind belief in God into the perception of infinite possibilities . They needed this 34:24 quickening , for soon their dear Master would rise again in the spiritual realm of reality , and ascend far above their apprehension . As the reward for his faithfulness , 34:27 he would disappear to material sense in that change which has since been called the ascension . The last breakfast What a contrast between our Lord 's last supper and 34:30 his last spiritual breakfast with his disciples in the bright morning hours at the joyful meeting on the shore of the Galilean Sea ! His gloom 35:1 had passed into glory , and His disciples ' grief into repent-ance , - hearts chastened and pride rebuked . Convinced 35:3 of the fruitlessness of their toil in the dark and wakened by their Master 's voice , they changed their methods , turned away from material things , and cast their net on the right 35:6 side . Discerning Christ , Truth , anew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rise somewhat from mortal sensuousness , or the burial of mind in matter , into new-35:9 ness of life as Spirit . This spiritual meeting with our Lord in the dawn of a new light is the morning meal which Christian Scientists 35:12 commemorate . They bow before Christ , Truth , to re-ceive more of his reappearing and silently to commune with the divine Principle , Love . They celebrate their 35:15 Lord 's victory over death , his probation in the flesh after death , its exemplification of human probation , and his spiritual and final ascension above matter , or the flesh , 35:18 when he rose out of material sight . Spiritual Eucharist Our baptism is a purification from all error . Our church is built on the divine Principle , Love . We can 35:21 unite with this church only as we are new-born of Spirit , as we reach the Life which is Truth and the Truth which is Life by bringing forth 35:24 the fruits of Love , - casting out error and healing the sick . Our Eucharist is spiritual communion with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from heaven , " 35:27 is Truth . Our cup is the cross . Our wine the inspira-tion of Love , the draught our Master drank and com-mended to his followers . Final purpose 35:30 The design of Love is to reform the sinner . If the sinner 's punishment here has been insufficient to re-form him , the good man 's heaven would be a hell to 36:1 the sinner . They , who know not purity and affection by experience , can never find bliss in the blessed company of 36:3 Truth and Love simply through translation into another sphere . Divine Science reveals the necessity of sufficient suffering , either before or after 36:6 death , to quench the love of sin . To remit the penalty due for sin , would be for Truth to pardon error . Escape from punishment is not in accordance with God 's govern-36:9 ment , since justice is the handmaid of mercy . Jesus endured the shame , that he might pour his dear-bought bounty into barren lives . What was his 36:12 earthly reward ? He was forsaken by all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women who bowed in silent woe beneath the shadow of his cross . The earthly 36:15 price of spirituality in a material age and the great moral distance between Christianity and sensualism preclude Christian Science from finding favor with the worldly-36:18 minded . Righteous retribution A selfish and limited mind may be unjust , but the un-limited and divine Mind is the immortal law of justice as 36:21 well as of mercy . It is quite as impossible for sinners to receive their full punishment this side of the grave as for this world to bestow on the right-36:24 eous their full reward . It is useless to suppose that the wicked can gloat over their offences to the last moment and then be suddenly pardoned and pushed into heaven , 36:27 or that the hand of Love is satisfied with giving us only toil , sacrifice , cross-bearing , multiplied trials , and mock-ery of our motives in return for our efforts at well doing . Vicarious suffering 36:30 Religious history repeats itself in the suf-fering of the just for the unjust . Can God therefore overlook the law of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not Science show that sin brings suffering as much to-day as yesterday ? They 37:3 who sin must suffer . " With what measure ye mete , it shall be measured to you again . " Martyrs inevitable History is full of records of suffering . " The blood of 37:6 the martyrs is the seed of the Church . " Mortals try in vain to slay Truth with the steel or the stake , but error falls only before the sword of Spirit . 37:9 Martyrs are the human links which connect one stage with another in the history of religion . They are earth 's lumi-naries , which serve to cleanse and rarefy the atmosphere of 37:12 material sense and to permeate humanity with purer ideals . Consciousness of right-doing brings its own reward ; but not amid the smoke of battle is merit seen and appreciated 37:15 by lookers-on . Complete emulation When will Jesus ' professed followers learn to emulate him in all his ways and to imitate his mighty works ? 37:18 Those who procured the martyrdom of that righteous man would gladly have turned his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Christians of to-day take up the more practical im-port of that career ! It is possible , - yea , it is the duty and privilege of every child , man , and woman , - to follow 37:24 in some degree the example of the Master by the demonstration of Truth and Life , of health and holiness . Chris-tians claim to be his followers , but do they follow him in 37:27 the way that he commanded ? Hear these imperative com-mands : " Be ye therefore perfect , even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect ! " " Go ye into all the world , 37:30 and preach the gospel to every creature ! " " Heal the sick ! " Jesus ' teaching belittled Why has this Christian demand so little inspiration 38:1 to stir mankind to Christian effort ? Because men are assured that this command was intended only for a par-38:3 ticular period and for a select number of fol-lowers . This teaching is even more pernicious than the old doctrine of foreordination , - the election of a 38:6 few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so it will be considered , when the lethargy of mortals , produced by man-made doctrines , is broken by the demands of 38:9 divine Science . Jesus said : " These signs shall follow them that be-lieve ; . . . they shall lay hands on the sick , and they 38:12 shall recover . " Who believes him ? He was addressing his disciples , yet he did not say , " These signs shall follow you , " but them- " them that believe " in all time to come . 38:15 Here the word hands is used metaphorically , as in the text , " The right hand of the Lord is exalted . " It expresses spiritual power ; otherwise the healing could not have 38:18 been done spiritually . At another time Jesus prayed , not for the twelve only , but for as many as should believe " through their word . " Material pleasures 38:21 Jesus experienced few of the pleasures of the physical senses , but his sufferings were the fruits of other peo-ple 's sins , not of his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never suffered . Jesus mapped out the path for others . He unveiled the Christ , the spiritual idea of divine Love . To those buried in the 38:27 belief of sin and self , living only for pleasure or the grati-fication of the senses , he said in substance : Having eyes ye see not , and having ears ye hear not ; lest ye should un-38:30 derstand and be converted , and I might heal you . He taught that the material senses shut out Truth and its healing power . Mockery of truth 39:1 Meekly our Master met the mockery of his unrecog-nized grandeur . Such indignities as he received , his fol-39:3 lowers will endure until Christianity 's last triumph . He won eternal honors . He over-came the world , the flesh , and all error , thus proving 39:6 their nothingness . He wrought a full salvation from sin , sickness , and death . We need " Christ , and him cruci-fied . " We must have trials and self-denials , as well as 39:9 joys and victories , until all error is destroyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the body causes mortals to regard death as a friend , as a stepping-stone 39:12 out of mortality into immortality and bliss . The Bible calls death an enemy , and Jesus overcame death and the grave instead of yielding to them . 39:15 He was " the way . " To him , therefore , death was not the threshold over which he must pass into living glory . Present salvation 39:18 " Now , " cried the apostle , " is the accepted time ; be-hold , now is the day of salvation , " - meaning , not that now men must prepare for a future-world salva-39:21 tion , or safety , but that now is the time in which to experience that salvation in spirit and in life . Now is the time for so-called material pains and material pleas-39:24 ures to pass away , for both are unreal , because impossible in Science . To break this earthly spell , mortals must get the true idea and divine Principle of all that really exists 39:27 and governs the universe harmoniously . This thought is apprehended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with doubts and defeats as well as 39:30 triumphs . Sin and penalty Who will stop the practice of sin so long as he believes in the pleasures of sin ? When mortals once admit that 40:1 evil confers no pleasure , they turn from it . Remove error from thought , and it will not appear in effect . The ad-40:3 vanced thinker and devout Christian , perceiv-ing the scope and tendency of Christian healing and its Science , will support them . Another will say : 40:6 " Go thy way for this time ; when I have a convenient season I will call for thee . " Divine Science adjusts the balance as Jesus adjusted 40:9 it . Science removes the penalty only by first removing the sin which incurs the penalty . This is my sense of divine pardon , which I understand to mean God 's method 40:12 of destroying sin . If the saying is true , " While there 's life there 's hope , " its opposite is also true , While there 's sin there 's doom . Another 's suffering can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Savonarola make the crimes of his implacable enemies less criminal ? Suffering inevitable Was it just for Jesus to suffer ? No ; but it was 40:18 inevitable , for not otherwise could he show us the way and the power of Truth . If a career so great and good as that of Jesus could not avert a 40:21 felon 's fate , lesser apostles of Truth may endure human brutality without murmuring , rejoicing to enter into fellowship with him through the triumphal arch of 40:24 Truth and Love . Service and worship Our heavenly Father , divine Love , demands that all men should follow the example of our Master and his 40:27 apostles and not merely worship his personal-ity . It is sad that the phrase divine service has come so generally to mean public worship instead of 40:30 daily deeds . Within the veil The nature of Christianity is peaceful and blessed , but in order to enter into the kingdom , the anchor of 41:1 hope must be cast beyond the veil of matter into the Shekinah into which Jesus has passed before us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the joys and triumphs of the right-eous as well as through their sorrows and afflictions. 41:6 Like our Master , we must depart from material sense into the spiritual sense of being . The thorns and flowers The God-inspired walk calmly on though it be with 41:9 bleeding footprints , and in the hereafter they will reap what they now sow . The pampered hypo-crite may have a flowery pathway here , but 41:12 he can not forever break the Golden Rule and escape the penalty due . Healing early lost The proofs of Truth , Life , and Love , which Jesus gave 41:15 by casting out error and healing the sick , completed his earthly mission ; but in the Christian Church this demonstration of healing was early lost , 41:18 about three centuries after the crucifixion . No ancient school of philosophy , materia medica , or scholastic theol-ogy ever taught or demonstrated the divine healing of 41:21 absolute Science . Immortal achieval Jesus foresaw the reception Christian Science would have before it was understood , but this foreknowledge hindered 41:24 him not . He fulfilled his God-mission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Father . Persecuted from city to city , his apostles still went about 41:27 doing good deeds , for which they were maligned and stoned . The truth taught by Jesus , the elders scoffed at . Why ? Because it demanded more than they were willing 41:30 to practise . It was enough for them to believe in a national Deity ; but that belief , from their time to ours , has never made a disciple who could cast out evils and heal the sick . 42:1 Jesus ' life proved , divinely and scientifically , that God is Love , whereas priest and rabbi affirmed God to be a 42:3 mighty potentate , who loves and hates . The Jewish the-ology gave no hint of the unchanging love of God . A belief in death The universal belief in death is of no advantage . It 42:6 can not make Life or Truth apparent . Death will be found at length to be a mortal dream , which comes in darkness and disappears with the light . Cruel desertion 42:9 The " man of sorrows " was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the homage of the world and endorsed pre-eminently by the approval 42:12 of God , his brief triumphal entry into Jerusa-lem was followed by the desertion of all save a few friends , who sadly followed him to the foot of the cross . Death outdone 42:15 The resurrection of the great demonstrator of God 's power was the proof of his final triumph over body and matter , and gave full evidence of divine 42:18 Science , - evidence so important to mortals . The belief that man has existence or mind separate from God is a dying error . This error Jesus met with divine 42:21 Science and proved its nothingness . Because of the won-drous glory which God bestowed on His anointed , temp-tation , sin , sickness , and death had no terror for Jesus . 42:24 Let men think they had killed the body ! Afterwards he would show it to them unchanged . This demonstrates that in Christian Science the true man is governed by 42:27 God - by good , not evil - and is therefore not a mortal but an immortal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was here to enable them to 42:30 test his still uncomprehended saying , " He that believ-eth on me , the works that I do shall he do also . " They must understand more fully his Life-principle by casting 43:1 out error , healing the sick , and raising the dead , even as they did understand it after his bodily departure . Pentecost repeated 43:3 The magnitude of Jesus ' work , his material disappear-ance before their eyes and his reappearance , all enabled the disciples to understand what Jesus had 43:6 said . Heretofore they had only believed ; now they understood . The advent of this understanding is what is meant by the descent of the Holy Ghost , - that 43:9 influx of divine Science which so illuminated the Pentecos-tal Day and is now repeating its ancient history . Convincing evidence Jesus ' last proof was the highest , the most convincing , 43:12 the most profitable to his students . The malignity of brutal persecutors , the treason and suicide of his betrayer , were overruled by divine Love to 43:15 the glorification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which Jesus ' persecutors had mocked and tried to slay . The final demonstration of the truth which Jesus taught , 43:18 and for which he was crucified , opened a new era for the world . Those who slew him to stay his influence perpetu-ated and extended it . Divine victory 43:21 Jesus rose higher in demonstration because of the cup of bitterness he drank . Human law had condemned him , but he was demonstrating divine Science . 43:24 Out of reach of the barbarity of his enemies , he was acting under spiritual law in defiance of mat-ter and mortality , and that spiritual law sustained him . 43:27 The divine must overcome the human at every point . The Science Jesus taught and lived must triumph over all material beliefs about life , substance , and intelli-43:30 gence , and the multitudinous errors growing from such beliefs . Love must triumph over hate . Truth and Life must 44:1 seal the victory over error and death , before the thorns can be laid aside for a crown , the benediction follow , 44:3 " Well done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Spirit be demonstrated . Jesus in the tomb The lonely precincts of the tomb gave Jesus a refuge 44:6 from his foes , a place in which to solve the great problem of being . His three days ' work in the sepulchre set the seal of eternity on time . 44:9 He proved Life to be deathless and Love to be the mas-ter of hate . He met and mastered on the basis of Chris-tian Science , the power of Mind over matter , all the claims 44:12 of medicine , surgery , and hygiene . He took no drugs to allay inflammation . He did not depend upon food or pure air to resuscitate wasted 44:15 energies . He did not require the skill of a surgeon to heal the torn palms and bind up the wounded side and lacerated feet , that he might use those hands to remove 44:18 the napkin and winding-sheet , and that he might employ his feet as before . The deific naturalism Could it be called supernatural for the God of nature 44:21 to sustain Jesus in his proof of man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surgery beyond material art , but it was not a supernatural act . On 44:24 the contrary , it was a divinely natural act , whereby divinity brought to humanity the understanding of the Christ-healing and revealed a method infinitely above that of 44:27 human invention . Obstacles overcome His disciples believed Jesus to be dead while he was hidden in the sepulchre , whereas he was alive , demon-44:30 strating within the narrow tomb the power of Spirit to overrule mortal , material sense . There were rock-ribbed walls in the way , and a great 45:1 stone must be rolled from the cave 's mouth ; but Jesus vanquished every material obstacle , overcame every law 45:3 of matter , and stepped forth from his gloomy resting-place , crowned with the glory of a sublime success , an everlasting victory . Victory over the grave 45:6 Our Master fully and finally demonstrated divine Sci-ence in his victory over death and the grave . Jesus ' deed was for the enlightenment of men and 45:9 for the salvation of the whole world from sin , sickness , and death . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemies , we were reconciled to God by the seeming death 45:12 of His Son , much more , being reconciled , we shall be saved by his life . " Three days after his bodily burial he talked with his disciples . The persecutors had failed to hide im-45:15 mortal Truth and Love in a sepulchre . The stone rolled away Glory be to God , and peace to the struggling hearts ! Christ hath rolled away the stone from the door of hu-45:18 man hope and faith , and through the reve-lation and demonstration of life in God , hath elevated them to possible at-one-ment with the spiritual 45:21 idea of man and his divine Principle , Love . After the resurrection They who earliest saw Jesus after the resurrection and beheld the final proof of all that he had taught , 45:24 misconstrued that event . Even his disciples at first called him a spirit , ghost , or spectre , for they believed his body to be dead . His reply was : 45:27 " Spirit hath not flesh and bones , as ye see me have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a spirit . He presented the same body that he had before his cru-45:30 cifixion , and so glorified the supremacy of Mind over matter . Jesus ' students , not sufficiently advanced fully to un-46:1 derstand their Master 's triumph , did not perform many wonderful works , until they saw him after his crucifixion 46:3 and learned that he had not died . This convinced them of the truthfulness of all that he had taught . Spiritual interpretation In the walk to Emmaus , Jesus was known to his friends 46:6 by the words , which made their hearts burn within them , and by the breaking of bread . The divine Spirit , which identified Jesus thus centuries 46:9 ago , has spoken through the inspired Word and will speak through it in every age and clime . It is revealed to the receptive heart , and is again seen casting out evil and 46:12 healing the sick . Corporeality and Spirit The Master said plainly that physique was not Spirit , and after his resurrection he proved to the physical senses 46:15 that his body was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in other words , rose even higher in the understanding of Spirit , God . To convince 46:18 Thomas of this , Jesus caused him to examine the nail-prints and the spear-wound . Spiritual ascension Jesus ' unchanged physical condition after what seemed 46:21 to be death was followed by his exaltation above all ma-terial conditions ; and this exaltation explained his ascension , and revealed unmistakably a 46:24 probationary and progressive state beyond the grave . Jesus was " the way ; " that is , he marked the way for all men . In his final demonstration , called the ascen-46:27 sion , which closed the earthly record of Jesus , he rose above the physical knowledge of his disciples , and the material senses saw him no more . Pentecostal power 46:30 His students then received the Holy Ghost . By this is meant , that by all they had witnessed and suffered , they were roused to an enlarged understanding of divine Sci-47:1 ence , even to the spiritual interpretation and discernment of Jesus ' teachings and demonstrations , which gave them 47:3 a faint conception of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man by material sense . After gaining the true idea of their glorified Master , 47:6 they became better healers , leaning no longer on matter , but on the divine Principle of their work . The influx of light was sudden . It was sometimes an overwhelming 47:9 power as on the Day of Pentecost . The traitor 's conspiracy Judas conspired against Jesus . The world 's ingratitude and hatred towards that just man effected his betrayal . 47:12 The traitor 's price was thirty pieces of silver and the smiles of the Pharisees . He chose his time , when the people were in doubt concerning Jesus ' 47:15 teachings . A period was approaching which would reveal the in-finite distance between Judas and his Master . Judas 47:18 Iscariot knew this . He knew that the great goodness of that Master placed a gulf between Jesus and his betrayer , and this spiritual distance inflamed Judas ' envy . The 47:21 greed for gold strengthened his ingratitude , and for a time quieted his remorse . He knew that the world generally loves a lie better than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jesus in order to raise himself in popular esti-mation . His dark plot fell to the ground , and the traitor fell with it . 47:27 The disciples ' desertion of their Master in his last earthly struggle was punished ; each one came to a vio-lent death except St. John , of whose death we have no 47:30 record . Gethsemane glorified During his night of gloom and glory in the garden , Jesus realized the utter error of a belief in any possi-48:1 ble material intelligence . The pangs of neglect and the staves of bigoted ignorance smote him sorely . His stu-48:3 dents slept . He said unto them : " Could ye not watch with me one hour ? " Could they not watch with him who , waiting and struggling in voice-48:6 less agony , held uncomplaining guard over a world ? There was no response to that human yearning , and so Jesus turned forever away from earth to heaven , from 48:9 sense to Soul . Remembering the sweat of agony which fell in holy benediction on the grass of Gethsemane , shall the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same cup , and think , or even wish , to escape the exalt-ing ordeal of sin 's revenge on its destroyer ? Truth and 48:15 Love bestow few palms until the consummation of a life-work . Defensive weapons Judas had the world 's weapons . Jesus had not one 48:18 of them , and chose not the world 's means of defence . " He opened not his mouth . " The great dem-onstrator of Truth and Love was silent before 48:21 envy and hate . Peter would have smitten the enemies of his Master , but Jesus forbade him , thus rebuking re-sentment or animal courage . He said : " Put up thy 48:24 sword . " Pilate 's question Pale in the presence of his own momentous question , " What is Truth , " Pilate was drawn into acquiescence 48:27 with the demands of Jesus ' enemies . Pilate was ignorant of the consequences of his awful decision against human rights and divine Love , knowing 48:30 not that he was hastening the final demonstration of what life is and of what the true knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the cross could have answered Pilate 's question . They knew what had inspired their devotion , 49:3 winged their faith , opened the eyes of their understand-ing , healed the sick , cast out evil , and caused the disciples to say to their Master : " Even the devils are subject 49:6 unto us through thy name . " Students ' ingratitude Where were the seventy whom Jesus sent forth ? Were all conspirators save eleven ? Had they forgotten the 49:9 great exponent of God ? Had they so soon lost sight of his mighty works , his toils , privations , sacrifices , his divine patience , sublime courage , and unre-49:12 quited affection ? O , why did they not gratify his last human yearning with one sign of fidelity ? Heaven 's sentinel The meek demonstrator of good , the highest instruc-49:15 tor and friend of man , met his earthly fate alone with God . No human eye was there to pity , no arm to save . Forsaken by all whom he had 49:18 blessed , this faithful sentinel of God at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trust of heaven , was ready to be transformed by the renewing 49:21 of the infinite Spirit . He was to prove that the Christ is not subject to material conditions , but is above the reach of human wrath , and is able , through Truth , 49:24 Life , and Love , to triumph over sin , sickness , death , and the grave . Cruel contumely The priests and rabbis , before whom he had meekly 49:27 walked , and those to whom he had given the highest proofs of divine power , mocked him on the cross , saying derisively , " He saved others ; 49:30 himself he can not save . " These scoffers , who turned " aside the right of a man before the face of the Most High , " esteemed Jesus as " stricken , smitten of God . " 50:1 " He is brought as a lamb to the slaughter , and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb , so he openeth not his mouth . " 50:3 " Who shall declare his generation ? " Who shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despair The last supreme moment of mockery , desertion , tor-50:6 ture , added to an overwhelming sense of the magnitude of his work , wrung from Jesus ' lips the awful cry , " My God , why hast Thou forsaken me ? " 50:9 This despairing appeal , if made to a human parent , would impugn the justice and love of a father who could with-hold a clear token of his presence to sustain and bless so 50:12 faithful a son . The appeal of Jesus was made both to his divine Principle , the God who is Love , and to himself , Love 's pure idea . Had Life , Truth , and Love forsaken 50:15 him in his highest demonstration ? This was a startling question . No ! They must abide in him and he in them , or that hour would be shorn of its mighty blessing for the 50:18 human race . Divine Science misunderstood If his full recognition of eternal Life had for a mo-ment given way before the evidence of the bodily senses , 50:21 what would his accusers have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jesus ' teachings were false , and that all evidence of their cor-50:24 rectness was destroyed by his death . But this saying could not make it so . The real pillory The burden of that hour was terrible beyond human 50:27 conception . The distrust of mortal minds , disbelieving the purpose of his mission , was a million times sharper than the thorns which pierced 50:30 his flesh . The real cross , which Jesus bore up the hill of grief , was the world 's hatred of Truth and Love . Not the spear nor the material cross wrung from his faithful 51:1 lips the plaintive cry , " Eloi , Eloi , lama sabachthani ? " It was the possible loss of something more important than 51:3 human life which moved him , - the possible misappre-hension of the sublimest influence of his career . This dread added the drop of gall to his cup . Life-power indestructible 51:6 Jesus could have withdrawn himself from his enemies . He had power to lay down a human sense of life for his spiritual identity in the likeness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the destruc-tion of the mortal body in order that he might furnish the proof of immortal life . Nothing could kill this Life 51:12 of man . Jesus could give his temporal life into his enemies ' hands ; but when his earth-mission was accom-plished , his spiritual life , indestructible and eternal , 51:15 was found forever the same . He knew that matter had no life and that real Life is God ; therefore he could no more be separated from his spiritual Life than God could 51:18 be extinguished . Example for our salvation His consummate example was for the salvation of us all , but only through doing the works which he did and 51:21 taught others to do . His purpose in healing was not alone to restore health , but to demon-strate his divine Principle . He was inspired by God , by 51:24 Truth and Love , in all that he said and did . The motives of his persecutors were pride , envy , cruelty , and vengeance , inflicted on the physical Jesus , but aimed at the divine Prin-51:27 ciple , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His spirituality separated him from sensuousness , and caused the selfish materialist 51:30 to hate him ; but it was this spirituality which enabled Jesus to heal the sick , cast out evil , and raise the dead . Master 's business 52:1 From early boyhood he was about his " Father 's busi-ness . " His pursuits lay far apart from theirs . His mas-52:3 ter was Spirit ; their master was matter . He served God ; they served mammon . His affec-tions were pure ; theirs were carnal . His senses drank in 52:6 the spiritual evidence of health , holiness , and life ; their senses testified oppositely , and absorbed the material evi-dence of sin , sickness , and death . Purity 's rebuke 52:9 Their imperfections and impurity felt the ever-present rebuke of his perfection and purity . Hence the world 's hatred of the just and perfect Jesus , and the 52:12 prophet 's foresight of the reception error would give him . " Despised and rejected of men , " was Isaiah 's graphic word concerning the coming Prince of Peace . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to unite in putting to shame and death the best man that ever trod the globe . To-day , as of old , error and evil again 52:18 make common cause against the exponents of truth . Saviour 's prediction The " man of sorrows " best understood the nothing-ness of material life and intelligence and the mighty ac-52:21 tuality of all-inclusive God , good . These were the two cardinal points of Mind-healing , or Christian Science , which armed him with Love . The high-52:24 est earthly representative of God , speaking of human ability to reflect divine power , prophetically said to his disciples , speaking not for their day only but for all time : 52:27 " He that believeth on me , the works that I do shall he do also ; " and " These signs shall follow them that believe . " Defamatory accusations The accusations of the Pharisees were as self-contra-52:30 dictory as their religion . The bigot , the deb-auchee , the hypocrite , called Jesus a glutton and a wine-bibber . They said : " He casteth out devils 53:1 through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sinners . " The latter accusation was true , but not in their 53:3 meaning . Jesus was no ascetic . He did not fast as did the Baptist 's disciples ; yet there never lived a man so far removed from appetites and passions as the Nazarene. 53:6 He rebuked sinners pointedly and unflinchingly , because he was their friend ; hence the cup he drank . Reputation and character The reputation of Jesus was the very opposite of his 53:9 character . Why ? Because the divine Principle and practice of Jesus were misunderstood . He was at work in divine Science . His words 53:12 and works were unknown to the world because above and contrary to the world 's religious sense . Mortals be-lieved in God as humanly mighty , rather than as divine , 53:15 infinite Love . Inspiring discontent The world could not interpret aright the discomfort which Jesus inspired and the spiritual blessings which 53:18 might flow from such discomfort . Science shows the cause of the shock so often pro-duced by the truth , - namely , that this shock arises from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Like Peter , we should weep over the warning , instead of denying the truth or mocking the lifelong sacrifice which 53:24 goodness makes for the destruction of evil . Bearing our sins Jesus bore our sins in his body . He knew the mortal errors which constitute the material body , and 53:27 could destroy those errors ; but at the time when Jesus felt our infirmities , he had not conquered all the beliefs of the flesh or his sense of ma-53:30 terial life , nor had he risen to his final demonstration of spiritual power . Had he shared the sinful beliefs of others , he would 54:1 have been less sensitive to those beliefs . Through the magnitude of his human life , he demonstrated the divine 54:3 Life . Out of the amplitude of his pure affection , he de-fined Love . With the affluence of Truth , he vanquished error . The world acknowledged not his righteousness , 54:6 seeing it not ; but earth received the harmony his glorified example introduced . Inspiration of sacrifice Who is ready to follow his teaching and example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christ , the true idea of God . That he might liberally pour his dear-bought treasures into empty or sin-54:12 filled human storehouses , was the inspiration of Jesus ' intense human sacrifice . In witness of his divine com-mission , he presented the proof that Life , Truth , and 54:15 Love heal the sick and the sinning , and triumph over death through Mind , not matter . This was the highest proof he could have offered of divine Love . His hearers 54:18 understood neither his words nor his works . They would not accept his meek interpretation of life nor follow his example . Spiritual friendship 54:21 His earthly cup of bitterness was drained to the dregs . There adhered to him only a few unpretentious friends , whose religion was something more 54:24 than a name . It was so vital , that it en-abled them to understand the Nazarene and to share the glory of eternal life . He said that those who fol-54:27 lowed him should drink of his cup , and history has con-firmed the prediction . Injustice to the Saviour If that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would not some , who now pro-fess to love him , reject him ? Would they not deny him even the rights of humanity , if he enter-55:1 tained any other sense of being and religion than theirs ? The advancing century , from a deadened sense of the 55:3 invisible God , to-day subjects to unchristian comment and usage the idea of Christian healing enjoined by Jesus ; but this does not affect the invincible facts . 55:6 Perhaps the early Christian era did Jesus no more injustice than the later centuries have bestowed upon the healing Christ and spiritual idea of being . Now 55:9 that the gospel of healing is again preached by the wayside , does not the pulpit sometimes scorn it ? But that curative mission , which presents the Saviour in a 55:12 clearer light than mere words can possibly do , can not be left out of Christianity , although it is again ruled out of the synagogue . 55:15 Truth 's immortal idea is sweeping down the centuries , gathering beneath its wings the sick and sinning . My weary hope tries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognize the Science of Christ and love his neighbor as himself , - when he shall realize God 's omnipotence and the healing power of the divine Love in what it has done 55:21 and is doing for mankind . The promises will be ful-filled . The time for the reappearing of the divine healing is throughout all time ; and whosoever layeth his earthly 55:24 all on the altar of divine Science , drinketh of Christ 's cup now , and is endued with the spirit and power of Christian healing . 55:27 In the words of St. John : " He shall give you another Comforter , that he may abide with you forever . " This Comforter I understand to be Divine Science . CHAPTER III - MARRIAGE What therefore God hath joined together , let not man put asunder . In the resurrection they neither marry , nor are given in marriage , but are as the angels of God in heaven . - JESUS . 56:1 WHEN our great Teacher came to him for baptism , John was astounded . Reading his thoughts , Jesus 56:3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness . " Jesus ' concessions ( in certain cases ) to material methods were for the advancement of 56:6 spiritual good . Marriage temporal Marriage is the legal and moral provision for genera-tion among human kind . Until the spiritual creation 56:9 is discerned intact , is apprehended and under-stood , and His kingdom is come as in the vision of the Apocalypse , - where the corporeal sense of crea-56:12 tion was cast out , and its spiritual sense was revealed from heaven , - marriage will continue , subject to such moral regulations as will secure increasing virtue . Fidelity required 56:15 Infidelity to the marriage covenant is the social scourge of all races , " the pestilence that walketh in darkness , . . . the destruction that wasteth at noonday. " 56:18 The commandment , " Thou shalt not com-mit adultery , " is no less imperative than the one , " Thou shalt not kill . " 57:1 Chastity is the cement of civilization and progress . Without it there is no stability in society , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Life . Mental elements Union of the masculine and feminine qualities consti-tutes completeness . The masculine mind reaches a 57:6 higher tone through certain elements of the feminine , while the feminine mind gains cour-age and strength through masculine qualities . These 57:9 different elements conjoin naturally with each other , and their true harmony is in spiritual oneness . Both sexes should be loving , pure , tender , and strong . The attrac-57:12 tion between native qualities will be perpetual only as it is pure and true , bringing sweet seasons of renewal like the returning spring . Affection 's demands 57:15 Beauty , wealth , or fame is incompetent to meet the demands of the affections , and should never weigh against the better claims of intellect , good-57:18 ness , and virtue . Happiness is spiritual , born of Truth and Love . It is unselfish ; therefore it can not exist alone , but requires all mankind to 57:21 share it . Help and discipline Human affection is not poured forth vainly , even though it meet no return . Love enriches the nature , en-57:24 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blasts of earth may uproot the flowers of affec-tion , and scatter them to the winds ; but this severance 57:27 of fleshly ties serves to unite thought more closely to God , for Love supports the struggling heart until it ceases to sigh over the world and begins to unfold its wings for 57:30 heaven . Marriage is unblest or blest , according to the disap-pointments it involves or the hopes it fulfils . To happify 58:1 existence by constant intercourse with those adapted to elevate it , should be the motive of society . Unity of 58:3 spirit gives new pinions to joy , or else joy 's drooping wings trail in dust . Chord and discord Ill-arranged notes produce discord . Tones of the 58:6 human mind may be different , but they should be con-cordant in order to blend properly . Unselfish ambition , noble life-motives , and purity , - 58:9 these constituents of thought , mingling , constitute in-dividually and collectively true happiness , strength , and permanence . Mutual freedom 58:12 There is moral freedom in Soul . Never contract the horizon of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time and thoughts . With ad-58:15 ditional joys , benevolence should grow more diffusive . The narrowness and jealousy , which would confine a wife or a husband forever within four walls , will 58:18 not promote the sweet interchange of confidence and love ; but on the other hand , a wandering desire for incessant amusement outside the home circle is a poor augury for 58:21 the happiness of wedlock . Home is the dearest spot on earth , and it should be the centre , though not the bound-ary , of the affections . A useful suggestion 58:24 Said the peasant bride to her lover : " Two eat no more together than they eat separately . " This is a hint that a wife ought not to court vulgar extravagance 58:27 or stupid ease , because another supplies her wants . Wealth may obviate the necessity for toil or the chance for ill-nature in the marriage relation , but noth-58:30 ing can abolish the cares of marriage . Differing duties " She that is married careth . . . how she may please her husband , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do . Matrimony should never be entered into without a full recognition of its enduring obligations on 59:3 both sides . There should be the most tender solicitude for each other 's happiness , and mu-tual attention and approbation should wait on all the years 59:6 of married life . Mutual compromises will often maintain a compact which might otherwise become unbearable . Man should 59:9 not be required to participate in all the annoyances and cares of domestic economy , nor should woman be ex-pected to understand political economy . Fulfilling the 59:12 different demands of their united spheres , their sympa-thies should blend in sweet confidence and cheer , each partner sustaining the other , - thus hallowing the union 59:15 of interests and affections , in which the heart finds peace and home . Trysting renewed Tender words and unselfish care in what promotes the 59:18 welfare and happiness of your wife will prove more salutary in prolonging her health and smiles than stolid indifference or jealousy . Husbands , hear this 59:21 and remember how slight a word or deed may renew the old trysting-times . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incompati-59:24 bility of disposition . A mutual understanding should exist before this union and continue ever after , for decep-tion is fatal to happiness . Permanent obligation 59:27 The nuptial vow should never be annulled , so long as its moral obligations are kept intact ; but the frequency of divorce shows that the sacredness of this re-59:30 lationship is losing its influence , and that fatal mistakes are undermining its foundations . Separation never should take place , and it never would , if both 60:1 husband and wife were genuine Christian Scientists . Science inevitably lifts one 's being higher in the scale of 60:3 harmony and happiness . Permanent affection Kindred tastes , motives , and aspirations are necessary to the formation of a happy and permanent companion-60:6 ship . The beautiful in character is also the good , welding indissolubly the links of affec-tion . A mother 's affection can not be weaned from her 60:9 child , because the mother-love includes purity and con-stancy , both of which are immortal . Therefore maternal affection lives on under whatever difficulties . 60:12 From the logic of events @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that wisdom will ultimately put asunder what she hath not joined 60:15 together . Centre for affections Marriage should improve the human species , becoming a barrier against vice , a protection to woman , strength to 60:18 man , and a centre for the affections . This , however , in a majority of cases , is not its present tendency , and why ? Because the education of 60:21 the higher nature is neglected , and other considerations , - passion , frivolous amusements , personal adornment , display , and pride , - occupy thought . Spiritual concord 60:24 An ill-attuned ear calls discord harmony , not appreciat-ing concord . So physical sense , not discerning the true happiness of being , places it on a false basis . 60:27 Science will correct the discord , and teach us life 's sweeter harmonies . Soul has infinite resources with which to bless mankind , 60:30 and happiness would be more readily attained and would be more secure in our keeping , if sought in Soul . Higher enjoyments alone can satisfy the cravings of immortal 61:1 man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal sense . The senses confer no real 61:3 enjoyment . Ascendency of good The good in human affections must have ascendency over the evil and the spiritual over the animal , or happi-61:6 ness will never be won . The attainment of this celestial condition would improve our progeny , diminish crime , and give higher aims to ambi-61:9 tion . Every valley of sin must be exalted , and every mountain of selfishness be brought low , that the highway of our God may be prepared in Science . The offspring 61:12 of heavenly-minded parents inherit more intellect , better balanced minds , and sounder constitutions . Propensities inherited If some fortuitous circumstance places promising chil-61:15 dren in the arms of gross parents , often these beautiful children early droop and die , like tropical flowers born amid Alpine snows . If perchance 61:18 they live to become parents in their turn , they may re-produce in their own helpless little ones the grosser traits of their ancestors . What hope of happiness , what noble 61:21 ambition , can inspire the child who inherits propensities that must either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 61:24 Is not the propagation of the human species a greater responsibility , a more solemn charge , than the culture of your garden or the raising of stock to increase your flocks 61:27 and herds ? Nothing unworthy of perpetuity should be transmitted to children . The formation of mortals must greatly improve to 61:30 advance mankind . The scientific morale of marriage is spiritual unity . If the propagation of a higher human species is requisite to reach this goal , then its material con-62:1 ditions can only be permitted for the purpose of gener-ating . The foetus must be kept mentally pure and the 62:3 period of gestation have the sanctity of virginity . The entire education of children should be such as to form habits of obedience to the moral and spiritual law , 62:6 with which the child can meet and master the belief in so-called physical laws , a belief which breeds disease . Inheritance heeded If parents create in their babes a desire for incessant 62:9 amusement , to be always fed , rocked , tossed , or talked to , those parents should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's fretfulness or fri-62:12 volity , which the parents themselves have occasioned . Taking less " thought for your life , what ye shall eat , or what ye shall drink " ; less thought " for your body what 62:15 ye shall put on , " will do much more for the health of the rising generation than you dream . Children should be allowed to remain children in knowledge , and should 62:18 become men and women only through growth in the understanding of man 's higher nature . The Mind creative We must not attribute more and more intelligence 62:21 to matter , but less and less , if we would be wise and healthy . The divine Mind , which forms the bud and blossom , will care for the human 62:24 body , even as it clothes the lily ; but let no mortal inter-fere with God 's government by thrusting in the laws of erring , human concepts . Superior law of Soul 62:27 The higher nature of man is not governed by the lower ; if it were , the order of wisdom would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harmony , 62:30 and produce the ills of which we complain . Because mortals believe in material laws and reject the Science of Mind , this does not make materiality first and 63:1 the superior law of Soul last . You would never think that flannel was better for warding off pulmonary disease 63:3 than the controlling Mind , if you understood the Science of being . Spiritual origin In Science man is the offspring of Spirit . The beauti-63:6 ful , good , and pure constitute his ancestry . His origin is not , like that of mortals , in brute instinct , nor does he pass through material conditions prior 63:9 to reaching intelligence . Spirit is his primitive and ulti-mate source of being ; God is his Father , and Life is the law of his being . The rights of woman 63:12 Civil law establishes very unfair differences between the rights of the two sexes . Christian Science furnishes no precedent for such injustice , and civilization 63:15 mitigates it in some measure . Still , it is a marvel why usage should accord woman less rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 63:18 Our laws are not impartial , to say the least , in their discrimination as to the person , property , and parental claims of the two sexes . If the elective fran-63:21 chise for women will remedy the evil with-out encouraging difficulties of greater magnitude , let us hope it will be granted . A feasible as well as rational 63:24 means of improvement at present is the elevation of society in general and the achievement of a nobler race for legislation , - a race having higher aims and 63:27 motives . If a dissolute husband deserts his wife , certainly the wronged , and perchance impoverished , woman should be 63:30 allowed to collect her own wages , enter into business agreements , hold real estate , deposit funds , and own her children free from interference . 64:1 Want of uniform justice is a crying evil caused by the selfishness and inhumanity of man . Our forefathers 64:3 exercised their faith in the direction taught by the Apostle James , when he said : " Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their affliction , and to keep himself unspotted from the world . " Benevolence hindered Pride , envy , or jealousy seems on most occasions to 64:9 be the master of ceremonies , ruling out primitive Chris-tianity . When a man lends a helping hand to some noble woman , struggling alone with 64:12 adversity , his wife should not say , " It is never well to interfere with your neighbor 's business . " A wife is sometimes debarred by a covetous domestic tyrant from 64:15 giving the ready aid her sympathy and charity would afford . Progressive development Marriage should signify a union of hearts . Further-64:18 more , the time cometh of which Jesus spake , when he declared that in the resurrection there should be no more marrying nor giving in marriage , 64:21 but man would be as the angels . Then shall Soul re-joice in its own , in which passion has no part . Then white-robed purity will unite in one person masculine wis-64:24 dom and feminine love , spiritual understanding and per-petual peace . Until it is learned that God is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not mortals permit a disregard of law which might lead to a worse state of society than now exists . Honesty and virtue ensure the stability of 64:30 the marriage covenant . Spirit will ultimately claim its own , - all that really is , - and the voices of physical sense will be forever hushed . Blessing of Christ 65:1 Experience should be the school of virtue , and human happiness should proceed from man 's highest nature . 65:3 May Christ , Truth , be present at every bridal altar to turn the water into wine and to give to human life an inspiration by which man 's spiritual and 65:6 eternal existence may be discerned . Righteous foundations If the foundations of human affection are consistent with progress , they will be strong and enduring . Divorces 65:9 should warn the age of some fundamental error in the marriage state . The union of the sexes suffers fearful discord . To gain Christian Science and its 65:12 harmony , life should be more metaphysically regarded . Powerless promises The broadcast powers of evil so conspicuous to-day show themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggling against the advancing spiritual era . Beholding the world 's lack of Christianity and the powerlessness of vows to make home 65:18 happy , the human mind will at length demand a higher affection . Transition and reform There will ensue a fermentation over this as over many 65:21 other reforms , until we get at last the clear straining of truth , and impurity and error are left among the lees . The fermentation even of fluids is 65:24 not pleasant . An unsettled , transitional stage is never desirable on its own account . Matrimony , which was once a fixed fact among us , must lose its present slippery foot-65:27 ing , and man must find permanence and peace in a more spiritual adherence . The mental chemicalization , which has brought con-65:30 jugal infidelity to the surface , will assuredly throw off this evil , and marriage will become purer when the scum is gone . Thou art right , immortal Shakespeare , great poet of humanity : 66:3 Sweet are the uses of adversity ; Which , like the toad , ugly and venomous , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorrow 66:6 Trials teach mortals not to lean on a material staff , - a broken reed , which pierces the heart . We do not half remember this in the sunshine of joy 66:9 and prosperity . Sorrow is salutary . Through great tribulation we enter the kingdom . Trials are proofs of God 's care . Spiritual development germi-66:12 nates not from seed sown in the soil of material hopes , but when these decay , Love propagates anew the higher joys of Spirit , which have no taint of earth . Each suc-66:15 cessive stage of experience unfolds new views of divine goodness and love . Amidst gratitude for conjugal felicity , it is well to re-66:18 member how fleeting are human joys . Amidst conjugal infelicity , it is well to hope , pray , and wait patiently on divine wisdom to point out the path . Patience is wisdom 66:21 Husbands and wives should never separate if there is no Christian demand for it . It is better to await the logic of events than for a wife precipitately 66:24 to leave her husband or for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better than the other , as must always be the case , the other pre-eminently needs good 66:27 company . Socrates considered patience salutary under such circumstances , making his Xantippe a discipline for his philosophy . The gold and dross 66:30 Sorrow has its reward . It never leaves us where it found us . The furnace separates the gold from the dross that the precious metal may 67:1 be graven with the image of God . The cup our Father hath given , shall we not drink it and learn the lessons 67:3 He teaches ? Weathering the storm When the ocean is stirred by a storm , then the clouds lower , the wind shrieks through the tightened shrouds , 67:6 and the waves lift themselves into mountains . We ask the helmsman : " Do you know your course ? Can you steer safely amid the storm ? " He 67:9 answers bravely , but even the dauntless seaman is not sure of his safety ; nautical science is not equal to the Science of Mind . Yet , acting up to his highest under-67:12 standing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on and awaits the issue . Thus should we deport ourselves on the seething ocean of sorrow . Hoping and work-67:15 ing , one should stick to the wreck , until an irresistible propulsion precipitates his doom or sunshine gladdens the troubled sea . Spiritual power 67:18 The notion that animal natures can possibly give force to character is too absurd for consideration , when we remember that through spiritual ascendency 67:21 our Lord and Master healed the sick , raised the dead , and commanded even the winds and waves to obey him . Grace and Truth are potent beyond all other 67:24 means and methods . The lack of spiritual power in the limited demonstration of popular Christianity does not put to silence the labor 67:27 of centuries . Spiritual , not corporeal , consciousness is needed . Man delivered from sin , disease , and death presents the true likeness or spiritual ideal . Basis of true religion 67:30 Systems of religion and medicine treat of physical pains and pleasures , but Jesus rebuked the suffering from any such cause or effect . The epoch approaches when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basis of true religion . At present mortals progress slowly for 68:3 fear of being thought ridiculous . They are slaves to fashion , pride , and sense . Some-time we shall learn how Spirit , the great architect , has 68:6 created men and women in Science . We ought to weary of the fleeting and false and to cherish nothing which hinders our highest selfhood. 68:9 Jealousy is the grave of affection . The presence of mistrust , where confidence is due , withers the flowers of Eden and scatters love 's petals to decay . Be not 68:12 in haste to take the vow " until death do us part . " Consider its obligations , its responsibilities , its rela-tions to your growth and to your influence on other 68:15 lives . Insanity and agamogenesis I never knew more than one individual who believed in agamogenesis ; she was unmarried , a lovely charac-68:18 ter , was suffering from incipient insanity , and a Christian Scientist cured her . I have named her case to individuals , when casting my bread upon 68:21 the waters , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evil to hatch their silly innuendoes and lies , since salutary causes sometimes incur these effects . The per-68:24 petuation of the floral species by bud or cell-division is evident , but I discredit the belief that agamogenesis applies to the human species . God 's creation intact 68:27 Christian Science presents unfoldment , not accretion ; it manifests no material growth from molecule to mind , but an impartation of the divine Mind to man 68:30 and the universe . Proportionately as human generation ceases , the unbroken links of eternal , har-monious being will be spiritually discerned ; and man , 69:1 not of the earth earthly but coexistent with God , will appear . The scientific fact that man and the universe 69:3 are evolved from Spirit , and so are spiritual , is as fixed in divine Science as is the proof that mortals gain the sense of health only as they lose the sense of sin and disease . 69:6 Mortals can never understand God 's creation while believ-ing that man is a creator . God 's children already created will be cognized only as man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the real , ideal man appears in proportion as the false and material disappears . No longer to marry or to be " given in marriage " neither closes man 's con-69:12 tinuity nor his sense of increasing number in God 's in-finite plan . Spiritually to understand that there is but one creator , God , unfolds all creation , confirms the Scrip-69:15 tures , brings the sweet assurance of no parting , no pain , and of man deathless and perfect and eternal . If Christian Scientists educate their own offspring 69:18 spiritually , they can educate others spiritually and not conflict with the scientific sense of God 's creation . Some day the child will ask his parent : " Do you keep the First 69:21 Commandment ? Do you have one God and creator , or is man a creator ? " If the father replies , " God creates man through man , " the child may ask , " Do you teach 69:24 that Spirit creates materially , or do you declare that Spirit is infinite , therefore matter is out of the ques-tion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world marry , 69:27 and are given in marriage : But they which shall be ac-counted worthy to obtain that world , and the resur-rection from the dead , neither marry , nor are given in 69:30 marriage . " CHAPTER IV - CHRISTIAN SCIENCE VERSUS SPIRITUALISM And when they shall say unto you , Seek unto them that have familiar spirits , And unto wizards that peep and that mutter ; Should not a people seek unto their God ? - ISAIAH . Verily , verily , I say unto you , If a man keep my saying , he shall never see death . Then said the Jews unto him , Now we know that thou hast a devil . - JOHN . The infinite one Spirit 70:1 MORTAL existence is an enigma . Every day is a mystery . The testimony of the corporeal senses 70:3 can not inform us what is real and what is delusive , but the revelations of Christian Science unlock the treasures of Truth . Whatever is false or sinful can 70:6 never enter the atmosphere of Spirit . There is but one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , made in God 's likeness , reflects God . In this scientific 70:9 reflection the Ego and the Father are inseparable . The supposition that corporeal beings are spirits , or that there are good and evil spirits , is a mistake . Real and unreal identity 70:12 The divine Mind maintains all identities , from a blade of grass to a star , as distinct and eternal . The questions are : What are God 's identities ? 70:15 What is Soul ? Does life or soul exist in the thing formed ? 71:1 Nothing is real and eternal , - nothing is Spirit , - but God and His idea . Evil has no reality . It is neither 71:3 person , place , nor thing , but is simply a belief , an illusion of material sense . The identity , or idea , of all reality continues forever ; 71:6 but Spirit , or the divine Principle of all , is not in Spirit 's formations . Soul is synonymous with Spirit , God , the creative , governing , infinite Principle outside of finite form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes , and you may dream that you see a flower , - that you touch and smell it . Thus you learn 71:12 that the flower is a product of the so-called mind , a formation of thought rather than of matter . Close your eyes again , and you may see land-71:15 scapes , men , and women . Thus you learn that these also are images , which mortal mind holds and evolves and which simulate mind , life , and intelligence . From 71:18 dreams also you learn that neither mortal mind nor matter is the image or likeness of God , and that im-mortal Mind is not in matter . Found wanting 71:21 When the Science of Mind is understood , spiritualism will be found mainly erroneous , having no scientific basis nor origin , no proof nor power outside of 71:24 human testimony . It is the offspring of the physical senses . There is no sensuality in Spirit . I never could believe in spiritualism . 71:27 The basis and structure of spiritualism are alike ma-terial and physical . Its spirits are so many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spiritualism 71:30 therefore presupposes Spirit , which is ever infinite , to be a corporeal being , a finite form , - a theory contrary to Christian Science . 72:1 There is but one spiritual existence , - the Life of which corporeal sense can take no cognizance . The 72:3 divine Principle of man speaks through immortal sense . If a material body - in other words , mortal , material sense - were permeated by Spirit , that body would 72:6 disappear to mortal sense , would be deathless . A con-dition precedent to communion with Spirit is the gain of spiritual life . Spirits obsolete 72:9 So-called spirits are but corporeal communicators . As light destroys darkness and in the place of darkness all is light , so ( in absolute Science ) Soul , or God , 72:12 is the only truth-giver to man . Truth de-stroys mortality , and brings to light immortality . Mortal belief ( the material sense of life ) and immortal Truth 72:15 ( the spiritual sense ) are the tares and the wheat , which are not united by progress , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spirit is not made manifest through matter , the anti-pode of Spirit . Error is not a convenient sieve through which truth can be strained . Scientific phenomena 72:21 God , good , being ever present , it follows in divine logic that evil , the suppositional opposite of good , is never present . In Science , individual good derived 72:24 from God , the infinite All-in-all , may flow from the departed to mortals ; but evil is neither com-municable nor scientific . A sinning , earthly mortal is 72:27 not the reality of Life nor the medium through which truth passes to earth . The joy of intercourse becomes the jest of sin , when evil and suffering are communicable . 72:30 Not personal intercommunion but divine law is the com-municator of truth , health , and harmony to earth and humanity . As readily can you mingle fire and frost as 73:1 Spirit and matter . In either case , one does not support the other . 73:3 Spiritualism calls one person , living in this world , ma-terial , but another , who has died to-day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it terms a spirit . 73:6 The fact is that neither the one nor the other is infinite Spirit , for Spirit is God , and man is His likeness . One government The belief that one man , as spirit , can control an-73:9 other man , as matter , upsets both the individuality and the Science of man , for man is image . God controls man , and God is the only Spirit . Any 73:12 other control or attraction of so-called spirit is a mortal belief , which ought to be known by its fruit , - the repe-tition of evil . 73:15 If Spirit , or God , communed with mortals or controlled them through electricity or any other form of matter , the divine order and the Science of omnipotent , omnipresent 73:18 Spirit would be destroyed . Incorrect theories The belief that material bodies return to dust , hereafter to rise up as spiritual bodies with material sensations and 73:21 desires , is incorrect . Equally incorrect is the belief that spirit is confined in a finite , ma-terial body , from which it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is freed from the material body , spirit retains the sensa-tions belonging to that body . No me-diumship It is a grave mistake to suppose that matter is any part 73:27 of the reality of intelligent existence , or that Spirit and matter , intelligence and non-intelligence , can commune together . This error Science will 73:30 destroy . The sensual can not be made the mouthpiece of the spiritual , nor can the finite become the channel of the infinite . There is no communication between so-74:1 called material existence and spiritual life which is not subject to death . Opposing conditions 74:3 To be on communicable terms with Spirit , persons must be free from organic bodies ; and their return to a mate-rial condition , after having once left it , would 74:6 be as impossible as would be the restoration to its original condition of the acorn , already absorbed into a sprout which has risen above the soil . The seed 74:9 which has germinated has a new form and state of exist-ence . When here or hereafter the belief of life in matter is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 74:12 with the belief , and never returns to the old condition . No correspondence nor communion can exist between persons in such opposite dreams as the belief of having 74:15 died and left a material body and the belief of still living in an organic , material body . Bridgeless division The caterpillar , transformed into a beautiful insect , 74:18 is no longer a worm , nor does the insect return to fraternize with or control the worm . Such a backward transformation is impossible in 74:21 Science . Darkness and light , infancy and manhood , sickness and health , are opposites , - different beliefs , which never blend . Who will say that infancy can utter 74:24 the ideas of manhood , that darkness can represent light , that we are in Europe when we are in the opposite hemi-sphere ? There is no bridge across the gulf which divides 74:27 two such opposite conditions as the spiritual , or incor-poreal , and the physical , or corporeal . In Christian Science there is never a retrograde step , 74:30 never a return to positions outgrown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for they are in separate states of existence , or consciousness . Unscientific investiture 75:1 This simple truth lays bare the mistaken assumption that man dies as matter but comes to life as spirit . The 75:3 so-called dead , in order to reappear to those still in the existence cognized by the physical senses , would need to be tangible and material , - to have 75:6 a material investiture , - or the material senses could take no cognizance of the so-called dead . Spiritualism would transfer men from the spiritual sense 75:9 of existence back into its material sense . This gross mate-rialism is scientifically impossible , since to infinite Spirit there can be no matter . Raising the dead 75:12 Jesus said of Lazarus : " Our friend Lazarus sleepeth ; but I go , that I may awake him out of sleep . " Jesus restored Lazarus by the understanding that 75:15 Lazarus had never died , not by an admis-sion that his body had died and then lived again . Had Jesus believed that Lazarus had lived or died in his 75:18 body , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belief as those who buried the body , and he could not have resuscitated it . 75:21 When you can waken yourself or others out of the belief that all must die , you can then exercise Jesus ' spiritual power to reproduce the presence of those who have thought 75:24 they died , - but not otherwise . Vision of the dying There is one possible moment , when those living on the earth and those called dead , can commune together , and 75:27 that is the moment previous to the transition , - the moment when the link between their op-posite beliefs is being sundered . In the vestibule through 75:30 which we pass from one dream to another dream , or when we awake from earth 's sleep to the grand verities of Life , the departing may hear the glad welcome of those 76:1 who have gone before . The ones departing may whisper this vision , name the face that smiles on them and the 76:3 hand which beckons them , as one at Niagara , with eyes open only to that wonder , forgets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is God 76:6 When being is understood , Life will be recognized as neither material nor finite , but as infinite , - as God , universal good ; and the belief that life , or 76:9 mind , was ever in a finite form , or good in evil , will be destroyed . Then it will be understood that Spirit never entered matter and was therefore never 76:12 raised from matter . When advanced to spiritual being and the understanding of God , man can no longer com-mune with matter ; neither can he return to it , any more 76:15 than a tree can return to its seed . Neither will man seem to be corporeal , but he will be an individual conscious-ness , characterized by the divine Spirit as idea , not matter . 76:18 Suffering , sinning , dying beliefs are unreal . When divine Science is universally understood , they will have no power over man , for man is immortal and lives by 76:21 divine authority . Immaterial pleasure The sinless joy , - the perfect harmony and immortality of Life , possessing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasure or pain , - constitutes the only veritable , indestructible man , whose being is spiritual . This state of existence 76:27 is scientific and intact , - a perfection discernible only by those who have the final understanding of Christ in divine Science . Death can never hasten this state of 76:30 existence , for death must be overcome , not submitted to , before immortality appears . The recognition of Spirit and of infinity comes not 77:1 suddenly here or hereafter . The pious Polycarp said : " I can not turn at once from good to evil . " Neither do 77:3 other mortals accomplish the change from error to truth at a single bound . Second death Existence continues to be a belief of corporeal sense 77:6 until the Science of being is reached . Error brings its own self-destruction both here and hereafter , for mortal mind creates its own physical con-77:9 ditions . Death will occur on the next plane of existence as on this , until the spiritual understanding of Life is reached . Then , and not until then , will it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power . " A dream vanishing The period required for this dream of material life , embracing its so-called pleasures and pains , to vanish 77:15 from consciousness , " knoweth no man . . . neither the Son , but the Father . " This period will be of longer or shorter duration according to the 77:18 tenacity of error . Of what advantage , then , would it be to us , or to the departed , to prolong the material state and so prolong the illusion either of a soul inert or of a sinning , 77:21 suffering sense , - a so-called mind fettered to matter . Progress and purgatory Even if communications from spirits to mortal consciousness were possible , such communications would 77:24 grow beautifully less with every advanced stage of existence . The departed would gradually rise above ignorance and materiality , and Spiritualists 77:27 would outgrow their beliefs in material spiritualism . Spiritism consigns the so-called dead to a state resembling that of blighted buds , - to a wretched purgatory , where 77:30 the chances of the departed for improvement narrow into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Unnatural deflections 78:1 The decaying flower , the blighted bud , the gnarled oak , the ferocious beast , - like the discords of disease , sin , 78:3 and death , - are unnatural . They are the fal-sities of sense , the changing deflections of mor-tal mind ; they are not the eternal realities of Mind . Absurd oracles 78:6 How unreasonable is the belief that we are wearing out life and hastening to death , and that at the same time we are communing with immortality ! 78:9 If the departed are in rapport with mor-tality , or matter , they are not spiritual , but must still be mortal , sinning , suffering , and dying . Then why 78:12 look to them - even were communication possible - for proofs of immortality , and accept them as oracles ? Com-munications gathered from ignorance are pernicious in 78:15 tendency . Spiritualism with its material accompaniments would destroy the supremacy of Spirit . If Spirit pervades all 78:18 space , it needs no material method for the transmission of messages . Spirit needs no wires nor electricity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not materially tangible . How then can it communicate with man through electric , material effects ? How can the majesty and omnipotence of 78:24 Spirit be lost ? God is not in the medley where matter cares for matter , where spiritism makes many gods , and hypnotism and electricity are claimed 78:27 to be the agents of God 's government . Spirit blesses man , but man can not " tell whence it cometh . " By it the sick are healed , the sorrowing are 78:30 comforted , and the sinning are reformed . These are the effects of one universal God , the invisible good dwelling in eternal Science . Thought regarding death 79:1 The act of describing disease - its symptoms , locality , and fatality - is not scientific . Warning people against 79:3 death is an error that tends to frighten into death those who are ignorant of Life as God . Thousands of instances could be cited of health restored 79:6 by changing the patient 's thoughts regarding death . Fallacious hypotheses A scientific mental method is more sanitary than the use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nent health . Science must go over the whole ground , and dig up every seed of error 's sow-ing . Spiritualism relies upon human beliefs and hy-79:12 potheses . Christian Science removes these beliefs and hypotheses through the higher understanding of God , for Christian Science , resting on divine Principle , not on ma-79:15 terial personalities , in its revelation of immortality , intro-duces the harmony of being . Jesus cast out evil spirits , or false beliefs . The Apostle 79:18 Paul bade men have the Mind that was in the Christ . Jesus did his own work by the one Spirit . He said : " My Father worketh hitherto , and I work . " He never de-79:21 scribed disease , so far as can be learned from the Gospels , but he healed disease . Mistaken methods The unscientific practitioner says : " You are ill . Your 79:24 brain is overtaxed , and you must rest . Your body is weak , and it must be strengthened . You have nervous prostration , and must be treated for it . " 79:27 Science objects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and asserting that Mind controls body and brain . Divine strength Mind-science teaches that mortals need " not be weary 79:30 in well doing . " It dissipates fatigue in doing good . Giving does not impoverish us in the service of our Maker , neither does withholding enrich us. giving 80:3 utterance to truth . A cup of coffee or tea is not the equal of truth , whether for the inspiration of a sermon or for the support of bodily endurance . A denial of immortality 80:6 A communication purporting to come from the late Theodore Parker reads as follows : " There never was , and there never will be , an immortal spirit . " 80:9 Yet the very periodical containing this sen-tence repeats weekly the assertion that spirit-communica-tions are our only proofs of immortality . Mysticism unscientific 80:12 I entertain no doubt of the humanity and philanthropy of many Spiritualists , but I can not coincide with their views . It is mysticism which gives spiritual-80:15 ism its force . Science dispels mystery and explains extraordinary phenomena ; but Science never removes phenomena from the domain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falsities It should not seem mysterious that mind , without the aid of hands , can move a table , when we already know 80:21 that it is mind-power which moves both table and hand . Even planchette - the French toy which years ago pleased so many people - attested the con-80:24 trol of mortal mind over its substratum , called matter . It is mortal mind which convulses its substratum , matter . These movements arise from the volition of human belief , 80:27 but they are neither scientific nor rational . Mortal mind produces table-tipping as certainly as table-setting , and believes that this wonder emanates from spirits and elec-80:30 tricity . This belief rests on the common conviction that mind and matter cooperate both visibly and invisibly , hence that matter is intelligent . Poor post-mortem evidence 81:1 There is not so much evidence to prove intercommuni-cation between the so-called dead and the living , as there 81:3 is to show the sick that matter suffers and has sensation ; yet this latter evidence is destroyed by Mind-science . If Spiritualists understood the 81:6 Science of being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of immortality At the very best and on its own theories , spiritualism can only prove that certain individuals have a continued 81:9 existence after death and maintain their affili-ation with mortal flesh ; but this fact affords no certainty of everlasting life . A man 's assertion that 81:12 he is immortal no more proves him to be so , than the op-posite assertion , that he is mortal , would prove immor-tality a lie . Nor is the case improved when alleged spirits 81:15 teach immortality . Life , Love , Truth , is the only proof of immortality . Mind 's manifestations immortal Man in the likeness of God as revealed in Science can-81:18 not help being immortal . Though the grass seemeth to wither and the flower to fade , they reappear . Erase the figures which express number , silence 81:21 the tones of music , give to the worms the body called man , and yet the producing , governing , divine Principle lives on , - in the case of man as truly as in 81:24 the case of numbers and of music , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man as mortal . Though the inharmony resulting from material sense hides the 81:27 harmony of Science , inharmony can not destroy the divine Principle of Science . In Science , man 's immortality de-pends upon that of God , good , and follows as a necessary 81:30 consequence of the immortality of good . Reading thoughts That somebody , somewhere , must have known the deceased person , supposed to be the communicator , is 82:1 evident , and it is as easy to read distant thoughts as near . We think of an absent friend as easily as we do of one 82:3 present . It is no more difficult to read the absent mind than it is to read the present . Chaucer wrote centuries ago , yet we still read his thought 82:6 in his verse . What is classic study , but discernment of the minds of Homer and Virgil , of whose personal exist-ence we may be in doubt ? Impossible intercommunion 82:9 If spiritual life has been won by the departed , they can not return to material existence , because different states of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exist in two different states of consciousness at the same time . In sleep we do not communicate with the dreamer by our side despite 82:15 his physical proximity , because both of us are either un-conscious or are wandering in our dreams through differ-ent mazes of consciousness . 82:18 In like manner it would follow , even if our departed friends were near us and were in as conscious a state of existence as before the change we call death , that their 82:21 state of consciousness must be different from ours . We are not in their state , nor are they in the mental realm in which we dwell . Communion between them and 82:24 ourselves would be prevented by this difference . The mental states are so unlike , that intercommunion is as impossible as it would be between a mole and a human 82:27 being . Different dreams and different awakenings be-token a differing consciousness . When wandering in Australia , do we look for help to the Esquimaux in their 82:30 snow huts ? In a world of sin and sensuality hastening to a greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consider whether it is the human mind or the divine Mind which is influencing one . What the prophets of 83:3 Jehovah did , the worshippers of Baal failed to do ; yet artifice and delusion claimed that they could equal the work of wisdom . 83:6 Science only can explain the incredible good and evil elements now coming to the surface . Mortals must find refuge in Truth in order to escape the error of these latter 83:9 days . Nothing is more antagonistic to Christian Science than a blind belief without understanding , for such a belief hides Truth and builds on error . Natural wonders 83:12 Miracles are impossible in Science , and here Science takes issue with popular religions . The scientific mani-festation of power is from the divine nature 83:15 and is not supernatural , since Science is an explication of nature . The belief that the universe , in-cluding man , is governed in general by material laws , but 83:18 that occasionally Spirit sets aside these laws , - this belief belittles omnipotent wisdom , and gives to matter the precedence over Spirit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose that life is either material or organically spiritual . Between Christian Science and all forms of superstition 83:24 a great gulf is fixed , as impassable as that be-tween Dives and Lazarus . There is mortal mind-reading and immortal Mind-reading . The latter is a revelation 83:27 of divine purpose through spiritual understanding , by which man gains the divine Principle and explanation of all things . Mortal mind-reading and immortal Mind-83:30 reading are distinctly opposite standpoints , from which cause and effect are interpreted . The act of reading mortal mind investigates and touches only human beliefs . 84:1 Science is immortal and coordinate neither with the premises nor with the conclusions of mortal beliefs . Scientific foreseeing 84:3 The ancient prophets gained their foresight from a spiritual , incorporeal standpoint , not by foreshadowing evil and mistaking fact for fiction , - predict-84:6 ing the future from a groundwork of corpo-reality and human belief . When sufficiently advanced in Science to be in harmony with the truth of being , men 84:9 become seers and prophets involuntarily , controlled not by demons , spirits , or demigods , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ever-present , divine Mind , and 84:12 of thought which is in rapport with this Mind , to know the past , the present , and the future . Acquaintance with the Science of being enables us to 84:15 commune more largely with the divine Mind , to foresee and foretell events which concern the universal welfare , to be divinely inspired , - yea , to reach the range of fetter-84:18 less Mind . The Mind unbounded To understand that Mind is infinite , not bounded by corporeality , not dependent upon the ear and eye for 84:21 sound or sight nor upon muscles and bones for locomotion , is a step towards the Mind-science by which we discern man 's nature and existence . 84:24 This true conception of being destroys the belief of spirit-ualism at its very inception , for without the concession of material personalities called spirits , spiritualism has no 84:27 basis upon which to build . Scientific foreknowing All we correctly know of Spirit comes from God , divine Principle , and is learned through Christ and Christian 84:30 Science . If this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can know the truth more accurately than the astronomer can read 85:1 the stars or calculate an eclipse . This Mind-reading is the opposite of clairvoyance . It is the illumination of 85:3 the spiritual understanding which demonstrates the ca-pacity of Soul , not of material sense . This Soul-sense comes to the human mind when the latter yields to the 85:6 divine Mind . Value of intuition Such intuitions reveal whatever constitutes and per-petuates harmony , enabling one to do good , but not 85:9 evil . You will reach the perfect Science of healing when you are able to read the human mind after this manner and discern the error you would 85:12 destroy . The Samaritan woman said : " Come , see a man , which told me all things that ever I did : is not this the Christ ? " 85:15 It is recorded that Jesus , as he once journeyed with his students , " knew their thoughts , " - read them scientifi-cally . In like manner he discerned disease and healed 85:18 the sick . After the same method , events of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Master rebuked the lack of this power when he said : 85:21 " O ye hypocrites ! ye can discern the face of the sky ; but can ye not discern the signs of the times ? " Hypocrisy condemned Both Jew and Gentile may have had acute corporeal 85:24 senses , but mortals need spiritual sense . Jesus knew the generation to be wicked and adulterous , seek-ing the material more than the spiritual . His 85:27 thrusts at materialism were sharp , but needed . He never spared hypocrisy the sternest condemnation . He said : " These ought ye to have done , and not to leave the other 85:30 undone . " The great Teacher knew both cause and effect , knew that truth communicates itself but never imparts error . Mental contact 86:1 Jesus once asked , " Who touched me ? " Supposing this inquiry to be occasioned by physical contact alone , 86:3 his disciples answered , " The multitude throng thee . " Jesus knew , as others did not , that it was not matter , but mortal mind , whose touch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was answered by the faith of a sick woman . His quick apprehension of this mental call illustrated his spirituality . The disciples ' 86:9 misconception of it uncovered their materiality . Jesus possessed more spiritual susceptibility than the disciples . Opposites come from contrary directions , and produce 86:12 unlike results . Images of thought Mortals evolve images of thought . These may appear to the ignorant to be apparitions ; but they are myste-86:15 rious only because it is unusual to see thoughts , though we can always feel their influence . Haunted houses , ghostly voices , unusual 86:18 noises , and apparitions brought out in dark seances either involve feats by tricksters , or they are images and sounds evolved involuntarily by mortal mind . Seeing 86:21 is no less a quality of physical sense than feeling . Then why is it more difficult to see a thought than to feel one ? Education alone determines the difference . In reality 86:24 there is none . Phenomena explained Portraits , landscape-paintings , fac-similes of penman-ship , peculiarities of expression , recollected sentences , 86:27 can all be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objects cognizable by the senses . Mortal mind sees what it believes as 86:30 certainly as it believes what it sees . It feels , hears , and sees its own thoughts . Pictures are mentally formed before the artist can convey them to canvas . So is it 87:1 with all material conceptions . Mind-readers perceive these pictures of thought . They copy or reproduce 87:3 them , even when they are lost to the memory of the mind in which they are discoverable . Mental environment It is needless for the thought or for the person hold-87:6 ing the transferred picture to be individually and con-sciously present . Though individuals have passed away , their mental environment re-87:9 mains to be discerned , described , and transmitted . Though bodies are leagues apart and their associations forgotten , their associations float in the general atmosphere of human 87:12 mind . Second sight The Scotch call such vision " second sight " , when really it is first sight instead of second , for it presents 87:15 primal facts to mortal mind . Science enables one to read the human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one to heal through Mind , but 87:18 not as a mesmerist . Buried secrets The mine knows naught of the emeralds within its rocks ; the sea is ignorant of the gems within its caverns , 87:21 of the corals , of its sharp reefs , of the tall ships that float on its bosom , or of the bodies which lie buried in its sands : yet these are all there . Do not 87:24 suppose that any mental concept is gone because you do not think of it . The true concept is never lost . The strong impressions produced on mortal mind by friend-87:27 ship or by any intense feeling are lasting , and mind-readers can perceive and reproduce these impressions . Recollected friends Memory may reproduce voices long ago silent . We 87:30 have but to close the eyes , and forms rise before us , which are thousands of miles away or altogether gone from physical sight and sense , and 88:1 this not in dreamy sleep . In our day-dreams we can recall that for which the poet Tennyson expressed the 88:3 heart 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And the sound of a voice that is still . 88:6 The mind may even be cognizant of a present flavor and odor , when no viand touches the palate and no scent salutes the nostrils . Illusions not ideas 88:9 How are veritable ideas to be distinguished from il-lusions ? By learning the origin of each . Ideas are emanations from the divine Mind . Thoughts , 88:12 proceeding from the brain or from matter , are offshoots of mortal mind ; they are mortal material be-liefs . Ideas are spiritual , harmonious , and eternal . Beliefs 88:15 proceed from the so-called material senses , which at one time are supposed to be substance-matter and at another are called spirits . 88:18 To love one 's neighbor as one 's self , is a divine idea ; but this idea can never be seen , felt , nor understood through the physical senses . Excite the organ of ven-88:21 eration or religious faith , and the individual manifests profound adoration . Excite the opposite development , and he blasphemes . These effects , however , do not pro-88:24 ceed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both arise from mortal belief . Trance speaking illusion Eloquence re-echoes the strains of Truth and Love . 88:27 It is due to inspiration rather than to erudition . It shows the possibilities derived from divine Mind , though it is said to be a gift whose endowment 88:30 is obtained from books or received from the impulsion of departed spirits . When eloquence proceeds from the belief that a departed spirit is speaking , who 89:1 can tell what the unaided medium is incapable of know-ing or uttering ? This phenomenon only shows that the 89:3 beliefs of mortal mind are loosed . Forgetting her igno-rance in the belief that another mind is speaking through her , the devotee may become unwontedly eloquent . Hav-89:6 ing more faith in others than in herself , and believing that somebody else possesses her tongue and mind , she talks freely . 89:9 Destroy her belief in outside aid , and her eloquence disappears . The former limits of her belief return . She says , " I am incapable of words that glow , for I am un-89:12 educated . " This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " As he thinketh in his heart , so is he . " If one believes that he can not be an orator with-89:15 out study or a superinduced condition , the body responds to this belief , and the tongue grows mute which before was eloquent . Scientific improvisation 89:18 Mind is not necessarily dependent upon educational processes . It possesses of itself all beauty and poetry , and the power of expressing them . Spirit , 89:21 God , is heard when the senses are silent . We are all capable of more than we do . The influence or action of Soul confers a freedom , which explains the phe-89:24 nomena of improvisation and the fervor of untutored lips . Divine origination Matter is neither intelligent nor creative . The tree is not the author of itself . Sound is not the originator of 89:27 music , and man is not the father of man . Cain very naturally concluded that if life was in the body , and man gave it , man had the right to take it away . 89:30 This incident shows that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beginning . " If seed is necessary to produce wheat , and wheat to 90:1 produce flour , or if one animal can originate another , how then can we account for their primal origin ? How 90:3 were the loaves and fishes multiplied on the shores of Galilee , - and that , too , without meal or monad from which loaf or fish could come ? Mind is substance 90:6 The earth 's orbit and the imaginary line called the equator are not substance . The earth 's motion and position are sustained by Mind alone . Divest 90:9 yourself of the thought that there can be sub-stance in matter , and the movements and transitions now possible for mortal mind will be found to be equally 90:12 possible for the body . Then being will be recognized as spiritual , and death will be obsolete , though now some insist that death is the necessary prelude to 90:15 immortality . Mortal delusions In dreams we fly to Europe and meet a far-off friend . The looker-on sees the body in bed , but the supposed 90:18 inhabitant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ocean . This shows the possibilities of thought . Opium and hashish eaters men-90:21 tally travel far and work wonders , yet their bodies stay in one place . This shows what mortal mentality and knowledge are . Scientific finalities 90:24 The admission to one 's self that man is God 's own like-ness sets man free to master the infinite idea . This con-viction shuts the door on death , and opens it 90:27 wide towards immortality . The understanding and recognition of Spirit must finally come , and we may as well improve our time in solving the mysteries of being 90:30 through an apprehension of divine Principle . At present we know not what man is , but we certainly shall know this when man reflects God . 91:1 The Revelator tells us of " a new heaven and a new earth . " Have you ever pictured this heaven and 91:3 earth , inhabited by beings under the control of supreme wisdom ? Let us rid ourselves of the belief that man is separated 91:6 from God , and obey only the divine principle , Life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for all true spiritual growth . Man 's genuine being 91:9 It is difficult for the sinner to accept divine Science , because Science exposes his nothingness ; but the sooner error is reduced to its native nothingness , the 91:12 sooner man 's great reality will appear and his genuine being will be understood . The destruction of error is by no means the destruction of Truth or Life , but 91:15 is the acknowledgment of them . Absorbed in material selfhood we discern and reflect but faintly the substance of Life or Mind . The denial of 91:18 material selfhood aids the discernment of man 's spiritual and eternal individuality , and destroys the erroneous knowledge gained from matter or through what are termed 91:21 the material senses . Erroneous postulates Certain erroneous postulates should be here considered in order that the spiritual facts may be better 91:24 apprehended . The first erroneous postulate of belief is , that substance , life , and intelligence are something apart from God . 91:27 The second erroneous postulate is , that man is both mental and material . The third erroneous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good ; whereas the real Mind can not be evil nor the medium of evil , for Mind is God . The fourth erroneous postulate is , that matter is in-92:1 telligent , and that man has a material body which is part of himself . 92:3 The fifth erroneous postulate is , that matter holds in itself the issues of life and death , - that matter is not only capable of experiencing pleasure and pain , but also 92:6 capable of imparting these sensations . From the illusion implied in this last postulate arises the decomposition of mortal bodies in what is termed death . 92:9 Mind is not an entity within the cranium with the power of sinning now and forever . Knowledge of good and evil In old Scriptural pictures we see a serpent coiled around 92:12 the tree of knowledge and speaking to Adam and Eve . This represents the serpent in the act of commending to our first parents the knowl-92:15 edge of good and evil , a knowledge gained from matter , or evil , instead of from Spirit . The portrayal is still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man - a burlesque of God 's man - is an outgrowth of human knowledge or sensuality , a mere offshoot of material sense . Opposing power 92:21 Uncover error , and it turns the lie upon you . Until the fact concerning error - namely , its nothingness - appears , the moral demand will not be met , 92:24 and the ability to make nothing of error will be wanting . We should blush to call that real which is only a mistake . The foundation of evil is laid on a belief 92:27 in something besides God . This belief tends to support two opposite powers , instead of urging the claims of Truth alone . The mistake of thinking that error can be real , 92:30 when it is merely the absence of truth , leads to belief in the superiority of error . The age 's privilege Do you say the time has not yet come in which to 93:1 recognize Soul as substantial and able to control the body ? Remember Jesus , who nearly nineteen centuries 93:3 ago demonstrated the power of Spirit and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works that I do shall he do also , " and who also said , " But the hour 93:6 cometh , and now is , when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth . " " Behold , now is the accepted time ; behold , now is the day of sal-93:9 vation , " said Paul . Logic and revelation Divine logic and revelation coincide . If we believe otherwise , we may be sure that either our 93:12 logic is at fault or that we have misinterpreted revelation . Good never causes evil , nor creates aught that can cause evil . 93:15 Good does not create a mind susceptible of causing evil , for evil is the opposing error and not the truth of creation . Destructive electricity is not the offspring of in-93:18 finite good . Whatever contradicts the real nature of the divine Esse , though human faith may clothe it with angelic vestments , is without foundation . Derivatives of spirit 93:21 The belief that Spirit is finite as well as infinite has darkened all history . In Christian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the name of the Supreme Being . 93:24 It means quantity and quality , and applies ex-clusively to God . The modifying derivatives of the word spirit refer only to quality , not to God . Man is spiritual . 93:27 He is not God , Spirit . If man were Spirit , then men would be spirits , gods . Finite spirit would be mortal , and this is the error embodied in the belief that the infi-93:30 nite can be contained in the finite . This belief tends to becloud our apprehension of the kingdom of heaven and of the reign of harmony in the Science of being . Scientific man 94:1 Jesus taught but one God , one Spirit , who makes man in the image and likeness of Himself , - of Spirit , not of 94:3 matter . Man reflects infinite Truth , Life , and Love . The nature of man , thus understood , includes all that is implied by the terms " image " and 94:6 " likeness " as used in Scripture . The truly Christian and scientific statement of personality and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demonstration which accompa-94:9 nied it , incensed the rabbis , and they said : " Crucify him , crucify him . . . by our law he ought to die , because he made himself the Son of God . " 94:12 The eastern empires and nations owe their false gov-ernment to the misconceptions of Deity there prevalent . Tyranny , intolerance , and bloodshed , wherever found , 94:15 arise from the belief that the infinite is formed after the pattern of mortal personality , passion , and impulse . Ingratitude and denial The progress of truth confirms its claims , and our 94:18 Master confirmed his words by his works . His healing-power evoked denial , ingratitude , and be-trayal , arising from sensuality . Of the ten 94:21 lepers whom Jesus healed , but one returned to give God thanks , - that is , to acknowledge the divine Principle which had healed him . Spiritual insight 94:24 Our Master easily read the thoughts of mankind , and this insight better enabled him to direct those thoughts aright ; but what would be said at this period of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his in-cisive power injuriously ? Our Master read mortal mind on a scientific basis , that of the omnipresence of Mind . 94:30 An approximation of this discernment indicates spiritual growth and union with the infinite capacities of the one Mind . Jesus could injure no one by his Mind-reading. 95:1 The effect of his Mind was always to heal and to save , and this is the only genuine Science of reading mortal 95:3 mind . His holy motives and aims were tra-duced by the sinners of that period , as they would be to-day if Jesus were personally present . Paul 95:6 said , " To be spiritually minded is life . " We approach God , or Life , in proportion to our spirituality , our fidel-ity to Truth and Love ; and in that ratio we know all 95:9 human need and are able to discern the thought of the sick and the sinning for the purpose of healing them . Error of any kind can not hide from the law of God . 95:12 Whoever reaches this point of moral culture and good-ness can not injure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or lesser ability of a Christian Scientist to discern 95:15 thought scientifically , depends upon his genuine spirit-uality . This kind of mind-reading is not clairvoyance , but it is important to success in healing , and is one of the 95:18 special characteristics thereof . Christ 's reappearance We welcome the increase of knowledge and the end of error , because even human invention must have its 95:21 day , and we want that day to be succeeded by Christian Science , by divine reality . Mid-night foretells the dawn . Led by a solitary star amid 95:24 the darkness , the Magi of old foretold the Messiahship of Truth . Is the wise man of to-day believed , when he beholds the light which heralds Christ 's eternal dawn 95:27 and describes its effulgence ? Spiritual awakening Lulled by stupefying illusions , the world is asleep in the cradle of infancy , dreaming away the hours . 95:30 Material sense does not unfold the facts of existence ; but spiritual sense lifts human consciousness into eternal Truth . Humanity advances 96:1 slowly out of sinning sense into spiritual understanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dom with chains . The darkest hours of all Love will finally mark the hour of harmony , and spir-itualization will follow , for Love is Spirit . Before error 96:6 is wholly destroyed , there will be interrup-tions of the general material routine . Earth will become dreary and desolate , but summer and winter , 96:9 seedtime and harvest ( though in changed forms ) , will continue unto the end , - until the final spiritualization of all things . " The darkest hour precedes the dawn . " Arena of contest 96:12 This material world is even now becoming the arena for conflicting forces . On one side there will be discord and dismay ; on the other side there will be 96:15 Science and peace . The breaking up of mate-rial beliefs may seem to be famine and pestilence , want and woe , sin , sickness , and death , which assume new 96:18 phases until their nothingness appears . These disturb-ances will continue until the end of error , when all discord will be swallowed up in spiritual Truth . 96:21 Mortal error will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begun , and will continue until all errors of belief yield to understanding . Belief is 96:24 changeable , but spiritual understanding is changeless . Millennial glory As this consummation draws nearer , he who has shaped his course in accordance with divine Science 96:27 will endure to the end . As material knowl-edge diminishes and spiritual understanding increases , real objects will be apprehended mentally 96:30 instead of materially . During this final conflict , wicked minds will endeavor to find means by which to accomplish more evil ; but 97:1 those who discern Christian Science will hold crime in check . They will aid in the ejection of error . They 97:3 will maintain law and order , and cheerfully await the certainty of ultimate perfection . Dangerous resemblances In reality , the more closely error simulates truth and 97:6 so-called matter resembles its essence , mortal mind , the more impotent error becomes as a belief . Ac-cording to human belief , the lightning is fierce 97:9 and the electric current swift , yet in Christian Science the flight of one and the blow of the other will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 97:12 more its nothingness will appear , until matter reaches its mortal zenith in illusion and forever disappears . The nearer a false belief approaches truth without passing 97:15 the boundary where , having been destroyed by divine Love , it ceases to be even an illusion , the riper it becomes for destruction . The more material the belief , the more 97:18 obvious its error , until divine Spirit , supreme in its do-main , dominates all matter , and man is found in the like-ness of Spirit , his original being . 97:21 The broadest facts array the most falsities against themselves , for they bring error from under cover . It requires courage to utter truth ; for the higher Truth 97:24 lifts her voice , the louder will error scream , until its in-articulate sound is forever silenced in oblivion . " He uttered His voice , the earth melted . " This Scrip-97:27 ture indicates that all matter will disappear before the supremacy of Spirit . Christianity still rejected Christianity is again demonstrating the Life that is 97:30 Truth , and the Truth that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and healing the sick . Earth has no repayment for the persecutions which 98:1 attend a new step in Christianity ; but the spiritual recom-pense of the persecuted is assured in the elevation of ex-98:3 istence above mortal discord and in the gift of divine Love . Spiritual foreshadowings The prophet of to-day beholds in the mental horizon the signs of these times , the reappearance of the Chris-98:6 tianity which heals the sick and destroys error , and no other sign shall be given . Body can-not be saved except through Mind . The Science of Chris-98:9 tianity is misinterpreted by a material age , for it is the healing influence of Spirit ( not spirits ) which the material senses can not comprehend , which can only be spiritu-98:12 ally discerned . Creeds , doctrines , and human hypotheses do not express Christian Science ; much less can they demonstrate it . Revelation of Science 98:15 Beyond the frail premises of human beliefs , above the loosening grasp of creeds , the demonstration of Christian Mind-healing stands a revealed and practical 98:18 Science . It is imperious throughout all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and of Love , which remains inviolate for every man to understand and to 98:21 practise . Science as foreign to all religion For centuries - yea , always - natural science has not been considered a part of any religion , Christianity not 98:24 excepted . Even now multitudes consider that which they call science has no proper con-nection with faith and piety . Mystery does 98:27 not enshroud Christ 's teachings , and they are not theo-retical and fragmentary , but practical and complete ; and being practical and complete , they are not deprived of 98:30 their essential vitality . Key to the kingdom The way through which immortality and life are learned is not ecclesiastical but Christian , not human but divine , 99:1 not physical but metaphysical , not material but scien-tifically spiritual . Human philosophy , ethics , and super-99:3 stition afford no demonstrable divine Principle by which mortals can escape from sin ; yet to escape from sin , is what the Bible demands . " Work 99:6 out your own salvation with fear and trembling , " says the apostle , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worketh in you both to will and to do of His good 99:9 pleasure " ( Philippians ii . 12 , 13 ) . Truth has furnished the key to the kingdom , and with this key Christian Sci-ence has opened the door of the human understanding . 99:12 None may pick the lock nor enter by some other door . The ordinary teachings are material and not spiritual . Christian Science teaches only that which is spiritual and 99:15 divine , and not human . Christian Science is unerring and Divine ; the human sense of things errs because it is human . 99:18 Those individuals , who adopt theosophy , spiritualism , or hypnotism , may possess natures above some others who eschew their false beliefs . Therefore my contest is 99:21 not with the individual , but with the false system . I love mankind , and shall continue to labor and to endure . The calm , strong currents of true spirituality , the 99:24 manifestations of which are health , purity , and self-immolation , must deepen human experience , until the beliefs of material existence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sin , disease , and death give everlasting place to the scientific demonstration of divine Spirit and to God 's spiritual , perfect man . CHAPTER V - ANIMAL MAGNETISM UNMASKED For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts , murders , adulteries , fornications , thefts , false witness , blasphemies : these are the things which defile a man . - JESUS . Earliest investigations 100:1 MESMERISM or animal magnetism was first brought into notice by Mesmer in Germany in 1775 . Ac-100:3 cording to the American Cyclopaedia , he regarded this so-called force , which he said could be ex-erted by one living organism over another , as 100:6 a means of alleviating disease . His propositions were as follows : " There exists a mutual influence between the celestial 100:9 bodies , the earth , and animated things . Animal bodies are susceptible to the influence of this agent , disseminat-ing itself through the substance of the nerves . " 100:12 In 1784 , the French government ordered the medical faculty of Paris to investigate Mesmer 's theory and to report upon it . Under this order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the com-missioners . This commission reported to the govern-ment as follows : 100:18 " In regard to the existence and utility of animal mag-netism , we have come to the unanimous conclusions that there is no proof of the existence of the animal magnetic 101:1 fluid ; that the violent effects , which are observed in the public practice of magnetism , are due to manipula-101:3 tions , or to the excitement of the imagination and the impressions made upon the senses ; and that there is one more fact to be recorded in the history of the errors of 101:6 the human mind , and an important experiment upon the power of the imagination . " Clairvoyance , magnetism In 1837 , a committee of nine persons was appointed , 101:9 among whom were Roux , Bouillaud , and Clo-quet , which tested during several sessions the phenomena exhibited by a reputed clairvoyant . Their 101:12 report stated the results as follows : " The facts which had been promised by Monsieur Berna the magnetizer as conclusive , and as adapted to 101:15 throw light on physiological and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doctrine of animal magnetism , and have nothing in common with 101:18 either physiology or therapeutics . " This report was adopted by the Royal Academy of Medicine in Paris . Personal conclusions 101:21 The author 's own observations of the workings of animal magnetism convince her that it is not a remedial agent , and that its effects upon 101:24 those who practise it , and upon their subjects who do not resist it , lead to moral and to physical death . If animal magnetism seems to alleviate or to cure dis-101:27 ease , this appearance is deceptive , since error can not remove the effects of error . Discomfort under error is preferable to comfort . In no instance is the effect of 101:30 animal magnetism , recently called hypnotism , other than the effect of illusion . Any seeming benefit derived from it is proportional to one 's faith in esoteric magic . Mere negation 102:1 Animal magnetism has no scientific foundation , for God governs all that is real , harmonious , and eternal , and 102:3 His power is neither animal nor human . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Science animal magnetism , mesmerism , or hypnotism is 102:6 a mere negation , possessing neither intelligence , power , nor reality , and in sense it is an unreal concept of the so-called mortal mind . 102:9 There is but one real attraction , that of Spirit . The pointing of the needle to the pole symbolizes this all-embracing power or the attraction of God , divine Mind . 102:12 The planets have no more power over man than over his Maker , since God governs the universe ; but man , reflecting God 's power , has dominion over all the earth 102:15 and its hosts . Hidden agents The mild forms of animal magnetism are disappear-ing , and its aggressive features are coming to the front . 102:18 The looms of crime , hidden in the dark re-cesses of mortal thought , are every hour weav-ing webs more complicated and subtle . So secret are the 102:21 present methods of animal magnetism that they ensnare the age into indolence , and produce the very apathy on the subject which the criminal desires . The following 102:24 is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a problem not lending itself to an easy explanation and development . It implies the exercise 102:27 of despotic control , and is much more likely to be abused by its possessor , than otherwise employed , for the in-dividual or society . " Mental despotism 102:30 Mankind must learn that evil is not power . Its so-called despotism is but a phase of nothingness . Christian Science despoils the kingdom of evil , and pre-eminently 103:1 promotes affection and virtue in families and therefore in the community . The Apostle Paul refers to the 103:3 personification of evil as " the god of this world , " and further defines it as dishonesty and craftiness . Sin was the Assyrian moon-god . Liberation of mental powers 103:6 The destruction of the claims of mortal mind through Science , by which man can escape from sin and mortality , blesses the whole human fam-103:9 ily . As in the beginning , however , this libera-tion does not scientifically show itself in a knowledge of both good and evil , for the latter is unreal . 103:12 On the other hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because Mind-science is of God and demonstrates the divine Principle , 103:15 working out the purposes of good only . The maximum of good is the infinite God and His idea , the All-in-all . Evil is a suppositional lie . The genus of error 103:18 As named in Christian Science , animal magnetism or hypnotism is the specific term for error , or mortal mind . It is the false belief that mind is in matter , and 103:21 is both evil and good ; that evil is as real as good and more powerful . This belief has not one qual-ity of Truth . It is either ignorant or malicious . The 103:24 malicious form of hypnotism ultimates in moral idiocy . The truths of immortal Mind sustain man , and they anni-hilate the fables of mortal mind , whose flimsy and gaudy 103:27 pretensions , like silly moths , singe their own wings and fall into dust . Thought-transference In reality there is no mortal mind , and conse-103:30 quently no transference of mortal thought and will-power . Life and being are of God . In Christian Science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughts are true thoughts , passing from God to man . 104:3 When Christian Science and animal magnetism are both comprehended , as they will be at no distant date , it will be seen why the author of this book has been 104:6 so unjustly persecuted and belied by wolves in sheep 's clothing . Agassiz , the celebrated naturalist and author , has 104:9 wisely said : " Every great scientific truth goes through three stages . First , people say it conflicts with the Bible . Next , they say it has been discovered before . Lastly , 104:12 they say they have always believed it . " Perfection of divine government Christian Science goes to the bottom of mental action , and reveals the theodicy which indicates the rightness of 104:15 all divine action , as the emanation of divine Mind , and the consequent wrongness of the opposite so-called action , - evil , occultism , 104:18 necromancy , mesmerism , animal magnetism , hypnotism . Adulteration of Truth The medicine of Science is divine Mind ; and dishonesty , sensuality , falsehood , revenge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mental quali-ties which heal the sick . The hypnotizer employs one error to destroy another . If he heals sick-104:24 ness through a belief , and a belief originally caused the sickness , it is a case of the greater error overcoming the lesser . This greater error thereafter occupies the ground , 104:27 leaving the case worse than before it was grasped by the stronger error . Motives considered Our courts recognize evidence to prove the motive as 104:30 well as the commission of a crime . Is it not clear that the human mind must move the body to a wicked act ? Is not mortal mind the mur-105:1 derer ? The hands , without mortal mind to direct them , could not commit a murder . Mental crimes 105:3 Courts and juries judge and sentence mortals in order to restrain crime , to prevent deeds of violence or to punish them . To say that these tribunals have no 105:6 jurisdiction over the carnal or mortal mind , would be to contradict precedent and to admit that the power of human law is restricted to matter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real outlaw , defies justice and is recommended to mercy . Can matter commit a crime ? Can matter be punished ? Can you separate the men-105:12 tality from the body over which courts hold jurisdiction ? Mortal mind , not matter , is the criminal in every case ; and human law rightly estimates crime , and courts rea-105:15 sonably pass sentence , according to the motive . Important decision When our laws eventually take cognizance of mental crime and no longer apply legal rulings wholly to physical 105:18 offences , these words of Judge Parmenter of Boston will become historic : " I see no reason why metaphysics is not as important to medicine as to 105:21 mechanics or mathematics . " Evil let loose Whoever uses his developed mental powers like an es-caped felon to commit fresh atrocities as opportunity oc-105:24 curs is never safe . God will arrest him . Di-vine justice will manacle him . His sins will be millstones about his neck , weighing him down to the 105:27 depths of ignominy and death . The aggravation of er-ror foretells its doom , and confirms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they first make mad . " The misuse of mental power 105:30 The distance from ordinary medical prac-tice to Christian Science is full many a league in the line of light ; but to go in healing from the use of 106:1 inanimate drugs to the criminal misuse of human will-power , is to drop from the platform of common manhood 106:3 into the very mire of iniquity , to work against the free course of honesty and justice , and to push vainly against the current running heavenward . Proper self-government 106:6 Like our nation , Christian Science has its Declaration of Independence . God has endowed man with inalien-able rights , among which are self-government , 106:9 reason , and conscience . Man is properly self-governed only when he is guided rightly and governed by his Maker , divine Truth and Love . 106:12 Man 's rights are invaded when the divine order is in-terfered with , and the mental trespasser incurs the divine penalty due this crime . Right methods 106:15 Let this age , which sits in judgment on Christian Science , sanction only such methods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and classify 106:18 all others as did St. Paul in his great epistle to the Galatians , when he wrote as follows : " Now the works of the flesh are manifest , which are 106:21 these ; Adultery , fornication , uncleanness , lasciviousness , idolatry , witchcraft , hatred , variance , emulations , wrath , strife , seditions , heresies , envyings , murders , drunkenness , 106:24 revellings and such like : of the which I tell you before , as I have also told you in time past , that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God . But 106:27 the fruit of the Spirit is love , joy , peace , longsuffering , gentleness , goodness , faith , meekness , temperance : against such there is no law . " CHAPTER VI - SCIENCE , THEOLOGY , MEDICINE But I certify you , brethren , that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man . For I neither received it of man , neither was I taught it , but by the revelation of Jesus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like unto leaven , which a woman took , and hid in three measures of meal , till the whole was leavened. - JESUS . Christian Science discovered 107:1 In the year 1866 , I discovered the Christ Science or divine laws of Life , Truth , and Love , and 107:3 named my discovery Christian Science . God had been graciously preparing me during many years for the reception of this final revelation of the ab-107:6 solute divine Principle of scientific mental healing . Mission of Christian Science This apodictical Principle points to the revelation of Immanuel , " God with us , " - the sovereign ever-pres-107:9 ence , delivering the children of men from every ill " that flesh is heir to . " Through Christian Science , religion and medicine are 107:12 inspired with a diviner nature and essence ; fresh pinions are given to faith and understanding , and thoughts ac-quaint themselves intelligently with God . Discontent with life 107:15 Feeling so perpetually the false consciousness that life inheres in the body , yet remembering that in reality God is our Life , we may well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we must say , " I have no pleasure in them . " 108:1 Whence came to me this heavenly conviction , - a con-viction antagonistic to the testimony of the physical senses ? 108:3 According to St. Paul , it was " the gift of the grace of God given unto me by the effectual working of His power . " It was the divine law of Life and Love , unfolding to me 108:6 the demonstrable fact that matter possesses neither sen-sation nor life ; that human experiences show the falsity of all material things ; and that immortal cravings , " the 108:9 price of learning love , " establish the truism that the only sufferer is mortal mind , for the divine Mind can not suffer . Demonstrable evidence 108:12 My conclusions were reached by allowing the evidence of this revelation to multiply with mathematical certainty and the lesser demonstration to prove the 108:15 greater , as the product of three multiplied by three , equalling nine , proves conclusively that three times three duodecillions must be nine duodecillions , - not 108:18 a fraction more , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparently near the confines of mortal existence , standing already within the shadow of the death-valley , 108:21 I learned these truths in divine Science : that all real being is in God , the divine Mind , and that Life , Truth , and Love are all-powerful and ever-108:24 present ; that the opposite of Truth , - called error , sin , sickness , disease , death , - is the false testimony of false material sense , of mind in matter ; that this false sense 108:27 evolves , in belief , a subjective state of mortal mind which this same so-called mind names matter thereby shutting out the true sense of Spirit . New lines of thought 108:30 My discovery , that erring , mortal , misnamed mind produces all the organism and action of the mortal body , set my thoughts to work in new channels , 109:1 and led up to my demonstration of the proposition that Mind is All and matter is naught as the leading factor in 109:3 Mind-science . Scientific evidence Christian Science reveals incontrovertibly that Mind is All-in-all , that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This great fact is not , however , seen to be supported by sensible evidence , until its divine Principle is demonstrated by healing the sick and 109:9 thus proved absolute and divine . This proof once seen , no other conclusion can be reached . Solitary research For three years after my discovery , I sought the solu-109:12 tion of this problem of Mind-healing , searched the Scrip-tures and read little else , kept aloof from so-ciety , and devoted time and energies to dis-109:15 covering a positive rule . The search was sweet , calm , and buoyant with hope , not selfish nor depressing . I knew the Principle of all harmonious Mind-action to be God , 109:18 and that cures were produced in primitive Christian healing by holy , uplifting faith ; but I must know the Science of this healing , and I won my way to absolute 109:21 conclusions through divine revelation , reason , and dem-onstration . The revelation of Truth in the understand-ing came to me gradually and apparently through divine 109:24 power . When a new spiritual idea is borne to earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Unto us a child is born , . . . and his name shall be 109:27 called Wonderful . " Jesus once said of his lessons : " My doctrine is not mine , but His that sent me . If any man will do His will , 109:30 he shall know of the doctrine , whether it be of God , or whether I speak of myself . " ( John vii . 16,17 . ) God 's allness learned The three great verities of Spirit , omnipotence , omni-110:1 presence , omniscience , - Spirit possessing all power , filling all space , constituting all Science , - contradict 110:3 forever the belief that matter can be actual . These eternal verities reveal primeval exist-ence as the radiant reality of God 's creation , 110:6 in which all that He has made is pronounced by His wis-dom good . Thus it was that I beheld , as never before , the awful 110:9 unreality called evil . The equipollence of God brought to light another glorious proposition , - man 's perfecti-bility and the establishment of the kingdom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these leadings of scientific revelation , the Bible was my only textbook . The Scriptures were 110:15 illumined ; reason and revelation were recon-ciled , and afterwards the truth of Christian Science was demonstrated . No human pen nor tongue 110:18 taught me the Science contained in this book , SCIENCE AND HEALTH ; and neither tongue nor pen can over-throw it . This book may be distorted by shallow criti-110:21 cism or by careless or malicious students , and its ideas may be temporarily abused and misrepresented ; but the Science and truth therein will forever remain to be dis-110:24 cerned and demonstrated . The demonstration lost and found Jesus demonstrated the power of Christian Science to heal mortal minds and bodies . But this power was lost 110:27 sight of , and must again be spiritually dis-cerned , taught , and demonstrated according to Christ 's command , with " signs following . " 110:30 Its Science must be apprehended by as many as believe on Christ and spiritually understand Truth . Mystical antagonists No analogy exists between the vague hypotheses of 111:1 agnosticism , pantheism , theosophy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tian Science ; and I find the will , or sensuous reason of the human mind , to be opposed to the divine Mind as expressed through divine Science . Optical illustration of Science 111:6 Christian Science is natural , but not physical . The Science of God and man is no more supernatural than is the science of numbers , though departing 111:9 from the realm of the physical , as the Science of God , Spirit , must , some may deny its right to the name of Science . The Principle of divine metaphysics 111:12 is God ; the practice of divine metaphysics is the utiliza-tion of the power of Truth over error ; its rules demon-strate its Science . Divine metaphysics reverses perverted 111:15 and physical hypotheses as to Deity , even as the ex-planation of optics rejects the incidental or inverted image and shows what this inverted image is meant to 111:18 represent . Pertinent proposal A prize of one hundred pounds , offered in Oxford Uni-versity , England , for the best essay on Natural Science , 111:21 - an essay calculated to offset the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ causes rather than to a final spiritual cause , - is one of 111:24 many incidents which show that Christian Science meets a yearning of the human race for spirituality . Confirmatory tests After a lengthy examination of my discovery and its 111:27 demonstration in healing the sick , this fact became evi-dent to me , - that Mind governs the body , not partially but wholly . I submitted my 111:30 metaphysical system of treating disease to the broad-est practical tests . Since then this system has gradually gained ground , and has proved itself , whenever scien-112:1 tifically employed , to be the most effective curative agent in medical practice . One school of Truth 112:3 Is there more than one school of Christian Science ? Christian Science is demonstrable . There can , there-fore , be but one method in its teaching . Those who de-112:6 part from this method forfeit their claims to belong to its school , and they become adher-ents of the Socratic , the Platonic , the Spencerian , or some 112:9 other school . By this is meant that they adopt and ad-here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinions may have occasional gleams of 112:12 divinity , borrowed from that truly divine Science which eschews man-made systems , they nevertheless remain wholly human in their origin and tendency and are not 112:15 scientifically Christian . Unchanging Principle From the infinite One in Christian Science comes one Principle and its infinite idea , and with this infinitude 112:18 come spiritual rules , laws , and their demonstration , which , like the great Giver , are " the same yesterday , and to-day , and forever ; " for thus are 112:21 the divine Principle of healing and the Christ-idea charac-terized in the epistle to the Hebrews . On sandy foundations Any theory of Christian Science , which departs from 112:24 what has already been stated and proved to be true , af-fords no foundation upon which to establish a genuine school of this Science . Also , if any 112:27 so-called new school claims to be Christian Science , and yet uses another author 's discoveries without giving that author proper credit , such a school is erroneous , for it 112:30 inculcates a breach of that divine commandment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Principle and practice God is the Principle of divine metaphysics . As there 113:1 is but one God , there can be but one divine Principle of all Science ; and there must be fixed rules for the demon-113:3 stration of this divine Principle . The letter of Science plentifully reaches humanity to-day , but its spirit comes only in small degrees . The vital part , 113:6 the heart and soul of Christian Science , is Love . With-out this , the letter is but the dead body of Science , - pulseless , cold , inanimate . Reversible propositions 113:9 The fundamental propositions of divine metaphysics are summarized in the four following , to me , self-evident propositions . Even if reversed , these proposi-113:12 tions will be found to agree in statement and proof , showing mathematically their exact relation to Truth . De Quincey says mathematics has not a foot to 113:15 stand upon which is not purely metaphysical. 1 . God is All-in-all. 2 . God is good . Good is Mind . 113:18 3 . God , Spirit , being all , nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good , deny death , evil , sin , disease . - Disease , sin , evil , death , deny good , omnipo-113:21 tent God , Life . Which of the denials in proposition four is true ? Both are not , can not be , true . According to the Scripture , 113:24 I find that God is true , " but every mortal man a liar . " Metaphysical inversions The divine metaphysics of Christian Science , like the 113:27 method in mathematics , proves the rule by inversion . For example : There is no pain in Truth , and no truth in pain ; no nerve in Mind , and no 113:30 mind in nerve ; no matter in Mind , and no mind in mat-ter ; no matter in Life , and no life in matter ; no matter in good , and no good in matter . Definition of mortal mind 114:1 Usage classes both evil and good together as mind ; therefore , to be understood , the author calls sick and sin-114:3 ful humanity mortal mind , - meaning by this term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evil in contradistinction to the divine Mind , or 114:6 Truth and good . The spiritually unscientific definition of mind is based on the evidence of the physical senses , which makes minds many and calls mind both human and 114:9 divine . In Science , Mind is one , including noumenon and phe-nomena , God and His thoughts . Imperfect terminology 114:12 Mortal mind is a solecism in language , and involves an improper use of the word mind . As Mind is immortal , the phrase mortal mind implies something un-114:15 true and therefore unreal ; and as the phrase is used in teaching Christian Science , it is meant to designate that which has no real existence . Indeed , if 114:18 a better word or phrase could be suggested , it would be used ; but in expressing the new tongue we must sometimes recur to the old and imperfect , and the new 114:21 wine of the Spirit has to be poured into the old bottles of the letter . Causation mental Christian Science explains all cause and effect as men-114:24 tal , not physical . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It shows the scientific relation of man to God , disentangles the interlaced ambiguities 114:27 of being , and sets free the imprisoned thought . In divine Science , the universe , including man , is spiritual , harmoni-ous , and eternal . Science shows that what is termed mat-114:30 ter is but the subjective state of what is termed by the author mortal mind . Philological inadequacy Apart from the usual opposition to everything new , 115:1 the one great obstacle to the reception of that spiritual-ity , through which the understanding of Mind-science 115:3 comes , is the inadequacy of material terms for metaphysical statements , and the consequent difficulty of so expressing metaphysical ideas as to make 115:6 them comprehensible to any reader , who has not person-ally demonstrated Christian Science as brought forth in my discovery . Job says : " The ear trieth words , as the 115:9 mouth tasteth meat . " The great difficulty is to give the right impression , when translating material terms back into the original spiritual tongue . 115:12 SCIENTIFIC TRANSLATION OF IMMORTAL MIND Divine synonyms GOD : Divine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spirit , Mind . Divine image 115:15 MAN : God 's spiritual idea , individual , per-fect , eternal . Divine reflection IDEA : An image in Mind ; the immediate 115:18 object of understanding . - Webster . SCIENTIFIC TRANSLATION OF MORTAL MIND First Degree : Depravity . Unreality 115:21 PHYSICAL .

Reality SPIRITUAL . Wisdom , purity , spiritual understanding , 116:3 spiritual power , love , health , holiness . Spiritual universe In the third degree mortal mind disappears , and man as God 's image appears . Science so reverses the evidence 116:6 before the corporeal human senses , as to make this Scriptural testimony true in our hearts , " The last shall be first , and the first last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be to us what divinity really is and must of necessity be , - all-inclusive . Aim of Science A correct view of Christian Science and of its adapta-116:12 tion to healing includes vastly more than is at first seen . Works on metaphysics leave the grand point untouched . They never crown the power of 116:15 Mind as the Messiah , nor do they carry the day against physical enemies , - even to the extinction of all belief in matter , evil , disease , and death , - nor insist upon the fact 116:18 that God is all , therefore that matter is nothing beyond an image in mortal mind . Divine personality Christian Science strongly emphasizes the thought that 116:21 God is not corporeal , but incorporeal , - that is , bodiless . Mortals are corporeal , but God is incorporeal. 116:24 As the words person and personal are commonly and ignorantly employed , they often lead , when applied to Deity , to confused and erroneous conceptions of divinity 116:27 and its distinction from humanity . If the term personality , as applied to God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , - in the sense of infinite personality , but 116:30 not in the lower sense . An infinite Mind in a finite form is an absolute impossibility . 117:1 The term individuality is also open to objections , be-cause an individual may be one of a series , one of many , 117:3 as an individual man , an individual horse ; whereas God is One , - not one of a series , but one alone and without an equal . Spiritual language 117:6 God is Spirit ; therefore the language of Spirit must be , and is , spiritual . Christian Science attaches no physi-cal nature and significance to the Supreme 117:9 Being or His manifestation ; mortals alone do this . God 's essential language is spoken of in the last chapter of Mark 's Gospel as the new tongue , the spir-117:12 itual meaning of which is attained through " signs following . " The miracles of Jesus Ear hath not heard , nor hath lip spoken , the pure lan-117:15 guage of Spirit . Our Master taught spirituality by simili-tudes and parables . As a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demon-117:18 strating Life and Truth in himself and by his power over the sick and sinning . Human theories are inadequate to interpret the divine Principle involved in the miracles 117:21 ( marvels ) wrought by Jesus and especially in his mighty , crowning , unparalleled , and triumphant exit from the flesh . Opacity of the senses 117:24 Evidence drawn from the five physical senses relates solely to human reason ; and because of opaci-ty to the true light , human reason dimly re-117:27 flects and feebly transmits Jesus ' works and words . Truth is a revelation . Leaven of Truth Jesus bade his disciples beware of the leaven of the 117:30 Pharisees and of the Sadducees , which he de-fined as human doctrines . His parable of the " leaven , which a woman took , and hid in three measures 118:1 of meal , till the whole was leavened , " impels the infer-ence that the spiritual leaven signifies the Science of Christ 118:3 and its spiritual interpretation , - an inference far above the merely ecclesiastical and formal applications of the illustration . 118:6 Did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the second appearing in the flesh of the Christ , Truth , hidden in sacred secrecy from the visi-118:9 ble world ? Ages pass , but this leaven of Truth is ever at work . It must destroy the entire mass of error , and so be eternally 118:12 glorified in man 's spiritual freedom . The divine and human contrasted In their spiritual significance , Science , Theology , and Medicine are means of divine thought , which include spirit-118:15 ual laws emanating from the invisible and in-finite power and grace . The parable may import that these spiritual laws , perverted by 118:18 a perverse material sense of law , are metaphysically pre-sented as three measures of meal , - that is , three modes of mortal thought . In all mortal forms of thought , dust 118:21 is dignified as the natural status of men and things , and modes of material motion are honored with the name of laws . This continues until the leaven of Spirit changes 118:24 the whole of mortal thought , as yeast changes the chemical properties of meal . Certain contradictions The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ science , represent a kingdom necessarily divided against itself , because these definitions portray law as physical , not spiritual . Therefore they con-118:30 tradict the divine decrees and violate the law of Love , in which nature and God are one and the natural order of heaven comes down to earth . Unescapable dilemma 119:1 When we endow matter with vague spiritual power , that is , when we do so in our theories , for of course we 119:3 can not really endow matter with what it does not and can not possess , - we disown the Al-mighty , for such theories lead to one of two things . They 119:6 either presuppose the self-evolution and self-government of matter , or else they assume that matter is the product of Spirit . To seize the first horn of this dilemma and con-119:9 sider matter as a power in and of itself , is to leave the cre-ator out of His own universe ; while to grasp the other horn of the dilemma and regard God as the creator of 119:12 matter , is not only to make Him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to announce Him as their source , thereby making Him guilty of maintaining perpet-119:15 ual misrule in the form and under the name of natural law . God and nature In one sense God is identical with nature , but this na-119:18 ture is spiritual and is not expressed in matter . The law-giver , whose lightning palsies or prostrates in death the child at prayer , is not the divine ideal 119:21 of omnipresent Love . God is natural good , and is repre-sented only by the idea of goodness ; while evil should be regarded as unnatural , because it is opposed to the nature 119:24 of Spirit , God . The sun and Soul In viewing the sunrise , one finds that it contradicts the evidence before the senses to believe that the earth 119:27 is in motion and the sun at rest . As astron-omy reverses the human perception of the movement of the solar system , so Christian Science re-119:30 verses the seeming relation of Soul and body and makes body tributary to Mind . Thus it is with man , who is but the humble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ otherwise to finite sense . But we shall never under-stand this while we admit that soul is in body or mind in 120:3 matter , and that man is included in non-intelligence . Soul , or Spirit , is God , unchangeable and eternal ; and man coexists with and reflects Soul , God , for man is God 's 120:6 image . Reversal of testimony Science reverses the false testimony of the physical senses , and by this reversal mortals arrive at the funda-120:9 mental facts of being . Then the question in-evitably arises : Is a man sick if the material senses indicate that he is in good health ? No ! for matter 120:12 can make no conditions for man . And is he well if the senses say he is sick ? Yes , he is well in Science in which health is normal and disease is abnormal . Health and the senses 120:15 Health is not a condition of matter , but of Mind ; nor can the material senses bear reliable testimony on the sub-ject of health . The Science of Mind-healing 120:18 shows it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or to exhibit the real status of man . There-fore the divine Principle of Science , reversing the testi-120:21 mony of the physical senses , reveals man as harmoniously existent in Truth , which is the only basis of health ; and thus Science denies all disease , heals the sick , overthrows 120:24 false evidence , and refutes materialistic logic . Any conclusion pro or con , deduced from supposed sen-sation in matter or from matter 's supposed consciousness 120:27 of health or disease , instead of reversing the testimony of the physical senses , confirms that testimony as legitimate and so leads to disease . Historic illustrations 120:30 When Columbus gave freer breath to the globe , ignorance and superstition chained the limbs of the brave old navigator , and disgrace and star-121:1 vation stared him in the face ; but sterner still would have been his fate , if his discovery had undermined the favor-121:3 ite inclinations of a sensuous philosophy . Copernicus mapped out the stellar system , and before he spake , astrography was chaotic , and the heavenly fields 121:6 were incorrectly explored . Perennial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of empires and the fortunes of men . Though no higher 121:9 revelation than the horoscope was to them dis-played upon the empyrean , earth and heaven were bright , and bird and blossom were glad in God 's 121:12 perennial and happy sunshine , golden with Truth . So we have goodness and beauty to gladden the heart ; but man , left to the hypotheses of material sense unexplained 121:15 by Science , is as the wandering comet or the desolate star - " a weary searcher for a viewless home . " Astronomic unfoldings The earth 's diurnal rotation is invisible to the physical 121:18 eye , and the sun seems to move from east to west , instead of the earth from west to east . Until rebuked by clearer views of the everlasting facts , this 121:21 false testimony of the eye deluded the judgment and in-duced false conclusions . Science shows appearances often to be erroneous , and corrects these errors by the simple 121:24 rule that the greater controls the lesser . The sun is the central stillness , so far as our solar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun once a year , besides 121:27 turning daily on its own axis . As thus indicated , astronomical order imitates the action of divine Principle ; and the universe , the reflec-121:30 tion of God , is thus brought nearer the spiritual fact , and is allied to divine Science as displayed in the everlasting government of the universe . Opposing testimony 122:1 The evidence of the physical senses often reverses the real Science of being , and so creates a reign of discord , - 122:3 assigning seeming power to sin , sickness , and death ; but the great facts of Life , rightly un-derstood , defeat this triad of errors , contradict their false 122:6 witnesses , and reveal the kingdom of heaven , - the actual reign of harmony on earth . The material senses ' re-versal of the Science of Soul was practically exposed nine-122:9 teen hundred years ago by the demonstrations of Jesus ; yet these so-called senses still make mortal mind tributary to mortal body , and ordain certain sections of matter , such 122:12 as brain and nerves , as the seats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this so-called mind its status of happiness or misery . Testimony of the senses 122:15 The optical focus is another proof of the illusion of material sense . On the eye 's retina , sky and tree-tops apparently join hands , clouds and ocean meet 122:18 and mingle . The barometer , - that little prophet of storm and sunshine , denying the testimony of the senses , - points to fair weather in the midst of murky 122:21 clouds and drenching rain . Experience is full of instances of similar illusions , which every thinker can recall for himself . Spiritual sense of life 122:24 To material sense , the severance of the jugular vein takes away life ; but to spiritual sense and in Science , Life goes on unchanged and 122:27 being is eternal . Temporal life is a false sense of existence . Ptolemaic and psychical error Our theories make the same mistake regarding Soul 122:30 and body that Ptolemy made regarding the solar system . They insist that soul is in body and mind therefore tribu-tary to matter . Astronomical science has destroyed the 123:1 false @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Christian Science will surely destroy the greater error as 123:3 to our terrestrial bodies . The true idea and Principle of man will then appear . The Ptole-maic blunder could not affect the harmony of 123:6 being as does the error relating to soul and body , which reverses the order of Science and assigns to matter the power and prerogative of Spirit , so that man becomes 123:9 the most absolutely weak and inharmonious creature in the universe . Seeming and being The verity of Mind shows conclusively how it is that 123:12 matter seems to be , but is not . Divine Science , rising above physical theories , excludes matter , resolves things into thoughts , and replaces the objects of 123:15 material sense with spiritual ideas . The term CHRISTIAN SCIENCE was introduced by the author to designate the scientific system of divine 123:18 healing . The revelation consists of two parts : 1 . The discovery of this divine Science of Mind-123:21 healing , through a spiritual sense of the Scriptures and through the teachings of the Comforter , as promised by the Master . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the so-called miracles of Jesus did not specially belong to a dispensation now ended , but that they illustrated an 123:27 ever-operative divine Principle . The operation of this Principle indicates the eternality of the scientific order and continuity of being . Scientific basis 123:30 Christian Science differs from material sci-ence , but not on that account is it less scien-tific . On the contrary , Christian Science is pre-emi-124:1 mently scientific , being based on Truth , the Principle of all science . Physical science a blind belief 124:3 Physical science ( so-called ) is human knowledge , - a law of mortal mind , a blind belief , a Samson shorn of his strength . When this human belief lacks organ-124:6 izations to support it , its foundations are gone . Having neither moral might , spiritual basis , nor holy Principle of its own , this belief mistakes effect 124:9 for cause and seeks to find life and intelligence in matter , thus limiting Life and holding fast to discord and death . In a word , human belief is a blind conclusion from material 124:12 reasoning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which immortal Spirit silences forever . Right interpretation The universe , like man , is to be interpreted by Science 124:15 from its divine Principle , God , and then it can be under-stood ; but when explained on the basis of physical sense and represented as subject to 124:18 growth , maturity , and decay , the universe , like man , is , and must continue to be , an enigma . All force mental Adhesion , cohesion , and attraction are properties of 124:21 Mind . They belong to divine Principle , and support the equipoise of that thought-force , which launched the earth in its orbit and said to the 124:24 proud wave , " Thus far and no farther . " Spirit is the life , substance , and continuity of all things . We tread on forces . Withdraw them , and 124:27 creation must collapse . Human knowledge calls them forces of matter ; but divine Science declares that they belong wholly to divine Mind , are inherent in this 124:30 Mind , and so restores them to their rightful home and classification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body and 125:1 of the physical world will change as mortal mind changes its beliefs . What is now considered the best condition 125:3 for organic and functional health in the human body may no longer be found indispensable to health . Moral conditions will be found always har-125:6 monious and health-giving . Neither organic inaction nor overaction is beyond God 's control ; and man will be found normal and natural to changed mortal thought , 125:9 and therefore more harmonious in his manifestations than he was in the prior states which human belief created and sanctioned . 125:12 As human thought changes from one stage to an-other of conscious pain and painlessness , sorrow and joy , - from fear to hope and from faith to understand-125:15 ing , - the visible manifestation will at last be man gov-erned by Soul , not by material sense . Reflecting God 's government , man is self-governed . When subordinate 125:18 to the divine Spirit , man can not be controlled by sin or death , thus proving our material theories about laws of health to be valueless . The time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes of time and tide , cold and heat , latitude and longitude . The agri-culturist will find that these changes can not 125:24 affect his crops . " As a vesture shalt Thou change them and they shall be changed . " The mariner will have dominion over the atmosphere and the great 125:27 deep , over the fish of the sea and the fowls of the air . The astronomer will no longer look up to the stars , - he will look out from them upon the universe ; and the 125:30 florist will find his flower before its seed . Mortal nothingness Thus matter will finally be proved nothing more than a mortal belief , wholly inadequate to affect a man 126:1 through its supposed organic action or supposed exist-ence . Error will be no longer used in stating truth . The 126:3 problem of nothingness , or " dust to dust , " will be solved , and mortal mind will be without form and void , for mortality will cease when man beholds 126:6 himself God 's reflection , even as man sees his reflection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is divine . Human thought never pro-126:9 jected the least portion of true being . Human belief has sought and interpreted in its own way the echo of Spirit , and so seems to have 126:12 reversed it and repeated it materially ; but the human mind never produced a real tone nor sent forth a positive sound . Antagonistic questions 126:15 The point at issue between Christian Science on the one hand and popular theology on the other is this : Shall Science explain cause and effect as being 126:18 both natural and spiritual ? Or shall all that is beyond the cognizance of the material senses be called supernatural , and be left to the mercy of speculative 126:21 hypotheses ? Biblical basis I have set forth Christian Science and its application to the treatment of disease just as I have discovered them . 126:24 I have demonstrated through Mind the effects of Truth on the health , longevity , and morals of men ; and I have found nothing in ancient or in modern 126:27 systems on which to found my own , except the teachings and demonstrations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apostles . The Bible has been my only au-126:30 thority . I have had no other guide in " the straight and narrow way " of Truth . Science and Christianity If Christendom resists the author 's application of the 127:1 word Science to Christianity , or questions her use of the word Science , she will not therefore lose faith in Chris-127:3 tianity , nor will Christianity lose its hold upon her . If God , the All-in-all , be the creator of the spiritual universe , including man , then everything 127:6 entitled to a classification as truth , or Science , must be comprised in a knowledge or understanding of God , for there can be nothing beyond illimitable divinity . Scientific terms 127:9 The terms Divine Science , Spiritual Science , Christ Science or Christian Science , or Science alone , she em-ploys interchangeably , according to the re-127:12 quirements of the context . These synony-mous terms stand for everything relating to God , the in-finite , supreme , eternal Mind . It may be said , however , 127:15 that the term Christian Science relates especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God , not as the author of sin , sickness , and death , 127:18 but as divine Principle , Supreme Being , Mind , exempt from all evil . It teaches that matter is the falsity , not the fact , of existence ; that nerves , brain , stomach , lungs , 127:21 and so forth , have - as matter - no intelligence , life , nor sensation . No physical science There is no physical science , inasmuch as all truth 127:24 proceeds from the divine Mind . Therefore truth is not human , and is not a law of matter , for matter is not a lawgiver . Science is an emanation of 127:27 divine Mind , and is alone able to interpret God aright . It has a spiritual , and not a material origin . It is a divine utterance , - the Comforter which leadeth into all truth . 127:30 Christian Science eschews what is called natural science , in so far as this is built on the false hypotheses that matter is its own lawgiver , that law is founded on material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the might of divine Mind . Good is natural and primitive . It is not 128:3 miraculous to itself . Practical Science The term Science , properly understood , refers only to the laws of God and to His government of the universe , 128:6 inclusive of man . From this it follows that business men and cultured scholars have found that Christian Science enhances their endurance and 128:9 mental powers , enlarges their perception of character , gives them acuteness and comprehensiveness and an ability to exceed their ordinary capacity . The human 128:12 mind , imbued with this spiritual understanding , becomes more elastic , is capable of greater endurance , escapes somewhat from itself , and requires less repose . A knowl-128:15 edge of the Science of being develops the latent abilities and possibilities of man . It extends the atmosphere of thought , giving mortals access to broader and higher 128:18 realms . It raises the thinker into his native air of insight and perspicacity . An odor becomes beneficent and agreeable only in pro-128:21 portion to its escape into the surrounding atmosphere . So it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarrel with his fellow-man for waking him from 128:24 a cataleptic nightmare , he should not resist Truth , which banishes - yea , forever destroys with the higher testi-mony of Spirit - the so-called evidence of matter . Mathematics and scientific logic 128:27 Science relates to Mind , not matter . It rests on fixed Principle and not upon the judgment of false sensation . The addition of two sums in mathematics must 128:30 always bring the same result . So is it with logic . If both the major and the minor propo-sitions of a syllogism are correct , the conclusion , if properly 129:1 drawn , can not be false . So in Christian Science there are no discords nor contradictions , because its logic is as 129:3 harmonious as the reasoning of an accurately stated syl-logism or of a properly computed sum in arithmetic . Truth is ever truthful , and can tolerate no error in 129:6 premise or conclusion . Truth by inversion If you wish to know the spiritual fact , you can discover it by reversing the material fable , be the 129:9 fable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your preconceptions or utterly contrary to them . Antagonistic theories Pantheism may be defined as a belief in the intelli-129:12 gence of matter , - a belief which Science overthrows . In those days there will be " great tribulation such as was not since the beginning of the 129:15 world ; " and earth will echo the cry , " Art thou Truth come hither to torment us before the time ? " Animal magnetism , hypnotism , spiritualism , theosophy , agnos-129:18 ticism , pantheism , and infidelity are antagonistic to true being and fatal to its demonstration ; and so are some other systems . Ontology needed 129:21 We must abandon pharmaceutics , and take up ontol-ogy , - " the science of real being . " We must look deep into realism instead of accepting only the out-129:24 ward sense of things . Can we gather peaches from a pine-tree , or learn from discord the concord of being ? Yet quite as rational are some of the leading 129:27 illusions along the path which Science must tread in its reformatory mission among mortals . The very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 129:30 The generous liver may object to the author 's small estimate of the pleasures of the table . The sinner sees , in the system taught in this book , that the demands of 130:1 God must be met . The petty intellect is alarmed by con-stant appeals to Mind . The licentious disposition is dis-130:3 couraged over its slight spiritual prospects . When all men are bidden to the feast , the ex-cuses come . One has a farm , another has merchandise , 130:6 and therefore they can not accept . Excuses for ignorance It is vain to speak dishonestly of divine Science , which destroys all discord , when you can demonstrate 130:9 the actuality of Science . It is unwise to doubt if reality is in perfect harmony with God , divine Principle , - if Science , when understood and demonstrated , will 130:12 destroy all discord , - since you admit that God is om-nipotent ; for from this premise it follows that good and its sweet concords have all-power . Children and adults 130:15 Christian Science , properly understood , would dis-abuse the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and these material 130:18 beliefs must be denied and cast out to make place for truth . You can not add to the contents of a vessel already full . Laboring long to shake the adult 's 130:21 faith in matter and to inculcate a grain of faith in God , - an inkling of the ability of Spirit to make the body har-monious , - the author has often remembered our Master 's 130:24 love for little children , and understood how truly such as they belong to the heavenly kingdom . All evil unnatural If thought is startled at the strong claim of Science 130:27 for the supremacy of God , or Truth , and doubts the su-premacy of good , ought we not , contrari-wise , to be astounded at the vigorous claims 130:30 of evil and doubt them , and no longer think it natural to love sin and unnatural to forsake it , - no longer imagine evil to be ever-present and good absent ? Truth should 131:1 not seem so surprising and unnatural as error , and error should not seem so real as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health . There is no error in Science , and our lives must be governed by reality in order to be in har-mony with God , the divine Principle of all being . The error of carnality 131:6 When once destroyed by divine Science , the false evi-dence before the corporeal senses disappears . Hence the opposition of sensuous man to the Science of 131:9 Soul and the significance of the Scripture , " The carnal mind is enmity against God . " The central fact of the Bible is the superiority of spiritual over physical power . 131:12 THEOLOGY Churchly neglect Must Christian Science come through the Christian churches as some persons insist ? This Science has come 131:15 already , after the manner of God 's appoint-ing , but the churches seem not ready to re-ceive it , according to the Scriptural saying , " He came 131:18 unto his own , and his own received him not . " Jesus once said : " I thank Thee , O Father , Lord of heaven and earth , that Thou hast hid these things from the wise 131:21 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so , Father , for so it seemed good in Thy sight . " As afore-time , the spirit of the Christ , which taketh away the cere-131:24 monies and doctrines of men , is not accepted until the hearts of men are made ready for it . John the Baptist , and the Messiah The mission of Jesus confirmed prophecy , and ex-131:27 plained the so-called miracles of olden time as natural demonstrations of the divine power , demonstra-tions which were not understood . Jesus ' works 131:30 established his claim to the Messiahship . In reply to John 's inquiry , " Art thou he that should come , " 132:1 Jesus returned an affirmative reply , recounting his works instead of referring to his doctrine , confident that this 132:3 exhibition of the divine power to heal would fully an-swer the question . Hence his reply : " Go and show John again those things which ye do hear and see : the 132:6 blind receive their sight and the lame walk , the lepers are cleansed , and the deaf hear , the dead are raised up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And 132:9 blessed is he , whosoever shall not be offended in me . " In other words , he gave his benediction to any one who should not deny that such effects , coming from divine 132:12 Mind , prove the unity of God , - the divine principle which brings out all harmony . Christ rejected The Pharisees of old thrust the spiritual idea and the 132:15 man who lived it out of their synagogues , and retained their materialistic beliefs about God . Jesus ' system of healing received no aid nor approval 132:18 from other sanitary or religious systems , from doctrines of physics or of divinity ; and it has not yet been generally accepted . To-day , as of yore , unconscious of the 132:21 reappearing of the spiritual idea , blind belief shuts the door upon it , and condemns the cure of the sick and sin-ning if it is wrought on any but a material and a doctrinal 132:24 theory . Anticipating this rejection of idealism , of the true idea of God , - this salvation from all error , physi-cal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Son of man 132:27 cometh , shall he find faith on the earth ? " John 's misgivings Did the doctrines of John the Baptist confer healing power upon him , or endow him with the truest concep-132:30 tion of the Christ ? This righteous preacher once pointed his disciples to Jesus as " the Lamb of God ; " yet afterwards he seriously questioned 133:1 the signs of the Messianic appearing , and sent the inquiry to Jesus , " Art thou he that should come ? " Faith according to works 133:3 Was John 's faith greater than that of the Samaritan woman , who said , " Is not this the Christ ? " There was also a certain centurion of whose 133:6 faith Jesus himself declared , " I have not found so great faith , no , not in Israel . " In Egypt , it was Mind which saved the Israelites from 133:9 belief in the plagues . In the wilderness , streams flowed from the rock , and manna fell from the sky . The Israelites looked upon the brazen serpent , and straightway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of vipers . In national prosperity , miracles attended the successes of the Hebrews ; but when they departed from the true 133:15 idea , their demoralization began . Even in captivity among foreign nations , the divine Principle wrought wonders for the people of God in the fiery furnace and 133:18 in kings ' palaces . Judaism antipathetic Judaism was the antithesis of Christianity , because Judaism engendered the limited form of a national or 133:21 tribal religion . It was a finite and material system , carried out in special theories concern-ing God , man , sanitary methods , and a religious cultus. 133:24 That he made " himself equal with God , " was one of the Jewish accusations against him who planted Christianity on the foundation of Spirit , who taught as he was in-133:27 spired by the Father and would recognize no life , intelli-gence , nor substance outside of God . Priestly learning The Jewish conception of God , as Yawah , Jehovah , 133:30 or only a mighty hero and king , has not quite given place to the true knowledge of God . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rabbinical lore . To-day the cry of bygone ages is re-peated , " Crucify him ! " At every advancing step , truth 134:3 is still opposed with sword and spear . Testimony of martyrs The word martyr , from the Greek , means witness ; but those who testified for Truth were so often persecuted 134:6 unto death , that at length the word martyr was narrowed in its significance and so has come always to mean one who suffers for his convictions . 134:9 The new faith in the Christ , Truth , so roused the hatred of the opponents of Christianity , that the followers of Christ were burned , crucified , and otherwise persecuted ; 134:12 and so it came about that human rights were hallowed by the gallows and the cross . Absence of Christ-power Man-made doctrines are waning . They have not waxed 134:15 strong in times of trouble . Devoid of the Christ-power , how can they illustrate the doctrines of Christ or the miracles of grace ? Denial of the possi-134:18 bility of Christian healing robs Christianity of the very element , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the first century . Basis of miracles 134:21 The true Logos is demonstrably Christian Science , the natural law of harmony which overcomes discord , - not because this Science is supernatural or pre-134:24 ternatural , nor because it is an infraction of divine law , but because it is the immutable law of God , good . Jesus said : " I knew that Thou hearest me al-134:27 ways ; " and he raised Lazarus from the dead , stilled the tempest , healed the sick , walked on the water . There is divine authority for believing in the superiority of 134:30 spiritual power over material resistance . Lawful wonders A miracle fulfils God 's law , but does not violate that law . This fact at present seems more mysterious than 135:1 the miracle itself . The Psalmist sang : " What ailed thee , O thou sea , that thou fleddest ? Thou Jordan , 135:3 that thou wast driven back ? Ye mountains , that ye skipped like rams , and ye little hills , like lambs ? Tremble , thou earth , at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the God of Jacob . " The miracle introduces no disorder , but unfolds the primal order , establishing the Science of God 's unchangeable law . 135:9 Spiritual evolution alone is worthy of the exercise of divine power . Fear and sickness identical The same power which heals sin heals also sickness . 135:12 This is " the beauty of holiness , " that when Truth heals the sick it casts out evils , and when Truth casts out the evil called disease , it heals the 135:15 sick . When Christ cast out the devil of dumbness , " it came to pass , when the devil was gone out , the dumb spake . " There is to-day danger of repeating 135:18 the offence of the Jews by limiting the Holy One of Israel and asking : " Can God furnish a table in the wilderness ? " What can not God do ? The unity of Science and Christianity 135:21 It has been said , and truly , that Christianity must be Science , and Science must be Christianity , else one or the other is false @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and they are alike in demonstration . This proves the one to be identical with the other . Christianity as Jesus taught it was not 135:27 a creed , nor a system of ceremonies , nor a special gift from a ritualistic Jehovah ; but it was the demonstration of divine Love casting out error and healing the sick , 135:30 not merely in the name of Christ , or Truth , but in demonstration of Truth , as must be the case in the cycles of divine light . The Christ-mission 136:1 Jesus established his church and maintained his mission on a spiritual foundation of Christ-healing . He taught 136:3 his followers that his religion had a divine Principle , which would cast out error and heal both the sick and the sinning . He claimed no intelli-136:6 gence , action , nor life separate from God . Despite the persecution this brought upon him , he used his divine power to save men both bodily and spiritually . Ancient spiritualism 136:9 The question then as now was , How did Jesus heal the sick ? His answer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students : " Whom do 136:12 men say that I , the Son of man , am ? " That is : Who or what is it that is thus identified with casting out evils and healing the sick ? They replied , " Some 136:15 say that thou art John the Baptist ; some , Elias ; and others , Jeremias , or one of the prophets . " These prophets were considered dead , and this reply may indicate that 136:18 some of the people believed that Jesus was a medium , controlled by the spirit of John or of Elias . This ghostly fancy was repeated by Herod himself . 136:21 That a wicked king and debauched husband should have no high appreciation of divine Science and the great work of the Master , was not surprising ; for how could such 136:24 a sinner comprehend what the disciples did not fully understand ? But even Herod doubted if Jesus was con-trolled by the sainted preacher . Hence Herod 's asser-136:27 tion : " John have I beheaded : but who is this ? " No wonder Herod @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disciples apprehended their Master better than 136:30 did others ; but they did not comprehend all that he said and did , or they would not have questioned him so often . Jesus patiently persisted in 137:1 teaching and demonstrating the truth of being . His stu-dents saw this power of Truth heal the sick , cast out evil , 137:3 raise the dead ; but the ultimate of this wonderful work was not spiritually discerned , even by them , until after the crucifixion , when their immaculate Teacher stood before 137:6 them , the victor over sickness , sin , disease , death , and the grave . Yearning to be understood , the Master repeated , 137:9 " But whom say ye that I am ? " This renewed inquiry meant : Who or what is it that is able to do the work , so mysterious to the popular mind ? In his rejection of the 137:12 answer already given and his renewal of the question , it is plain that Jesus completely eschewed the narrow opinion implied in their citation of the common report 137:15 about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Simon replied for his brethren , and his reply set forth a great fact : " Thou 137:18 art the Christ , the Son of the living God ! " That is : The Messiah is what thou hast de-clared , - Christ , the spirit of God , of Truth , Life , and 137:21 Love , which heals mentally . This assertion elicited from Jesus the benediction , " Blessed art thou , Simon Bar-jona : for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee , 137:24 but my Father which is in heaven ; " that is , Love hath shown thee the way of Life ! The true and living rock Before this the impetuous disciple had been called 137:27 only by his common names , Simon Bar-jona , or son of Jona ; but now the Master gave him a spiritual name in these words : " And I say also 137:30 unto thee , That thou art Peter ; and upon this rock the meaning of the Greek word petros , or stone I will build my church ; and the gates of hell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not prevail against it . " In other words , Jesus purposed founding his society , not 138:3 on the personal Peter as a mortal , but on the God-power which lay behind Peter 's confession of the true Messiah . Sublime summary 138:6 It was now evident to Peter that divine Life , Truth , and Love , and not a human personality , was the healer of the sick and a rock , a firm foundation in the realm 138:9 of harmony . On this spiritually scientific basis Jesus explained his cures , which appeared miraculous to outsiders . He showed that diseases were cast out neither 138:12 by corporeality , by materia medica , nor by hygiene , but by the divine Spirit , casting out the errors of mortal mind . The supremacy of Spirit was the foundation on which 138:15 Jesus built . His sublime summary points to the religion of Love . New era in Jesus Jesus established in the Christian era the precedent for 138:18 all Christianity , theology , and healing . Christians are under as direct orders now , as they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to 138:21 follow the Christ-example , and to heal the sick as well as the sinning . It is easier for Christianity to cast out sick-ness than sin , for the sick are more willing to part with 138:24 pain than are sinners to give up the sinful , so-called pleas-ure of the senses . The Christian can prove this to-day as readily is it was proved centuries ago . Healthful theology 138:27 Our Master said to every follower : " Go ye into all the world , and preach the gospel to every creature ! . . . Heal the sick ! . . . Love thy neighbor as 138:30 thyself ! " It was this theology of Jesus which healed the sick and the sinning . It is his theology in this book and the spiritual meaning of this theology , which 139:1 heals the sick and causes the wicked to " forsake his way , and the unrighteous man his thoughts . " It was our Mas-139:3 ter 's theology which the impious sought to destroy . Marvels and reformations From beginning to end , the Scriptures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mind , over matter . 139:6 Moses proved the power of Mind by what men called miracles ; so did Joshua , Elijah , and Elisha . The Christian era was ushered in with signs and 139:9 wonders . Reforms have commonly been attended with bloodshed and persecution , even when the end has been brightness and peace ; but the present new , yet old , re-139:12 form in religious faith will teach men patiently and wisely to stem the tide of sectarian bitterness , whenever it flows inward . Science obscured 139:15 The decisions by vote of Church Councils as to what should and should not be considered Holy Writ ; the man-ifest mistakes in the ancient versions ; the 139:18 thirty thousand different readings in the Old Testament , and the three hundred thousand in the New , - these facts show how a mortal and material sense stole 139:21 into the divine record , with its own hue darkening to some extent the inspired pages . But mistakes could neither wholly obscure the divine Science of the Scriptures seen 139:24 from Genesis to Revelation , mar the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prophets , who foresaw that " the stone which the builders rejected " would be-139:27 come " the head of the corner . " Opponents benefited Atheism , pantheism , theosophy , and agnosticism are opposed to Christian Science , as they are to ordinary re-139:30 ligion ; but it does not follow that the profane or atheistic invalid can not be healed by Chris-tian Science . The moral condition of such a man de-140:1 mands the remedy of Truth more than it is needed in most cases ; and Science is more than usually effectual in the 140:3 treatment of moral ailments . God invisible to the senses That God is a corporeal being , nobody can truly affirm . The Bible represents Him as saying : " Thou canst not 140:6 see My face ; for there shall no man see Me and live . " Not materially but spiritually we know Him as divine Mind , as Life , Truth , and Love . We 140:9 shall obey and adore in proportion as we apprehend the divine nature and love Him understandingly , warring no more over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God . Religion will then be of the heart and not of the head . Mankind will no longer be tyrannical and pro-scriptive from lack of love , - straining out gnats and 140:15 swallowing camels . The true worship We worship spiritually , only as we cease to worship materially . Spiritual devoutness is the soul of Chris-140:18 tianity . Worshipping through the medium of matter is paganism . Judaic and other rituals are but types and shadows of true worship . " The true 140:21 worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth . " Anthropomorphism The Jewish tribal Jehovah was a man-projected God , 140:24 liable to wrath , repentance , and human changeableness . The Christian Science God is universal , eter-nal , divine love , which changeth not and caus-140:27 eth no evil , disease , nor death . It is indeed mournfully true that the older Scripture is reversed . In the begin-ing God created man in His , God 's , image ; but mor-140:30 tals would procreate man , and make God in their own human image . What is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ More than profession required 141:1 This indicates the distance between the theological and ritualistic religion of the ages and the truth preached by 141:3 Jesus . More than profession is requisite for Christian demonstration . Few understand or adhere to Jesus ' divine precepts for living and 141:6 healing . Why ? Because his precepts require the disci-ple to cut off the right hand and pluck out the right eye , - that is , to set aside even the most cherished beliefs 141:9 and practices , to leave all for Christ . No ecclesiastical monopoly All revelation ( such is the popular thought ! ) must come from the schools and along the line of scholarly and eccle-141:12 siastical descent , as kings are crowned from a royal dynasty . In healing the sick and sinning , Jesus elaborated the fact that the healing effect 141:15 followed the understanding of the divine Principle and of the Christ-spirit which governed the corporeal Jesus . For this Principle there is no dynasty , no ecclesiastical 141:18 monopoly . Its only crowned head is immortal sover-eignty . Its only priest is the spiritualized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " kings and 141:21 priests unto God . " The outsiders did not then , and do not now , understand this ruling of the Christ ; there-fore they can not demonstrate God 's healing power . 141:24 Neither can this manifestation of Christ be com-prehended , until its divine Principle is scientifically understood . A change demanded 141:27 The adoption of scientific religion and of divine heal-ing will ameliorate sin , sickness , and death . Let our pulpits do justice to Christian Science . Let 141:30 it have fair representation by the press . Give to it the place in our institutions of learning now occu-pied by scholastic theology and physiology , and it will 142:1 eradicate sickness and sin in less time than the old systems , devised for subduing them , have required for self-estab-142:3 lishment and propagation . Two claims omitted Anciently the followers of Christ , or Truth , measured Christianity by its power over sickness , sin , and death ; 142:6 but modern religions generally omit all but one of these powers , - the power over sin . We must seek the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first proof of Christianity , for Christ , Truth , alone can furnish us with absolute evidence . Selfishness and loss If the soft palm , upturned to a lordly salary , and archi-142:12 tectural skill , making dome and spire tremulous with beauty , turn the poor and the stranger from the gate , they at the same time shut the door on 142:15 progress . In vain do the manger and the cross tell their story to pride and fustian . Sensuality palsies the right hand , and causes the left to let go its grasp on the divine . Temple cleansed 142:18 As in Jesus ' time , so to-day , tyranny and pride need to be whipped out of the temple , and humility and divine Sci-ence to be welcomed in . The strong cords of 142:21 scientific demonstration , as twisted and wielded by Jesus , are still needed to purge the temples of their vain traffic in worldly worship and to make them meet 142:24 dwelling-places for the Most High . MEDICINE Question of precedence Which was first , Mind or medicine ? If Mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter , must have been the first medicine . God being All-in-all , He made medicine ; but that medicine was 142:30 Mind . It could not have been matter , which departs from the nature and character of Mind , God . Truth 143:1 is God 's remedy for error of every kind , and Truth de-stroys only what is untrue . Hence the fact that , to-day , 143:3 as yesterday , Christ casts out evils and heals the sick . Methods rejected It is plain that God does not employ drugs or hygiene , 143:6 nor provide them for human use ; else Jesus would have recommended and employed them in his heal-ing . The sick are more deplorably lost than 143:9 the sinning , if the sick can not rely on God for help and the sinning can . The divine Mind never called matter medicine , and matter required a material and human be-143:12 lief before it could be considered as medicine . Error not curative Sometimes the human mind uses one error to medi-cine another . Driven to choose between two difficulties , 143:15 the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On this basis it saves from starva-tion by theft , and quiets pain with anodynes . You 143:18 admit that mind influences the body somewhat , but you conclude that the stomach , blood , nerves , bones , etc. , hold the preponderance of power . Controlled by 143:21 this belief , you continue in the old routine . You lean on the inert and unintelligent , never discerning how this de-prives you of the available superiority of divine Mind . 143:24 The body is not controlled scientifically by a negative mind . Impossible coalescence Mind is the grand creator , and there can be no power 143:27 except that which is derived from Mind . If Mind was first chronologically , is first potentially , and must be first eternally , then give to Mind the 143:30 glory , honor , dominion , and power everlastingly due its holy name . Inferior and unspiritual methods of healing may try to make Mind and drugs coalesce , but the two will 144:1 not mingle scientifically . Why should we wish to make them do so , since no good can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superior , let us rely upon Mind , which needs no cooperation from lower powers , even if these so-called powers are real . 144:6 Naught is the squire , when the king is nigh ; Withdraws the star , when dawns the sun 's brave light . Soul and sense The various mortal beliefs formulated in human philoso-144:9 phy , physiology , hygiene , are mainly predicated of matter , and afford faint gleams of God , or Truth . The more material a belief , the more obstinately 144:12 tenacious its error ; the stronger are the manifestations of the corporeal senses , the weaker the indications of Soul . Will-power detrimental Human will-power is not Science . Human will belongs 144:15 to the so-called material senses , and its use is to be con-demned . Willing the sick to recover is not the metaphysical practice of Christian Science , but 144:18 is sheer animal magnetism . Human will-power may in-fringe the rights of man . It produces evil continually , and is not a factor in the realism of being . Truth , and 144:21 not corporeal will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Peace , be still . " Conservative antagonism Because divine Science wars with so-called physical 144:24 science , even as Truth wars with error , the old schools still oppose it . Ignorance , pride , or prejudice closes the door to whatever is not stereotyped . 144:27 When the Science of being is universally understood , every man will be his own physician , and Truth will be the universal panacea . Ancient healers 144:30 It is a question to-day , whether the ancient inspired healers understood the Science of Christian healing , or 145:1 whether they caught its sweet tones , as the natural musician catches the tones of harmony , without being 145:3 able to explain them . So divinely imbued were they with the spirit of Science , that the lack of the letter could not hinder their work ; and that 145:6 letter , without the spirit , would have made void their practice . The struggle and victory The struggle for the recovery of invalids goes on , not 145:9 between material methods , but between mortal minds and immortal Mind . The victory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mind 145:12 through Christ , Truth , subdues the human belief in disease . It matters not what material method one may adopt , whether faith in drugs , trust in hygiene , or reliance 145:15 on some other minor curative . Mystery of godliness Scientific healing has this advantage over other meth-ods , - that in it Truth controls error . From this fact 145:18 arise its ethical as well as its physical ef-fects . Indeed , its ethical and physical effects are indissolubly connected . If there is any mystery 145:21 in Christian healing , it is the mystery which godliness always presents to the ungodly , - the mystery always arising from ignorance of the laws of eternal and unerr-145:24 ing Mind . Matter versus matter Other methods undertake to oppose error with error , and thus they increase the antagonism of one form of 145:27 matter towards other forms of matter or error , and the warfare between Spirit and the flesh goes on . By this antagonism mortal mind must con-145:30 tinually weaken its own assumed power . How healing was lost The theology of Christian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ article of faith propounded 146:1 to his students was healing , and he proved his faith by his works . The ancient Christians were healers . Why 146:3 has this element of Christianity been lost ? Because our systems of religion are governed more or less by our systems of medicine . The first idol-146:6 atry was faith in matter . The schools have rendered faith in drugs the fashion , rather than faith in Deity . By trusting matter to destroy its own discord , health and 146:9 harmony have been sacrificed . Such systems are barren of the vitality of spiritual power , by which material sense is made the servant of Science and religion becomes 146:12 Christlike . Drugs and divinity Material medicine substitutes drugs for the power of God - even the might of Mind - to heal the body . 146:15 Scholasticism clings for salvation to the per-son , instead of to the divine Principle , of the man Jesus ; and his Science , the curative agent of God , 146:18 is silenced . Why ? Because truth divests material drugs of their imaginary power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " stranger that is within thy gates , " 146:21 remembered not , even when its elevating effects prac-tically prove its divine origin and efficacy . Christian Science as old as God Divine Science derives its sanction from the Bible , 146:24 and the divine origin of Science is demonstrated through the holy influence of Truth in healing sick-ness and sin . This healing power of Truth 146:27 must have been far anterior to the period in which Jesus lived . It is as ancient as " the Ancient of days . " It lives through all Life , and extends throughout 146:30 all space . Reduction to system Divine metaphysics is now reduced to a system , to a form comprehensible by and adapted to the thought of 147:1 the age in which we live . This system enables the learner to demonstrate the divine Principle , 147:3 upon which Jesus ' healing was based , and the sacred rules for its present application to the cure of disease . 147:6 Late in the nineteenth century I demonstrated the divine rules of Christian Science . They were submitted to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plied under circumstances where demonstration was hu-manly possible , this Science showed that Truth had lost none of its divine and healing efficacy , even though cen-147:12 turies had passed away since Jesus practised these rules on the hills of Judaea and in the valleys of Galilee . Perusal and practice Although this volume contains the complete Science of 147:15 Mind-healing , never believe that you can absorb the whole meaning of the Science by a simple perusal of this book . The book needs to be studied , 147:18 and the demonstration of the rules of scientific healing will plant you firmly on the spiritual groundwork of Christian Science . This proof lifts you high above the 147:21 perishing fossils of theories already antiquated , and en-ables you to grasp the spiritual facts of being hitherto unattained and seemingly dim . A definite rule discovered 147:24 Our Master healed the sick , practised Christian heal-ing , and taught the generalities of its divine Principle to his students ; but he left no definite rule for 147:27 demonstrating this Principle of healing and preventing disease . This rule remained to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in good-147:30 ness , but Science alone reveals the divine Principle of goodness and demonstrates its rules . Jesus ' own practice Jesus never spoke of disease as dangerous or as difficult 148:1 to heal . When his students brought to him a case they had failed to heal , he said to them , " O faithless gen-148:3 eration , " implying that the requisite power to heal was in Mind . He prescribed no drugs , urged no obedience to material laws , but acted in direct 148:6 disobedience to them . The man of anatomy and of theology Neither anatomy nor theology has ever described man as created by Spirit , - as God 's man . The former ex-148:9 plains the men of men , or the " children of men , " as created corporeally instead of spir-itually and as emerging from the lowest , in-148:12 stead of from the highest , conception of being . Both anatomy and theology define man as both physical and mental , and place mind at the mercy of matter for every 148:15 function , formation , and manifestation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loses Spirit , drops the true tone , and accepts the discord . Anatomy and the-148:18 ology reject the divine Principle which produces harmo-nious man , and deal - the one wholly , the other primarily - with matter , calling that man which is not the counter-148:21 part , but the counterfeit , of God 's man . Then theology tries to explain how to make this man a Christian , - how from this basis of division and discord to produce the con-148:24 cord and unity of Spirit and His likeness . Physiology deficient Physiology exalts matter , dethrones Mind , and claims to rule man by material law , instead of spiritual . When 148:27 physiology fails to give health or life by this process , it ignores the divine Spirit as unable or unwilling to render help in time of physical need . 148:30 When mortals sin , this ruling of the schools leaves them to the guidance of a theology which admits God to be the healer of sin but not of sickness , although our great 149:1 Master demonstrated that Truth could save from sickness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mind as far outweighs drugs in the cure of disease as in the cure of sin . The more excellent way is divine Science in every case . Is materia medica a 149:6 science or a bundle of speculative human theories ? The prescription which succeeds in one in-stance fails in another , and this is owing to the different 149:9 mental states of the patient . These states are not com-prehended and they are left without explanation except in Christian Science . The rule and its perfection of opera-149:12 tion never vary in Science . If you fail to succeed in any case , it is because you have not demonstrated the life of Christ , Truth , more in your own life , - because you have 149:15 not obeyed the rule and proved the Principle of divine Science . Old-school physician A physician of the old school remarked with great 149:18 gravity : " We know that mind affects the body some-what , and advise our patients to be hopeful and cheerful and to take as little medicine as 149:21 possible ; but mind can never cure organic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contradict it . The author has cured what is termed organic disease as readily as she 149:24 has cured purely functional disease , and with no power but the divine Mind . Tests in our day Since God , divine Mind , governs all , not partially but 149:27 supremely , predicting disease does not dignify therapeutics . Whatever guides thought spiritually benefits mind and body . We need to understand the 149:30 affirmations of divine Science , dismiss superstition , and demonstrate truth according to Christ . To-day there is hardly a city , village , or hamlet , in which are not to 150:1 be found living witnesses and monuments to the virtue and power of Truth , as applied through this Christian 150:3 system of healing disease . The main purpose To-day the healing power of Truth is widely demon-strated as an immanent , eternal Science , instead of a 150:6 phenomenal exhibition . Its appearing is the coming anew of the gospel of " on earth peace , good-will toward men . " This coming , as was promised 150:9 by the Master , is for its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mission of Christian Science now , as in the time of its earlier demonstration , 150:12 is not primarily one of physical healing . Now , as then , signs and wonders are wrought in the metaphysical heal-ing of physical disease ; but these signs are only to demon-150:15 strate its divine origin , - to attest the reality of the higher mission of the Christ-power to take away the sins of the world . Exploded doctrine 150:18 The science ( so-called ) of physics would have one be-lieve that both matter and mind are subject to disease , and that , too , in spite of the individual 's pro-150:21 test and contrary to the law of divine Mind . This human view infringes man 's free moral agency ; and it is as evidently erroneous to the author , and will be to 150:24 all others at some future day , as the practically rejected doctrine of the predestination of souls to damnation or salvation . The doctrine that man 's harmony is gov-150:27 erned by physical conditions all his earthly days , and that he is then thrust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , - even the doctrine of the superiority of matter 150:30 over Mind , - is fading out . Disease mental The hosts of AEsculapius are flooding the world with diseases , because they are ignorant that the human mind 151:1 and body are myths . To be sure , they sometimes treat the sick as if there was but one factor in the case ; but 151:3 this one factor they represent to be body , not mind . Infinite Mind could not possibly create a remedy outside of itself , but erring , finite , human mind 151:6 has an absolute need of something beyond itself for its redemption and healing . Intentions respected Great respect is due the motives and philanthropy of 151:9 the higher class of physicians . We know that if they un-derstood the Science of Mind-healing , and were in possession of the enlarged power it confers 151:12 to benefit the race physically and spiritually , they would rejoice with us . Even this one reform in medicine would ultimately deliver mankind from the awful and oppres-151:15 sive bondage now enforced by false theories , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mind Mortal belief says that death has been occasioned by 151:18 fright . Fear never stopped being and its action . The blood , heart , lungs , brain , etc. , have nothing to do with Life , God . Every function of the 151:21 real man is governed by the divine Mind . The human mind has no power to kill or to cure , and it has no con-trol over God 's man . The divine Mind that made man 151:24 maintains His own image and likeness . The human mind is opposed to God and must be put off , as St. Paul declares . All that really exists is the divine Mind and 151:27 its idea , and in this Mind the entire being is found har-monious and eternal . The straight and narrow way is to see and acknowledge this fact , yield to this power , and 151:30 follow the leadings of truth . Mortal mind dethroned That mortal mind claims to govern every organ of the mortal body , we have overwhelming proof . But this so-152:1 called mind is a myth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It would wield the sceptre of a monarch , but 152:3 it is powerless . The immortal divine Mind takes away all its supposed sovereignty , and saves mortal mind from itself . The author has endeavored 152:6 to make this book the AEsculapius of mind as well as of body , that it may give hope to the sick and heal them , although they know not how the work is done . Truth 152:9 has a healing effect , even when not fully understood . All activity from thought Anatomy describes muscular action as produced by mind in one instance and not in another . Such errors 152:12 beset every material theory , in which one statement contradicts another over and over again . It is related that Sir Humphry Davy once ap-152:15 parently cured a case of paralysis simply by introducing a thermometer into the patient 's mouth . This he did merely to ascertain the temperature of the patient 's body ; 152:18 but the sick man supposed this ceremony was intended to heal him , and he recovered accordingly . Such a fact illustrates our theories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's medical researches and experiments had prepared her thought for the metaphysics of Christian Science . Every material dependence had 152:24 failed her in her search for truth ; and she can now understand why , and can see the means by which mortals are divinely driven to a spiritual source 152:27 for health and happiness . Homoeopathic attenuations Her experiments in homoeopathy had made her skep-tical as to material curative methods . Jahr , from 152:30 Aconitum to Zincum oxydatum , enumerates the general symptoms , the characteristic signs , which demand different remedies ; but the drug 153:1 is frequently attenuated to such a degree that not a ves-tige of it remains . Thus we learn that it is not the drug 153:3 which expels the disease or changes one of the symptoms of disease . Only salt and water The author has attenuated Natrum muriaticum ( com-153:6 mon table-salt ) until there was not a single saline property left . The salt had " lost his savour ; " and yet , with one drop of that attenuation in a goblet of 153:9 water , and a teaspoonful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she has cured a patient sinking in the last stage of typhoid fever . The highest attenuation 153:12 of homoeopathy and the most potent rises above matter into mind . This discovery leads to more light . From it may be learned that either human faith or the divine Mind is 153:15 the healer and that there is no efficacy in a drug . Origin of pain You say a boil is painful ; but that is impossible , for matter without mind is not painful . The boil simply 153:18 manifests , through inflammation and swell-ing , a belief in pain , and this belief is called a boil . Now administer mentally to your patient a high 153:21 attenuation of truth , and it will soon cure the boil . The fact that pain can not exist where there is no mortal mind to feel it is a proof that this so-called mind makes its 153:24 own pain - that is , its own belief in pain . Source of contagion We weep because others weep , we yawn because they yawn , and we have smallpox because others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , contains and carries the infection . When this mental contagion is understood , we shall be more careful of our mental con-153:30 ditions and we shall avoid loquacious tattling about disease , as we would avoid advocating crime . Neither sympathy nor society should ever tempt us to cherish 154:1 error in any form , and certainly we should not be error 's advocate . 154:3 Disease arises , like other mental conditions , from as-sociation . Since it is a law of mortal mind that certain diseases should be regarded as contagious , this law ob-154:6 tains credit through association , - calling up the fear that creates the image of disease and its consequent manifes-tation in the body . Imaginary cholera 154:9 This fact in metaphysics is illustrated by the following incident : A man was made to believe that he occupied a bed where a cholera patient had died . Imme-154:12 diately the symptoms of this disease appeared , and the man died . The fact was , that he had not caught the cholera by material contact , because no cholera patient 154:15 had been in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exposed to contagion or infection , the mother is frightened and says , " My child will be sick . " 154:18 The law of mortal mind and her own fears gov-ern her child more than the child 's mind gov-erns itself , and they produce the very results which might 154:21 have been prevented through the opposite understanding . Then it is believed that exposure to the contagion wrought the mischief . 154:24 That mother is not a Christian Scientist , and her affec-tions need better guidance , who says to her child : " You look sick , " " You look tired , " " You need rest , " or " You 154:27 need medicine . " Such a mother runs to her little one , who thinks she has hurt her face by falling on the carpet , and says , moaning 154:30 more childishly than her child , " Mamma knows you are hurt . " The better and more successful method for any mother to adopt is to say : " Oh , never mind ! You 're not 155:1 hurt , so do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all about the accident , and is at play . Drug-power mental 155:3 When the sick recover by the use of drugs , it is the law of a general belief , culminating in individual faith , which heals ; and according to this faith will the effect 155:6 be . Even when you take away the individual confidence in the drug , you have not yet divorced the drug from the general faith . The chemist , the botanist , the 155:9 druggist , the doctor , and the nurse equip the medicine with their faith , and the beliefs which are in the majority rule . When the general belief endorses the inanimate 155:12 drug as doing this or that , individual dissent or faith , un-less it rests on Science , is but a belief held by a minority , and such a belief is governed by the majority . Belief in physics 155:15 The universal belief in physics weighs against the high and mighty truths of Christian metaphysics . This errone-ous general belief , which sustains medicine and 155:18 produces all medical results , works against Christian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this Science must mightily outweigh the power of 155:21 popular belief in order to heal a single case of disease . The human mind acts more powerfully to offset the discords of matter and the ills of flesh , in proportion as it puts less 155:24 weight into the material or fleshly scale and more weight into the spiritual scale . Homoeopathy diminishes the drug , but the potency of the medicine increases as the 155:27 drug disappears . Nature of drugs Vegetarianism , homoeopathy , and hydropathy have diminished drugging ; but if drugs are an antidote to 155:30 disease , why lessen the antidote ? If drugs are good things , is it safe to say that the less in quantity you have of them the better ? If drugs 156:1 possess intrinsic virtues or intelligent curative qualities , these qualities must be mental . Who named drugs , and 156:3 what made them good or bad for mortals , beneficial or injurious ? Dropsy cured without drugs A case of dropsy , given up by the faculty , fell into 156:6 my hands . It was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as she lay in her bed , the patient looked like a barrel . I prescribed 156:9 the fourth attenuation of Argentum nitratum with occa-sional doses of a high attenuation of Sulphuris . She im-proved perceptibly . Believing then somewhat in the 156:12 ordinary theories of medical practice , and learning that her former physician had prescribed these remedies , I began to fear an aggravation of symptoms from their 156:15 prolonged use , and told the patient so ; but she was unwilling to give up the medicine while she was re-covering . It then occurred to me to give her un-156:18 medicated pellets and watch the result . I did so , and she continued to gain . Finally she said that she would give up her medicine for one day , and risk the 156:21 effects . After trying this , she informed me that she could get along two days without globules ; but on the third day she again suffered , and was relieved by 156:24 taking them . She went on in this way , taking the unmedicated pellets , - and receiving occasional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she was 156:27 cured . A stately advance Metaphysics , as taught in Christian Science , is the next stately step beyond homoeopathy . In metaphysics , 156:30 matter disappears from the remedy entirely , and Mind takes its rightful and supreme place . Homoeopathy takes mental symptoms largely 157:1 into consideration in its diagnosis of disease . Christian Science deals wholly with the mental cause in judging and 157:3 destroying disease . It succeeds where homoeopathy fails , solely because its one recognized Principle of healing is Mind , and the whole force of the mental element is em-157:6 ployed through the Science of Mind , which never shares its rights with inanimate matter . The modus of homoeopathy Christian Science exterminates the drug , and rests on 157:9 Mind alone as the curative Principle , acknowledging that the divine Mind has all power . Homoeopathy mentalizes a drug with such repetition of 157:12 thought-attenuations , that the drug becomes more like the human mind than the substratum of this so-called mind , which we call matter ; and the drug 's power 157:15 of action is proportionately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's creation , which ( according to the narrative in Genesis ) He pronounced good , then 157:18 drugs can not be poisonous . If He could cre-ate drugs intrinsically bad , then they should never be used . If He creates drugs at all and designs 157:21 them for medical use , why did Jesus not employ them and recommend them for the treatment of disease ? Matter is not self-creative , for it is unintelligent . Erring 157:24 mortal mind confers the power which the drug seems to possess . Narcotics quiet mortal mind , and so relieve the body ; 157:27 but they leave both mind and body worse for this sub-mission . Christian Science impresses the entire corpore-ality , - namely , mind and body , - and brings out the 157:30 proof that Life is continuous and harmonious . Science both neutralizes error and destroys it . Mankind is the better for this spiritual and profound pathology . Mythology and materia medica 158:1 It is recorded that the profession of medicine originated in idolatry with pagan priests , who besought the gods to 158:3 heal the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He was supposed to have dic-tated the first prescription , according to the 158:6 " History of Four Thousand Years of Medicine . " It is here noticeable that Apollo was also regarded as the sender of disease , " the god of pestilence . " Hippocrates turned 158:9 from image-gods to vegetable and mineral drugs for heal-ing . This was deemed progress in medicine ; but what we need is the truth which heals both mind and 158:12 body . The future history of material medicine may correspond with that of its material god , Apollo , who was banished from heaven and endured great sufferings 158:15 upon earth . Footsteps to intemperance Drugs , cataplasms , and whiskey are stupid substitutes for the dignity and potency of divine Mind and its effi-158:18 cacy to heal . It is pitiful to lead men into temptation through the byways of this wil-derness world , - to victimize the race with intoxicating 158:21 prescriptions for the sick , until mortal mind acquires an educated appetite for strong drink , and men and women become loathsome sots . Advancing degrees 158:24 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand . Drug-systems are quitting their hold on matter and so letting in matter 's higher stra-158:27 tum , mortal mind . Homoeopathy , a step in advance of allopathy , is doing this . Matter is going out of medicine ; and mortal mind , of a higher attenuation 158:30 than the drug , is governing the pellet . Effects of fear A woman in the city of Lynn , Massachusetts , was etherized and died in consequence , although her physi-159:1 cians insisted that it would be unsafe to perform a needed surgical operation without the ether . After the autopsy , 159:3 her sister testified that the deceased protested against inhaling the ether and said it would kill her , but that she was compelled by her physicians to take 159:6 it . Her hands were held , and she was forced into sub-mission . The case was brought to trial . The evidence was found to be conclusive , and a verdict was returned that 159:9 death was occasioned , not by the ether , but by fear of inhaling it . Mental conditions to be heeded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of men-159:12 tal conditions and to treat the patient as if she were so much mindless matter , and as if matter were the only factor to be consulted ? Had these 159:15 unscientific surgeons understood metaphysics , they would have considered the woman 's state of mind , and not have risked such treatment . They would either 159:18 have allayed her fear or would have performed the opera-tion without ether . The sequel proved that this Lynn woman died from 159:21 effects produced by mortal mind , and not from the disease or the operation . False source of knowledge The medical schools would learn the state of man 159:24 from matter instead of from Mind . They examine the lungs , tongue , and pulse to ascertain how much harmony , or health , matter is permit-159:27 ting to matter , - how much pain or pleasure , action or stagnation , one form of matter is allowing another form of matter . 159:30 Ignorant of the fact that a man 's belief produces dis-ease and all its symptoms , the ordinary physician is liable to increase disease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself to the work of destroying it through the power of the divine Mind . 160:3 The systems of physics act against metaphysics , and vice versa . When mortals forsake the material for the spiritual basis of action , drugs lose their healing force , 160:6 for they have no innate power . Unsupported by the faith reposed in it , the inanimate drug becomes powerless . Obedient muscles 160:9 The motion of the arm is no more dependent upon the direction of mortal mind , than are the organic action and secretion of the viscera . When this so-called 160:12 mind quits the body , the heart becomes as tor-pid as the hand . Anatomy and mind Anatomy finds a necessity for nerves to convey the man-160:15 date of mind to muscle and so cause action ; but what does anatomy say when the cords contract and be-come immovable ? Has mortal mind ceased 160:18 speaking to them , or has it bidden them to be impotent ? Can muscles , bones , blood , and nerves rebel against mind in one instance and not in another , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are self-acting at all times , they are never so , - never capable of acting contrary to mental 160:24 direction . If muscles can cease to act and become rigid of their own preference , - be deformed or symmetrical , as they please or as disease directs , - they must be self-160:27 directing . Why then consult anatomy to learn how mor-tal mind governs muscle , if we are only to learn from anatomy that muscle is not so governed ? Mind over matter 160:30 Is man a material fungus without Mind to help him ? Is a stiff joint or a contracted muscle as much a result of law as the supple and 161:1 elastic condition of the healthy limb , and is God the lawgiver ? 161:3 You say , " I have burned my finger . " This is an exact statement , more exact than you suppose ; for mor-tal mind , and not matter , burns it . Holy inspiration 161:6 has created states of mind which have been able to nullify the action of the flames , as in the Bible case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Babylonian furnace ; 161:9 while an opposite mental state might produce spontaneous combustion . Restrictive regulations In 1880 , Massachusetts put her foot on a proposed 161:12 tyrannical law , restricting the practice of medicine . If her sister States follow this example in har-mony with our Constitution and Bill of Rights , 161:15 they will do less violence to that immortal sentiment of the Declaration , " Man is endowed by his Maker with certain inalienable rights , among which are life , liberty , and the 161:18 pursuit of happiness . " The oppressive state statutes touching medicine re-mind one of the words of the famous Madame Roland , 161:21 as she knelt before a statue of Liberty , erected near the guillotine : " Liberty , what crimes are committed in thy name ! " Metaphysics challenges physics 161:24 The ordinary practitioner , examining bodily symptoms , telling the patient that he is sick , and treating the case ac-cording to his physical diagnosis , would natu-161:27 rally induce the very disease he is trying to cure , even if it were not already determined by mor-tal mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this old class of philanthropists looked as deeply for cause and effect into mind as into matter . The physician agrees with his " adversary quickly , " but upon different terms 162:1 than does the metaphysician ; for the matter-physician agrees with the disease , while the metaphysician agrees 162:3 only with health and challenges disease . Truth an alterative Christian Science brings to the body the sunlight of Truth , which invigorates and purifies . Christian Science 162:6 acts as an alterative , neutralizing error with Truth . It changes the secretions , expels hu-mors , dissolves tumors , relaxes rigid muscles , restores 162:9 carious bones to soundness . The effect of this Science is to stir the human mind to a change of base , on which it may yield to the harmony of the divine Mind . Practical success 162:12 Experiments have favored the fact that Mind governs the body , not in one instance , but in every instance . The indestructible faculties of Spirit exist without 162:15 the conditions of matter and also without the false beliefs of a so-called material existence . Working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has re-162:18 stored health in cases of both acute and chronic disease in their severest forms . Secretions have been changed , the structure has been renewed , shortened limbs have been 162:21 elongated , ankylosed joints have been made supple , and carious bones have been restored to healthy conditions . I have restored what is called the lost substance of lungs , and 162:24 healthy organizations have been established where disease was organic . Christian Science heals organic disease as surely as it heals what is called functional , for it requires 162:27 only a fuller understanding of the divine Principle of Christian Science to demonstrate the higher rule . Testimony of medical teachers With due respect for the faculty , I kindly 162:30 quote from Dr. Benjamin Rush , the famous Philadelphia teacher of medical practice . He declared that " it is impossible to calculate the mischief 163:1 which Hippocrates has done , by first marking Nature with his name , and afterward letting her loose upon sick 163:3 people . " Dr. Benjamin Waterhouse , Professor in Harvard Uni-versity , declared himself " sick of learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IV , King Of England , said : " I declare my conscientious opinion , founded on long 163:9 observation and reflection , that if there were not a single physician , surgeon , apothecary , man-midwife , chemist , druggist , or drug on the face of the earth , there would be 163:12 less sickness and less mortality . " Dr. Mason Good , a learned Professor in London , said : 163:15 " The effects of medicine on the human system are in the highest degree uncertain ; except , indeed , that it has already destroyed more lives than war , pestilence , and 163:18 famine , all combined . " Dr. Chapman , Professor of the Institutes and Practice of Physic in the University of Pennsylvania , in a published 163:21 essay said : " Consulting the records of our science , we can not help being disgusted with the multitude of hypotheses 163:24 obtruded upon us at different times . Nowhere is the imagination displayed to a greater extent ; and perhaps so ample an exhibition of human invention might gratify 163:27 our vanity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view of so much absurdity , contradiction , and falsehood . To harmonize the contrarieties of med-163:30 ical doctrines is indeed a task as impracticible as to arrange the fleeting vapors around us , or to reconcile the fixed and repulsive antipathies of nature . Dark and 164:1 perplexed , our devious career resembles the groping of Homer 's Cyclops around his cave . " 164:3 Sir John Forbes , M.D. , F.R.S. , Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians , London , said : " No systematic or theoretical classification of diseases 164:6 or of therapeutic agents , ever yet promulgated , is true , or anything like the truth , and none can be adopted as a safe guidance in practice . " 164:9 It is just to say that generally the cultured class of medi-cal practitioners are grand men and women , therefore they are more scientific than are false claimants to Chris-164:12 tian Science . But all human systems based on material premises are minus the unction of divine Science . Much yet remains to be said and done before all mankind is 164:15 saved and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are exterminated . If you or I should appear to die , we should not be 164:18 dead . The seeming decease , caused by a majority of human beliefs that man must die , or produced by mental assassins , does not in the least disprove Christian Science ; 164:21 rather does it evidence the truth of its basic proposition that mortal thoughts in belief rule the materiality mis-called life in the body or in matter . But the forever fact 164:24 remains paramount that Life , Truth , and Love save from sin , disease , and death . " When this corruptible shall have put on incorruption , and this mortal shall have put on 164:27 immortality divine Science , then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written , Death is swallowed up in victory " ( St. Paul ) . CHAPTER VII - PHYSIOLOGY Therefore I say unto you , Take no thought for your life , what ye shall eat , or what ye shall drink ; nor yet for your body , what ye shall put on . Is not the life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - JESUS . He sent His word , and healed them , and delivered them from their destructions. - PSALMS. 165:1 PHYSIOLOGY is one of the apples from " the tree of knowledge . " Evil declared that eating this fruit 165:3 would open man 's eyes and make him as a god . Instead of so doing , it closed the eyes of mortals to man 's God-given dominion over the earth . Man not structural 165:6 To measure intellectual capacity by the size of the brain and strength by the exercise of muscle , is to subjugate intelligence , to make mind mor-165:9 tal , and to place this so-called mind at the mercy of material organization and non-intelligent matter . 165:12 Obedience to the so-called physical laws of health has not checked sickness . Diseases have multiplied , since man-made material theories took the place of spiritual 165:15 truth . Causes of sickness You say that indigestion , fatigue , sleeplessness , cause distressed stomachs and aching heads . Then 165:18 you consult your brain in order to remember what has hurt you , when your remedy lies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no sensation of its own , and the human mind is all that can produce pain . 166:3 As a man thinketh , so is he . Mind is all that feels , acts , or impedes action . Ignorant of this , or shrinking from its implied responsibility , the healing effort is made 166:6 on the wrong side , and thus the conscious control over the body is lost . Delusions pagan and medical The Mohammedan believes in a pilgrimage to Mecca 166:9 for the salvation of his soul . The popular doctor believes in his prescription , and the pharmacist believes in the power of his drugs to save a man 's 166:12 life . The Mohammedan 's belief is a religious delusion ; the doctor 's and pharmacist 's is a medical mistake . Health from reliance on spirituality 166:15 The erring human mind is inharmonious in itself . From it arises the inharmonious body . To ignore God as of little use in sickness is a mistake . 166:18 Instead of thrusting Him aside in times of bodily trouble , and waiting for the hour of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 166:21 that He can do all things for us in sickness as in health . Failing to recover health through adherence to physi-166:24 ology and hygiene , the despairing invalid often drops them , and in his extremity and only as a last resort , turns to God . The invalid 's faith in the divine Mind is less 166:27 than in drugs , air , and exercise , or he would have resorted to Mind first . The balance of power is conceded to be with matter by most of the medical systems ; but when 166:30 Mind at last asserts its mastery over sin , disease , and death , then is man found to be harmonious and immortal . 167:1 Should we implore a corporeal God to heal the sick out of His personal volition , or should we understand the 167:3 infinite divine Principle which heals ? If we rise no higher than blind faith , the Science of healing is not attained , and Soul-existence , in the place of sense-existence , is not com-167:6 prehended . We apprehend Life in divine Science only as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admission of the claims of good or of evil de-167:9 termines the harmony of our existence , - our health , our longevity , and our Christianity . The two masters We can not serve two masters nor perceive divine Sci-167:12 ence with the material senses . Drugs and hygiene can not successfully usurp the place and power of the divine source of all health and perfection . If 167:15 God made man both good and evil , man must remain thus . What can improve God 's work ? Again , an error in the premise must appear in the conclusion . To have 167:18 one God and avail yourself of the power of Spirit , you must love God supremely . Half-way success The " flesh lusteth against the Spirit . " The flesh and 167:21 Spirit can no more unite in action , than good can coin-cide with evil . It is not wise to take a halt-ing and half-way position or to expect to work 167:24 equally with Spirit and matter , Truth and error . There , is but one way - namely , God and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scientific government of the 167:27 body must be attained through the divine Mind . It is im-possible to gain control over the body in any other way . On this fundamental point , timid conservatism is abso-167:30 lutely inadmissible . Only through radical reliance on Truth can scientific healing power be realized . Substituting good words for a good life , fair seeming 168:1 for straightforward character , is a poor shift for the weak and worldly , who think the standard of Christian Science 168:3 too high for them . Belief on the wrong side If the scales are evenly adjusted , the removal of a single weight from either scale gives preponderance to the oppo-168:6 site . Whatever influence you cast on the side of matter , you take away from Mind , which would otherwise outweigh all else . Your belief militates 168:9 against your health , when it ought to be enlisted on the side of health . When sick ( according to belief ) you rush after drugs , search out the material so-called laws of 168:12 health , and depend upon them to heal you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of disease through just this false belief . The divine authority 168:15 Because man-made systems insist that man becomes sick and useless , suffers and dies , all in consonance with the laws of God , are we to believe it ? Are 168:18 we to believe an authority which denies God 's spiritual command relating to perfection , - an authority which Jesus proved to be false ? He did the will of the 168:21 Father . He healed sickness in defiance of what is called material law , but in accordance with God 's law , the law of Mind . Disease foreseen 168:24 I have discerned disease in the human mind , and rec-ognized the patient 's fear of it , months before the so-called disease made its appearance in the body . Dis-168:27 ease being a belief , a latent illusion of mortal mind , the sensation would not appear if the error of belief was met and destroyed by truth . Changed mentality 168:30 Here let a word be noticed which will be better understood hereafter , - chemicalization . By chemicalization I mean the process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of belief from a material to a spiritual basis . Scientific foresight 169:3 Whenever an aggravation of symptoms has occurred through mental chemicalization , I have seen the mental signs , assuring me that danger was over , before 169:6 the patient felt the change ; and I have said to the patient , " You are healed , " - sometimes to his dis-comfiture , when he was incredulous . But it always came 169:9 about as I had foretold . I name these facts to show that disease has a mental , mortal origin , - that faith in rules of health or in drugs 169:12 begets and fosters disease by attracting the mind to the subject of sickness , by exciting fear of disease , and by dos-ing the body in order to avoid it . The faith reposed in 169:15 these things should find stronger supports and a higher home . If we understood the control of Mind over body , we should put no faith in material means . Mind the only healer 169:18 Science not only reveals the origin of all disease as mental , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divine Mind . There can be no healing ex-169:21 cept by this Mind , however much we trust a drug or any other means towards which human faith or endeavor is directed . It is mortal mind , not mat-169:24 ter , which brings to the sick whatever good they may seem to receive from materiality . But the sick are never really healed except by means of the divine power . 169:27 Only the action of Truth , Life , and Love can give harmony . Modes of matter Whatever teaches man to have other laws and to 169:30 acknowledge other powers than the divine Mind , is anti-Christian . The good that a poisonous drug seems to do is evil , for it robs man of 170:1 reliance on God , omnipotent Mind , and according to belief , poisons the human system . Truth is not the basis of 170:3 theogony . Modes of matter form neither a moral nor a spiritual system . The discord which calls for material methods is the result of the exercise of faith in material 170:6 modes , - faith in matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the economy of man less than Graham or Cutter ? Christian ideas certainly present 170:9 what human theories exclude - the Principle of man 's harmony . The text , " Whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die , " not only con-170:12 tradicts human systems , but points to the self-sustaining and eternal Truth . The demands of Truth are spiritual , and reach the 170:15 body through Mind . The best interpreter of man 's needs said : " Take no thought for your life , what ye shall eat , or what ye shall drink . " 170:18 If there are material laws which prevent disease , what then causes it ? Not divine law , for Jesus healed the sick and cast out error , always in opposition , never in 170:21 obedience , to physics . Causation considered Spiritual causation is the one question to be considered , for more than all others spiritual causation relates to 170:24 human progress . The age seems ready to approach this subject , to ponder somewhat the supremacy of Spirit , and at least to touch the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man as purely physical , or as both material and spiritual , - but in either case dependent 170:30 upon his physical organization , - is the Pandora box , from which all ills have gone forth , especially despair . Matter , which takes divine power into its own hands and 171:1 claims to be a creator , is a fiction , in which paganism and lust are so sanctioned by society that mankind has caught 171:3 their moral contagion . Paradise regained Through discernment of the spiritual opposite of ma-teriality , even the way through Christ , Truth , man will 171:6 reopen with the key of divine Science the gates of Paradise which human beliefs have closed , and will find himself unfallen , upright , pure , and free , 171:9 not needing to consult almanacs for the probabilities either of his life or of the weather , not needing to study brain-ology to learn how much of a man he is . A closed question 171:12 Mind 's control over the universe , including man , is no longer an open question , but is demonstrable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power of immortal Mind by healing sickness and sin and destroying the foundations of death . Matter versus Spirit Mistaking his origin and nature , man believes himself to 171:18 be combined matter and Spirit . He believes that Spirit is sifted through matter , carried on a nerve , ex-posed to ejection by the operation of matter . 171:21 The intellectual , the moral , the spiritual , - yea , the image of infinite Mind , - subject to non-intelligence ! No more sympathy exists between the flesh and Spirit 171:24 than between Belial and Christ . The so-called laws of matter are nothing but false be-liefs that intelligence and life are present where Mind 171:27 is not . These false beliefs are the procuring cause of all sin and disease . The opposite truth , that intelligence and life are spiritual , never material , destroys sin , sickness , 171:30 and death . The fundamental error lies in the supposition that man is a material outgrowth and that the cognizance of good 172:1 or evil , which he has through the bodily senses , con-stitutes his happiness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development from mushrooms to monkeys and from monkeys into men amounts to nothing in the right direction and 172:6 very much in the wrong . Materialism grades the human species as rising from matter upward . How then is the material species main-172:9 tained , if man passes through what we call death and death is the Rubicon of spirituality ? Spirit can form no real link in this supposed chain of material being . 172:12 But divine Science reveals the eternal chain of existence as uninterrupted and wholly spiritual ; yet this can be realized only as the false sense of being disappears . Degrees of development 172:15 If man was first a material being , he must have passed through all the forms of matter in order to become man . If the material body is man , he is a portion of 172:18 matter , or dust . On the contrary , man is the image and likeness of Spirit ; and the belief that there is Soul in sense or Life in matter obtains in mortals , alias 172:21 mortal mind , to which the apostle refers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old man . " Identity not lost What is man ? Brain , heart , blood , bones , etc. , the 172:24 material structure ? If the real man is in the material body , you take away a portion of the man when you amputate a limb ; the surgeon destroys 172:27 manhood , and worms annihilate it . But the loss of a limb or injury to a tissue is sometimes the quickener of manli-ness ; and the unfortunate cripple may present more no-172:30 bility than the statuesque athlete , - teaching us by his very deprivations , that " a man 's a man , for a ' that . " When man is man When we admit that matter ( heart , blood , brain , acting 173:1 through the five physical senses ) constitutes man , we fail to see how anatomy can distinguish between 173:3 humanity and the brute , or determine when man is really man and has progressed farther than his animal progenitors . Individualization 173:6 When the supposition , that Spirit is within what it creates and the potter is subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the level 173:9 of error , and the sensible is required to be made manifest through the insensible . What is termed matter manifests nothing but a material 173:12 mentality . Neither the substance nor the manifestation of Spirit is obtainable through matter . Spirit is positive . Matter is Spirit 's contrary , the absence of Spirit . For 173:15 positive Spirit to pass through a negative condition would be Spirit 's destruction . Man not structural Anatomy declares man to be structural . Physiology 173:18 continues this explanation , measuring human strength by bones and sinews , and human life by material law . Man is spiritual , individual , and eter-173:21 nal ; material structure is mortal . Phrenology makes man knavish or honest according to the development of the cranium ; but anatomy , physiology , 173:24 phrenology , do not define the image of God , the real im-mortal man . Human reason and religion come slowly to the recogni-173:27 tion of spiritual facts , and so continue to call upon matter to remove the error which the human mind alone has created . 173:30 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and longevity than are the idols of barbarism . The idols of civilization call into action less faith than Buddhism 174:1 in a supreme governing intelligence . The Esquimaux restore health by incantations as consciously as do civi-174:3 lized practitioners by their more studied methods . Is civilization only a higher form of idolatry , that man should bow down to a flesh-brush , to flannels , to 174:6 baths , diet , exercise , and air ? Nothing save divine power is capable of doing so much for man as he can do for himself . Rise of thought 174:9 The footsteps of thought , rising above material stand-points , are slow , and portend a long night to the traveller ; but the angels of His presence - the spiritual 174:12 intuitions that tell us when " the night is far spent , the day is at hand " - are our guardians in the gloom . Whoever opens the way in Christian Science is 174:15 a pilgrim and stranger , marking out the path for gen-erations yet unborn . The thunder of Sinai and the Sermon on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rebuking in their course all error and proclaiming the kingdom of heaven on earth . Truth is revealed . It needs only to 174:21 be practised . Medical errors Mortal belief is all that enables a drug to cure mortal ailments . Anatomy admits that mind is somewhere in 174:24 man , though out of sight . Then , if an indi-vidual is sick , why treat the body alone and administer a dose of despair to the mind ? Why declare 174:27 that the body is diseased , and picture this disease to the mind , rolling it under the tongue as a sweet morsel and holding it before the thought of both physician and pa-174:30 tient ? We should understand that the cause of disease obtains in the mortal human mind , and its cure comes from the immortal divine Mind . We should prevent the 175:1 images of disease from taking form in thought , and we should efface the outlines of disease already formulated in 175:3 the minds of mortals . Novel Diseases When there are fewer prescriptions , and less thought is given to sanitary subjects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In old times who ever heard of dyspepsia , cerebro-spinal meningitis , hay-fever , and rose-cold ? 175:9 What an abuse of natural beauty to say that a rose , the smile of God , can produce suffering ! The joy of its presence , its beauty and fragrance , should uplift the 175:12 thought , and dissuade any sense of fear or fever . It is profane to fancy that the perfume of clover and the breath of new-mown hay can cause glandular inflammation , 175:15 sneezing , and nasal pangs . No ancestral dyspepsia If a random thought , calling itself dyspepsia , had tried to tyrannize over our forefathers , it would have 175:18 been routed by their independence and in-dustry . Then people had less time for self-ishness , coddling , and sickly after-dinner talk . The ex-175:21 act amount of food the stomach could digest was not discussed according to Cutter nor referred to sanitary laws . A man 's belief in those days was not so severe 175:24 upon the gastric juices . Beaumont 's " Medical Experi-ments " did not govern the digestion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 175:27 plump cheeks of our ancestors , but they never indulged in the refinement of inflamed bronchial tubes . They were as innocent as Adam , before he ate 175:30 the fruit of false knowledge , of the existence of tubercles and troches , lungs and lozenges . Our modern Eves " Where ignorance is bliss , ' t is folly to be wise , " says 176:1 the English poet , and there is truth in his sentiment . The action of mortal mind on the body was not so injurious 176:3 before inquisitive modern Eves took up the study of medical works and unmanly Adams attributed their own downfall and the fate of their off-176:6 spring to the weakness of their wives . The primitive custom of taking no thought about food left the stomach and bowels free to act in obedi-176:9 ence to nature , and gave the gospel a chance to be seen in its glorious effects upon the body . A ghastly array of diseases was not paraded before the imagination . There 176:12 were fewer books on digestion and more " sermons in stones , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the human mind gives place to the divine Mind , self-176:15 ishness and sin , disease and death , will lose their foothold . Human fear of miasma would load with disease the 176:18 air of Eden , and weigh down mankind with superimposed and conjectural evils . Mortal mind is the worst foe of the body , while divine Mind is its best friend . Diseases not to be classified 176:21 Should all cases of organic disease be treated by a regular practitioner , and the Christian Scientist try truth only in cases of hysteria , hypochon-176:24 dria , and hallucination ? One disease is no more real than another . All disease is the result of education , and disease can carry its ill-effects 176:27 no farther than mortal mind maps out the way . The human mind , not matter , is supposed to feel , suffer , en-joy . Hence decided types of acute disease are quite as 176:30 ready to yield to Truth as the less distinct type and chronic form of disease . Truth handles the most malignant con-tagion with perfect assurance . One basis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organic dis-ease as certainly as it produces hysteria , and it must re-177:3 linquish all its errors , sicknesses , and sins . I have demonstrated this beyond all cavil . The evidence of divine Mind 's healing power and abso-177:6 lute control is to me as certain as the evidence of my own existence . Mental and physical oneness Mortal mind and body are one . Neither exists without 177:9 the other , and both must be destroyed by immortal Mind . Matter , or body , is but a false concept of mor-tal mind . This so-called mind builds its own 177:12 superstructure , of which the material body is the grosser portion ; but from first to last , the body is a sensuous , human concept . The effect of names 177:15 In the Scriptural allegory of the material creation , Adam or error , which represents the erroneous theory of life and intelligence in matter , had the 177:18 naming of all that was material . These names indicated matter 's properties , qualities , and forms . But a lie , the opposite of Truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is termed matter , and create the so-called laws of the flesh , nor can a lie hold the preponderance of power in any direction against God , Spirit and 177:24 Truth . Poison defined mentally If a dose of poison is swallowed through mistake , and the patient dies even though physician and 177:27 patient are expecting favorable results , does human belief , you ask , cause this death ? Even so , and as directly as if the poison had been intentionally 177:30 taken . In such cases a few persons believe the potion swal-lowed by the patient to be harmless , but the vast ma-178:1 jority of mankind , though they know nothing of this par-ticular case and this special person , believe the arsenic , 178:3 the strychnine , or whatever the drug used , to be poi-sonous , for it is set down as a poison by mortal mind . Consequently , the result is controlled by the majority of 178:6 opinions , not by the infinitesimal minority of opinions in the sick-chamber . Heredity is not a law . The remote cause or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ priority and the connection of past mortal thoughts with present . The predisposing cause and the exciting cause are 178:12 mental . Perhaps an adult has a deformity produced prior to his birth by the fright of his mother . When wrested from 178:15 human belief and based on Science or the divine Mind , to which all things are possible , that chronic case is not difficult to cure . Animal magnetism destroyed 178:18 Mortal mind , acting from the basis of sensation in matter , is animal magnetism ; but this so-called mind , from which comes all evil , contradicts itself , 178:21 and must finally yield to the eternal Truth , or the divine Mind , expressed in Science . In pro-portion to our understanding of Christian Science , we are 178:24 freed from the belief of heredity , of mind in matter or ani-mal magnetism ; and we disarm sin of its imaginary power in proportion to our spiritual understanding of the status 178:27 of immortal being . Ignorant of the methods and the basis of metaphysical healing , you may attempt to unite with it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these methods can be mingled with metaphysical healing . Whoever reaches the understanding of Christian Science 179:1 in its proper signification will perform the sudden cures of which it is capable ; but this can be done only by 179:3 taking up the cross and following Christ in the daily life . Absent patients Science can heal the sick , who are absent from their 179:6 healers , as well as those present , since space is no ob-stacle to Mind . Immortal Mind heals what eye hath not seen ; but the spiritual capacity to ap-179:9 prehend thought and to heal by the Truth-power , is won only as man is found , not in self-righteousness , but re-flecting the divine nature . Horses mistaught 179:12 Every medical method has its advocates . The prefer-ence of mortal mind for a certain method creates a demand for that method , and the body then seems to re-179:15 quire such treatment . You can even educate a healthy horse so far in physiology that he will take cold without his blanket , whereas the wild animal , left to his 179:18 instincts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a humanly evolved ailment , which a wild horse might never have . Medical works objectionable 179:21 Treatises on anatomy , physiology , and health , sustained by what is termed material law , are the pro-moters of sickness and disease . It should not 179:24 be proverbial , that so long as you read medical works you will be sick . The sedulous matron - studying her Jahr with homoe-179:27 opathic pellet and powder in hand , ready to put you into a sweat , to move the bowels , or to produce sleep - is unwittingly sowing the seeds of reliance on matter , 179:30 and her household may erelong reap the effect of this mistake . Descriptions of disease given by physicians and adver-180:1 tisements of quackery are both prolific sources of sickness . As mortal mind is the husbandman of error , it should be 180:3 taught to do the body no harm and to uproot its false sowing . The invalid 's outlook The patient sufferer tries to be satisfied when he sees 180:6 his would-be healers busy , and his faith in their efforts is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Science one must understand the resusci-180:9 tating law of Life . This is the seed within itself bearing fruit after its kind , spoken of in Genesis . Physicians should not deport themselves as if Mind 180:12 were non-existent , nor take the ground that all causation is matter , instead of Mind . Ignorant that the human mind governs the body , its phenomenon , the invalid may 180:15 unwittingly add more fear to the mental reservoir already overflowing with that emotion . Wrong and right way Doctors should not implant disease in the thoughts of 180:18 their patients , as they so frequently do , by declaring dis-ease to be a fixed fact , even before they go to work to eradicate the disease through the ma-180:21 terial faith which they inspire . Instead of furnishing thought with fear , they should try to correct this turbulent element of mortal mind by the influence of divine Love 180:24 which casteth out fear . When man is governed by God , the ever-present Mind who understands all things , man knows that with 180:27 God all things are possible . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sick , is found in the Science of divine Mind as taught and demonstrated by Christ 180:30 Jesus . The important decision To reduce inflammation , dissolve a tumor , or cure or-ganic disease , I have found divine Truth more potent than 181:1 all lower remedies . And why not , since Mind , God , is the source and condition of all existence ? Before decid-181:3 ing that the body , matter , is disordered , one should ask , " Who art thou that repliest to Spirit ? Can matter speak for itself , or does 181:6 it hold the issues of life ? " Matter , which can neither suffer nor enjoy , has no partnership with pain and pleas-ure , but mortal belief has such a partnership . Manipulation unscientific 181:9 When you manipulate patients , you trust in electricity and magnetism more than in Truth ; and for that reason , you employ matter rather than 181:12 Mind . You weaken or destroy your power when you re-sort to any except spiritual means . It is foolish to declare that you manipulate patients but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this be so , why manipulate ? In reality you manipulate because you are ignorant of the baneful effects of magnetism , or are not 181:18 sufficiently spiritual to depend on Spirit . In either case you must improve your mental condition till you finally attain the understanding of Christian Science . Not words but deeds 181:21 If you are too material to love the Science of Mind and are satisfied with good words instead of effects , if you adhere to error and are afraid to trust Truth , 181:24 the question then recurs , " Adam , where art thou ? " It is unnecessary to resort to aught besides Mind in order to satisfy the sick that you are doing some-181:27 thing for them , for if they are cured , they generally know it and are satisfied . " Where your treasure is , there will your heart be also . " 181:30 If you have more faith in drugs than in Truth , this faith will incline you to the side of matter and error . Any hypnotic power you may exercise will diminish your 182:1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The act of healing the sick through divine Mind alone , of casting 182:3 out error with Truth , shows your position as a Christian Scientist . Physiology or Spirit The demands of God appeal to thought only ; but the 182:6 claims of mortality , and what are termed laws of nature , appertain to matter . Which , then , are we to accept as legitimate and capable of producing 182:9 the highest human good ? We can not obey both physi-ology and Spirit , for one absolutely destroys the other , and one or the other must be supreme in the affections . 182:12 It is impossible to work from two standpoints . If we attempt it , we shall presently " hold to the one , and despise the other . " 182:15 The hypotheses of mortals are antagonistic to Science and can not mix with it . This is clear to those , who heal the sick on the basis of Science . No material law 182:18 Mind 's government of the body must supersede the so-called laws of matter . Obedience to material law pre-vents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which overcomes material conditions and puts matter under the feet of Mind . Mortals entreat the di-vine Mind to heal the sick , and forthwith shut out the aid 182:24 of Mind by using material means , thus working against themselves and their prayers and denying man 's God-given ability to demonstrate Mind 's sacred power . Pleas 182:27 for drugs and laws of health come from some sad incident , or else from ignorance of Christian Science and its tran-scendent power . 182:30 To admit that sickness is a condition over which God has no control , is to presuppose that omnipotent power is powerless on some occasions . The law of Christ , or 183:1 Truth , makes all things possible to Spirit ; but the so-called laws of matter would render Spirit of no avail , and 183:3 demand obedience to materialistic codes , thus departing from the basis of one God , one lawmaker . To suppose that God constitutes laws of inharmony is a mistake ; dis-183:6 cords have no support from nature or divine law , however much is said to the contrary . Can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crop without sowing the seed and awaiting its germina-tion according to the laws of nature ? The answer is no , and yet the Scriptures inform us that sin , or error , first 183:12 caused the condemnation of man to till the ground , and indicate that obedience to God will remove this necessity . Truth never made error necessary , nor devised a law to 183:15 perpetuate error . Laws of nature spiritual The supposed laws which result in weariness and dis-ease are not His laws , for the legitimate and only possible 183:18 action of Truth is the production of harmony . Laws of nature are laws of Spirit ; but mortals commonly recognize as law that which hides the power of 183:21 Spirit . Divine Mind rightly demands man 's entire obe-dience , affection , and strength . No reservation is made for any lesser loyalty . Obedience to Truth gives man 183:24 power and strength . Submission to error superinduces loss of power . Belief and understanding Truth casts out all evils and materialistic methods 183:27 with the actual spiritual law , - the law which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , voice to the dumb , feet to the lame . If Christian 183:30 Science dishonors human belief , it honors spiritual understanding ; and the one Mind only is entitled to honor . 184:1 The so-called laws of health are simply laws of mortal belief . The premises being erroneous , the conclusions 184:3 are wrong . Truth makes no laws to regulate sickness , sin , and death , for these are unknown to Truth and should not be recognized as reality . 184:6 Belief produces the results of belief , and the penal-ties it affixes last so long as the belief and are insepara-ble from it . The remedy consists in probing the trouble 184:9 to the bottom , in finding and casting out by denial the error of belief which produces a mortal disorder , never honoring erroneous belief with the title of law nor yield-184:12 ing obedience to it . Truth , Life , and Love are the only legitimate and eternal demands on man , and they are spiritual lawgivers , enforcing obedience through divine 184:15 statutes . Laws of human belief Controlled by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is governed by a false belief 184:18 is discordant and mortal . We say man suffers from the effects of cold , heat , fatigue . This is human belief , not the truth of being , for matter can not 184:21 suffer . Mortal mind alone suffers , - not because a law of matter has been transgressed , but because a law of this so-called mind has been disobeyed . I have demonstrated 184:24 this as a rule of divine Science by destroying the delusion of suffering from what is termed a fatally broken physical law . 184:27 A woman , whom I cured of consumption , always breathed with great difficulty when the wind was from the east . I sat silently by her side a few moments . Her 184:30 breath came gently . The inspirations were deep and nat-ural . I then requested her to look at the weather-vane . She looked and saw that it pointed due east . The wind 185:1 had not changed , but her thought of it had and so her difficulty in breathing had gone . The wind had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action of her belief on the lungs , and she never suffered again from east winds , but was restored to health . A so-called mind-cure 185:6 No system of hygiene but Christian Science is purely mental . Before this book was published , other books were in circulation , which discussed " mental 185:9 medicine " and " mind-cure , " operating through the power of the earth 's magnetic currents to regulate life and health . Such theories and such systems of so-called 185:12 mind-cure , which have sprung up , are as material as the prevailing systems of medicine . They have their birth in mortal mind , which puts forth a human conception 185:15 in the name of Science to match the divine Science of im-mortal Mind , even as the necromancers of Egypt strove to emulate the wonders wrought by Moses . Such theories 185:18 have no relationship to Christian Science , which rests on the conception of God as the only Life , substance , and intelligence , and excludes the human mind as a spiritual 185:21 factor in the healing work . Jesus and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only with-out drugs , but without hypnotism , which is 185:24 the reverse of ethical and pathological Truth-power . Erroneous mental practice may seem for a time to bene-185:27 fit the sick , but the recovery is not permanent . This is because erroneous methods act on and through the ma-terial stratum of the human mind , called brain , which is 185:30 but a mortal consolidation of material mentality and its suppositional activities . False stimulus A patient under the influence of mortal mind is healed 186:1 only by removing the influence on him of this mind , by emptying his thought of the false stimulus 186:3 and reaction of will-power and filling it with the divine energies of Truth . Christian Science destroys material beliefs through the 186:6 understanding of Spirit , and the thoroughness of this work determines health . Erring human mind-forces can work only evil under whatever name or pretence they are em-186:9 ployed ; for Spirit and matter , good and evil , light and darkness , can not mingle . Evil negative and self-destructive Evil is a negation , because it is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is the absence of something . It is unreal , because it presupposes the absence of God , the omnipotent and omnipresent. 186:15 Every mortal must learn that there is neither power nor reality in evil . Evil is self-assertive . It says : " I am a real entity , over-186:18 mastering good . " This falsehood should strip evil of all pretensions . The only power of evil is to destroy itself . It can never destroy one iota of good . Every attempt of evil 186:21 to destroy good is a failure , and only aids in peremptorily punishing the evil-doer . If we concede the same reality to discord as to harmony , discord has as lasting a claim upon 186:24 us as has harmony . If evil is as real as good , evil is also as immortal . If death is as real as Life , immortality is a myth . If pain is as real as the absence of pain , both must be im-186:27 mortal ; and if so , harmony can not be the law of being . Ignorant idolatry Mortal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be self-deceived . If mortal mind knew how to be better , it 186:30 would be better . Since it must believe in some-thing besides itself , it enthrones matter as deity . The human mind has been an idolater from the beginning , 187:1 having other gods and believing in more than the one Mind . 187:3 As mortals do not comprehend even mortal existence , how ignorant must they be of the all-knowing Mind and of His creations . 187:6 Here you may see how so-called material sense creates its own forms of thought , gives them material names , and then worships and fears them . With pagan blindness , 187:9 it attributes to some material god or medicine an ability beyond itself . The beliefs of the human mind rob and enslave it , and then impute this result to another illusive 187:12 personification , named Satan . Action of mortal mind The valves of the heart , opening and closing for the pas-sage of the blood , obey the mandate of mor-187:15 tal mind as directly as does the hand , ad-mittedly moved by the will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but not of the former . 187:18 We say , " My hand hath done it . " What is this my but mortal mind , the cause of all materialistic action ? All voluntary , as well as miscalled involuntary , action of the 187:21 mortal body is governed by this so-called mind , not by matter . There is no involuntary action . The divine Mind includes all action and volition , and man in Science is gov-187:24 erned by this Mind . The human mind tries to classify action as voluntary and involuntary , and suffers from the attempt . Death and the body 187:27 If you take away this erring mind , the mortal material body loses all appearance of life or action , and this so-called mind then calls itself dead ; but the hu-187:30 man mind still holds in belief a body , through which it acts and which appears to the human mind to live , - a body like the one it had before death . This body 188:1 is put off only as the mortal , erring mind yields to God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ image . Embryonic sinful thoughts 188:3 What is termed disease does not exist . It is neither mind nor matter . The belief of sin , which has grown terrible in strength and influence , is an uncon-188:6 scious error in the beginning , - an embryonic thought without motive ; but afterwards it governs the so-called man . Passion , depraved appetites , 188:9 dishonesty , envy , hatred , revenge ripen into action , only to pass from shame and woe to their final punishment . Disease a dream Mortal existence is a dream of pain and pleasure in 188:12 matter , a dream of sin , sickness , and death ; and it is like the dream we have in sleep , in which every one recognizes his condition to be wholly a state of 188:15 mind . In both the waking , and the sleeping dream , the dreamer thinks that his body is material and the suffering is in that body . 188:18 The smile of the sleeper indicates the sensation pro-duced physically by the pleasure of a dream . In the same way pain and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mortals by unmistakable signs . Sickness is a growth of error , springing from mortal ignorance or fear . Error rehearses error . What causes 188:24 disease can not cure it . The soil of disease is mortal mind , and you have an abundant or scanty crop of disease , according to the seedlings of fear . Sin and the fear of 188:27 disease must be uprooted and cast out . Sense yields to understanding When darkness comes over the earth , the physical senses have no immediate evidence of a sun . 188:30 The human eye knows not where the orb of day is , nor if it exists . Astronomy gives the desired information regarding the sun . The human or 189:1 material senses yield to the authority of this science , and they are willing to leave with astronomy the explanation of 189:3 the sun 's influence over the earth . If the eyes see no sun for a week , we still believe that there is solar light and heat . Science ( in this instance named natural ) raises 189:6 the human thought above the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fear . In like manner mortals should no more deny the power 189:9 of Christian Science to establish harmony and to explain the effect of mortal mind on the body , though the cause be unseen , than they should deny the existence of the sun-189:12 light when the orb of day disappears , or doubt that the sun will reappear . The sins of others should not make good men suffer . Ascending the scale 189:15 We call the body material ; but it is as truly mortal mind , according to its degree , as is the material brain which is supposed to furnish the evidence 189:18 of all mortal thought or things . The human mortal mind , by an inevitable perversion , makes all things start from the lowest instead of from the highest 189:21 mortal thought . The reverse is the case with all the formations of the immortal divine Mind . They proceed from the divine source ; and so , in tracing them , we con-189:24 stantly ascend in infinite being . Human reproduction From mortal mind comes the reproduction of the species @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ani-189:27 mate matter . According to mortal thought , the development of embryonic mortal mind commences in the lower , basal portion of the brain , and 189:30 goes on in an ascending scale by evolution , keeping always in the direct line of matter , for matter is the subjective condition of mortal mind . 190:1 Next we have the formation of so-called embryonic mortal mind , afterwards mortal men or mortals , - all this 190:3 while matter is a belief , ignorant of itself , ignorant of what it is supposed to produce . The mortal says that an inani-mate unconscious seedling is producing mortals , both body 190:6 and mind ; and yet neither a mortal mind nor the immortal Mind is found in brain or elsewhere in matter or in mortals . Human stature This embryonic and materialistic human belief called 190:9 mortal man in turn fills itself with thoughts of pain and pleasure , of life and death , and arranges itself into five so-called senses , which presently 190:12 measure mind by the size of a brain and the bulk of a body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , maturity , and decay are as the 190:15 grass springing from the soil with beautiful green blades , afterwards to wither and return to its native nothingness . This mortal seeming is temporal ; 190:18 it never merges into immortal being , but finally disap-pears , and immortal man , spiritual and eternal , is found to be the real man . 190:21 The Hebrew bard , swayed by mortal thoughts , thus swept his lyre with saddening strains on human existence : As for man , his days are as grass : 190:24 As a flower of the field , so he flourisheth . For the wind passeth over it , and it is gone ; And the place thereof shall know it no more . 190:27 When hope rose higher in the human heart , he sang : As for me , I will behold Thy face in righteousness : I shall be satisfied , when I awake , with Thy likeness . . . . . . 190:30 For with Thee is the fountain of life ; In Thy light shall we see light . 191:1 The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It can take no cognizance of Mind . Matter is not the organ of infi-191:3 nite Mind . As mortals give up the delusion that there is more than one Mind , more than one God , man in God 's likeness will 191:6 appear , and this eternal man will include in that likeness no material element . The immortal birth As a material , theoretical life-basis is found to be a 191:9 misapprehension of existence , the spiritual and divine Principle of man dawns upon human thought , and leads it to " where the young child was , " 191:12 - even to the birth of a new-old idea , to the spiritual sense of being and of what Life includes . Thus the whole earth will be transformed by Truth on its pinions of light , 191:15 chasing away the darkness of error . Spiritual freedom The human thought must free itself from self-imposed materiality and bondage . It should no longer 191:18 ask of the head , heart , or lungs : What are man 's prospects for life ? Mind is not helpless . Intelli-gence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not a blade of grass springs up , not a spray buds within the vale , not a leaf unfolds its fair outlines , not a flower starts from its cloistered cell . 191:24 The Science of being reveals man and immortality as based on Spirit . Physical sense defines mortal man as based on matter , and from this premise infers the mor-191:27 tality of the body . No physical affinity The illusive senses may fancy affinities with their op-posites ; but in Christian Science , Truth never mingles 191:30 with error . Mind has no affinity with matter , and therefore Truth is able to cast out the ills of the flesh . Mind , God , sends forth the aroma of Spirit , 192:1 the atmosphere of intelligence . The belief that a pulpy substance under the skull is mind is a mockery of intelli-192:3 gence , a mimicry of Mind . We are Christian Scientists , only as we quit our reliance upon that which is false and grasp the true . We are not 192:6 Christian Scientists until we leave all for Christ . Human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ear , from corporeality instead of from Principle , 192:9 and from the mortal instead of from the immortal . Spirit is not separate from God . Spirit is God . Human power a blind force Erring power is a material belief , a blind miscalled force , 192:12 the offspring of will and not of wisdom , of the mortal mind and not of the immortal . It is the headlong cataract , the devouring flame , the tempest 's 192:15 breath . It is lightning and hurricane , all that is selfish , wicked , dishonest , and impure . The one real power Moral and spiritual might belong to Spirit , who holds 192:18 the " wind in His fists ; " and this teaching accords with Science and harmony . In Science , you can have no power opposed to God , and the physi-192:21 cal senses must give up their false testimony . Your in-fluence for good depends upon the weight you throw into the right scale . The good you do and embody gives you 192:24 the only power obtainable . Evil is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which erelong betrays its weakness and falls , never to rise . 192:27 We walk in the footsteps of Truth and Love by follow-ing the example of our Master in the understanding of divine metaphysics . Christianity is the basis of true heal-192:30 ing . Whatever holds human thought in line with unselfed love , receives directly the divine power . Mind cures hip-disease I was called to visit Mr. Clark in Lynn , who had been 193:1 confined to his bed six months with hip-disease , caused by a fall upon a wooden spike when quite a boy . On enter-193:3 ing the house I met his physician , who said that the patient was dying . The physician had just probed the ulcer on the hip , and said the bone was carious 193:6 for several inches . He even showed me the probe , which had on it the evidence of this condition of the bone . The doctor went out . Mr. Clark lay with his eyes fixed and 193:9 sightless . The dew of death was on his brow . I went to his bedside . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave place to a natural hue . The eyelids 193:12 closed gently and the breathing became natural ; he was asleep . In about ten minutes he opened his eyes and said : " I feel like a new man . My suffering is all gone . " 193:15 It was between three and four o'clock in the afternoon when this took place . I told him to rise , dress himself , and take supper with 193:18 his family . He did so . The next day I saw him in the yard . Since then I have not seen him , but am informed that he went to work in two weeks . The discharge from 193:21 the sore stopped , and the sore was healed . The diseased condition had continued there ever since the injury was received in boyhood . 193:24 Since his recovery I have been informed that his physician claims to have cured him , and that his mother has been threatened with incarceration in an insane asylum 193:27 for saying : " It was none other than God and that woman who healed him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report , but what I saw and did for that man , and what 193:30 his physician said of the case , occurred just as I have narrated . It has been demonstrated to me that Life is God 194:1 and that the might of omnipotent Spirit shares not its strength with matter or with human will . Review-194:3 ing this brief experience , I can not fail to discern the coincidence of the spiritual idea of man with the divine Mind . Change of belief 194:6 A change in human belief changes all the physical symp-toms , and determines a case for better or for worse . When one 's false belief is corrected 194:9 Truth sends a report of health over the body . Destruction of the auditory nerve and paralysis of the optic nerve are not necessary to ensure deafness and blind-194:12 ness ; for if mortal mind says , " I am deaf and blind , " it will be so without an injured nerve . Every theory op-posed to this fact ( as I learned in metaphysics ) would 194:15 presuppose man , who is immortal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Power of habit The authentic history of Kaspar Hauser is a useful hint 194:18 as to the frailty and inadequacy of mortal mind . It proves beyond a doubt that education consti-tutes this so-called mind , and that , in turn , 194:21 mortal mind manifests itself in the body by the false sense it imparts . Incarcerated in a dungeon , where neither sight nor sound could reach him , at the age of 194:24 seventeen Kaspar was still a mental infant , crying and chattering with no more intelligence than a babe , and realizing Tennyson 's description : 194:27 An infant crying in the night , An infant crying for the light , And with no language but a cry . 194:30 His case proves material sense to be but a belief formed by education alone . The light which affords us joy gave 195:1 him a belief of intense pain . His eyes were inflamed by the light . After the babbling boy had been taught to 195:3 speak a few words , he asked to be taken back to his dun-geon , and said that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cold silence he found no 195:6 peace . Every sound convulsed him with anguish . All that he ate , except his black crust , produced violent retchings . All that gives pleasure to our educated senses 195:9 gave him pain through those very senses , trained in an opposite direction . Useful knowledge The point for each one to decide is , whether it is mortal 195:12 mind or immortal Mind that is causative . We should forsake the basis of matter for meta-physical Science and its divine Principle . 195:15 Whatever furnishes the semblance of an idea governed by its Principle , furnishes food for thought . Through as-tronomy , natural history , chemistry , music , mathematics , 195:18 thought passes naturally from effect back to cause . Academics of the right sort are requisite . Observa-tion , invention , study , and original thought are expansive 195:21 and should promote the growth of mortal mind out of it-self , out of all that is mortal . It is the tangled barbarisms of learning which we 195:24 deplore , - the mere dogma , the speculative theory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their exaggerated pictures , impossible ideals , and specimens 195:27 of depravity , fill our young readers with wrong tastes and sentiments . Literary commercialism is lowering the intellectual standard to accommodate the purse and to 195:30 meet a frivolous demand for amusement instead of for improvement . Incorrect views lower the standard of truth . 196:1 If materialistic knowledge is power , it is not wisdom . It is but a blind force . Man has " sought out many inven-196:3 tions , " but he has not yet found it true that knowledge can save him from the dire effects of knowledge . The power of mortal mind over its own body is little understood . Sin destroyed through suffering 196:6 Better the suffering which awakens mortal mind from its fleshly dream , than the false pleasures which tend to perpetuate this dream . Sin 196:9 alone brings death , for sin is the only element of destruction . " Fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body 196:12 in hell , " said Jesus . A careful study of this text allows that here the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The command was a warning to beware , 196:15 not of Rome , Satan , nor of God , but of sin . Sickness , sin , and death are not concomitants of Life or Truth . No law supports them . They have no relation to God 196:18 wherewith to establish their power . Sin makes its own hell , and goodness its own heaven . Dangerous shoals avoided Such books as will rule disease out of mortal mind , - 196:21 and so efface the images and thoughts of dis-ease , instead of impressing them with forcible descriptions and medical details , - will help 196:24 to abate sickness and to destroy it . Many a hopeless case of disease is induced by a single post mortem examination , - not from infection nor from 196:27 contact with material virus , but from the fear of the disease and from the image brought before the mind ; it is a mental state , which is afterwards outlined on the 196:30 body . Pangs caused by the press The press unwittingly sends forth many sorrows and diseases among the human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diseases and by printing long descriptions which mirror images of disease distinctly in thought . A 197:3 new name for an ailment affects people like a Parisian name for a novel garment . Every one hastens to get it . A minutely described dis-197:6 ease costs many a man his earthly days of comfort . What a price for human knowledge ! But the price does not ex-ceed the original cost . God said of the tree of knowledge , 197:9 which bears the fruit of sin , disease , and death , " In the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die . " Higher standard for mortals The less that is said of physical structure and laws , and 197:12 the more that is thought and said about moral and spiritual law , the higher will be the stand-ard of living and the farther mortals will be re-197:15 moved from imbecility or disease . We should master fear , instead of cultivating it . It was the ignorance of our forefathers in the departments 197:18 of knowledge now broadcast in the earth , that made them hardier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politicians . Diet and dyspepsia 197:21 We are told that the simple food our forefathers ate helped to make them healthy , but that is a mistake . Their diet would not cure dyspepsia at this 197:24 period . With rules of health in the head and the most digestible food in the stomach , there would still be dyspeptics . Many of the effeminate constitutions 197:27 of our time will never grow robust until individual opin-ions improve and mortal belief loses some portion of its error . Harm done by physicians 197:30 The doctor 's mind reaches that of his patient . The doctor should suppress his fear of disease , else his belief in its reality and fatality will harm his patients even more 198:1 than his calomel and morphine , for the higher stratum of mortal mind has in belief more power to harm man than 198:3 the substratum , matter . A patient hears the doctor 's verdict as a criminal hears his death-sentence . The patient may seem calm under it , but he is 198:6 not . His fortitude may sustain him , but his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gaining the mastery , is increased by the physician 's words . Disease depicted 198:9 The materialistic doctor , though humane , is an art-ist who outlines his thought relative to disease , and then fills in his delineations with sketches from text-198:12 books . It is better to prevent disease from forming in mortal mind afterwards to appear on the body ; but to do this requires attention . The thought of 198:15 disease is formed before one sees a doctor and before the doctor undertakes to dispel it by a counter-irritant , - perhaps by a blister , by the application of caustic or 198:18 croton oil , or by a surgical operation . Again , giving an-other direction to faith , the physician prescribes drugs , until the elasticity of mortal thought haply causes a 198:21 vigorous reaction upon itself , and reproduces a picture of healthy and harmonious formations . A patient 's belief is more or less moulded and formed 198:24 by his doctor 's belief in the case , even though the doctor says nothing to support his theory . His thoughts and his patient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weaker . Hence the importance that doctors be Christian Scientists . Mind over matter Because the muscles of the blacksmith 's arm are 198:30 strongly developed , it does not follow that exercise has produced this result or that a less used arm must be weak . If matter were the cause 199:1 of action , and if muscles , without volition of mortal mind , could lift the hammer and strike the anvil , it 199:3 might be thought true that hammering would enlarge the muscles . The trip-hammer is not increased in size by exercise . Why not , since muscles are as material as 199:6 wood and iron ? Because nobody believes that mind is producing such a result on the hammer . Muscles are not self-acting . If mind does not move 199:9 them , they are motionless . Hence the great fact that Mind alone enlarges and empowers man through its mandate , - by reason of its demand for and supply of 199:12 power . Not because of muscular exercise , but by rea-son of the blacksmith 's faith in exercise , his arm becomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bodies or make them sick , according as they influence them through mortal mind . To know whether this development is produced 199:18 consciously or unconsciously , is of less impor-tance than a knowledge of the fact . The feats of the gym-nast prove that latent mental fears are subdued by him . 199:21 The devotion of thought to an honest achievement makes the achievement possible . Exceptions only confirm this rule , proving that failure is occasioned by a too feeble 199:24 faith . Had Blondin believed it impossible to walk the rope over Niagara 's abyss of waters , he could never have 199:27 done it . His belief that he could do it gave his thought-forces , called muscles , their flexibility and power which the unscientific might attribute to a lubricating oil . His 199:30 fear must have disappeared before his power of putting resolve into action could appear . Homer and Moses When Homer sang of the Grecian gods , Olympus was 200:1 dark , but through his verse the gods became alive in a nation 's belief . Pagan worship began with muscularity , 200:3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of David . Moses advanced a nation to the worship of God in Spirit instead of matter , and il-200:6 lustrated the grand human capacities of being bestowed by immortal Mind . A mortal not man Whoever is incompetent to explain Soul would be wise 200:9 not to undertake the explanation of body . Life is , always has been , and ever will be independent of matter ; for life is God , and man is the idea 200:12 of God , not formed materially but spiritually , and not subject to decay and dust . The Psalmist said : " Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of Thy 200:15 hands . Thou hast put all things under his feet . " The great truth in the Science of being , that the real man was , is , and ever shall be perfect , is incontrovertible ; 200:18 for if man is the image , reflection , of God , he is neither inverted nor subverted , but upright and Godlike . The suppositional antipode of divine infinite Spirit 200:21 is the so-called human soul or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flesh that warreth against Spirit . These so called material senses must yield to the infinite 200:24 Spirit , named God . St. Paul said : " For I determined not to know any-thing among you , save Jesus Christ , and him crucified . " 200:27 ( I Cor. ii . 2 . ) Christian Science says : I am determined not to know anything among you , save Jesus Christ , and him glorified . CHAPTER VIII - FOOTSTEPS OF TRUTH Remember , Lord , the reproach of Thy servants ; how I do bear in my bosom the reproach of all the mighty people ; wherewith Thine enemies have reproached , O Lord ; wherewith they have reproached the footsteps of Thine anointed. - PSALMS . Practical preaching 201:1 THE best sermon ever preached is Truth practised and demonstrated by the destruction of sin , sickness , 201:3 and death . Knowing this and knowing too that one affection would be supreme in us and take the lead in our lives , Jesus said , " No man can serve 201:6 two masters . " We can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new creature , in whom old things pass away 201:9 and " all things are become new . " Passions , selfishness , false appetites , hatred , fear , all sensuality , yield to spirit-uality , and the superabundance of being is on the side 201:12 of God , good . The uses of truth We can not fill vessels already full . They must first be emptied . Let us disrobe error . Then , when 201:15 the winds of God blow , we shall not hug our tatters close about us . The way to extract error from mortal mind is to pour 201:18 in truth through flood-tides of Love . Christian perfec-tion is won on no other basis . Grafting holiness upon unholiness , supposing that sin 202:1 can be forgiven when it is not forsaken , is as foolish as straining out gnats and swallowing camels . 202:3 The scientific unity which exists between God and man must be wrought out in life-practice , and God 's will must be universally done . Divine study 202:6 If men would bring to bear upon the study of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the so-called pains and pleasures of material sense , 202:9 they would not go on from bad to worse , until disciplined by the prison and the scaffold ; but the whole human family would be redeemed through 202:12 the merits of Christ , - through the perception and ac-ceptance of Truth . For this glorious result Christian Science lights the torch of spiritual understanding . Harmonious life-work 202:15 Outside of this Science all is mutable ; but immortal man , in accord with the divine Principle of His being , God , neither sins , suffers , nor dies . The days 202:18 of our pilgrimage will multiply instead of di-minish , when God 's kingdom comes on earth ; for the true way leads to life instead of to death , and earthly 202:21 experience discloses the finity of error and the infinite capacities of Truth , in which God gives man dominion over all the earth . Belief and practice 202:24 Our beliefs about a Supreme Being contradict the practice growing out of them . Error abounds where Truth should " much more abound . " We 202:27 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very present help in trouble ; " and yet we rely on a drug or hypnotism to heal disease , as if senseless matter or err-202:30 ing mortal mind had more power than omnipotent Spirit . Sure reward of righteousness Common opinion admits that a man may take cold in the act of doing good , and that this cold may produce 203:1 fatal pulmonary disease ; as though evil could overbear the law of Love , and check the reward for do-203:3 ing good . In the Science of Christianity , Mind - omnipotence - has all-power , assigns sure rewards to righteousness , and shows that matter can 203:6 neither heal nor make sick , create nor destroy . Our belief and understanding If God were understood instead of being merely be-lieved , this understanding would establish health . The 203:9 accusation of the rabbis , " He made himself the Son of God , " was really the justification of Jesus , for to the Christian the only true 203:12 spirit is Godlike . This thought incites to a more exalted worship and self-abnegation . Spiritual perception brings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 203:15 but God , and so makes man the image of his Maker in deed and in truth . Suicide and sin We are prone to believe either in more than one Su-203:18 preme Ruler or in some power less than God . We im-agine that Mind can be imprisoned in a sensuous body . When the material body has gone to ruin , when evil has 203:21 overtaxed the belief of life in matter and destroyed it , then mortals believe that the deathless Principle , or Soul , escapes from matter and lives on ; but this is not 203:24 true . Death is not a stepping-stone to life , immortality , and bliss . The so-called sinner is a suicide . Sin kills the sinner and will continue to kill 203:27 him so long as he sins . The foam and fury of illegiti-mate living and of fearful and doleful dying should disappear on the shore of time ; then the waves of sin , 203:30 sorrow , and death beat in vain . God , divine good , does not kill a man in order to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . God is at 204:1 once the centre and circumference of being . It is evil that dies ; good dies not . Spirit the only intelligence and substance 204:3 All forms of error support the false conclusions that there is more than one Life ; that material history is as real and living as spiritual history ; that mortal 204:6 error is as conclusively mental as immortal Truth ; and that there are two separate , an-tagonistic entities and beings , two powers , - namely , 204:9 Spirit and matter , - resulting in a third person ( mortal man ) who carries out the delusions of sin , sickness , and death . 204:12 The first power is admitted to be good , an intelligence or Mind called God . The so-called second power , evil , is the unlikeness of good . It can not therefore be mind , though 204:15 so called . The third power , mortal man , is a supposed mixture of the first and second antagonistic powers , in-telligence and non-intelligence , of Spirit and matter . Unscientific theories 204:18 Such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ test of Science . Judging them by their fruits , they are corrupt . When will the ages under-204:21 stand the Ego , and realize only one God , one Mind or intelligence ? False and self-assertive theories have given sinners the 204:24 notion that they can create what God can not , - namely , sinful mortals in God 's image , thus usurping the name without the nature of the image or reflection of divine 204:27 Mind ; but in Science it can never be said that man has a mind of his own , distinct from God , the all Mind . 204:30 The belief that God lives in matter is pantheistic . The error , which says that Soul is in body , Mind is in matter , and good is in evil , must unsay it and cease from such 205:1 utterances ; else God will continue to be hidden from hu-manity , and mortals will sin without knowing that they 205:3 are sinning , will lean on matter instead of Spirit , stumble with lameness , drop with drunkenness , consume with dis-case , - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerning God and man . Creation perfect When will the error of believing that there is life in matter , and that sin , sickness , and death are creations of 205:9 God , be unmasked ? When will it be under-stood that matter has neither intelligence , life , nor sensation , and that the opposite belief is the prolific 205:12 source of all suffering ? God created all through Mind , and made all perfect and eternal . Where then is the necessity for recreation or procreation ? Perceiving the divine image 205:15 Befogged in error ( the error of believing that matter can be intelligent for good or evil ) , we can catch clear glimpses of God only as the mists disperse , 205:18 or as they melt into such thinness that we per-ceive the divine image in some word or deed which indicates the true idea , - the supremacy and real-205:21 ity of good , the nothingness and unreality of evil . Redemption from selfishness When we realize that there is one Mind , the divine law of loving our neighbor as ourselves is unfolded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man 's normal drift towards the one Mind , one God , and leads human thought into opposite channels 205:27 where selfishness reigns . Selfishness tips the beam of human existence towards the side of error , not towards Truth . Denial of the one-205:30 ness of Mind throws our weight into the scale , not of Spirit , God , good , but of matter . When we fully understand our relation to the Divine , 206:1 we can have no other Mind but His , - no other Love , wisdom , or Truth , no other sense of Life , and no con-206:3 sciousness of the existence of matter or error . Will-power unrighteous The power of the human will should be exercised only in subordination to Truth ; else it will misguide the judg-206:6 ment and free the lower propensities . It is the province of spiritual sense to govern man . Material , erring , human thought acts injuriously both 206:9 upon the body and through it . Will-power is capable of all evil . It can never heal the sick , for it is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sentiments - hope , faith , love - is the prayer of the righteous . This prayer , governed by Science instead of the senses , heals the sick . 206:15 In the scientific relation of God to man , we find that whatever blesses one blesses all , as Jesus showed with the loaves and the fishes , - Spirit , not matter , being the 206:18 source of supply . Birth and death unreal Does God send sickness , giving the mother her child for the brief space of a few years and then taking it away 206:21 by death ? Is God creating anew what He has already created ? The Scriptures are definite on this point , declaring that His work was finished , 206:24 nothing is new to God , and that it was good . Can there be any birth or death for man , the spiritual image and likeness of God ? Instead of God sending 206:27 sickness and death , He destroys them , and brings to light immortality . Omnipotent and infinite Mind made all and includes all . This Mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God does not cause man to sin , to be sick , or to die . No evil in Spirit There are evil beliefs , often called evil spirits ; but 207:1 these evils are not Spirit , for there is no evil in Spirit . Because God is Spirit , evil becomes more apparent and 207:3 obnoxious proportionately as we advance spir-itually , until it disappears from our lives . This fact proves our position , for every scientific state-207:6 ment in Christianity has its proof . Error of statement leads to error in action . Subordination of evil God is not the creator of an evil mind . Indeed , evil 207:9 is not Mind . We must learn that evil is the awful decep-tion and unreality of existence . Evil is not supreme ; good is not helpless ; nor are the 207:12 so-called laws of matter primary , and the law of Spirit secondary . Without this lesson , we lose sight of the per-fect Father , or the divine Principle of man . Evident impossibilities 207:15 Body is not first and Soul last , nor is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-evident impossibilities , such as the amalgama-207:18 tion of Truth and error in cause or effect . Science sepa-rates the tares and wheat in time of harvest . One primal cause There is but one primal cause . Therefore there can 207:21 be no effect from any other cause , and there can be no reality in aught which does not proceed from this great and only cause . Sin , sickness , dis-207:24 ease , and death belong not to the Science of being . They are the errors , which presuppose the absence of Truth , Life , or Love . 207:27 The spiritual reality is the scientific fact in all things . The spiritual fact , repeated in the action of man and the whole universe , is harmonious and is the ideal of Truth . 207:30 Spiritual facts are not inverted ; the opposite discord , which bears no resemblance to spirituality , is not real . The only evidence of this inversion is obtained from 208:1 suppositional error , which affords no proof of God , Spirit , or of the spiritual creation . Material sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense of the infinite . Seemingly independent authority The Scriptures say , " In Him we live , and move , and 208:6 have our being . " What then is this seeming power , in-dependent of God , which causes disease and cures it ? What is it but an error of belief , - 208:9 a law of mortal mind , wrong in every sense , embracing sin , sickness , and death ? It is the very anti-pode of immortal Mind , of Truth , and of spiritual law . 208:12 It is not in accordance with the goodness of God 's char-acter that He should make man sick , then leave man to heal himself ; it is absurd to suppose that matter can both 208:15 cause and cure disease , or that Spirit , God , produces disease and leaves the remedy to matter . John Young of Edinburgh writes : " God is the father 208:18 of mind , and of nothing else . " Such an utterance is " the voice of one crying in the wilderness " of human beliefs and preparing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real and eternal , and prepare for the reign of Spirit , the kingdom of heaven , - the reign and rule of universal harmony , which can not be lost nor remain 208:24 forever unseen . Sickness as only thought Mind , not matter , is causation . A material body only expresses a material and mortal mind . A mortal 208:27 man possesses this body , and he makes it harmonious or discordant according to the images of thought impressed upon it . You embrace 208:30 your body in your thought , and you should delineate upon it thoughts of health , not of sickness . You should banish all thoughts of disease and sin and of other beliefs 209:1 included in matter . Man , being immortal , has a perfect indestructible life . It is the mortal belief which makes 209:3 the body discordant and diseased in proportion as igno-rance , fear , or human will governs mortals . Allness of Truth Mind , supreme over all its formations and governing 209:6 them all , is the central sun of its own systems of ideas , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and man is tributary to divine Mind . The 209:9 material and mortal body or mind is not the man . The world would collapse without Mind , without the in-telligence which holds the winds in its grasp .
