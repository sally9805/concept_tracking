MORPHINE . I HAVE lived for ten years of my life in a dream ; a waking dream . I say a dream because , although that term does not exactly describe my mental condition during the period alluded to , it still describes it with sufficient accuracy for all practical purposes , and , when qualified by the adjective I have here associated with it , describes it perhaps more accurately than any other which I could employ . Yes , dear reader , I have spent ten years of my life in a dream ; ten of the best years of my life , those occurring between thirty and forty years of age , - that period of a man 's life when he is , or ought to be , in the prime and vigor of his manhood ; when , if ever , the foundations of his fortune are laid ; when , if ever , fame and distinction are acquired ; when , if ever , he feels ambition stirring within him . During this most important period of my life I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morphine , opium . But for this I might have won fortune , and perhaps fame . But it was not to be . The light of my life was obscured by the dark clouds of opium . Thus were ten of the best years of my life wasted , utterly wasted . I made my first acquaintance with morphine through the medium of a physician 's prescription . From my earliest youth I had been afflicted with neuralgia , as had been my father before me , and other members of our family as well . in fact , the disease seemed to be hereditary in our family . At first it made its appearance in the form of ticdouloureux , a most excruciating pain in the face and jaws . R.emoving at nineteen years of age to a large city , where the services of better dentists could be had than a country place affords , the extraction of all badly . decayed teeth , and some attention to those that remained , removed the exciting cause of // Morphine . the tic , and so I was happily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of some years . This immunity from suffering was not however of permanent duration . In the summer of 1857 my old enemy returned . The stomach this time was selected as the point of attack ; that being , I presume , the most vulnerable point . Every evening , about dark , the enemy commenced his assault . Then it was that for the first time , by direct'lon of my physician , I took morphine . A solution was made of one grain sulphate of morphia in an ounce of water , of which I was directed to take one quarter , then wait for half an hour , and if by that time relief had not been obtained , I was to repeat the dose , and so on every half-hour , unUl I found myself free from pain . The first dose produced no sensible mitigation of the symptoms . The second merely took the wire edge off the pain , so to speak . The third dose rendered me comparatively comfortable , but it was only after I had taken the fourth and last portion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I experienced full and entire relief . I may be pardoned the minuteness with which I have dwelt upon the circumstances connected with my taking morphine for the first time ; because it was the first link in a long chain of evils , and as such it forms an incident in my life 's history indelibly stamped upon the tablet of memory , and therefore not to be slightin*ly passed over ; and because of the interest which others of my class - 1 mean the class of opium-eaters ; and a large class it is - take in the recital of anything relatin* to their habit , not to speak of the interest which medical men and others have also in this subject . To say that I was now free from pain would be to describe only the negative effects of the drug I had taken . I went to bed and lay during the whole night in a most delightful reverie . Time seemed to speed onward with increased velocity . Oh how the hours flew by ! It seemed to be but twenty minutes from one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tingling sensation as or prickly June , heat , all over the body . With this trifling exception , my condition physically was one of the most perfect comfort and satisfaction ; and not until morning came , did I feel that sense of drowsiness and stupor resulting from the morphine as its secondary effect . Finding , then , that a grain of morphine was just the quantity required in my case , I took that amount every day , in the evening , while the neuralgia continued , which was for three or four weeks ; when the disease left me . Being now free from pain , I ceased taking morphine , as the necessity for it had ceased . This was my first experience with morphine ; would to God it had been my last ! And this experience was pleasant , leaving no sting behind . Is it then to be wondered at , that upon the next attack of my hereditary enemy , and in all subsequent attacks , I employed a remedy which had worked so well before , in fact the only remedy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became acquainted with morphine as a remedy for neuralgia pain , its periodical attacks were anticipated with dread . Now I was able to look the enemy in the face with some degree of composure , not to say complacency . Its advent was viewed with horror and dismay no longer . For had I not discovered a remedy , a sovereign remedy , a remedy at once prompt , efficient , and safe ? And not only that , but one which at the same time that it relieved my sufferings , yielded me the most exquisite delight . But there came a time when matters took a different turn , when my relations with morphine were not of so friendly a nature , and when my reflections became of a more sombre hue . In the autumn of 1858 , in consequence of an attack of typhoid fever , which was characterized throu0hout its continuance by extreme pain in the head , the battle-ground was again shifted from the stomach to the head . Though the pain varied much in its character and in its immediate locality ; being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the back ; sometimes confined to one spot , as just over the right or the // Morphine . left eye , or to one or the other of the posterior inferior angles of the cranium , and sometimes diffused oyer the whole coronal region , rendering the scalp sore to the touch - so sore that while it continued I could wear no headcovering except a knitted woolen cap , or a hat made of the softest and lightest felt ; when to cut my hair was agony , and even to comb it drew tears : however much the disease varied in its manifestations or in its special locality , the kead was always , from this time forward , the point d ' app ut . Not only was the seat of the pain changed from this time , but the character of the disease upon which it depended was also chan0ed . Whereas before , it was periodical in its manifestations , occurring once or twice a year , and lasting from one to four weeks , now it continued - with the exception of such intermissions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - all the time . In short , the malady had changed from the acute to the chronic form . Before I had fully recovered from the effects of the fever , the neuralgia set in , in the chronic form ; and I was never free from pain a single day for four months , except when under the influence of morphine . In the mean time I had become an inmate of a water-cure , but had not as yet received any benefit from the treatment . At the end of four months the neuralgia suddenly ceased , and I immediately laid aside the morphine , as I had done always before on the subsidence of the pain . Although I had been using the drug in moderation , never exceeding a grain to a grain and a half daily , yet having taken it continuously for four months , I found a difficulty in thus suddenly leaving it off which I had never experienced before . I felt as weak as a child , and as though I was falling to pieces . All the secretions of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been locked up , were now poured forth abundantly . Perspiration was profuse . Yet it was a cold and clammy sweat , and I was compelled to go to bed and cover up with blankets in order to keep warm in the middle of a July day . I had a 699 gnawing sensation in my stomach which demanded for its satisfaction mustard , pepper , and other hot and stimulating condiments . And for eight days and nights I never closed an eye in sleep . But in a little over a week , the system had fully reacted , and I began to feel pretty comfortable . I had not yet become a confirmed opium-eater , but I had made a narrow escape . I had been standing on dangerous ground . The neuralgia returned before I had been free from it a month . Being still at the water-cure , I brought to my aid all the resources of hydropathy . I tried cold baths and warm baths , and a most rigid diet , a*ll to no purpose ; and after suffering as none but a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old remedy , and the only remedy for this protean malady . It may be that I resumed the use of the drug without proper reflection ; but when does a man in severe and agonizing pain ever reflect ? Although I suffered , suffered severely , when last I abandoned the use of the morphine , still I did not suffer as much from . that cause as I was now suffering from neuralgic pain . I thought I was choosing the least of two evils . I now struggled both against the disease and against the remedy . I tried hard not to become an opium-eater . I tried hard to sever the links of the chain rapidly forging about me , links which were becoming every day more adamantine . And at one time , and that within four months of the date of my last resumption , taking advantage of a temporary cessation of pain , I almost succeeded . Yet I did not succeed . After this period my pains increased , calling for increased doses of morphine . I had now become a confirmed opiumeater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several months . My custom was to take it twice a day ; the first portion immediately on rising in the morning , and the second about the middle of the afternoon ; though sometimes I took it three or four times a day , if upon occasion I had more pain than common ; and of course making the amount taken for that day largely in // iiiorphine. excess of the usual daily quantum . I bought my supplies - one ei0hth of an ounce at a time - put up in the botties containing that amount , which are familiar to druggists , physicians , and all others accustomed to use thc article , and which I kept in the drawer of my washstand , convenient of access . Besides this I carried a little vial , - such as homeopathic physicians use to contain their pellets , - with a few grains , in my waistcoat pocket , so as to have it always at hand in case I should be away from home for a day or a part of a day . My health was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor indeed . I was as thin as a shadow ; did not weigh a hundred pounds . My complexion was sallow , the secretions of the body all locked up , and all the organic functions sluggishly performed . But the morphine kept me for the most part free from pain . Under its influence I slept well at night , and for a while in the beginning of the winter I spent the time , in daylight , in dozing upon the sofa . After mid-winter my health improved somewhat , I lessened the quantity of morphine I was using , and in consequence I became more wakeful , and my mind more active . I now spent my time mostly in reading and writing . I also took up the study of stenography . Although I had given up all idea of business long before , I was still unwilling that my time should be wholly lost ; so I pursued this study not alone as a pastime , but with a view to its profitable employment at some future time as a means of gaining a livelihood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recover my health sufficiently to work at it . Towards spring I left the water-cure and went for a while to Philadelphia , and soon after to the country again , where I spent most of the two years following . I have nothing special to re- , cord as to this period of my career , until we come to the summer of 1861 . It was at this time that I took the largest ( loses of morphine that I ever attained to , amounting to an average of ten grains daily . That was the maximum .. The disease was generally worse in the fjJune , winter season , owing to confinement indoors and want of exercise , thus requiring larger doses of morphine for its relief . Under these circumstances I sometimes took six or eight grains a day ; but . on the advent of warm and tileasant weather , when I could be more out-doors , my health would improve , so that I was enabled to come back to the old standard of about half that amount . But now at the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my favor , the disease grew worse than it had ever before been . It was under these circumstances that I gradually advanced to ten grains of morphine a day . My health , as I have just stated , was miserable indeed . Though when under the influence of the morphine 1 suffered no actual pain , still I never felt completely well ; and taking the drug in such enormous quantity as I did , I could lie down and go to sleep at any hour of the day or night . In fact , it was difficult for me at all times to keep awake . Although the stimulating effect of the large doses I was taking at this time was very great , the narcotic effect was still greater , indeed overpowering . The drug had lost its exhilarating effect on the mind , and I had become *loomy and despondent . I had almost lost hope . But just here , when I least expected it , deliverance came . It was on the night of the last day of September . I went to bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and no worse than common . But I awoke some time in the night feeling deathly sick , and suffering severe pain in the stomach . About daylight I attempted to take my usual morning dose of morphine . I had scarcely set down the glass from which I had taken it , dissolved in a little water , accordin , , to my customary method , when I threw it - the morphine- up again . This alarmed me very much , for I thought that if I should not be able to retain the morphine on my stomach , I should die for the want of it . I had not learned then , as I have since , that morphine could he dispensed with thus suddenly , after the habit of taking it had been formed . I made another attempt // Morphine . to take morphine during the day , with better success . A critical action by vomiting and diarrhma now commehced , which seemed to tear down the system to its very foundations . Every vestige of disease was cleared out by this convulsion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the vomiting ceased , I found myself , for the first time in some years , free from neuralgic pain . The diarrhma continued for three months afterwards . Owing to the absence of neuralgic pain , I was now enabled to reduce at once the daily rations of morphine to about half the'amount I had lately been using . From this point I made further reduction , week by week and day by day , until by the first day of January following , just three months after the commencement of my late illness , I was able to lay it aside entirely . While the morphine was in process of reduction , and for some time afterwards , by medical advice I made free use of alcoholic stimulus , in order to supply the place of the stimulus of the morphine which was being gradually withdrawn . But whether this was of any advantage or not , I am not now able to say . I did not suffer much while disusing the morphine , except from that gnawing sensation in my stomach , which I have adverted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left off the drug suddenly . I suffered also from sleeplessness . During the period of my convalescence I went to Philadelphia , and not being able to content myself in bed when I could not sleep , I usually spent the first half of the night at the theatre , or at some concert-saloon , listening to the music and drinking whisky punch . Sleep at length came back to me , and I was now in a better condition of health than I had enjoyed for years . I had gained about thirty pounds in weight . In the month of March , 1862 , I left Philadelphia and went to reside with Dr. - , in southern New York , to enter upon the study of medicine , and at the same time to assist him in the conduct of the institution of which he was proprietor , a sort of private hospital . 701 In the capacity of assistant to Dr. - , I had an opportunity of witnessing the cure of several opium-eaters by his method , as a number of his patients were drawn from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patient abandon the use of the drug at once , without any preliminary . This plan , though always attended with an immense amount of suffering , was generally successful , at least for the time being , though relapses sometimes occurred after the patient had left the institution . My health had now become pretty well established . But it was for a very brief period indeed . About the beginning of July of this year , symptoms of my old malady began again to make themselves felt . I took every precaution to ward off the attack . I tried all the resources of allopathy , homeopathy , and hydropathy , together with a most rigid regimen ; for above all things I did not wish again to become an opium-eater . But what was to be done ? Althou*h my condition before , when taking morphine habitually , was a truly deplorable one , still it was more tolerable than my condition was now , without it . While using it moderately I could give some attention to business ; I had still some enjoyment oflife , especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intellectual faculties to increased activity . And , barring all considerations of this kind , I was free from pain while under its influence . Now 1 was wholly incapacitated for business of any kind , and enjoyment was out of the question . I had no pleasure in existence ; life was a burden . I fought the enemy long and desperately ; fought him with the energy of despair , until , overcome with suffering , I finally succumbed . Then I took morphine for a single day , making a truce with the enemy , as it were , for that short period , only to renew the battle the day following . Then on the third day I took morphine again . In this way I kept the enemy at bay for several weeks , making it a rule never to take ' morphine two days in succession , thus giving the system time fully to recover from the effects of one dose before tak // Morphine . ing another . ? thought that in this way I incurred less danger of falling back ac , ain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this rule could no longer be observed , and I took morphine every day ; but once a day for a while , and , by the time winter had set in , twice a day , or oftener , as required . Thus , in about a year from the time I had gone through the tremendous crisis described a little further back , I was again in the gall of bitterness . Indeed , I had come to that condition in which I cared but little whether I lived or died . I had become , in short , perfectly reckless of consequences . Under the influence of the morphine I was comparatively comfortable ; and being at this season of the year - winter - in a measure released from duty in Dr. -s institution , I had increased opportunity to pursue my medical studies . I studied diligently this winter , and made good progress . In the spring , I left Dr. -s and went to Brooklyn to reside with another physician , in much the same capacity as that in which I had lived with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studies , assisting my present preceptor as I had done my former one . In the autumn of 1863 I left Brooklyn and went a , , aiu to the country . I was now entirely out of business . It is needless here to recapitulate the numerous frantic attempts I made to break my fetters since my last resumption of morphine ; how I tried to substitute chloroform in its stead , and sometimes liquor . All of which attempts failed , as I predict all such attempts must fail . Nor need I tell how , while yet I was in Brooklyn , I went resolutely to bed for a whole month and tried to starve out the neuralgia , taking no nourishment during that time except a plate of soup every day at dinner time . I had also a cup of cocoa for my breakfast , and a cup of tea for supper . There was no nourishment in these last , of course , except what was due to the milk and sugar which they contained . This experiment also was a failure . After this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfied that they could never succeed . MSr health was at this time variable , sometimes better and sometimes worse , and the amount of morphine used varied as did my health . Still I was not at this period of my career using it in inordinate quantities . The average , one month with another , was not more than three or four grains a day . Sometimes for months together it was even less than this . I now read a good deal , as formerly , especially on medical subjects ; for having entered upon the study of medicine , I was determined to go through with it , my condition at this time being not so bad but that I could make good progress . I also kept up my practice at short-hand , and in time managed to acquire such a degree of expertness in the stenographic art , as to warrant me in offering my services as a professional reporter . I had now been out of employment for a long time , and began to feel the necessity of exerting myself to gain a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to New York and engaged as reporter at Fowler and Wells 's , phrenologists , to report phrenological examinations . Soon after going to New York , I made trial of electricity for my neuralgia , but without experiencing any benefit . Under the close confinement incident to a sedentary occupation , my health now still further declined , until at length I again got up to my old maximum of ten grains of morphine a day . Using a large amount of morphine as I did at this time , a time when the drug was at its highest price , and eating but little , my weekly bills therefor were sometimes in excess of the amount I paid at a restaurant of the middle class for food . Morphine was to me , at this period , board and lod , ing , fuel and washing , combined . It destroyed any natural appetite for food I might otherwise have had , and therefore but little food was required . And under the narcotic effect of such large doses , I could sit down and fall asleep anywhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As under like circumstances before , I could scarcely // Morphine . keep sufficiently awake to attend to business . Stimulating as it was , it kept me always warm ; and checking as it did the excretion from the skin , I could wear a shirt a week without soiling . While in New York this winter I saw many openings for business in the line of the profession which I had adopted , which were suited to my capacities and tastes ; opportunities to engage in enterprises affording scope to such talents as I possessed , but all of which I was compelled to forego in consequence of the state of my health . I was bound hand and foot . These considerations , at times , almost maddened me . I finally grew so restless under this condition of affairs that I determined to achieve my freedom at all hazards . My friend and former preceptor , Dr. - , urged me to come to him , enter his institution as a patient , and give up the morphine at once and forever . It was one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , taking morphine for neuralgic pain , would have pain as long as he continued to take morphine . That is , that though he took morphine in consequence of pain , yet after a time the pain would persist in consequence of the daily doses of morphine - just as old coffee-drinkers sometimes have a headache which coffee alone will relieve , but which will return next day in consequence *of the coffee drunk the day before to cure it . He thought that if I could but *ive up the morphine , I would in a week 's time thereafter find myself free from pain . Accordingly , in the be , ianing of March of the year we have now arrived at , that is , the year 1865 , I left New York and went to Dr. - , s . I arrived at my destination the same day I left the city . This was Saturday . In the morning , before going aboard the cars , I took five grains of morphine , and 1 had five grains yet remaining , which I bad intended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last I would take . But reflecting that the sooner the struggle commenced , the sooner it would be over , as I was not suffering much pain , I decided not to take it , for I 703 would thereby gain a few hours ' time . I had the five grains of morphine still in the little vial which I carried in my waistcoat pocket , when Dr. - came to visit me in my room the next morning , and I gave it to him then and there , well knowing that the time would soon come when I would not be able to resist the temptation to make use of it if left anywhere within my reach . Two days afterwards I would have given five dollars for those five grains of morphine . Yes , I would have given all I was worth for even one grain . I slept pretty well the first night , notwithstanding the want of my usual afternoon dose . This was , I suppose , partly owing to the fatigue of my journey . The next day I kept my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the head ; but I had not yet come out from under the influence of the morphine . I had my breakfast in bed ; ate some dinner , too ; but before tea-time I had got beyond the point where food could be tolerated . The second night I did not rest so well . But it was not until the morning of Monday , forty-eight hours after I had taken the last morphine , that the struggle may be said to have fairly commenced . I can take enough of morphine in one day to have its effects last for two days afterwards . During the forenoon of this day I rolled and tossed and threshed about in my bed , in a perfect agony of nervousness and distress . A freezing perspiration broke out over the whole body , alternated with flushes of heat . At one moment I felt as if buried deep in Arctic snows ; the next as though I lay on a lake of burning lava . Then came violent and protracted sternutation . I sneezed like one taking a severe cold ; sneezed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At length a bilious diarrhuia set in , accompanied with vomiting of a dark , bilious matter . All the secretions of the body , long suppressed by the morphine , were now poured forth with unexampled profuseness . Nature , long cheated of her rights , was now making reprisals . The liver , especially , was now exacting cent // Morphine . per cent . for long years of abuse . That terrible gnawing in my stomach , which I have alluded to before as occurring in like circumstances , was again felt . The vomiting gave relief to this for a few minutes afterwards . Sometimes , too , after vomiting I could lie back in bed and doze for perhaps five minutes . This was the only sleep I had , and the only cessation of my sufferin0s , ni0ht or day , for a week . After this had gone on for three or four days , I begged the doctor to give me morphine - but a single grain - in order that I might have a short respite from my sufferin0s , promising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I should want no more , but would allow things to take their course . But he was inexorable . I then wanted liquor of some kind . That too was refused . He said , however , he would give me some bromide of potash , which would make me sleep . Of this I took double , triple , quadruple doses , but all without the least effect . One night as I lay as my bed , suffering more than tongue can tell , I bethought me of a vial containing about two fiuid-drachms of extra stron , laudanum , which I had in a medical case in my trunk . Quick as lightning I bounded out of bed , got it out of my trunk , and before the attendant could prevent me , took out the cork and swallowed the whole . I had not time to return the vial to its case before I threw the laudanum up again . My stomach had by this time become too irritable to retain it . Thus nature was left to fight out the battle alone and unaided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the experiment had proceeded so far . Matters continued in pretty much the same state until the end of the week . On Saturday the violence of the reaction be , an to subside . At noon of that day I felt as though I could eat something , and accordingly I made a light dinner . This was the first food I had taken since noon of the Sunday previous , just six days . I was pretty comfortable during the afternoon . I now felt that the long struggle wa* o . rer . And more than all , I was now June , free from neuralgic pain . Dr. - said that here was proof of the truth of his theory . I did not so regard it . 1 thought that my freedom from pain was alone due to the tremendous crisis I had just passed through , a crisis which few diseases could withstand . I was now a truly happy and thankful man . The next day - Sunday - I still kept my bed , happy in contrasting my situation now with what it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was able to get out to the bath-room and take a bath , after which I went into the parlor and lay on the sofa for the rest of the day , only too glad to escape from confinement within the four walls of my chamber , the silent witnesses of my sufferings , and mingle once more with con , enial society . 1 was extremely weak , as I might be supposed to be , after a week 's battling with the enemy , and fasting the while . But my appetite was now keen , and my digestion rapid , and I bade fair to make up very soon for my previous fasting . I could hardly wait from one meal to the next . Although the worst of my sufferings were now over , I was still far from being comfortable . That freezing perspiration was always present , especially down the spine , and I was exceedingly nervous and irritable and impatient , ready to fly into a passion upon the slightest occasion , or without occasion . And worse than all , I could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could lie down on the sofa and doze for five or ten minutes , I got but an hour or two of sleep at night for a month afterwards . I kept a lamp burningon my table all night , while I lay in bed and read Dc Quincey . After an absence of four weeks I returned to New York and to business . 1 was not yet fit for business , being so nervous that I could scarcely write . I therefore remained in New York but a fortnight after my return , when I resigned my situation at Fowler and Wells 's and went into the western part of the State , to recruit for awhile and then enter upon a professional engagement with another party . // Morpidne . It was now about six weeks since I had taken the last morphine . My health in the mean time had not improved to that degree which I thought I had a right to expect . I was free from neuralgic pain , it is true , but I was still nervous and irritable , and exceedin0ly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued . It seemed indeed to be more profuse than it had been three weeks before . Other sympt6ms there were too , which , along with this , indicated a state of great relaxation of the general system . I saw that tonic remedies were called for , and I took quinine , but without any effect whatever . Mine is one of those constitutions upon which quinine never seems to have any effect . At length the time came when I must go to work , though in no fit condition for it . Short-hand reporting is a pursuit requiring in those who would practice it the best condition of mental and physical capacity . The mental faculties which it calls into action are put to the utmost stretch , and the physical health must be such as to give them adequate support . However , the attempt must be made , and I made it . I very soon found that without assistance from some quarter I could not succeed . What was to be done now ? I ventured to take a grain of morphine . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , never losing a word . And I could do any amount of labor at transcribing , the drudgery of the stenographer . I now liked to work , the harder and the more of it the better . The morphine had such a bracing and tonic effect ! I felt when I walked as though I had a man on each side of me , supporting me . It brought such a feeling of physical and mental vigor , such a feeling of weilness , - to coin a word , - as I had never experienced before . The next day I felt not quite so vigorous , but still I was by no means so weak and languid as I had been two days before . It was not until the third day that I lapsed fully into my former condition . I then repeated the dose . Two days subsequently I took morphine again . I found myself necessitated to 705 take it every second day in order to be able to work , and I was determined not to take it oftener , for I knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I thought that in the mean while , perhaps in two or three weeks , my system might rally , and so become able to work itself out of its relaxed condition , when the morphine could be dispensed with . Here , and here only , do I acknowledge guilt in my dealings with morphine : that is , in taking it merely to remove languor of the system , and brace it up sufficiently to enable me to attend to business , at a time when I was not suffering actual pain . Had I had my time fully at my own command I would doubtless have acted differently . But I was the victim of circumstances . Work I must , and in my then condition I could not work . Say , ye cavilers , what in like circumstances would you have done ? It seemed too as though I had now lost that wholesome fear of morphine which I had once entertained . I had once understood that the opiumhabit was one from which , when once formed , there was no escape except by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stop it was equally fatal . My recent experience had taught me differently . I had now learned that the habit could be broken off instantly with safety , if the unfortunate victim could but muster up the requisite degree of pluck to enable him without flinching to undergo the punishment that must of necessity ensue . I knew that if I should unluckily fall back into my old habits , I could get out of them again by the same course which I had taken so recently . So 1 played with morphine as a child plays with fire . Instead of any improvement taking place in my physical condition , such as I had hoped for , matters only grew worse ; and to add to my other difficulties , neuralgic troubles began again to make their appearance about this time . It was not long , under this new condition of affairs , before I found myself compelled to take morphine every day , then twice a day , and also to in- // life rp hine . crease the dose . Thus gradually and imperceptibly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slipped back again into the gulf from which I had been so lately rescued . In a few months after this I got up to my old average of ten grains a day . I continued to work at my profession all this summer , but I was determined as soon as circumstances would permit , that is , as soon as I should get a sufficient sum of money by me , to take a furlough , and turn my attention to the recovery of my health . Accordingly , in the autumn of this year I resie , ned my situation with this view , and went under medical treatment . I wished again to make the experiment which I had made six months before , that is , of giving up the morphine at once . My medical adviser this time , however , was a physician . who was opposed to any such violent measures . His plan was to reduce the quantity of morphine used , day by day , and thus bring the patient down gradually , and almost insensibly , to nothing at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the course I had taken before ; but after I had been for two days without morphine , I was induced by the doctor - and that without much persuasion on his part , you may be sure - to change my tactics , and consent to follow his plan instead of my own . By so doing , I succeeded in about a week in bringing down the daily quantum from ten grains to one , and that without much suffering except from a severe pain in the head , which , however , gradually declined , until at the end of the week it left me entirely . Here now was pretty good proof of the correctness of Dr. -s theory before alluded to , namely , that the pain I suffered was in a great measure caused by the morphine I was constantly using . I was unwilling to believe this when I left off the morphine abruptly before , and found myself free from pain soon after ; because , as I have already stated , I attributed my release from pain on that occasion to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But in reducing June . the quantity consumed gradually , as I had now done , no such revulsion occurred . And although I was not yet entirely free from the morphine , still I was not taking it in an amount sufficient to interfere materially with the organic functions . I had arrived at that happy mean where the amount taken was just sufficient to answer the demands of an organism long accustomed to a powerful stimulus , yet not enough to oppress ; and the system was working better under the influence of this small quantity than it was possible for it to do had the drug been wholly and at once withdrawn , which would only have created disturbance . I wish just here to say a word to neural , , ic sufferers in regard to this pain in the head which is caused by taking morphine or other preparations of opium . It is not true neural0ia . Persons who habitually use stimulants or narcoties of any kind are very apt to have headache when the effect of the dose begins to pass off , demanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus a continued use of the a*ent they are accustomed to employ , whatever that may be . This headache is almost always worse in the morning , after hayinc , slept under the influence of the potion taken the evening before . One is most likely to awake out of a hypnotic sleep with a headache . To obtain permanent relief , then , from a headache caused thus indirectly by a stimulant or narcotic of whatever kind , the entire abandonment of such stimulant or narcotic is in ( licated . Although the affection nude ; consideration mi , , ht be termed a nervous headache , it is not neuralgic . I could always distinguish between it and neuralgia . Whereas the former is a dull pain diffused over the frontal region , the latter is a sharp , lancinating pain , mostly confined to one spot . Any one who has ever suffered from nenral , , in never fails afterwards to distinguish it from every other kind of pain . In my own case , the affection in question usually followed an attack of neuralgia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . // Aito*phine . But to return to my story ; I continued to take one grain of morphine daily during the second week , and after that I gradually reduced the amount from week to week , hoping in this way finally to abandon it altogether ; but before I got quite to the end , I began to be again troubled with neuralgia , and so had to make a retrograde movement . I suppose I had not been sufficiently careful in my diet ; for my stomach was yet weak , and under the lessened doses of morphine , and the full play of all the excretory functions incident thereto , my appetite became so keen that I could with difficulty control it . I believe this is the experience of all opium-eaters retiring - as De Quincey would say - or lately retired from business . Here then I again met with a defeat to all my recently cherished hopes , as I had often done before , and from the same cause . Before six months had gone round , I once more arrived at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I kept up to the maximum but for a very short time now , however , and I may here state that this was the last time - namely , June , 1866- that lever attained to this lar.e quantity . In all my subsequent experience , I never , under the most unfavorable circumstances , got much beyond half that amount as a daily ration . Herein is shown the falsity of the opinion very generally entertained , that the longer a man uses opium , the greater will his daily doses of it become . The same doctrine is held by most people in regard to other stimulants and narcotics , and I believe it to be equally fallacious as respects them . Reflecting upon the many failures I had made to disuse the morphine , when I was almost at the point of success , I resolved that the next time I should succeed in bringin , down the daily quantum to one grain , I would then , and at that point , stop entirely , without waiting for a further reduction , and running the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a retrograde movement , and a loss of all that had been already gained , as had always occurred before . I thought that if I 707 could go from ten grains of morphine a day to none at all , at one step , as I had once done , and yet live , I could surely step down from one grain to nothing without much inconvenience . The time came at length when I was afforded an opportunity of carrying my newly formed resolution into effect . I made the trial . I passed successfully through all the stages of nervousness and uneasiness , immediately following the abandonment of the morphine , and though my condition after that was one of unmitigated misery , still my sufferings were not greater than I was able to bear . But after the lapse of two days , that gnawing sensation in the stomach , before adverted to , again set in . It was worse now than it had ever been before under similar circumstances . It seemed to be even more severe now , when breaking off from a ration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been when breaking off from ten grains a day . On the latter occasion , the revulsion that resulted was so great that the gastric disturbance was in some degree masked by the violence of the other symptoms . And moreover , the emesis that then occurred gave me some relief , as has been already stated . The change in coming down from one grain of morphine to nothing was not so great as to producu any such violent reaction as I had before experienced ; and there was now no emesis . I bore my sufferings as well as I could till the end of the fourth day , and then I had to yield . A few weeks afterwards I made another trial with the same result . And in all subsequent trials that . I made , I could never hold out against these gastric symptoms beyond the fourth day . I had now been idle for a year an ( l a half , and the time had come round again when , sick or well , I must work . I accordingly made an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living in western New York , who had a large correspondence , and who was also engaged in authorship . Though the salary was not large , the work to be done did not require my whole time . It was stipulated that // Morphine . I should board in the family of my employer , who was a health reformer of the hygienic school . I had been compelled to use the graham bread ever since my use of morphine commenced . 1 was not always able to obtain as good a quality of the article as I wished , but here I got the staff of life made to perfection , together with an abundance of good fruit . The diet was plain and simple throughout , and I derived iminense benefit from it . To this cause more than to any other , do I attribute the measure of comfort , not to say health , which I enjoyed while I remained in this situation . My daily consumption of morphine at this period was from two to three grains . It rarely , if ever , exceeded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well on two grains a day ; one of the ordinary drachm bottles sometimes lasting a month . When my time here expired by limitation , I refused to renew the engagement . I had now a little money ahead , and I determined to turn my attention for a while to the recovery of my health , and solely to that . Soon after this time I met with a gentleman , an old friend of mine , who had rather an exaggerated opinion of . my capacities , and who in consequence offered to employ me at a much greater salary than I had yet received , if I would only quit taking morphine : this was a condition precedent to his employing me ; and also that I took no morphine as long as I remained with him . He wished me to put myself under the care of a certain physician whom he named , and who he thought could cure me . This was an opening , to one in my circumstances , too good to be lost ; and I thought it worth while to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Accordingly I consented to the terms proposed , and in a few days afterwards commenced treatment in accordance with my friend 's desires . I was deprived of all morphine at once , and put under surveillance , not being allowed to leave my room for any purpose whatever . I went through the usual course of suffering incident to the June , sudden abandonment of the morphine , until I arrived at the point where the gastric disturbance begins . I have spoken of this as a gnawing sensation in the stomach , which seemed to increase in severity at each subsequent attempt I had made to quit the morphine . But nothing that I have said of these gastric symptoms heretofore will serve adequately to describe what I suffered now . I felt as if the mucous membrane of the stomach was being torn with pincers . I endured it with as much fortitude as I could bring to bear on the case , until the end of the third day , when I saw that to endure it longer and at the same time retain my sanity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the doctor was inexorable , and the attendants were watchful that I should not get out of the house to go for it myself . I managed , however , to elude their vigilance by getting up one night at midnight and going with tottering steps to a drug store a mile distant . I took one grain at once before leaving the druggist 's . I could scarcely wait until he weighed it out for me . I started for home as soon as I had taken it . Before I got half-way home I felt better . That is , my nervous system was composed , and I felt sufficiently stimulated by the morphine I had taken to walk along quite briskly . But that awful pinching , tearing sensation in my stomach was not yet entirely removed . It required an additional grain of mnorphine to give me complete relief from that . I have always found in the attempts I have made to quit the morphine abruptly , that if I allowed matters to progress until the stage of gastric irritation is reached , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a condition of comfort . For instance : if I have been taking one grain of morphine daily for a week , and leave it off entirely , certain feelings of uneasiness and discomfort are felt for the first two or three days ; then these may subside in some measure , and the gnawing sensation commences . If any time previous to the commencement of the latter , I take half to three quarters of a grain of // Aliorpidne. morphine , I am at once restored to comfort of body and serenity of mind . If , however , I wait until the gastric disti*rbance begins , a few hours later , nothing less than one and a half to two grains will then suffice to restore me to my former condition . Thus I again failed to achieve my freedom ; ingloriously failed , and that at a time when I had a powerful motive to succeed . I had now tried every plan I could think of , by which to escape from bonda*e , and they had all equally failed . The gradual plan of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times . The abrupt plan had also failed . Although I did succeed at one time in quitting the morphine for a while , by the latter plan , still I had had no permanent success , having been driven to resume it again within two months . And my resent experience had demonstrated that , however successful that plan might have been at an earlier period of my career , it was now no longer feasible . I had no further plan to propose to myself , and I saw that if I got out of my difficulties at all , it must be in virtue of assistance derived from some source foreign to myself . In the beginning of the next year - 1869 - I heard that opium-eaters were sometimes received at the New York State Inebriate Asylum at Binghamton , and that Dr. Day , the superintendent of that institution , had by his method of treatment succeeded in curing some desperate cases . I therefore wrote to Dr. Day , giving him a history of my case , and making inquiries . Dr. Day thought I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no means a bad one . Accordingly , in the month of June , I went to Binghamton and became an inmate of the Inebriate Asylum . I had been more than usually unwell this spring , and for some time previous to this , I had been taking four grains of morphine a day . Upon entering the asylum I was wholly deprived of morphine , and given instead a substitute , which seemed fully to supply its place . At least , while using the substitute , I suffered no inconvenience from the want 709 of the morphine . Here was a desideratum found at length , and I was highly elated with the prospect . What this substitute was composed of I know not . I once asked Dr. Day if it contained opium . He said it did not . lie did not , however , say that it contained no morphine . His reply to my inquiry may , therefore , have been strictly correct ; for although opium is morphine , and more , yet , strictly speaking , morphine is not opium . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contain morphine , or at least some preparation or some principle of opium , for it had all the effects of that upon the system . Whatever this substitute may have been , I took it in daily diminishing doses ; and when , at the end of three we*eks , - for causes , the explanation of which I need not enter upon here , - I left the asylum , I found myself still necessitated to use morphine , though in greatly lessened doses . The only result of my stay there was to reduce the daily consumption of morphine from four grains to one . I believe that had circumstances been such that I could have remained longer , I might have got entirely out of the difficulty , but the time was not sufficient to perfect the cure . The question now arose , What is next to be done ? In order to solve this problem satisfactorily , it became necessary to take a review of the situation . I knew that the amount of morphine I had been using of late years was considerably less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been progressively decreasing from year to year . I knew that whereas for the first five years of my career as an opium-eater , the average daily consumption had been six grains , and the maximum ten grains ; for the next three years the average had been about three and a half grains a day , and the maximum five ; and for the last year the average had been only two and a half grains , with a maximum never exceeding four grains . Here was evidence that the habit , as a habit , had not grown upon me . I was not taking morphine for the sake of the morphine , but for relief from agonizing pain , and // Jib rpAine. as that was less severe than formerly , it required less morphine for its relief . I found some crumbs of comfort in these two associated facts . I had also learned in the course of my medical reading that the malady from which I suffered was in many cases limited to subjects under forty years of age , and that neuralgic sufferers often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period of life . Here was further ground for hope . As I was fast approaching that age beyond which I would most likely have no further trouble from neuralgia , and as I knew that the violence of the disease had already somewhat abated within the last few years , I cherished the hope that I might , ata time now not far distant , outgrow it entirely . And , if happily I should do so , I thought that I could in that case abandon the use of the morkhine gradually and without suffering . I had never yet experienced much difficulty , indeed any difficulty , in reducing from day to day the quantity of morphine I was using , when free from pain . The only difficulty hitherto had been , that before sufficient time had elapsed to get quite to the bottom of the lone , descending scale , the neuralgia would return , preventing , for the time being , not only any further descent , but necessitating an upward movement . That I could disuse the morphine by degrees , and without suffering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sufficient length of time , I knew from the fact that I had once done so ; namely , in 1861 , after the occurrence of that'violent illness already referred to . In consequence of that illness , and the critical action which then took place , the neuralgia was , for the time , so thoroughly cleared out of the system , that it did not return for a long time afterwards ; so that I had upon this occasion sufficient time to bring the experiment to a successful issue , without the interference of any untoward occurrence to interrupt my progress . But such an opportunity as this had never since occurred . Thus , upon a review of my entire career as an opium-eater , things did June , not , after all , look so desperate . All 1 had to do , I thought , was merely to have patience and wait . It was only a question of time . And however long that time might be , relief must come finally . I endeavored to console myself as well as I could with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would arise in my mind that I might have to wait too long ; might have to wait , in fine , until the strength and vigor of manhood were past , beyond recall , and every opportunity for fulfilling life 's mission forever gone . I spent the summer and autumn of this year with my old friend and former preceptor , Dr. - , giving him in exchange for my board and lodging such assistance in the oversight of his patients and the general conduct of his institution , as I was able in my then state of health to render . Although I was now sometimes free from neuralgic pain , sometimes I suffered severely . The favorite locality of the pain this season seemed to be in the left posterior inferior angle of the cranium . When situated here it seemed to be more severe than when felt anywhere else , requiring a larger amount of morphine to overcome it . I could hardly ever get relief with less than two or three grains . I began to be troubled also this summer with gastric irritation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This , too , seemed to require large doses of morphine for its relief . So for a great part of the time , when I had not neuralgia I had gastric irritation , and when I had not astric irritation I had neuralgia , and sometimes I had both together . I was thus placed between two fires , one or the other of which was always burning , and sometimes both together . Owing to this unlucky combination of circumstances , I was compelled to use the morphine to a greater extent than I had done the previous year ; and it now began to tell with disastrous effect upon the general economy . I had determined in the spring of this year that I would get out of my difficulties , if possible , before another winter should set in , as , owing to the chilliness // Morphine . and the freezing sensation immediately succeeding the abandonment of the morphine , the summer is a rather more favorable time for laying it aside . But spring had run into summer , summer into autumn , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the slough of despond . What could I do ? All my previous attempts to free myself from this incubus had failed . I had never yet been able to endure that terrible Onawino ' sensation in stom ' *h be my a*. yond the fourth day . At length it occurred to me to try the following plan : to go without morphine for two or three days , then taken single moderate dose ' then go without again for two or three days , and again take a moderate portion ; and so on , perhaps increasing the length of the intervals of abstinence as I progressed , but never pi*tshing the matter so far at any one time as to arrive at the stage where the gastric disturbance begins ; for when I did this , it always took , as I have previously remarked , a much larger quantity of morphine to restore me to my pre-abstinent condition than it did when I stopped short of this stage . As I had always derived signal advantage from an abstinence from the morphine , if but for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which improvement sometimes continued for months afterwards , I thought the experiment which I now proposed to try , whether it succeeded fully or not , could not fail to be of some benefit to me . It might start some of the organic functions into activity , which seemed to have almost ceased ; it might bring me , physically , up to the plane I had occupied six months before . Accordingly , I laid the morphine aside for the space of two days and a half to begin with ; then I took a single dose . Then 1 quit again for three days and a half ; then took morphine again . I now thought that at the next trial I could abstain for a week ; and if for a week , that I could do without it entirely , - for all time . I * , ot along very well for three or four days . To my surprise , none of the untoward symptoms which usually 711 succeed the sudden abandonment of the drug had as yet occurred . Although I felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not refuse my food ; had missed my meals scarcely for a single day . Were the powers of nature so far gone that there was not vi0or of constitution left sufficient to get up a reaction ? Matters went on in this way , without much variation , until about the end of the fourth day , when in the evening , after I had gone to bed , my old acquaintance , that terrible sensation in the stomach , again put in an appearance . I have before described this symptom as progressively increasing in severity at each subsequent trial I had made to abandon the use of the morphine , until at the last trial it seemed as though the mucous membrane of the stomach was being torn with pincers . It was now something exceeding even that in severity ; something , in deed , far beyond all that I had ever before experienced . My stomach seemed to burn . I seemed to be on fire of hell . I now had evidence , very palpable evidence , that the powers of nature , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nerves of sensation at least , though paralyzed , were not yet dead . I did not call for morphine , as it might be supposed that under such circumstances I would . No ; I did not want that , for I knew that I had got beyond the point where a moderate quantity of morphine would bring relief . I wanted a diffusible stimulant ; liquor of some kind . I knew that my suffering was caused by the want of stimulation , and an alcoholic stimulus would , I thought , best answer this indication . Accordingly , they brought me a glass of old bourbon , which I lost no time in drinking . The effect was truly magical . That glass of whisky , as soon as it touched the mucous membrane of my stomach , seemed to put out the fire that was raging there as quickly as you could extinguish the live coals in a brazier by pouring on them a dipperful of water . Two hours later the burning returned , when the same remedy was applied with the same happy effect . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a quantity of liquor which , taken overnight by almost any man unaccustomed to it as I was , would be sufficie.nt to produce a splitting headache next morning ; but to my surprise , no such event occurred . On the contrary , I found that the severe pain in the head from which I had been suffering for two days previously had now altogether left me , and I now felt better every way than I had hitherto done . This was additional evidence that the whisky was , under the circumstances , an eminently proper remedy . I had no further trouble that night ; but on the following night the burning in my stomach again returned , though it was less severe . It continued to return at intervals for a week afterwards , but with steadily decreasing severity . It always yielded promptly to the alcoholic stimulus . I had now discovered a method by which the gastric disturbance , the only bar to my success heretofore in leaving off the morphiue , could be controlled . But I was in other respects very uncomfortable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unpleasant feelings would subside , as they had done before when I abandoned the morphine abruptMorgan Stanwood . June , ly , though I was taking ten grains a day . But now I seemed to be in this respect very little better at the end of a week than at the beginning . Then I suffered intensely for a week , when my sufferings suddenly ceased . By the persistent use of mercurials , I succeeded at length in getting the liver aroused to action , and the only difficulty that now remained was want of sleep . But after long and weary waiting , sleep did come to my eyes , and slumber to my eyelids at last . I have now done with morphine , I hope , forever . And although my condition Is one of comparative comfort , I am not yet restored to perfect health . That must be the work of time , if , indeed , it be ever accomplished . Had I known in the beginning all that I know now , I might have achieved my freedom much sooner ; yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where my mistakes occurred , so that others of my class , in attempting to do what I have done , might avoid them . I believe that all opiumeaters , at least all who have not yet suffered some organic lesion , may be saved . And believing that my experience with morphine may be useful to others , it is now given to the public . James Coulter Layard.
