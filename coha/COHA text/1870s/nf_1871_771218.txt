txt // upon with a tolerance , if not a reverence , befitting their difficulty and weight . Holding , as I do , the nebular hypothesis , I am logically bound to deduce the life of the world from forces inherent in the nebula . With this view , which is set forth in the second volume , it seemed but fair to associate the reasons which cause me to conclude that every attempt made in our day to generate life independently of antecedent life has utterly broken down . A discourse on the Electric Light winds up the Second volume . The incongruity of its position is to be referred to the lateness of its delivery . ******************** VOL . I. INORGANIC NATURE . I. THE CONSTITUTION OF NATURE . Footnote : ' Fortnightly Review , ' 1865 , vol. iii . p. 129 . WE can not think of space as finite , for wherever in imagination we erect a boundary , we are compelled to think of space as existing beyond it . Thus by the incessant dissolution of limits we arrive at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But , though compelled to think of space as unbounded , there is no mental necessity compelling us to think of it either as filled or empty ; whether it is so or not must be decided by experiment and observation . That it is not entirely void , the starry heavens declare ; but the question still remains , Are the stars themselves hung in vacuo ? Are the vast regions which surround them , and across which their light is propagated , absolutely empty ? A century ago the answer to this question , founded on the Newtonian theory , would have been , ' No , for particles of light are incessantly shot through space . ' The reply of modern science is also negative , but on different grounds . It has the best possible reasons for rejecting the idea of luminiferous particles ; but , in support of the conclusion that the celestial spaces are occupied by matter , it is able to offer proofs almost as cogent as those which can be adduced of the existence of an atmosphere round the earth . Men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the celestial and universal atmosphere through the study of the terrestrial and local one . From the phenomena of sound , as displayed in the air , they ascended to the phenomena of light , as displayed in the aether ; which is the name given to the interstellar medium . The notion of this medium must not be considered as a vague or fanciful conception on the part of scientific men . Of its reality most of them are as convinced as they are of the existence of the sun and moon . The luminiferous aether has definite mechanical properties . It is almost infinitely more attenuated than any known gas , but its properties are those of a solid rather than of a gas . It resembles jelly rather than air . This was not the first conception of the aether , but it is that forced upon us by a more complete knowledge of its phenomena . A body thus constituted may have its boundaries ; but , although the aether may not be co-extensive with space , it must at all events extend as far as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vehicle of their light , and without it they could not be seen . This all-pervading substance takes up their molecular tremors , and conveys them with inconceivable rapidity to our organs of vision . It is the transported shiver of bodies countless millions of miles distant , which translates itself in human consciousness into the splendour of the firmament at night . If the aether have a boundary , masses of ponderable matter might be conceived to exist beyond it , but they could emit no light . Beyond the aether dark suns might burn ; there , under proper conditions , combustion might be carried on ; fuel might consume unseen , and metals be fused in invisible fires . A body , moreover , once heated there , would continue for ever heated ; a sun or planet once molten , would continue for ever molten . For , the loss of heat being simply the abstraction of molecular motion by the aether , where this medium is absent no cooling could occur . A sentient being on approaching a heated body in this region , would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warmth dependent on the laws of radiation would not exist , and actual contact would first reveal the heat of an extra ethereal sun . Imagine a paddle-wheel placed in water and caused to rotate . From it , as a centre , waves would issue in all directions , and a wader as he approached the place of disturbance would be met by stronger and stronger waves . This gradual augmentation of the impression made upon the wader is exactly analogous to the augmentation of light when we approach a luminous source . In the one case , however , the coarse common nerves of the body suffice ; for the other we must have the finer optic nerve . But suppose the water withdrawn ; the action at a distance would then cease , and , as far as the sense of touch is concerned , the wader would be first rendered conscious of the motion of the wheel by the blow of the paddles . The transference of motion from the paddles to the water is mechanically similar to the transference of molecular motion from the heated body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the liquid is mechanically similar to the propagation of light and radiant heat . As far as our knowledge of space extends , we are to conceive it as the holder of the luminiferous aether , through which are interspersed , at enormous distances apart , the ponderous nuclei of the stars . Associated with the star that most concerns us we have a group of dark planetary masses revolving at various distances round it , each again rotating on its own axis ; and , finally , associated with some of these planets we have dark bodies of minor note  --  the moons . Whether the other fixed stars have similar planetary companions or not is to us a matter of pure conjecture , which may or may not enter into our conception of the universe . But probably every thoughtful person believes , with regard to those distant suns , that there is , in space , something besides our system on which they shine . From this general view of the present condition of space , and of the bodies contained in it , we pass to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Was space furnished at once , by the fiat of Omnipotence , with these burning orbs ? In presence of the revelations of science this view is fading more and more . Behind the orbs , we now discern the nebulae from which they have been condensed . And without going so far back as the nebulae , the man of science can prove that out of common non-luminous matter this whole pomp of stars might have been evolved . The law of gravitation enunciated by Newton is , that every particle of matter in the universe attracts every other particle with a force which diminishes as the square of the distance increases . Thus the sun and the earth mutually pull each other ; thus the earth and the moon are kept in company , the force which holds every respective pair of masses together being the integrated force of their component parts . Under the operation of this force a stone falls to the ground and is warmed by the shock ; under its operation meteors plunge into our atmosphere mid rise to incandescence . Showers of such meteors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this force , the earth , were it stopped in its orbit to-morrow , would rush towards , and finally combine with , the sun . Heat would also be developed by this collision . Mayer first , and Helmholtz and Thomson afterwards , have calculated its amount . It would equal that produced by the combustion of more than 5,000 worlds of solid coal , all this heat being generated at the instant of collision . In the attraction of gravity , therefore , acting upon non-luminous matter , we have a source of heat more powerful than could be derived from any terrestrial combustion . And were the matter of the universe thrown in cold detached fragments into space , and there abandoned to the mutual gravitation of its own parts , the collision of the fragments would in the end produce the fires of the stars . The action of gravity upon matter originally cold may , in fact , be the origin of all light and heat , and also the proximate source of such other powers as are generated by light and heat . But we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the heat thus produced ? This question has already been answered in a general way . Both light and heat are modes of motion . Two planets clash and come to rest ; their motion , considered as that of masses , is destroyed , but it is in great part continued as a motion of their ultimate particles . It is this latter motion , taken up by the rather , and propagated through it with a velocity of 186,000 miles a second , that comes to its as the light and heat of suns and stars . The atoms of a hot body swing with inconceivable rapidity  --  billions of times in a second  --  but this power of vibration necessarily implies the operation of forces between the atoms themselves . It reveals to us that while they are held together by one force , they are kept asunder by another , their position at any moment depending on the equilibrium of attraction and repulsion . The atoms behave as if connected by elastic springs , which oppose at the same time their approach and their retreat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vibration once set up is instantly shared with the aether , and diffused by it throughout space . We on the earth 's surface live night and day in the midst of aethereal commotion . The medium is never still . The cloud canopy above us may be thick enough to shut out the light of the stars ; but this canopy is itself a warm body , which radiates its thermal motion through the aether . The earth also is warm , and sends its heat-pulses incessantly forth . It is the waste of its molecular motion in space that chills the earth upon a clear night ; it is the return of thermal motion from the clouds which prevents the earth 's temperature , on a cloudy night , from falling so low . To the conception of space being filled , we must therefore add the conception of its being in a state of incessant tremor . The sources of this vibration are the ponderable masses of the universe . Let us take a sample of these and examine it in detail . When we look to our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solids , liquids , and gases . Subjected to a sufficiently low temperature , the two last , would also assume the solid form . When we look at any one of these , we generally find it composed of still more elementary parts . We learn , for example , that the water of our rivers is formed by the union , in definite proportions , of two gases , oxygen and hydrogen . We know how to bring these constituents together , so as to form water : we also know how to analyse the water , and recover from it its two constituents . So , likewise , as regards the solid portions of the earth . Our chalk hills , for example , are formed by a combination of carbon , oxygen , and calcium . These are the so-called elements the union of which , in definite proportions , has resulted in the formation of chalk . The flints within the chalk we know to be a compound of oxygen and silicium , called silica ; and our ordinary clay is , for the most part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the well-known light metal , aluminium . By far the greater portion of the earth 's crust is compounded of the elementary substances mentioned in these few lines . The principle of gravitation has been already described as an attraction which every particle of matter , however small , exerts on every other particle . With gravity there is no selection ; no particular atoms choose , by preference , other particular atoms as objects of attraction ; the attraction of gravitation is proportional simply to the quantity of the attracting matter , regardless of its quality . But in the molecular world which we have now entered matters are otherwise arranged . Here we have atoms between which a strong attraction is exercised , and also atoms between which a weak attraction is exercised . One atom can jostle another out of its place in virtue of a superior force of attraction . But , though the amount of force exerted varies thus from atom to atom , it is still an attraction of the same mechanical quality , if I may use the term , as that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same way , namely by the amount of motion which it can generate in a certain time . Thus the attraction of gravity at the earth 's surface is expressed by the number 32 ; because , when acting freely on a body for a second of time , gravity imparts to the body a velocity of thirty-two feet a second . In like manner the mutual attraction of oxygen and hydrogen might be measured by the velocity imparted to the atoms in their rushing together . Of course such a unit of time as a second is not here to be thought of , the whole interval required by the atoms to cross the minute spaces which separate them amounting only to an inconceivably small fraction of a second . It has been stated that when a body falls to the earth it is warmed by the shock . Here , to use the terminology of Mayer , we have a mechanical combination of the earth and the body . Let us suffer the falling body and the earth to dwindle in imagination to the size of atoms , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chemical affinity ; we have then what is called a chemical combination . The effect of the union in this case also is the development of heat , and from the amount of heat generated we can infer the intensity of the atomic pull . Measured by ordinary mechanical standards , this is enormous . Mix eight pounds of oxygen with one of hydrogen , and pass a spark through the mixture ; the gases instantly combine , their atoms rushing over the little distances which separate them . Take a weight of 47,000 pounds to an elevation of 1,000 feet above the earth 's surface , and let it fall ; the energy with which it will strike the earth will not exceed that of the eight pounds of oxygen atoms , as they dash against one pound of hydrogen atoms to form water . It is sometimes stated that gravity is distinguished from all other forces by the fact of its resisting conversion into other forms of force . Chemical affinity , it is said , can be converted into heat and light , and these again into magnetism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; being a force maintaining itself under all circumstances , and not capable of disappearing to give place to another . The statement arises from vagueness of thought . If by it be meant that a particle of matter can never be deprived of its weight , the assertion is correct ; but the law which affirms the convertibility of natural forces was never intended , in the minds of those who understood it , to affirm that such a conversion as that here implied occurs in any case whatever . As regards convertibility into heat , gravity and chemical affinity stand on precisely the same footing . The attraction in the one case is as indestructible as in the other . Nobody affirms that when a stone rests upon the surface of the earth , the mutual attraction of the earth and stone is abolished ; nobody means to affirm that the mutual attraction of oxygen for hydrogen ceases , after the atoms have combined to form water . What is meant , in the case of chemical affinity , is , that the pull of that affinity , acting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the one atom towards the other . This motion is not heat , nor is the force that produces it heat . But when the atoms strike and recoil , the motion of translation is converted into a motion of vibration , which is heat . The vibration , however , so far from causing the extinction of the original attraction , is in part carried on by that attraction . The atoms recoil , in virtue of the elastic force which opposes actual contact , and in the recoil they are driven too far back . The original attraction then triumphs over the force of recoil , and urges the atoms once more together . Thus , like a pendulum , they oscillate , until their motion is imparted to the surrounding aether ; or , in other words , until their heat becomes radiant heat . In this sense , and in this sense only , is chemical affinity converted into heat . There is , first of all , the attraction between the atoms ; there is , secondly , space between them . Across this space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they oscillate . There is here a change in the form of the motion , but there is no real loss . It is so with the attraction of gravity . To produce motion by gravity space must also intervene between the attracting bodies . When they strike together motion is apparently destroyed , but in reality there is no destruction . Their atoms are suddenly urged together by the shock ; by their own perfect elasticity these atoms recoil ; and thus is set up the molecular oscillation which , when communicated to the proper nerves , announces itself as heat . It was formerly universally supposed that by the collision of unelastic bodies force was destroyed . Men saw , for example , that when two spheres of clay , painter 's putty , or lead for example , were urged together , the motion possessed by the masses , prior to impact , was more or less annihilated . They believed in an absolute destruction of the force of impact . Until recent times , indeed , no difficulty was experienced in believing this , whereas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refuse to be united in most philosophic minds . In the collision of elastic bodies , on the contrary , it was observed that the motion with which they clashed together was in great part restored by the resiliency of the masses , the more perfect the elasticity the more complete being the restitution . This led to the idea of perfectly elastic bodies  --  bodies competent to restore by their recoil the whole of the motion which they possessed before impact  --  and this again to the idea of the conservation of force , as opposed to that destruction of force which was supposed to occur when unelastic bodies met in collision . We now know that the principle of conservation holds equally good with elastic and unelastic bodies . Perfectly elastic bodies would develop no heat on collision . They would retain their motion afterwards , though its direction might be changed ; and it is only when sensible motion is wholly or partly destroyed , that heat is generated . This always occurs in unelastic collision , the heat developed being the exact equivalent of the sensible motion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elasticity , denied to the masses , exists among their atoms ; by the recoil and oscillation of which the principle of conservation is vindicated . But ambiguity in the use of the term ' force ' makes itself more and more felt as we proceed . We have called the attraction of gravity a force , without any reference to motion . A body resting on a shelf is as much pulled by gravity as when , after having been pushed off the shelf , it falls towards the earth . We applied the term force also to that molecular attraction which we called chemical affinity . When , however , we spoke of the conservation of force , in the case of elastic collision , we meant neither a pull nor a push , which , as just indicated , might be exerted upon inert matter , but we meant force invested in motion  --  the vis viva , as it is called , of the colliding masses . Force in this form has a definite mechanical measure , in the amount of work that it can perform . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weight . A man walking up-hill , or up-stairs , with a pound weight in his hand , to an elevation say of sixteen feet , performs a certain amount of work , over and above the lifting of his own body . If he carries the pound to a height of thirty-two feet , he does twice the work ; if to a height of forty-eight feet , he does three times the work ; if to sixty-four feet , he does four times the work , and so on . If , moreover , he carries up two pounds instead of one , other things being equal , he does twice the work ; if three , four , or five pounds , he does three , four , or five times the work . In fact , it is plain that the work performed depends on two factors , the weight raised and the height to which it is raised . It is expressed by the product of these two factors . But a body may be caused to reach a certain elevation in opposition to the force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hodman , for example , wished to land a brick at an elevation of sixteen feet above the place where he stood , he would probably pitch it up to the bricklayer . He would thus impart , by a sudden effort , a velocity to the brick sufficient to raise it to the required height ; the work accomplished by that effort being precisely the same as if he had slowly carried up the brick . The initial velocity to be imparted , in this case , is well known . To reach a height of sixteen feet , the brick must quit the man 's hand with a velocity of thirty-two feet a second . It is needless to say , that a body starting with any velocity , would , if wholly unopposed or unaided , continue to move for ever with the same velocity . But when , as in the case before us , the body is thrown upwards , it moves in opposition to gravity , which incessantly retards its motion , and finally brings it to rest at an elevation of sixteen feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would return to the hodman with an accelerated motion , and reach his hand with the precise velocity it possessed on quitting it . An important relation between velocity and work is here to be pointed out . Supposing the hodman competent to impart to the brick , at starting , a velocity of sixty-four feet a second , or twice its former velocity , would the amount of work performed be twice what it was in the first instance ? No ; it would be four times that quantity ; for a body starting with twice the velocity of another , will rise to four times the height . In like manner , a three-fold velocity will give a nine-fold elevation , a four-fold velocity will give a sixteen-fold elevation , and so on . The height attained , then , is not proportional to the initial velocity , but to the square of the velocity . As before , the work is also proportional to the weight elevated . Hence the work which any moving mass whatever is competent to perform , in virtue of the motion which it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weight and the square of its velocity . Here , then , we have a second measure of work- , in which we simply translate the idea of height into its equivalent idea of motion . In mechanics , the product of the mass of a moving body into the square of its velocity , expresses what is called the vis viva , or living force . It is also sometimes called the ' mechanical effect . ' If , for example , a cannon pointed to the zenith urge a ball upwards with twice the velocity imparted to a second ball , the former will rise to four times the height attained by the latter . If directed against a target , it will also do four times the execution . Hence the importance of imparting a high velocity to projectiles in war . Having thus cleared our way to a perfectly definite conception of the vis viva of moving masses , we are prepared for the announcement that the heat generated by the shock of a falling body against the earth is proportional to the vis viva annihilated . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the case , therefore , of two cannon-balls of equal weight , if one strike a target with twice the velocity of the other , it will generate four times the heat , if with three times the velocity , it will generate nine times the heat , and so on . Mr. Joule has shown that a pound weight falling from a height of 772 feet , or 772 pounds falling through one foot , will generate by its collision with the earth an amount of heat sufficient to raise a pound of water one degree Fahrenheit in temperature . 772 " foot-pounds " constitute the mechanical equivalent of heat . Now , a body falling from a height of 772 feet , has , upon striking the earth , a velocity of 223 feet a second ; and if this velocity were imparted to the body , by any other means , the quantity of heat generated by the stoppage of its motion would be that stated above . Six times that velocity , or 1,338 feet , would not be an inordinate one for a cannon-ball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving with a velocity of 1,338 feet a second , would , by collision , generate an amount of heat competent to raise its own weight of water 36 degrees Fahrenheit in temperature . If composed of iron , and if all the heat generated were concentrated in the ball itself , its temperature would be raised about 360 degrees Fahrenheit ; because one degree in the case of water is equivalent to about ten degrees in the case of iron . In artillery practice , the heat generated is usually concentrated upon the front of the bolt , and on the portion of the target first struck . By this concentration the heat developed becomes sufficiently intense to raise the dust of the metal to incandescence , a flash of light often accompanying collision with the target . Let us now fix our attention for a moment on the gunpowder which urges the cannon-ball . This is composed of combustible matter , which if burnt in the open air would yield a certain amount of heat . It will not yield this amount if it perform the work of urging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will fall short of that produced in the open air , by an amount equivalent to the vis viva of the ball ; and this exact amount is restored by the ball on its collision with the target . In this perfect way are heat and mechanical motion connected . Broadly enunciated , the principle of the conservation of force asserts , that the quantity of force in the universe is as unalterable as the quantity of matter ; that it is alike impossible to create force and to annihilate it . But in what sense are we to understand this assertion ? It would be manifestly inapplicable to the force of gravity as defined by Newton ; for this is a force varying inversely as the square of the distance ; and to affirm the constancy of a varying force would be self-contradictory . Yet , when the question is properly understood , gravity forms no exception to the law of conservation . Following the method pursued by Helmholtz , I will here attempt an elementary exposition of this law . Though destined in its applications to produce momentous changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For the sake of simplicity we will consider a particle of matter , which we may call F , to be perfectly fixed , and a second movable particle , D , placed at a distance from F. We will assume that these two particles attract each other according to the Newtonian law . At a certain distance , the attraction is of a certain definite amount , which might be determined by means of a spring balance . At half this distance the attraction would be augmented four times ; at a third of the distance , nine times ; at one-fourth of the distance , sixteen times , and so on . In every case , the attraction might be measured by determining , with the spring balance , the amount of tension just sufficient to prevent D from moving towards F. Thus far we have nothing whatever to do with motion ; we deal with statics , not with dynamics . We simply take into account the distance of D from F , and the pull exerted by gravity at that distance . It is customary in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line of a certain length , a force of double magnitude being represented by a line of double length , and so on . Placing then the particle D at a distance from F , we can , in imagination , draw a straight line from D to F , and at D erect a perpendicular to this line , which shall represent the amount of the attraction exerted on D. If D be at a very great distance from F , the attraction will be very small , and the perpendicular consequently very short . If the distance be practically infinite , the attraction is practically nil . Let us now suppose at every point in the line joining F and D a perpendicular to be erected , proportional in length to the attraction exerted at that point ; we thus obtain an infinite number of perpendiculars , of gradually increasing length , as D approaches F. Uniting the ends of all these perpendiculars , we obtain a curve , and between this curve and the straight line joining F and D we have an area containing all the perpendiculars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ series of perpendiculars representing an attraction , or tension , as it is sometimes called , the area just referred to represents the sum of the tensions exerted upon the particle D , during its passage from its first position to F. Up to the present point we have been dealing with tensions , not with motion . Thus far vis viva has been entirely foreign to our contemplation of D and F. Let us now suppose D placed at a practically infinite distance from F ; here , as stated , the pull of gravity would be infinitely small , and the perpendicular representing it would dwindle almost to a point . In this position the sum of the tensions capable of being exerted on D would be a maximum . Let D now begin to move in obedience to the infinitesimal attraction exerted upon it . Motion being once set up , the idea of vis viva arises . In moving towards F the particle D consumes , as it were , the tensions . Let us fix our attention on D , at any point of the path @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ F there is a quantity of unused tensions ; beyond that point the tensions have been all consumed , but we have in their place an equivalent quantity of vis viva . After D has passed any point , the tension previously in store at that point disappears , but not without having added , during the infinitely small duration of its action , a due amount of motion to that previously possessed by D. The nearer D approaches to F , the smaller is the sum of the tensions remaining , but the greater is the vis viva ; the farther D is from F , the greater is the sum of the unconsumed tensions , and the less is the living force . Now the principle of conservation affirms not the constancy of the value of the tensions of gravity , nor yet the constancy of the vis viva , taken separately , but the absolute constancy of the value of both taken together . At the beginning the vis viva was zero , and the tension area was a maximum ; close to F the vis viva is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At every other point , the work-producing power of the particle D consists in part of vis viva , and in part of tensions . If gravity , instead of being attraction , were repulsion , then , with the particles in contact , the sum of the tensions between D and F would be a maximum , and the vis viva zero . If , in obedience to the repulsion , D moved away from F , vis viva would be generated ; and the farther D retreated from F the greater would be its vis viva , and the less the amount of tension still available for producing motion . Taking repulsion as well as attraction into account , the principle of the conservation of force affirms that the mechanical value of the tensions and vires vivae of the material universe , so far as we know it , is a constant quantity . The universe , in short , possesses two kinds of property which are mutually convertible . The diminution of either carries with it the enhancement of the other , the total value of the property @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equally to chemical affinity . Ina mixture of oxygen and hydrogen the atoms exist apart , but by the application of proper means they may be caused to rush together across that space that separates them . While this space exists , and as long as the atoms have not begun to move towards each other , we have tensions and nothing else . During their motion towards each other the tensions , as in the case of gravity , are converted into vis viva . After they clash we have still vis viva , but in another form . It was translation , it is vibration . It was molecular transfer , it is heat . It is possible to reverse these processes , to unlock the combined atoms and replace them in their first positions . But , to accomplish this , as much heat would be required as was generated by their union . Such reversals occur daily and hourly in nature . By the solar waves , the oxygen of water is divorced from its hydrogen in the leaves of plants . As molecular vis viva the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atoms of oxygen and hydrogen with tension . The atoms are thus enabled to recombine , and when they do so they restore the precise amount of heat consumed in their separation . The same remarks apply to the compound of carbon and oxygen , called carbonic acid , which is exhaled from our lungs , produced by our fires , and found sparingly diffused everywhere throughout the air . In the leaves of plants the sunbeams also wrench the atoms of carbonic acid asunder , and sacrifice themselves in the act ; but when the plants are burnt , the amount of heat consumed in their production is restored . This , then , is the rhythmic play of Nature as regards her forces . Throughout all her regions she oscillates from tension to vis viva , from vis viva to tension . We have the same play in the planetary system . The earth 's orbit is an ellipse , one of the foci of which is occupied by the sun . Imagine the earth at the most distant part of the orbit . Her motion , and consequently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planet rounds the curve , and begins its approach to the sun . In front it has a store of tensions , which are gradually consumed , an equivalent amount of vis viva being generated . When nearest to the sun the motion , and consequently the vis viva , reach a maximum . But here the available tensions have been used up . The earth rounds this portion of the curve and retreats from the sun . Tensions are now stored up , but vis viva is lost , to be again restored at the expense of the complementary force on the opposite side of the curve . Thus beats the heart of the universe , but without increase or diminution of its total stock of force . I have thus far tried to steer clear amid confusion , by fixing the mind of the reader upon things rather than upon names . But good names are essential ; and here , as yet , we are not provided with such . We have had the force of gravity and living force  --  two utterly distinct things . We have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the force of heat , the force of light , the force of magnetism , or the force of electricity  --  all of which terms have been employed more or less loosely by writers on physics . This confusion is happily avoided by the introduction of the term ' energy , ' which embraces both tension and vis viva . Energy is possessed by bodies already in motion ; it is then actual , and we agree to call it actual or dynamic energy . It is our old vis viva . On the other hand , energy is possible to bodies not in motion , but which , in virtue of attraction or repulsion , possess a power of motion which would realise itself if all hindrances were removed . Looking , for example , at gravity ; a body on the earth 's surface in a position from which it can not fall to a lower one possesses no energy . It has neither motion nor power of motion . But the same body suspended at a height above the earth has a power of motion , though it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a body , and we agree to call this potential energy . It consists of our old tensions . We , moreover , speak of the conservation of energy , instead of the conservation of force ; and say that the sum of the potential and dynamic energies of the material universe is a constant quantity . A body cast upwards consumes the actual energy of projection , and lays up potential energy . When it reaches its utmost height all its actual energy is consumed , its potential energy being then a maximum . When it returns , there is a reconversion of the potential into the actual . A pendulum at the limit of its swing possesses potential energy ; at the lowest point of its arc its energy is all actual . A patch of snow resting on a mountain slope has potential energy ; loosened , and shooting down as an avalanche , it possesses dynamic energy . The pine-trees growing on the Alps have potential energy ; but rushing down the Holzrinne of the woodcutters they possess actual energy . The same is true of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compose them can fall to a lower level , they possess potential energy , which is converted into actual when the frost ruptures their cohesion and hands them over to the action of gravity . The stone avalanches of the Matterhorn and Weisshorn are illustrations in point . The hammer of the great bell of Westminster , when raised before striking , possesses potential energy ; when it falls , the energy becomes dynamic ; and after the stroke , we have the rhythmic play of potential and dynamic in the vibrations of the bell . The same holds good for the molecular oscillations of a heated body . An atom is driven against its neighbour , and recoils . The ultimate amplitude of the recoil being attained , the motion of the atom in that direction is checked , and for an instant its energy is all potential . It is then drawn towards its neighbour with accelerated speed ; thus , by attraction , converting its potential into dynamic energy . Its motion in this direction is also finally checked , and again , for an instant , its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ converting , by repulsion , its potential into dynamic energy , till the latter attains a maximum , after which it is again changed into potential energy . Thus , what is true of the earth , as she swings to and fro in her yearly journey round the sun , is also true of her minutest atom . We have wheels within wheels , and rhythm within rhythm . When a body is heated , a change of molecular arrangement always occurs , and to produce this change heat is consumed . Hence , a portion only of the heat communicated to the body remains as dynamic energy . Looking back on some of the statements made at the beginning of this article , now that our knowledge is more extensive , we see the necessity of qualifying them . When , for example , two bodies clash , heat is generated ; but the heat , or molecular dynamic energy , developed at the moment of collision , is not the exact equivalent of the sensible dynamic energy destroyed . The true equivalent is this heat , plus the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater distances between them . This molecular potential energy is afterwards , on the cooling of the body , converted into heat . Wherever two atoms capable of uniting together by their mutual attractions exist separately , they form a store of potential energy . Thus our woods , forests , and coal-fields on the one hand , and our atmospheric oxygen on the other , constitute a vast store of energy of this kind  --  vast , but far from infinite . We have , besides our coal-fields , metallic bodies more or less sparsely distributed through the earth 's crust . These bodies can be oxydised ; and hence they are , so far as they go , stores of energy . But the attractions of the great mass of the earth 's crust are already satisfied , and from them no further energy can possibly be obtained . Ages ago the elementary constituents of our rocks clashed together and produced the motion of heat , which was taken up by the aether and carried away through stellar space . It is lost for ever as far as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carbon , oxygen , and calcium produced the chalk and limestone bills which are now cold ; and from this carbon , oxygen , and calcium no further energy can be derived . So it is with almost all the other constituents of the earth 's crust . They took their present form in obedience to molecular force ; they turned their potential energy into dynamic , and yielded it as radiant heat to the universe , ages before man appeared upon this planet . For him a residue of potential energy remains , vast , truly , in relation to the life and wants of an individual , but exceedingly minute in comparison with the earth 's primitive store . To sum up . The whole stock of energy or working-power in the world consists of attractions , repulsions , and motions . If the attractions and repulsions be so circumstanced as to be able to produce motion , they are sources of working-power , but not otherwise . As stated a moment ago , the attraction exerted between the earth and a body at a distance from the earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the body can be moved by the attraction , and in falling can perform work . When it rests at its lowest level it is not a source of power or energy , because it can fall no farther . But though it has ceased to be a source of energy , the attraction of gravity still acts as a force , which holds the earth and weight together . The same remarks apply to attracting atoms and molecules . As long as distance separates them , they can move across it in obedience to the attraction ; and the motion thus produced may , by proper appliances , be caused to perform mechanical work . When , for example , two atoms of hydrogen unite with one of oxygen , to form water , the atoms are first drawn towards each other  --  they move , they clash , and then by virtue of their resiliency , they recoil and quiver . To this quivering motion we give the name of heat . This atomic vibration is merely the redistribution of the motion produced by the chemical affinity ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be said to be converted into heat . We must not imagine the chemical attraction destroyed , or converted into anything else . For the atoms , when mutually clasped to form a molecule of water , are held together by the very attraction which first drew them towards each other . That which has really been expended is the pull exerted through the space by which the distance between the atoms has been diminished . If this be understood , it will be at once seen that gravity , as before insisted on , may , in this sense , be said to be convertible into heat ; that it is in reality no more an outstanding and inconvertible agent , as it is sometimes stated to be , than is chemical affinity . By the exertion of a certain pull through a certain space , a body is caused to clash with a certain definite velocity against the earth . Heat is thereby developed , and this is the only sense in which gravity can be said to be converted into heat . In no case is the force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else . The mutual attraction of the earth and weight exists when they are in contact , as when they were separate but the ability of that attraction to employ itself in the production of motion does not exist . The transformation , in this case , is easily followed by the mind 's eye . First , the weight as a whole is set in motion by the attraction of gravity . This motion of the mass is arrested by collision with the earth , being broken up into molecular tremors , to which we give the name of heat . And when we reverse the process , and employ those tremors of heat to raise a weight  --  which is done through the intermediation of an elastic fluid in the steam-engine  --  a certain definite portion of the molecular motion is consumed . In this sense , and in this sense only , can the heat be said to be converted into gravity ; or , more correctly , into potential energy of gravity . Here the destruction of the heat has created no new attraction ; but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a certain definite pull , between the starting-point of the falling weight and the earth . When , therefore , writers on the conservation of energy speak of tensions being ' consumed ' and ' generated , ' they do not mean thereby that old attractions have been annihilated , and new ones brought into existence , but that , in the one case , the power of the attraction to produce motion has been diminished by the shortening of the distance between the attracting bodies , while , in the other case , the power of producing motion has been augmented by the increase of the distance . These remarks apply to all bodies , whether they be sensible masses or molecules . Of the inner quality that enables matter to attract matter we know nothing ; and the law of conservation makes no statement regarding that quality . It takes the facts of attraction as they stand , and affirms only the constancy of working-power . That power may exist in the form of MOTION ; or it may exist in the form of FORCE , with distance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latter is potential energy , the constancy of the sum of both being affirmed by the law of conservation . The convertibility of natural forces consists solely in transformations of dynamic into potential , and of potential into dynamic energy . In no other sense has the convertibility of force any scientific meaning . Grave errors have been entertained as to what is really intended to be conserved by the doctrine of conservation . This exposition I hope will tend to remove them . ******************** II . RADIATION . Footnote : The Rede Lecture delivered in the Senate House before the University of Cambridge , May 16 , 1865. ***** 1 . Visible and Invisible Radiation . BETWEEN the mind of man and the outer world are interposed the nerves of the human body , which translate , or enable the mind to translate , the impressions of that world into facts of consciousness and thought . Different nerves are suited to the perception of different impressions . We do not see with the ear , nor hear with the eye , nor are we rendered sensible of sound by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of physical actions , each nerve , or group of nerves , selects and responds to those for the perception of which it is specially organised . The optic nerve passes from the brain to the back of the eyeball and there spreads out , to form the retina , a web of nerve filaments , on which the images of external objects are projected by the optical portion of the eye . This nerve is limited to the apprehension of the phenomena of radiation , and , notwithstanding its marvellous sensibility to certain impressions of this class , it is singularly obtuse to other impressions . Nor does the optic nerve embrace the entire range even of radiation . Some rays , when they reach it , are incompetent to evoke its power , while others never reach it at all , being absorbed by the humours of the eye . To all rays which , whether they reach the retina or not , fail to excite vision , we give the name of invisible or obscure rays . All non-luminous bodies emit such rays . There is no body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold emits rays of heat . But to render radiant heat fit to affect the optic nerve a certain temperature is necessary . A cool poker thrust into a fire remains dark for a time , but when its temperature has become equal to that of the surrounding coals , it glows like them . In like manner , if a current of electricity , of gradually increasing strength , be sent through a wire of the refractory metal platinum , the wire first becomes sensibly warm to the touch ; for a time its heat augments , still however remaining obscure ; at length we can no longer touch the metal with impunity ; and at a certain definite temperature it emits a feeble red light . As the current augments in power the light augments in brilliancy , until finally the wire appears of a dazzling white . The light which it now emits is similar to that of the sun . By means of a prism Sir Isaac Newton unravelled the texture of solar light , and by the same simple instrument we can investigate the luminous changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all its rays ( and they are infinite in variety ) are bent or refracted from their straight course ; and , as different rays are differently refracted by the prism , we are by it enabled to separate one class of rays from another . By such prismatic analysis Dr. Draper has shown , that when the platinum wire first begins to glow , the light emitted is sensibly red . As the glow augments the red becomes more brilliant , but at the same time orange rays are added to the emission . Augmenting the temperature still further , yellow rays appear beside the orange ; after the yellow , green rays are emitted ; and after the green come , in succession , blue , indigo , and violet rays . To display all these colours at the same time the platinum wire must be white-hot : the impression of whiteness being in fact produced by the simultaneous action of all these colours on the optic nerve . In the experiment just described we began with a platinum wire at an ordinary temperature , and gradually raised it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even before the electric current had acted at all upon the wire , it emitted invisible rays . For some time after the action of the current had commenced , and even for a time after the wire had become intolerable to the touch , its radiation was still invisible . The question now arises , What becomes of these invisible rays when the visible ones make their appearance ? It will be proved in the sequel that they maintain themselves in the radiation ; that a ray once emitted continues to be emitted when the temperature is increased , and hence the emission from our platinum wire , even when it has attained its maximum brilliancy , consists of a mixture of visible and invisible rays . If , instead of the platinum wire , the earth itself were raised to incandescence , the obscure radiation which it now emits would continue to be emitted . To reach incandescence the planet would have to pass through all the stages of non-luminous radiation , and the final emission would embrace the rays of all these stages . There can hardly be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar in kind to those which the dark earth pours nightly into space . In fact , the various kind of obscure rays emitted by all the planets of our system are included in the present radiation of the sun . The great pioneer in this domain of science was Sir William Herschel . Causing a beam of solar light to pass through a prism , he resolved it into its coloured constituents ; he formed what is technically called the solar spectrum . Exposing thermometers to the successive colours he determined their heating power , and found it to augment from the violet or most refracted end , to the red or least refracted end of the spectrum . But he did not stop here . Pushing his thermometers into the dark space beyond the red he found that , though the light had disappeared , the radiant heat falling on the instruments was more intense than that at any visible part of the spectrum . In fact , Sir William Herschel showed , and his results have been verified by various philosophers since his time , that , besides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of other rays , more powerfully calorific than the luminous ones , but entirely unsuited to the purposes of vision . At the less refrangible end of the solar spectrum , then , the range of the sun 's radiation is not limited by that of the eye . The same statement applies to the more refrangible end . Ritter discovered the extension of the spectrum into the invisible region beyond the violet ; and , in recent times , this ultra-violet emission has had peculiar interest conferred upon it by the admirable researches of Professor Stokes . The complete spectrum of the sun consists , therefore , of three distinct parts : first , of ultra-red rays of high heating power , but unsuited to the purposes of vision ; secondly , of luminous rays which display the succession of colours , red , orange , yellow , green , blue , indigo , violet ; thirdly , of ultra-violet rays which , like the ultra-red ones , are incompetent to excite vision , but which , unlike the ultra-red rays , possess a very feeble heating power . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rays are of the utmost importance to the organic world . ******************** 2 . Origin and Character of Radiation . The Aether . When we see a platinum wire raised gradually to a white heat , and emitting in succession all the colours of the spectrum , we are simply conscious of a series of changes in the condition of our own eyes . We do not see the actions in which these successive colours originate , but the mind irresistibly infers that the appearance of the colours corresponds to certain contemporaneous changes in the wire . What is the nature of these changes ? In virtue of what condition does the wire radiate at all ? We must now look from the wire , as a whole , to its constituent atoms . Could we see those atoms , even before the electric current has begun to act upon them , we should find them in a state of vibration . In this vibration , indeed , consists such warmth as the wire then possesses . Locke enunciated this idea with great precision , and it has been placed beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Joule . ' Heat , ' says Locke , ' is a very brisk agitation of the insensible parts of the object , which produce in us that sensation from which we denominate the object hot : so what in our sensations is heat in the object is nothing but motion . ' When the electric current , still feeble , begins to pass through the wire , its first act is to intensify the vibrations already existing , by causing the atoms to swing through wider ranges . Technically speaking , the amplitudes of the oscillations are increased . The current does this , however , without altering the periods of the old vibrations , or the times in which they were executed . But besides intensifying the old vibrations the current generates new and more rapid ones , and when a certain definite rapidity has been attained , the wire begins to glow . The colour first exhibited is red , which corresponds to the lowest rate of vibration of which the eye is able to take cognisance . By augmenting the strength of the electric current more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A quicker rate of vibration produces yellow , a still quicker green ; and by further augmenting the rapidity , we pass through blue , indigo , and violet , to the extreme ultra-violet rays . Such are the changes recognised by the mind in the wire itself , as concurrent with the visual changes taking place in the eye . But what connects the wire with this organ By what means does it send such intelligence of its varying condition to the optic nerve ? Heat being as defined by Locke , ' a very brisk agitation of the insensible parts of an object , ' it is readily conceivable that on touching a heated body the agitation may communicate itself to the adjacent nerves , and announce itself to them as light or heat . But the optic nerve does not touch the hot platinum , and hence the pertinence of the question , By what agency are the vibrations of the wire transmitted to the eye ? The answer to this question involves one of the most important physical conceptions that the mind of man has yet achieved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mechanically for the transmission of the vibrations of light and heat , as air is fitted for the transmission of sound . This medium is called the luminiferous aether . Every vibration of every atom of our platinum wire raises in this aether a wave , which speeds through it at the rate of 186,000 miles a second . The aether suffers no rupture of continuity at the surface of the eye , the inter-molecular spaces of the various humours are filled with it ; hence the waves generated by the glowing platinum can cross these humours and impinge on the optic nerve at the back of the eye . Footnote : The action here described is analogous to the passage of sound-waves through thick felt whose interstices are occupied by air . Thus the sensation of light reduces itself to the acceptance of motion . Up to this point we deal with pure mechanics ; but the subsequent translation of the shock of the aethereal waves into consciousness eludes mechanical science . As an oar dipping into the Cam generates systems of waves , which , speeding from the centre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's bank , so do the vibrating atoms generate in the surrounding aether undulations , which finally stir the filaments of the retina . The motion thus imparted is transmitted with measurable , and not very great velocity to the brain , where , by a process which the science of mechanics does not even tend to unravel , the tremor of the nervous matter is converted into the conscious impression of light . Darkness might then be defined as aether at rest ; light as aether in motion . But in reality the aether is never at rest , for in the absence of light-waves we have heat-waves always speeding through it . In the spaces of the universe both classes of undulations incessantly commingle . Here the waves issuing from uncounted centres cross , coincide , oppose , and pass through each other , without confusion or ultimate extinction . Every star is seen across the entanglement of wave-motions produced by all other stars . It is the ceaseless thrill caused by those distant orbs collectively in the aether , that constitutes what we call the ' temperature of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself to the requirements of an orchestra , transmitting each vibration of every pipe and string , so does the inter-stellar aether accommodate itself to the requirements of light and heat . Its waves mingle in space without disorder , each being endowed with an individuality as indestructible as if it alone had disturbed the universal repose . All vagueness with regard to the use of the terms ' radiation ' and ' absorption ' will now disappear . Radiation is the communication of vibratory motion to the aether ; and when a body is said to be chilled by radiation , as for example the grass of a meadow on a starlight night , the meaning is , that the molecules of the grass have lost a portion of their motion , by imparting it to the medium in which they vibrate . On the other hand , the waves of aether may so strike against the molecules of a body exposed to their action as to yield up their motion to the latter ; and in this transfer of the motion from the aether to the molecules consists the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are in this way reducible to interchanges of motion ; and it is purely as the recipients or the donors of this motion , that we ourselves become conscious of the action of heat and cold . ******************** 3 . The Atomic Theory in reference to the Aether . The word ' atoms ' has been more than once employed in this discourse . Chemists have taught us that all matter is reducible to certain elementary forms to which they give this name . These atoms are endowed with powers of mutual attraction , and under suitable circumstances they coalesce to form compounds . Thus oxygen and hydrogen are elements when separate , or merely mixed , but they may be made to combine so as to form molecules , each consisting of two atoms of hydrogen and one of oxygen . In this condition they constitute water . So also chlorine and sodium are elements , the former a pungent gas , the latter a soft metal ; and they unite together to form chloride of sodium or common salt . In the same way the element nitrogen combines with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former to three of the latter , to form ammonia . Picturing in imagination the atoms of elementary bodies as little spheres , the molecules of compound bodies must be pictured as groups of such spheres . This is the atomic theory as Dalton conceived it . Now if this theory have any foundation in fact , and if the theory of an aether pervading space , and constituting the vehicle of atomic motion , be founded in fact , it is surely of interest to examine whether the vibrations of elementary bodies are modified by the act of combination  --  whether as regards radiation and absorption , or , in other words , whether as regards the communication of motion to the aether , and the acceptance of motion from it , the deportment of the uncombined atoms will be different from that of the combined . ******************** 4 . Absorption of Radiant Heat by Gases . We have now to submit these considerations to the only test by which they can be tried , namely , that of experiment . An experiment is well defined as a question put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asking amiss , we ought to purify the question from all adjuncts which do not necessarily belong to it . Matter has been shown to be composed of elementary constituents , by the compounding of which all its varieties are produced . But , besides the chemical unions which they form , both elementary and compound bodies can unite in another and less intimate way . Gases and vapours aggregate to liquids and solids , without any change of their chemical nature . We do not yet know how the transmission of radiant heat may be affected by the entanglement due to cohesion ; and , as our object now is to examine the influence of chemical union alone , we shall render our experiments more pure by liberating the atoms and molecules entirely from the bonds of cohesion , and employing them in the gaseous or vaporous form . Let us endeavour to obtain a perfectly clear mental image of the problem now before us . Limiting in the first place our enquiries to the phenomena of absorption , we have to picture a succession of waves issuing from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them striking against the gaseous molecules and yielding up their motion to the latter ; others gliding round the molecules , or passing through the intermolecular spaces without apparent hindrance . The problem before us is to determine whether such free molecules have any power whatever to stop the waves of heat ; and if so , whether different molecules possess this power in different degrees . In examining the problem let us fall back upon an actual piece of work , choosing as the source of our heat-waves a plate of copper , against the back of which a steady sheet of flame is permitted to play . On emerging from the copper , the waves , in the first instance , pass through a space devoid of air , and then enter a hollow glass cylinder , three feet long and three inches wide . The two ends of this cylinder are stopped by two plates of rock-salt , a solid substance which offers a scarcely sensible obstacle to the passage of the calorific waves . After passing through the tube , the radiant heat falls upon the anterior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Appendix to the first chapter of ' Heat as a Mode of ' Motion , ' the construction of the thermo-electric pile is fully explained. which instantly converts the heat into an electric current . This current conducted round a magnetic needle deflects it , and the magnitude of the deflection is a measure of the heat falling upon the pile . This famous instrument , and not an ordinary thermometer , is what we shall use in these enquiries , but we shall use it in a somewhat novel way . As long as the two opposite faces of the thermo-electric pile are kept at the same temperature , no matter how high that may be , there is no current generated . The current is a consequence of a difference of temperature between the two opposite faces of the pile . Hence , if after the anterior face has received the heat from our radiating source , a second source , which we may call the compensating source , be permitted to radiate against the posterior face , this latter radiation will tend to neutralise the former . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pile is no longer deflected , but points to the zero of the graduated circle over which it hangs . And now let us suppose the glass tube , through which the waves from the heated plate of copper are passing , to be exhausted by an air-pump , the two sources of heat acting at the same time on the two opposite faces of the pile . When by means of an adjusting screen , perfectly equal quantities of heat are imparted to the two faces , the needle points to zero . Let any gas be now permitted to enter the exhausted tube ; if its molecules possess any power of intercepting the calorific waves , the equilibrium previously existing will be destroyed , the compensating source will triumph , and a deflection of the magnetic needle will be the immediate consequence . From the deflections thus produced by different gases , we can readily deduce the relative amounts of wave-motion which their molecules intercept . In this way the substances mentioned in the following table were examined , a small portion only of each being admitted into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was just sufficient to depress a column of mercury associated with the tube one inch : in other words , the gases were examined at a pressure of one-thirtieth of an atmosphere . The numbers in the table express the relative amounts of wave-motion absorbed by the respective gases , the quantity intercepted by air being taken as unity . Radiation through Gases . Name of gas Relative absorption Air 1 Oxygen 1 Nitrogen 1 Hydrogen 1 Carbonic oxide 750 Carbonic acid 972 Hydrochloric acid . 1,005 Nitric oxide 1,590 Nitrous oxide 1,860 Sulphide of hydrogen 2,100 Ammonia 5,460 Olefiant gas 6,030 Sulphurous acid 6,480 Every gas in this table is perfectly transparent to light , that is to say , all waves within the limits of the visible spectrum pass through it without obstruction ; but for the waves of slower period , emanating from our heated plate of copper , enormous differences of absorptive power are manifested . These differences illustrate in the most unexpected manner the influence of chemical combination . Thus the elementary gases , oxygen , hydrogen , and nitrogen , and the mixture atmospheric air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heat ; for every ray , or , more strictly speaking , for every unit of wave-motion , which any one of them intercepts , perfectly transparent ammonia intercepts 5,460 units , olefiant gas 6,030 units , while sulphurous acid gas absorbs 6,480 units . What , becomes of the wave-motion thus intercepted ? It is applied to the heating of the absorbing gas . Through air , oxygen , hydrogen , and nitrogen , the waves of aether pass without absorption , and these gases are not sensibly changed in temperature by the most powerful calorific rays . The position of nitrous oxide in the foregoing table is worthy of particular notice . In this gas we have the same atoms in a state of chemical union , that exist uncombined in the atmosphere ; but the absorption of the compound is 1,800 times that of air . ******************** 5 . Formation of Invisible Foci . This extraordinary deportment of the elementary gases naturally directed attention to elementary bodies ' in other states of aggregation . Some of Melloni 's results now attained a new significance . This celebrated experimenter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radiant heat ; he had also proved that lamp-black , and black glass , ( which owes its blackness to the element carbon ) were to a considerable extent transparent to calorific rays of low refrangibility . These facts , harmonising so strikingly with the deportment of the simple gases , suggested further enquiry . Sulphur dissolved in bisulphide of carbon was found almost perfectly diathermic . The dense and deeply-coloured element bromine was examined , and found competent to cut off the light of our most brilliant flames , while it transmitted the invisible calorific rays with extreme freedom . Iodine , the companion element of bromine , was next thought of , but it was found impracticable to examine the substance in its usual solid condition . It however dissolves freely in bisulphide of carbon . There is no chemical union between the liquid and the iodine ; it is simply a case of solution , in which the uncombined atoms of the element can act upon the radiant heat . When permitted to do so , it was found that a layer of dissolved iodine , sufficiently opaque @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was almost absolutely transparent to the invisible calorific rays . Footnote : Professor Dewar has recently succeeded in producing a medium highly opaque to light , and highly transparent to obscure heat , by fusing together sulphur and iodine . By prismatic analysis Sir William Herschel separate the luminous from the non-luminous rays of the sun , and he also sought to render the obscure rays visible by concentration . Intercepting the luminous portion of his spectrum he brought , by a converging lens , the ultra-red rays to a focus , but by this condensation he obtained no light . The solution of iodine offers a means of filtering the solar beam , or failing it , the beam of the electric lamp , which renders attainable far more powerful foci of invisible rays than could possibly be obtained by the method of Sir William Herschel . For to form his spectrum he was obliged to operate upon solar light which had passed through a narrow slit or through a small aperture , the amount of the obscure heat being limited by this circumstance . But with our opaque solution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and having thus converged the rays , luminous and non-luminous , we can intercept the former by the iodine , and do what we please with the latter . Experiments of this character , not only with the iodine solution , but also with black glass and layers of lampblack , were publicly performed at the Royal Institution in the early part of 1862 , and the effects at the foci of invisible rays , then obtained , were such as had never been witnessed previously . In the experiments here referred to , glass lenses were employed to concentrate the rays . But glass , though highly transparent to the luminous , is in a high degree opaque to the invisible , heat-rays of the electric lamp , and hence a large portion of those rays was intercepted by the glass . The obvious remedy here is to employ rock-salt lenses instead of glass ones , or to abandon the use of lenses wholly , and to concentrate the rays by a metallic mirror . Both of these improvements have been introduced , and , as anticipated , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mode of operating remains however the same , in principle , as that made known in 1862 . It was then found that an instant 's exposure of the face of the thermoelectric pile to the focus of invisible rays , dashed the needles of a coarse galvanometer violently aside . It is now found that on substituting for the face of the thermo-electric pile a combustible body , the invisible rays are competent to set that body on fire . ******************** 6 . Visible and Invisible Rays of the Electric Light . We have next to examine what proportion the non-luminous rays of the electric light bear to the luminous ones . This the opaque solution of iodine enables us to do with an extremely close approximation to the truth . The pure bisulphide of carbon , which is the solvent of the iodine , is perfectly transparent to the luminous , and almost perfectly transparent to the dark , rays of the electric lamp . Supposing the total radiation of the lamp to pass through the transparent bisulphide , while through the solution of iodine only the dark rays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thermoelectric pile , the total radiation , and deduct from it the purely obscure , we obtain the value of the purely luminous emission . Experiments , performed in this way , prove that if all the visible rays of the electric light were converged to a focus of dazzling brilliancy , its heat would only be one-eighth of that produced at the unseen focus of the invisible rays . Exposing his thermometers to the successive colours of the solar spectrum , Sir William Herschel determined the heating power of each , and also that of the region beyond the extreme red . Then drawing a straight line to represent the length of the spectrum , he erected , at various points , perpendiculars to represent the calorific intensity existing at those points . Uniting the ends of all his perpendiculars , he obtained a curve which showed at a glance the manner in which the heat was distributed in the solar spectrum . Professor Mueller of Freiburg , with improved instruments , afterwards made similar experiments , and constructed a more accurate diagram of the same kind . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spectrum of the electric light ; and for this purpose we shall employ a particular form of the thermo-electric pile , devised by Melloni . Its face is a rectangle , which by means of movable side-pieces can be rendered as narrow as desired . We can , for example , have the face of the pile the tenth , the hundredth , or even the thousandth of an inch in breadth . By means of an endless screw , this linear thermo-electric pile may be moved through the entire spectrum , from the violet to the red , the amount of heat falling upon the pile at every point of its march , being declared by a magnetic needle associated with the pile . When this instrument is brought up to the violet end of the spectrum of the electric light , the heat is found to be insensible . As the pile is gradually moved from the violet end towards the red , heat soon manifests itself , augmenting as we approach the red . Of all the colours of the visible spectrum the red possesses the highest heating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond the red , the heat , instead of vanishing , rises suddenly and enormously in intensity , until at some distance beyond the red it attains a maximum . Moving the pile still forward , the thermal power falls , somewhat more rapidly than it rose . It then gradually shades away , but , for a distance beyond the red greater than the length of the whole visible spectrum , signs of heat may be detected . Drawing a datum line , and erecting along it perpendiculars , proportional in length to the thermal intensity at the respective points , we obtain the extraordinary curve , shown on the opposite page , which exhibits the distribution of heat in the spectrum of the electric light . In the region of dark rays , beyond the red , the curve shoots up to B , in a steep and massive peak  --  a kind of Matterhorn of heat , which dwarfs the portion of the diagram C D E , representing the luminous radiation . Indeed the idea forced upon the mind by this diagram is that the light rays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the area A B C D , thrown in as it were by nature for the purpose of vision . Figure 1 . Spectrum of Electric Light The diagram drawn by Professor Mueller to represent the distribution of heat in the solar spectrum is not by any means so striking as that just described , and the reason , doubtless , is that prior to reaching the earth the solar rays have to traverse our atmosphere . By the aqueous vapour there diffused , the summit of the peak representing the sun 's invisible radiation is cut off . A similar lowering of the mountain of invisible heat is observed when the rays from the electric light are permitted to pass through a film of water , which acts upon them as the atmospheric vapour acts upon the rays of the sun . ******************** 7 . Combustion by Invisible Rays . The sun 's invisible rays far transcend the visible ones in heating power , so that if the alleged performances of Archimedes during the siege of Syracuse had any foundation in fact , the dark solar rays would have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small scale we can readily produce , with the purely invisible rays of the electric light , all that Archimedes is said to have performed with the sun 's total radiation . Placing behind the electric light a small concave mirror , the rays are converged , the cone of reflected rays and their point of convergence being rendered clearly visible by the dust always floating in the air . Placing between the luminous focus and the source of rays our solution of iodine , the light of the cone is entirely cut away ; but the intolerable heat experienced when the band is placed , even for a moment , at the dark focus , shows that the calorific rays pass unimpeded through the opaque solution . Almost anything that ordinary fire can effect may be accomplished at the focus of invisible rays ; the air at the focus remaining at the same time perfectly cold , on account of its transparency to the heat-rays . An air thermometer , with a hollow rack-salt bulb , would be unaffected by the heat of the focus : there would be no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convection . The aether at the focus , and not the air , is the substance in which the heat is embodied . A block of wood , placed at the focus , absorbs the heat , and dense volumes of smoke rise swiftly upwards , showing the manner in which the air itself would rise , if the invisible rays were competent to heat it . At the perfectly dark focus dry paper is instantly inflamed : chips of wood are speedily burnt up : lead , tin , and zinc are fused : and disks of charred paper are raised to vivid incandescence . It might be supposed that the obscure rays would show no preference for black over white ; but they do show a preference , and to obtain rapid combustion , the body , if not already black , ought to be blackened . When metals are to be burned , it is necessary to blacken or otherwise tarnish them , so as to diminish their reflective power . Blackened zinc foil , when brought into the focus of invisible rays , is instantly caused to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Magnesium wire flattened , or tarnished magnesium ribbon , also bursts into flame . Pieces of charcoal suspended in a receiver full of oxygen are also set on fire when the invisible focus falls upon them ; the dark rays after having passed through the receiver , still possessing sufficient power to ignite the charcoal , and thus initiate the attack of the oxygen . If , instead of being plunged in oxygen , the charcoal be suspended in vacuo , it immediately glows at the place where the focus falls . ******************** 8 . Transmutation of Rays : Calorescence . Footnote : I borrow this term from Professor Challis , ' Philosophical Magazine , ' vol. xii . P. 521 Eminent experimenters were long occupied in demonstrating the substantial identity of light and radiant heat , and we have now the means of offering a new and striking proof of this identity . A concave mirror produces , beyond the object which it reflects , an inverted and magnified image of the object . Withdrawing , for example , our iodine solution , an intensely luminous inverted image of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ focus of the mirror employed in the foregoing experiments . When the solution is interposed , and the light is cut away , what becomes of this image ? It disappears from sight ; but an invisible thermograph remains , and it is only the peculiar constitution of our eyes that disqualifies us from seeing the picture formed by the calorific rays . Falling on white paper , the image chars itself out : falling on black paper , two holes are pierced in it , corresponding to the images of the two coke points : but falling on a thin plate of carbon in vacuo , or upon a thin sheet of platinised platinum , either in vacuo or in air , radiant heat is converted into light , and the image stamps itself in vivid incandescence upon both the carbon and the metal . Results similar to those obtained with the electric light have also been obtained with the invisible rays of the lime-light and of the sun . Before a Cambridge audience it is hardly necessary to refer to the excellent researches of Professor Stokes at the opposite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of complement to his discoveries . Professor Stokes named the phenomena which he has discovered and investigated Fluorescence ; for the new phenomena here described I have proposed the term Calorescence . He , by the interposition of a proper medium , so lowered the refrangibility of the ultraviolet rays of the spectrum as to render them visible . Here , by the interposition of the platinum foil , the refrangibility of the ultra-red rays is so exalted as to render them visible . Looking through a prism at the incandescent image of the carbon points , the light of the image is decomposed , and a complete spectrum is obtained . The invisible rays of the electric light , remoulded by the atoms of the platinum , shine thus visibly forth ; ultra-red rays being converted into red , orange , yellow , green , blue , indigo , violet , and ultraviolet ones . Could we , moreover , raise the original source of rays to a sufficiently high temperature , we might not only obtain from the dark rays of such a source a single incandescent image @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might obtain a second one , from the dark rays of the second a third , and so on  --  a series of complete images and spectra being thus extracted from the invisible emission of the primitive source . Footnote : On investigating the calorescence produced by rays transmitted through glasses of various colours , it was found that in the case of certain specimens of blue glass , the platinum foil glowed with a pink or purplish light . The effect was not subjective , and considerations of obvious interest are suggested by it . Different kinds of black glass differ notably as to their power of transmitting radiant heat . When thin , some descriptions tint the sun with a greenish hue : others make it appear a glowing red without any trace of green . The latter are far more diathermic than the former . In fact , carbon when perfectly dissolved and incorporated with a good white glass , is highly transparent to the calorific rays , and by employing it as an absorbent the phenomena of ' calorescence ' may be obtained , though in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass chosen for thermometers , and intended to absorb completely the solar heat , may entirely fail in this object , if the glass in which the carbon is incorporated be colourless . To render the bulb of a thermometer a perfect absorbent , the glass ought in the first instance to be green . Soon after the discovery of fluorescence the late Dr. William Allen Miller pointed to the lime-light as an illustration of exalted refrangibility . Direct experiments have since entirely confirmed the view expressed at page 210 of his work on ' Chemistry , ' published in 1855. ******************** 9 . Deadness of the Optic Nerve to the Calorific Rays . The layer of iodine used in the foregoing experiments intercepted the rays of the noonday sun . No trace of light from the electric lamp was visible in the darkest room , even when a white screen was placed at the focus of the mirror employed to concentrate the light . It was thought , however , that if the retina itself were brought into the focus the sensation of light might be experienced . The danger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were absorbed in a high degree by the humours of the eye the albumen of the humours might coagulate along the line of the rays . If , on the contrary , no such high absorption took place , the rays might reach the retina with a force sufficient to destroy it . To test the likelihood of these results , experiments were made on water and on a solution of alum , and they showed it to be very improbable that in the brief time requisite for an experiment any serious damage could be done . The eye was therefore caused to approach the dark focus , no defence , in the first instance , being provided ; but the heat , acting upon the parts surrounding the pupil , could not be borne . An aperture was therefore pierced in a plate of metal , and the eye , placed behind the aperture , was caused to approach the point of convergence of invisible rays . The focus was attained , first by the pupil and afterwards by the retina . Removing the eye , but permitting the plate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was placed in the position occupied by the retina a moment before . The platinum became red-hot . No sensible damage was done to the eye by this experiment ; no impression of light was produced ; the optic nerve was not even conscious of heat . But the humours of the eye are known to be highly impervious to the invisible calorific rays , and the question therefore arises , ' Did the radiation in the foregoing experiment reach the retina at all ? ' The answer is , that the rays were in part transmitted to the retina , and in part absorbed by the humours . Experiments on the eye of an ox showed that the proportion of obscure rays which reached the retina amounted to 18 per cent . of the total radiation ; while the luminous emission from the electric light amounts to no more than 10 per cent . of the same total . Were the purely luminous rays of the electric lamp converged by our mirror to a focus , there can be no doubt as to the fate of a retina placed there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be accomplished by an amount of wave-motion but little more than half of that which the retina , without exciting consciousness , bears at the focus of invisible rays . This subject will repay a moment 's further attention . At a common distance of a foot the visible radiation of the electric light employed in these experiments is 800 times the light of a candle . At the same distance , the portion of the radiation of the electric light which reaches the retina , but fails to excite vision , is about 1,500 times the luminous radiation of the candle . ' Footnote : It will be borne in mind that the heat which any ray , luminous or non-luminous , is competent to generate is the true measure of the energy of the ray . But a candle on a clear night can readily be seen at a distance of a mile , its light at this distance being less than 1/20,000,000 of its light at the distance of a foot . Hence , to make the candle-light a mile off equal in power to the non-luminous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its intensity would have to be multiplied by 1,500 x 20,000,000 , or by thirty thousand millions . Thus the thirty thousand millionth part of the invisible radiation from the electric light , received by the retina at the distance of a foot , would , if slightly changed in character , be amply sufficient to provoke vision . Nothing could more forcibly illustrate that special relationship supposed by Melloni and others to subsist between the optic nerve and the oscillating periods of luminous bodies . The optic nerve responds , as it were , to the waves with which it is in consonance , while it refuses to be excited by others of almost infinitely greater energy , whose periods of recurrence are not in unison with its own . ******************** 10 . Persistence of Rays . At an early part of this lecture it was affirmed , that when a platinum wire was , gradually raised to a state of high incandescence , new rays were constantly added , while the intensity of the old ones was increased . Thus , in Dr. Draper 's experiments , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green , and blue augmented the intensity of the red . What is true of the red is true of every other ray of the spectrum , visible and invisible . We can not indeed see the augmentation of intensity in the region beyond the red , but we can measure it and express it numerically . With this view the following experiment was performed : A spiral of platinum wire was surrounded by a small glass globe to protect it from currents of air ; through an orifice in the globe the rays could pass from the spiral and fall afterwards upon a thermo-electric pile . Placing in front of the orifice an opaque solution of iodine , the platinum was gradually raised from a low dark heat to the fullest incandescence , with the following results : Appearance of spiral Energy of obscure radiation Dark 1 Dark , but hotter 3 Dark , but still hotter 5 Dark , but still hotter 10 Feeble red 19 Dull red 25 Red 37 Full red . 62 Orange 89 Bright orange 144 Yellow 202 White 276 Intense white 440 Thus the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from its primitive dark condition to an intense white heat , exalts at the same time the energy of the obscure radiation , until at the end it is fully 440 times what it was at the beginning . What has been here proved true of the totality of the ultra-red rays is true for each of them singly . Placing our linear thermo-electric pile in any part of the ultra-red spectrum , it may be proved that a ray once emitted continues to be emitted with increased energy as the temperature is augmented . The platinum spiral , so often referred to , being raised to whiteness by an electric current , a brilliant spectrum was formed from its light . A linear thermo-electric pile was placed in the region of obscure rays beyond the red , and by diminishing the current the spiral was reduced to a low temperature . It was then caused to pass through various degrees of darkness and incandescence , with the following results : Appearance of spiral Energy of obscure rays Dark 1 Dark 6 Faint red 10 Dull red 13 Red 18 Full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as in the former case , the dark and bright radiations reached their maximum together ; as the one augmented , the other augmented , until at last the energy of the obscure rays of the particular refrangibility here chosen , became 122 times what it was at first . To reach a white heat the wire has to pass through all the stages of invisible radiation , but in its most brilliant condition it embraces , in an intensified form , the rays of all those stages . And thus it is with all other kinds of matter , as far as they have hitherto been examined . Coke , whether brought to a white heat by the electric current , or by the oxyhydrogen jet , pours out invisible rays with augmented energy , as its light is increased . The same is true of lime , bricks , and ' other substances . It is true of all metals which are capable of being heated to incandescence . It also holds good for phosphorus burning in oxygen . Every gush of dazzling light has associated with it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the light in energy . This condition of things applies to all bodies capable of being raised to a white heat , either in the solid or the molten condition . It would doubtless also apply to the luminous fogs formed by the condensation of incandescent vapours . In such cases when the curve representing the radiant energy of the body is constructed , the obscure radiation towers upwards like a mountain , the luminous radiation resembling a mere ' spur ' at its base . From the very brightness of the light of some of the fixed stars we may infer the intensity of that dark radiation , which is the precursor and inseparable associate of their luminous rays . We thus find the luminous radiation appearing when the radiant body has attained a certain temperature ; or , in other words , when the vibrating atoms of the body have attained a certain width of swing . In solid and molten bodies a certain amplitude can not be surpassed without the introduction of periods of vibration , which provoke the sense of vision . How are we to figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are not these more rapid vibrations the progeny of the slower ? Is it not really the mutual action of the atoms , when they swing through very wide spaces , and thus encroach upon each other , that causes them to tremble in quicker periods ? If so , whatever be the agency by which the large swinging space is obtained , we shall have light-giving vibrations associated with it . It matters not whether the large amplitudes be produced by the strokes of a hammer , or by the blows of the molecules of a non-luminous gas , like air at some height above a gas-flame ; or by the shock of the aether particles when transmitting radiant heat . The result in all cases will be incandescence . Thus , the invisible waves of our filtered electric beam may be regarded as generating synchronous vibrations among the atoms of the platinum on which they impinge ; but , once these vibrations have attained a certain amplitude , the mutual jostling of the atoms produces quicker tremors , and the light-giving waves follow as the necessary product of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heat by Vapours and Odours . We commenced the demonstrations brought forward in this lecture by experiments on permanent gases , and we have now to turn our attention to the vapours of volatile liquids . Here , as in the case of the gases , vast differences have been proved to exist between various kinds of molecules , as regards their power of intercepting the calorific waves . While some vapours allow the waves a comparatively free passage , the faintest mixture of other vapours causes a deflection of the magnetic needle . Assuming the absorption effected by air , at a pressure of one atmosphere , to be unity , the following are the absorptions effected by a series of vapours at a pressure of 1/60th of an atmosphere : Name of vapour Absorption Bisulphide of carbon 47 Iodide of methyl 115 Benzol 136 Amylene 321 Sulphuric ether 440 Formic ether 548 Acetic ether 612 Bisulphide of carbon is the most transparent vapour in this list ; and acetic ether the most opaque ; 1/60th of an atmosphere of the former , however , produces 47 times the effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an atmosphere of the latter produces 612 times the effect of a whole atmosphere of air . Reducing dry air to the pressure of the acetic ether here employed , and comparing them then together , the quantity of wave-motion intercepted by the ether would be many thousand times that intercepted by the air . Any one of these vapours discharged into the free atmosphere , in front of a body emitting obscure rays , intercepts more or less of the radiation . A similar effect is produced by perfumes diffused in the air , though their attenuation is known to be almost infinite . Carrying , for example , a current of dry air over bibulous paper , moistened by patchouli , the scent taken up by the current absorbs 30 times the quantity of heat intercepted by the air which carries it ; and yet patchouli acts more feebly on radiant heat than any other perfume yet examined . Here follow the results obtained with various essential oils , the odour , in each case , being carried by a current of dry air into the be already employed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30 Sandal wood 32 Geranium 33 Oil of cloves 34 Otto of roses 37 Bergamot 44 Neroli 47 Lavender 60 Lemon 65 Portugal 67 Thyme 68 Rosemary 74 Oil of laurel 80 Camomile flowers 87 Cassia 109 Spikenard 355 Aniseed 372 Thus the absorption by a tube full of dry air being 1 , that of the odour of patchouli diffused in it is 30 , at of lavender 60 , that of rosemary 74 , whilst that of aniseed amounts to 372 . It would be idle to speculate the quantities of matter concerned in these actions . ******************** 12 . Aqueous Vapour in relation to the Terrestrial Temperatures . We are now fully prepared for a result which , without such preparation , might appear incredible . Water is , to some extent , a volatile body , and our atmosphere , resting as it does upon the surface of the ocean , receives from it a continual supply of aqueous vapour . It would be an error to confound clouds or fog or any visible mist with the vapour of water , which is a perfectly impalpable gas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the atmosphere . Compared with the great body of the air , the aqueous vapour it contains is of almost infinitesimal amount , 99.5 out of every 100 parts of the atmosphere being composed of oxygen and nitrogen . In the absence of experiment , we should never think of ascribing to this scant and varying constituent any important influence on terrestrial radiation ; and yet its influence is far more potent than that of the great body of the air . To say that on a day of average humidity in England , the atmospheric vapour exerts 100 times the action of the air itself , would certainly be an understatement of the fact . Comparing a single molecule of aqueous vapour with an atom of either of the main constituents of our atmosphere , I am not prepared to say how many thousand times the action of the former exceeds that of the latter . But it must be borne in mind that these large numbers depend , in part , on the extreme feebleness of the air ; the power of aqueous vapour seems vast , because that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Absolutely considered , however , this substance , notwithstanding its small specific gravity , exercises a very potent action . Probably from 10 to 15 per cent . of the heat radiated from the earth is absorbed within 10 or 20 feet of the earth 's surface . This must evidently be of the utmost consequence to the life of the world . Imagine the superficial molecules of the earth agitated with the motion of heat , and imparting it to the surrounding aether ; this motion would be carried rapidly away , and lost for ever to our planet , if the waves of aether had nothing but the air to contend with in their outward course . But the aqueous vapour takes up the motion , and becomes hereby heated , thus wrapping the earth like a warm garment , and protecting its surface from the deadly chill which it would otherwise sustain . Various philosophers have speculated on the influence of an atmospheric envelope . De Saussure , Fourier , M. Pouillet , and Mr. Hopkins have , one and all , enriched scientific literature with contributions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men have applied to atmospheric air , have , if my experiments be correct , to be transferred to the aqueous vapour . The observations of meteorologists furnish important , though hitherto unconscious evidence of the influence of this agent . Wherever the air is dry we are liable to daily extremes of temperature . By day , such places , the sun 's heat reaches the earth unimpeded , and renders the maximum high ; by night , on the other hand , the earth 's heat escapes unhindered to space , and renders the minimum low . Hence the difference between the maximum and minimum is greatest where the air is driest . In the plains of India , the heights of the Himalaya , in central Asia , in Australia  --  wherever drought reigns , we have the heat of day forcibly contrasted with the chill of night . In the Sahara itself , when the sun 's rays cease to impinge on the burning soil , the temperature runs rapidly down to freezing , because there is no vapour overhead to check the calorific drain . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known , in which nature tends as it were to check her own excess . By nocturnal refrigeration , the aqueous vapour of the air is condensed to water on the surface of the earth ; and , as only the superficial portions radiate , the act of condensation makes water the radiating body . Now experiment proves that to the rays emitted by water , aqueous vapour is especially opaque . Hence the very act of condensation , consequent on terrestrial cooling , becomes a safeguard to the earth , imparting to its radiation that particular character which renders it most liable to be prevented from escaping into space . It might however be urged that , inasmuch as we derive all our heat from the sun , the selfsame covering which protects the earth from chill must also shut out the solar radiation . This is partially true , but only partially ; the sun 's rays are different in quality from the earth 's rays , and it does not at all follow that the substance which absorbs the one must necessarily absorb the other . Through a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an inch in thickness , the sun 's rays are transmitted with comparative freedom ; but through a layer half this thickness , as Melloni has proved , no single ray from the warmed earth could pass . In like manner , the sun 's rays pass with comparative freedom through the aqueous vapour of the air : the absorbing power of this substance being mainly exerted upon the invisible heat that endeavours to escape from the earth . In consequence of this differential action upon solar and terrestrial heat , the mean temperature of our planet is higher than is due to its distance from the sun . ******************** 13 . Liquids and their Vapours in relation to Radiant Heat . The deportment here assigned to atmospheric vapour has been established by direct experiments on it taken from the streets and parks of London , from the downs of Epsom , from the hills and sea-beach of the Isle of Wight , and also by experiments on air in the first instance dried , and afterwards rendered artificially humid by pure distilled water . It has also en established in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ random and the power of these quids , at a common thickness , to intercept the waves f heat , was carefully determined . The vapours of the quids were next taken , in quantities proportional to e quantities of liquid , and the power of the vapours intercept the waves of heat was also determined . Commencing with the substance which exerted the least absorptive power , and proceeding onwards to the most energetic , the following order of absorption was observed : Liquids Vapours Bisulphide of carbon . Bisulphide of carbon . Chloroform . Chloroform . Iodide of methyl . Iodide of methyl . Iodide of ethyl . Iodide of ethyl . Benzol . Benzol . Amylene . Amylene . Sulphuric aether . Sulphuric aether . Acetic aether . Acetic aether . Formic aether . Formic aether . Alcohol . Alcohol . Water . We here find the order of absorption in both cases be the same . We have liberated the molecules from the bonds which trammel them more or less in a liquid condition ; but this change in their state of aggregation does not change their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the act of absorption depends upon the individual molecule , which equally asserts its power in the liquid and the gaseous state . We may safely conclude from the above table that the position of a vapour is determined by that of its liquid . Now at the very foot of the list of liquids stands water , signalising itself above all others by its enormous power of absorption . And from this fact , even if no direct experiment on the vapour of water had ever been made , we should be entitled to rank that vapour as our most powerful absorber of radiant heat . Its attenuation , however , diminishes its action . I have proved that a shell of air two inches in thickness surrounding our planet , and saturated with the vapour of sulphuric aether , would intercept 35 per cent . of the earth 's radiation . And though the quantity of aqueous vapour necessary to saturate air is much less than the amount of sulphuric aether vapour which it can sustain , it is still extremely probable that the estimate already made of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth 's surface , is under the mark ; and that we are indebted to this wonderful substance , to an extent not accurately determined , but certainly far beyond what has hitherto been imagined , for the temperature now existing at the surface of the globe . ******************** 14 . Reciprocity of Radiation and Absorption . Throughout the reflections which have hitherto occupied us , the image before the mind has been that of a radiant source sending forth calorific waves , which on passing among the molecules of a gas or vapour were intercepted by those molecules in various degrees . In all cases it was the transference of motion from the aether to the comparatively quiescent molecules of the gas or vapour that occupied our thoughts . We have now to change the form of our conception , and to figure these molecules not as absorbers but as radiators , not as the recipients but as the originators of wave-motion . That is to say , we must figure them vibrating , and generating in the surrounding aether undulations which speed through it with the velocity of light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of chemical combination , which proves so potent as regards the phenomena of absorption , does not also manifest its power in the phenomena of radiation . For the examination of this question it is necessary , in the first place , to heat our gases and vapours to the same temperature , and then examine their power of discharging the motion thus imparted to them upon the aether in which they swing . A heated copper ball was placed above a ring gas-burner possessing a great number of small apertures , the burner being connected by a tube with vessels containing the various gases to be examined . By gentle pressure the gases were forced through the orifices of the burner against the copper ball , where each of them , being heated , rose in an ascending column . A thermoelectric pile , entirely screened from the hot ball , was exposed to the radiation of the warm gas , while the deflection of a magnetic needle connected with the pile declared the energy of the radiation . By this mode of experiment it was proved that the selfsame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ renders it a powerful radiator  --  that the atom or molecule which is competent to intercept the calorific waves is , in the same degree , competent to send them forth . Thus , while the atoms of elementary gases proved themselves unable to emit any sensible amount of radiant heat , the molecules of compound gases were shown to be capable of powerfully disturbing the surrounding aether . By special modes of experiment the same was proved to hold good for the vapours of volatile liquids , the radiative power of every vapour being found proportional to its absorptive power . The method of experiment here pursued , though not of the simplest character , is still easy to grasp . When air is permitted to rush into an exhausted tube , the temperature of the air is raised to a degree equivalent to the vis viva extinguished . Footnote : See above for a definition of vis viva . Such air is said to be dynamically heated , and , if pure , it shows itself incompetent to radiate , even when a rock-salt window is provided for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empty the tube contain a small quantity of vapour , the warmed air communicates its heat by contact to the vapour , the molecules of which convert into the radiant form the heat imparted to them by the atoms of the air . By this process also , which I have called Dynamic Radiation , the reciprocity of radiation and absorption has been conclusively proved . Footnote : When heated air imparts its motion to another gas or vapour , the transference of heat is accompanied by a change of vibrating period . The Dynamic Radiation of vapours is rendered possible by this transmutation of vibrations . In the excellent researches of Leslie , De la Provostaye and Detains , and Balfour Stewart , the same reciprocity , as regards solid bodies , has been variously illustrated ; while the labours , theoretical and experimental , of Kirchhoff have given this subject a wonderful expansion , and enriched it by applications of the highest kind . To their results are now to be added the foregoing , whereby gases and vapours , which have been hitherto thought inaccessible to experiments with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the indissoluble duality of radiation and absorption , the influence of chemical combination on both being exhibited in the most decisive and extraordinary way . ******************** 15 . Influence of Vibrating Period and Molecular Form . Physical Analysis of the Human Breath . In the foregoing experiments with gases and vapours have employed throughout invisible rays , and found e of these bodies so impervious to radiant heat , that lengths of a few feet they intercept every ray as actually as a layer of pitch . The substances , however , which show themselves thus opaque to radiant heat perfectly transparent to light . Now the rays of light differ from those of invisible heat merely in point period , the former failing to affect the retina because their periods of recurrence are too slow . Hence , in one way or other , the transparency of our gases and vapours depends upon the periods of the waves which impinge upon them . What is the nature of this dependence ? The admirable researches of Kirchhoff help us an answer . The atoms and molecules of every gas e certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most copiously absorbed whose periods recurrence synchronise with those of the atomic ups amongst which they pass . Thus , when we find invisible rays absorbed and the visible ones transmitted by a layer of gas , we conclude that the oscillating periods of the atoms constituting the gaseous molecules coincide with those of the invisible , and not with those of the visible spectrum . It requires some discipline of the imagination to form a clear picture of this process . Such a picture is , however , possible , and ought to be obtained . When the waves of aether impinge upon molecules whose periods of vibration coincide with the recurrence of the undulations , the timed strokes of the waves augment the vibration of the molecules , as a heavy pendulum is set in motion by well-timed puffs of breath . Millions of millions of shocks are received every second from the calorific waves ; and it is not difficult to see that as every wave arrives just in time to repeat the action of its predecessor , the molecules must finally be caused to swing through wider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In fact , it is not difficult to see that an assemblage of molecules , operated upon by contending waves , might remain practically quiescent . This is actually the case when the waves of the visible spectrum pass through a transparent gas or vapour . There is here no sensible transference of motion from the aether to the molecules ; in other words , there is no sensible absorption of heat . One striking example of the influence of period may be here recorded . Carbonic acid gas is one of the feeblest absorbers of the radiant heat emitted by solid bodies . It is , for example , to a great extent transparent to the rays emitted by the heated copper plate already referred to . There are , however , certain rays , comparatively few in number , emitted by the copper , to which the carbonic acid is impervious ; and could we obtain a source of heat emitting such rays only , we should find carbonic acid more opaque to the radiation from that source , than any other gas . Such a source is actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carbonic acid constitutes the main radiating body . Of the rays emitted by our heated plate of copper , olefiant gas absorbs ten times the quantity absorbed by carbonic acid . Of the rays emitted by a carbonic oxide flame , carbonic acid absorbs twice as much as olefiant gas . This wonderful change in the power of the former , as an absorber , is simply due to the fact , that the periods of the hot and cold carbonic acid are identical , and that the waves from the flame freely transfer their motion to the molecules which synchronise with them . Thus it is that the tenth an atmosphere of carbonic acid , enclosed in a tube four feet long , absorbs 60 per cent . of the radiation from carbonic oxide flame , while one-thirtieth of an atmosphere absorbs 48 per cent . of the heat from the same source . In fact , the presence of the minutest quantity of carbonic acid may be detected by its action on the rays from the carbonic oxide flame . Carrying , for example , the dried human breath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effected by the carbonic acid of the breath amounts to 50 per cent . of the entire radiation . Radiant heat may indeed be employed as a means of determining practically the amount of carbonic acid expired from the lungs . My late assistant , Mr. Barrett , while under my direction , made this determination . The absorption produced by the breath freed from its moisture , but retaining its carbonic acid , was first determined . Carbonic acid , artificially prepared , was then mixed with dry air in such proportions that the action of the mixture upon the rays of heat was the same as that of the dried breath . The percentage of the former being known , immediately gave that of the latter . The same breath , analysed chemically by Dr. Frankland , and physically by Mr. Barrett , gave the following results : Percentage of Carbonic Acid in the Human Breath . Chemical analysis Physical analysis 4.66 4.56 5.33 5.22 It is thus proved that in the quantity of aethereal motion which it is competent to take up , we have a practical measure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the combustion going on in the human lungs . Still this question of period , though of the utmost importance , is not competent to account for the whole of the observed facts . The aether , as far as we know , accepts vibrations of all periods with the same readiness . To it the oscillations of an atom of free oxygen are just as acceptable as those of the atoms in a molecule of olefiant gas ; that the vibrating oxygen then stands so far below the olefiant gas in radiant power must be referred not to period , but to some other peculiarity . The atomic group which constitutes the molecule of olefiant gas , produces many thousand times the disturbance caused by the oxygen , it may be because the group is able to lay a vastly more powerful hold upon the aether than single atoms can . Another , and probably very potent cause of the difference may be , that the vibrations , being those of the constituent atoms of the molecule , Footnote : See ' Physical Considerations , ' Art . iv. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : condensed air upon sound . But whatever may be the fate of these attempts to visualise the physics of the process , it will still remain true , that to account for the phenomena of radiation and absorption we must take into consideration the shape , size , and condition of the aether within the molecules , by which the external aether is disturbed . ******************** 16 . Summary and Conclusion . Let us now cast a momentary glance over the ground that we have left behind . The general nature of light and heat was first briefly described : the compounding of matter from elementary atoms , and the influence of the act of combination on radiation and absorption , were considered and experimentally illustrated . Through the transparent elementary gases radiant heat was found to pass as through a vacuum , while many of the compound gases presented almost impassable obstacles to the calorific-waves . This deportment of the simple gases directed our attention to other elementary bodies , the examination of which led to the discovery that the element iodine , dissolved in bisulphide of carbon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light of the spectrum from its heat , intercepting all luminous rays up to the extreme red , and permitting the calorific rays beyond the red to pass freely through it . This substance was then employed to filter the beams of the electric light , and to form foci of invisible rays so intense as to produce almost all the effects obtainable in ordinary fire . Combustible bodies were burnt , and refractory ones were raised to a white heat , by the concentrated invisible rays . Thus , by exalting their refrangibility , the invisible rays of the electric light were rendered visible , and all the colours of the solar spectrum were extracted from utter darkness . The extreme richness of the electric light in invisible rays of low refrangibility was demonstrated , one-eighth only of its radiation consisting of luminous rays . The deadness of the optic nerve to those invisible rays was proved , and experiments were then added to show that the bright and the dark rays of a solid body , raised gradually to incandescence , are strengthened together ; intense dark heat being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not be formed , or a meteorite rendered luminous , on any other condition . The light-giving rays constituting only a small fraction of the total radiation , their unspeakable importance to us is due to the fact , that their periods are attuned to the special requirements of the eye . Among the vapours of volatile liquids vast differences were also found to exist , as regards their powers of absorption . We followed various molecules from a state of liquid to a state of gas , and found , in both states of aggregation , the power of the individual molecules equally asserted . The position of a vapour as an absorber of radiant heat was shown to be determined by that of the liquid from which it is derived . Reversing our conceptions , and regarding the molecules of gases and vapours not as the recipients but as the originators of wave-motion ; not as absorbers but as radiators ; it was proved that the powers of absorption and radiation went hand in hand , the self-same chemical act which rendered a body competent to intercept the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same degree , to generate them . Perfumes were next subjected to examination , and , notwithstanding their extraordinary tenuity , they were found vastly superior , in point of absorptive power , to the body of the air in which they were diffused . We were led thus slowly up to the examination of the most widely diffused and most important of all vapours  --  the aqueous vapour of our atmosphere , and we found in it a potent absorber of the purely calorific rays . The power of this substance to influence climate , and its general influence on the temperature of the earth , were then briefly dwelt upon . A cobweb spread above a blossom is sufficient to protect it from nightly chill ; and thus the aqueous vapour of our air , attenuated as it is , checks the drain of terrestrial heat , and saves the surface of our planet from the refrigeration which would assuredly accrue , were no such substance interposed between it and the voids of space . We considered the influence of vibrating period , and molecular form , on absorption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon radiant heat , the exact amount of carbonic acid expired by the human lungs . Thus , in brief outline , were placed before you some ofthe results of recent enquiries in the domain of Radiation , and my aim throughout has been to raise in your minds distinct physical images of the various processes involved in our researches . It is thought by some that natural science has a deadening influence on the imagination , and a doubt might fairly be raised as to the value of any study which would necessarily have this effect . But the experience of the last hour must , I think , have convinced you , that the study of natural science goes hand in hand with the culture of the imagination . Throughout the greater part of this discourse we have been sustained by this faculty . We have been picturing atoms , and molecules , and vibrations , and waves , which eye has never seen nor ear heard , and which can only be discerned by the exercise of imagination . This , in fact , is the faculty which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the phenomena of our visible world with those of an invisible one . Without imagination we never could have risen to the conceptions which have occupied us here today ; and in proportion to your power of exercising this faculty aright , and of associating definite mental images with the terms employed , will be the pleasure and the profit which you will derive from this lecture . The outward facts of nature are insufficient to satisfy the mind . We can not be content with knowing that the light and heat of the sun illuminate and warm the world . We are led irresistibly to enquire , ' What is light , and what is heat ? ' and this question leads us at once out of the region of sense into that of imagination . Footnote : This line of thought was pursued further five years subsequently . See ' Scientific Use of the Imagination ' in Vol . II . Thus pondering , and questioning , and striving to supplement that which is felt and seen , but which is incomplete , by something unfelt and unseen which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in part discerned , not only the nature of light and heat , but also , through them , the general relationship of natural phenomena . The working power of Nature consists of actual or potential motion , of which all its phenomena are but special forms . This motion manifests itself in tangible and in intangible matter , being incessantly transferred from the one to the other , and incessantly transformed by the change . It is as real in the waves of the aether as in the waves of the sea ; the latter  --  derived as they are from winds , which in their turn are derived from the sun  --  are , indeed , nothing more than the heaped-up motion of the aether waves . It is the calorific waves emitted by the sun which heat our air , produce our winds , and hence agitate our ocean . And whether they break in foam upon the shore , or rub silently against the ocean 's bed , or subside by the mutual friction of their own parts , the sea waves , which can not subside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aether , thus regenerating the motion from which their temporary existence was derived . This connection is typical . Nature is not an aggregate of independent parts , but an organic whole . If you open a piano and sing into it , a certain string will respond . Change the pitch of our voice ; the first string ceases to vibrate , but another replies . Change again the pitch ; the first two strings are silent , while another resounds . Thus is sentient man acted on by Nature , the optic , the auditory , and other nerves of the human body being so many strings differently tuned , and responsive to different forms of the universal power . ******************** III ON RADIANT HEAT IN RELATION TO THE COLOUR AND CHEMICAL CONSTITUTION OF BODIES . Footnote : A discourse delivered in the Royal Institution of Great Britain , Jan. 19 , 1866 . ONE of the most important functions of physical science , considered as a discipline of the mind , is to enable us by means of the sensible processes of Nature to apprehend the insensible . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but this once given , the length of the line is not limited by the boundaries of the senses . Indeed , the domain of the senses , in Nature , is almost infinitely small in comparison with the vast region accessible to thought which lies beyond them . From a few observations of a comet , when it comes within the range of his telescope , an astronomer can calculate its path in regions which no telescope can reach : and in like manner , by means of data furnished in the narrow world of the senses , we make ourselves at home in other and wider worlds , which are traversed by the intellect alone . From the earliest ages the questions , ' What is light ? ' and ' What is heat ? ' have occurred to the minds of men ; but these questions never would have been answered had they not been preceded by the question , ' What is sound ? ' Amid the grosser phenomena of acoustics the mind was first disciplined , conceptions being thus obtained from direct observation , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subtle to be observed directly . Sound we know to be due to vibratory motion . A vibrating tuning-fork , for example , moulds the air around it into undulations or waves , which speed away on all sides with a certain measured velocity , impinge upon the drum of the ear , shake the auditory nerve , and awake in the brain the sensation of sound . When sufficiently near a sounding body we can feel the vibrations of the air . A deaf man , for example , plunging his hand into a bell when it is sounded , feels through the common nerves of his body those tremors which , when imparted to the nerves of healthy ears , are translated into sound . There are various ways of rendering those sonorous vibrations not only tangible but visible ; and it was not until numberless experiments of this kind had been executed , that the scientific investigator abandoned himself wholly , and without a shadow of misgiving , to the conviction that what is sound within us is , outside of us , a motion of the air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proved beyond all doubt that the sensation of sound is produced by an agitation of the auditory nerve  --  the thought soon suggested itself that light might be due to an agitation of the optic nerve . This was a great step in advance of that ancient notion which regarded light as something emitted by the eye , and not as anything imparted to it . But if light be produced by an agitation of the retina , what is it that produces the agitation ? Newton , you know , supposed minute particles to be shot through the humours of the eye against the retina , which he supposed to hang like a target at the back of the eye . The impact of these particles against the target , Newton believed to be the cause of light . But Newton 's notion has not held its ground , being entirely driven from the field by the more wonderful and far more philosophical notion that light , like sound , is a product of wave-motion . The domain in which this motion of light is carried on lies entirely beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ require a medium for their formation and propagation ; but we can not see , or feel , or taste , or smell this medium . How , then , has its existence been established ? By showing , that by the assumption of this wonderful intangible aether , all the phenomena of optics are accounted for , with a fulness , and clearness , and conclusiveness , which leave no desire of the intellect unsatisfied . When the law of gravitation first suggested itself to the mind of Newton , what did he do ? He set himself to examine whether it accounted for all the facts . He determined the courses of the planets ; he calculated the rapidity of the moon 's fall towards the earth ; he considered the precession of the equinoxes , the ebb and flow of the tides , and found all explained by the law of gravitation . He therefore regarded this law as established , and the verdict of science subsequently confirmed his conclusion . On similar , and , if possible , on stronger grounds , we found our belief in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far more various and complicated than those on which Newton based his law . If a single phenomenon could be pointed out which the aether is proved incompetent to explain , we should have to give it up ; but no such phenomenon has ever been pointed out . It is , therefore , at least as certain that space is filled with a medium , by means of which suns and stars diffuse their radiant power , as that it is traversed by that force which holds in its grasp , not only our planetary system , but the immeasurable heavens themselves . There is no more wonderful instance than this of the production of a line of thought , from the world of the senses into the region of pure imagination . I mean by imagination here , not that play of fancy which can give to airy nothings a local habitation and a name , but that power which enables the mind to conceive realities which lie beyond the range of the senses  --  to present to itself distinct images of processes which , though mighty in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to elude all observation . It is the waves of air excited by a tuning-fork which render its vibrations audible . It is the waves of aether sent forth from those lamps overhead which render them luminous to us ; but so minute are these waves , that it would take from 30,000 to 60,000 of them placed end to end to cover a single inch . Their number , however , compensates for their minuteness . Trillions of them have entered your eyes , and hit the retina at the backs of your eyes , in the time consumed in the utterance of the shortest sentence of this discourse . This is the steadfast result of modern research ; but we never could have reached it without previous discipline . We never could have measured the waves of light , nor even imagined them to exist , had we not previously exercised ourselves among the waves of sound . Sound and light are now mutually helpful , the conceptions of each being expanded , strengthened , and defined by the conceptions of the other . The aether which conveys the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , swathing suns , and planets , and moons , but it also encircles the atoms of which these bodies are composed . It is the motion of these atoms , and not that of any sensible parts of bodies , that the aether conveys . This motion is the objective cause of what , in our sensations , are light and heat . An atom , then , sending its pulses through the aether , resembles a tuning-fork sending its pulses through the air . Let us look for a moment at this thrilling medium , and briefly consider its relation to the bodies whose vibrations it conveys . Different bodies , when heated to the same temperature , possess very different powers of agitating the aether : some are good radiators , others are bad radiators ; which means that some are so constituted as to communicate their atomic motion freely to the aether , producing therein powerful undulations ; while the atoms of others are unable thus to communicate their motions , but glide through the medium without materially disturbing its repose . Recent experiments have proved that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the class of bad radiators . An atom , vibrating in the aether , resembles a naked tuning-fork vibrating in the air . The amount of motion communicated to the air by the thin prongs is too small to evoke at any distance the sensation of sound . But if we permit the atoms to combine chemically and form molecules , the result , in many cases , is an enormous change in the power of radiation . The amount of aethereal disturbance , produced by the combined atoms of a body , may be many thousand times that produced by the same atoms when uncombined . The pitch of a musical note depends upon the rapidity of its vibrations , or , in other words , on the length of its waves . Now , the pitch of a note answers to the colour of light . Taking a slice of white light from the sun , or from an electric lamp , and causing the light to pass through an arrangement of prisms , it is decomposed . We have the effect obtained by Newton , who first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spectrum . At one end of this spectrum we have red light , at the other , violet ; and between those extremes lie the other prismatic colours . As we advance along the spectrum from the red to the violet , the pitch of the light  --  if I may use the expression  --  heightens , the sensation of violet being produced by a more rapid succession of impulses than that which produces the impression of red . The vibrations of the violet are about twice as rapid as those of the red ; in other words , the range of the visible spectrum is about an octave . There is no solution of continuity in this spectrum one colour changes into another by insensible gradations . It is as if an infinite number of tuning-forks , of gradually augmenting pitch , were vibrating at the same time . But turning to another spectrum  --  that , namely , obtained from the incandescent vapour of silver  --  you observe that it consists of two narrow and intensely luminous green bands . Here it is as if two forks only , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the waves which produce this first band is such that 47,460 of them , placed end to end , would fill an inch . The waves which produce the second band are a little shorter ; it would take of these 47,920 to fill an inch . In the case of the first band , the number of impulses imparted , in one second , to every eye which sees it , is 677 millions of millions ; while the number of impulses imparted , in the same time , by the second band is 600 millions of millions . We may project upon a white screen the beautiful stream of green light from which these bands were derived . This luminous stream is the incandescent vapour of silver . The rates of vibration of the atoms of that vapour are as rigidly fixed as those of two tuning-forks ; and to whatever height the temperature of the vapour may be raised , the rapidity of its vibrations , and consequently its colour , which wholly depends upon that rapidity , remain unchanged . The vapour of water , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ periods of vibration , and these are such as to disqualify the vapour , when acting freely as such , from being raised to a white heat . The oxyhydrogen flame , for example , consists of hot aqueous vapour . It is scarcely visible in the air of this room , and it would be still less visible if we could burn the gas in a clean atmosphere . But the atmosphere , even at the summit of Mont Blanc , is dirty ; in London it is more than dirty ; and the burning dirt gives to this flame the greater portion of its present light . But the heat of the flame is enormous . Cast iron fuses at a temperature of 2,000 deg . Fahr ; while the temperature of the oxyhydrogen flame is 6,000 deg . Fahr . A piece of platinum is heated to vivid redness , at a distance of two inches beyond the visible termination of the flame . The vapour which produces incandescence is here absolutely dark . In the flame itself the platinum is raised to dazzling whiteness , and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a piece of lime , we have the dazzling Drummond light . But the light is here due to the fact that when it impinges upon the solid body , the vibrations excited in that body by the flame are of periods different from its own . Thus far we have fixed our attention on atoms and molecules in a state of vibration , and surrounded by a medium which accepts their vibrations , and transmits them through space . But suppose the waves generated by one system of molecules to impinge upon another system , how will the waves be affected ? Will they be stopped , or will they be permitted to pass ? Will they transfer their motion to the molecules on which they impinge , or will they glide round the molecules , through the intermolecular spaces , and thus escape ? The answer to this question depends upon a condition which may be beautifully exemplified by an experiment on sound . These two tuning-forks are tuned absolutely alike . They vibrate with the same rapidity , and , mounted thus upon their resonant cases , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stopping one of the forks , I throw the other into strong vibration , and bring that other near the silent fork , but not into contact with it . Allowing them to continue in this position for four or five seconds , and then stopping the vibrating fork , the sound does not cease . The second fork has taken up the vibrations of its neighbour , and is now sounding in its turn . Dismounting one of the forks , and permitting the other to remain upon its stand , I throw the dismounted fork into strong vibration . You can not hear it sound . Detached from its case , the amount of motion which it can communicate to the air is too small to be sensible at any distance . When the dismounted fork is brought close to the mounted one , but not into actual contact with it , out of the silence rises a mellow sound . Whence comes it ? From the vibrations which have been transferred from the dismounted fork to the mounted one . That the motion should thus transfer itself through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be in perfect unison . If a morsel of wax not larger than a pea be placed on one of the forks , it is rendered thereby powerless to affect , or to be affected by , the other . It is easy to understand this experiment . The pulses of the one fork can affect the other , because they are perfectly timed . A single pulse causes the prong of the silent fork to vibrate through an infinitesimal space . But just as it has completed this small vibration another pulse is ready to strike it . Thus , the impulses add themselves together . In the five seconds during which the forks were held near each other , the vibrating fork sent 1,280 waves against its neighbour and those 1,280 shocks , all delivered at the proper moment , all , as I have said , perfectly timed , have given such strength to the vibrations of the mounted fork as to render them audible to all . Another curious illustration of the influence of synchronism on musical vibrations , is this : Three small gas-flames are inserted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these flames can be caused to emit a musical note , the pitch of which is determined by the length of the tube surrounding the flame . The shorter the tube the higher is the pitch . The flames are now silent within their respective tubes , but each of them can be caused to respond to a proper note sounded anywhere in this room . With an instrument called a syren , a powerful musical note , of gradually increasing pitch , can be produced . Beginning with a low note , and ascending gradually to a higher one , we finally attain the pitch of the flame in the longest tube . The moment it is reached , the flame bursts into song . The other flames are still silent within their tubes . But by urging the instrument on to higher notes , the second flame is started , and the third alone remains . A still higher note starts it also . Thus , as the sound of the syren rises gradually in pitch , it awakens every flame in passing , by striking it with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its own . Now the wave-motion from the syren is in part taken up by the flame which synchronises with the waves ; and were these waves to impinge upon a multitude of flames , instead of upon one flame only , the transference might be so great as to absorb the whole of the original wave motion . Let us apply these facts to radiant heat . This blue flame is the flame of carbonic oxide ; this transparent gas is carbonic acid gas . In the blue flame we have carbonic acid intensely heated , or , in other words , in a state of intense vibration . It thus resembles the sounding fork , while this cold carbonic acid resembles the silent one . What is the consequence ? Through the synchronism of the hot and cold gas , the waves emitted by the former are intercepted by the latter , the transmission of the radiant heat being thus prevented . The cold gas is intensely opaque to the radiation from this particular flame , though highly transparent to heat of every other kind . We are here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basis of spectrum analysis , and which has enabled scientific men to determine the substances of which the sun , the stars , and even the nebulae are composed ; the principle , namely , that a body which is competent to emit any ray , whether of heat or light , is competent in the same degree to absorb that ray . The absorption depends on the synchronism existing between the vibrations of the toms from which the rays , or more correctly the waves , sue , and those of the atoms on which they impinge . To its almost total incompetence to emit white light , aqueous vapour adds a similar incompetence to absorb bite light . It can not , for example , absorb the luminous rays of the sun , though it can absorb the non-luminous rays of the earth . This incompetence of the vapour to absorb luminous rays is shared by water and ice  --  in fact , by all really transparent substances . Their transparency is due to their inability to absorb luminous rays . The molecules of such substances are in dissonance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transparent bodies without disturbing the molecular rest . A purely luminous beam , however intense may be its heat , is sensibly incompetent to melt ice . We can , for example , converge a powerful luminous beam upon a surface covered with hoar frost , without melting a single spicula of the crystals . How then , it may be asked , are the snows of the Alps swept away by the sunshine of summer ? I answer , they are not swept away by sunshine at all , but by rays which have no sunshine whatever in them . The luminous rays of the sun fall upon the snow-fields and are flashed in echoes from crystal to crystal , but they find next to no lodgment within the crystals . They are hardly at all absorbed , and hence they can not produce fusion . But a body of powerful dark rays is emitted by the sun ; and it is these that cause the glaciers to shrink and the snows to disappear ; it is they that fill the banks of the Arve and Arveyron , and liberate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Placing a concave silvered mirror behind the electric light its rays are converged to a focus of dazzling brilliancy . Placing in the path of the rays , between the light and the focus , a vessel of water , and introducing at the focus a piece of ice , the ice is not melted by the concentrated beam . Matches , at the same place , are ignited , and wood is set on fire . The powerful heat , then , of this luminous beam is incompetent to melt the ice . On withdrawing the cell of water , the ice immediately liquefies , and the water trickles from it in drops . Reintroducing the cell of water , the fusion is arrested , and the drops cease to fall . The transparent water of the cell exerts no sensible absorption on the luminous rays , still it withdraws something from the beam , which , when permitted to act , is competent to melt the ice . This something is the dark radiation of the electric light . Again , I place a slab of pure ice in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first through our cell of water and then through the ice . By means of a lens an image of the slab is cast upon a white screen . The beam , sifted by the water , has little power upon the ice . But observe what occurs when the water is removed ; we have here a star and there a star , each star resembling a flower of six petals , and growing visibly larger before our eyes . As the leaves enlarge , their edges become serrated , but there is no deviation from the six-rayed type . We have here , in fact , the crystallisation of the ice reversed by the invisible rays of the electric beam . They take the molecules down in this wonderful way , and reveal to us the exquisite atomic structure of the substance with which Nature every winter roofs our ponds and lakes . Numberless effects , apparently anomalous , might be adduced in illustration of the action of these lightless rays . These two powders , for example , are both white , and undistinguishable from each other by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unabsorbed by both  --  from such rays these powders acquire no heat ; still one of them , sugar , is heated so highly by the concentrated beam of the electric lamp , that it first smokes and then violently inflames , while the other substance , salt , is barely warmed at the focus . Placing two perfectly transparent liquids in test-tubes at the focus , one of them boils in a couple of seconds , while the other , in a similar position , is hardly warmed . The boiling-point of the first liquid is 78 deg.C , which is speedily reached ; that of the second liquid is only 48 deg.C , which is never reached at all . These anomalies are entirely due to the unseen element which mingles with the luminous rays of the electric beam , and indeed constitutes 90 per cent . of its calorific power . A substance , as many of you know , has been discovered , by which these dark rays may be detached from the total emission of the electric lamp . This ray-filter is a liquid , black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diamond to the non-luminous , radiation . It mercilessly cuts off the former , but allows the latter free transmission . When these invisible rays are brought to a focus , at a distance of several feet from the electric lamp , the dark rays form an invisible image of their source . By proper means , this image may be transformed into a visible one of dazzling brightness . It might , moreover , be shown , if time permitted , how , out of those perfectly dark rays , could be extracted , by a process of transmutation , all the colours of the solar spectrum . It might also be proved that those rays , powerful as they are , and sufficient to fuse many metals , can be permitted to enter the eye , and to break upon the retina , without producing the least luminous impression . The dark rays being thus collected , you see nothing at their place of convergence . With a proper thermometer it could be proved that even the air at the focus is just as cold as the surrounding air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It proves the aether at the focus to be practically detached from the air ,  --  that the most violent aethereal motion may there exist , without the least aerial motion . But , though you see it not , there is sufficient heat at that focus to set London on fire . The heat there is competent to raise iron to a temperature at which it throws off brilliant scintillations . It can heat platinum to whiteness , and almost fuse that refractory metal . It actually can fuse gold , silver , copper , and aluminium . The moment , moreover , that wood is placed at the focus it bursts into a blaze . It has been already affirmed that , whether as regards radiation or absorption , the elementary atoms possess but little power . This might be illustrated by a long array of facts ; and one of the most singular of these is furnished by the deportment of that extremely combustible substance , phosphorus , when placed at the dark focus . It is impossible to ignite there a fragment of amorphous phosphorus . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deportment towards radiant heat is still more impressive . It may be exposed to the intense radiation of an ordinary fire without bursting into flame . It may also be exposed for twenty or thirty seconds at an obscure focus , of sufficient power to raise platinum to a red heat , without ignition . Notwithstanding the energy of the aethereal waves here concentrated , notwithstanding the extremely inflammable character of the elementary body exposed to their action , the atoms of that body refuse to partake of the motion of the powerful waves of low refrangibility , and consequently can not be affected by their heat . The knowledge we now possess will enable us to analyse with profit a practical question . White dresses are worn in summer , because they are found to be cooler than dark ones . The celebrated Benjamin Franklin placed bits of cloth of various colours upon snow , exposed them to direct sunshine , and found that they sank to different depths in the snow . The black cloth sank deepest , the white did not sink at all . Franklin inferred from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white ones the worst absorbers , of radiant heat . Let us test the generality of this conclusion . One of these two cards is coated with a very dark powder , and the other with a perfectly white one . I place the powdered surfaces before a fire , and leave them there until they have acquired as high a temperature as they can attain in this position . Which of the cards is then most highly heated ? It requires no thermometer to answer this question . Simply pressing the back of the card , on which the white powder is strewn , against the cheek or forehead , it is found intolerably hot . Placing the dark card in the same position , it is found cool . The white powder has absorbed far more heat than the dark one . This simple result abolishes a hundred conclusions which have been hastily drawn from the experiments of Franklin . Again , here are suspended two delicate mercurial thermometers at the same distance from a gas-flame . The bulb of one of them is covered by a dark substance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Both bulbs have received the radiation from the flame , but the white bulb has absorbed most , and its mercury stands much higher than that of the other thermometer . This experiment might be varied in a hundred ways : it proves that from the darkness of a body you can draw no certain conclusion regarding its power of absorption . The reason of this simply is , that colour gives us intelligence of only one portion , and that the smallest one , of the rays impinging on the coloured body . Were the rays all luminous , we might with certainty infer from the colour of a body its power of absorption ; but the great mass of the radiation from our fire , our gas-flame , and even from the sun itself , consists of invisible calorific rays , regarding which colour teaches us nothing . A body may be highly transparent to the one class of rays , and highly opaque to the other . Thus the white powder , which has shown itself so powerful an absorber , has been specially selected on account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its extreme imperviousness to the invisible ones ; while the dark powder was chosen on account of its extreme transparency to the invisible , and its extreme opacity to the visible , rays . In the case of the radiation from our fire , about 98 per cent of the whole emission consists of invisible rays ; the body , therefore , which was most opaque to these triumphed as an absorber , though that body was a white one . And here it is worth while to consider the manner in which we obtain from natural facts what may be called their intellectual value . Throughout the processes of Nature we have interdependence and harmony ; and the main value of physics , considered as a mental discipline , consists in the tracing out of this interdependence , and the demonstration of this harmony . The outward and visible phenomena are the counters of the intellect ; and our science would not be worthy of its name and fame if it halted at facts , however practically useful , and neglected the laws which accompany and rule the phenomena . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiment of Franklin all that it can yield , calling to our aid the knowledge which our predecessors have already stored . Let us imagine two pieces of cloth of the same texture , the one black and the other white , placed upon sunned snow . Fixing our attention on the white piece , let us enquire whether there is any reason to expect that it will sink in the snow at all . There is knowledge at hand which enables us to reply at once in the negative . There is , on the contrary , reason to expect that , after a sufficient exposure , the bit of cloth will be found on an eminence instead of in a hollow ; that instead of a depression , we shall have a relative elevation of the bit of cloth . For , as regards the luminous rays of the sun , the cloth and the snow are alike powerless ; the one can not be warmed , nor the other melted , by such rays . The cloth is white and the snow is white , because their confusedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rays . Whether , then , the cloth will sink or not depends entirely upon the dark rays of the sun . Now the substance which absorbs these dark rays with the greatest avidity is ice ,  --  or snow , which is merely ice in powder . Hence , a less amounts of heat will be lodged in the cloth than in the surrounding snow . The cloth must therefore act as a shield to the snow on which it rests ; and , in consequence of the more rapid fusion of the exposed snow , its shield must , in due time , be left behind , perched upon an eminence like a glacier-table . But though the snow transcends the cloth , both as a radiator and absorber , it does not much transcend it . Cloth is very powerful in both these respects . Let us now turn our attention to the piece of black cloth , the texture and fabric of which I assume to be the same as that of the white . For our object being to compare the effects of colour , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purity , preserve all the other conditions constant . Let us then suppose the black cloth to be obtained from the dyeing of the white . The cloth itself , without reference to the dye , is nearly as good an absorber of heat as the snow around it . But to the absorption of the dark solar rays by the undyed cloth , is now added the absorption of the whole of the luminous rays , and this great additional influx of heat is far more than sufficient to turn the balance in favour of the black cloth . The sum of its actions on the dark and luminous rays , exceeds the action of the snow on the dark rays alone . Hence the cloth will sink in the snow , and this is the complete analysis of Franklin 's experiments . Throughout this discourse the main stress has been laid on chemical constitution , as influencing most powerfully the phenomena of radiation and absorption . With regard to gases and vapours , and to the liquids from which these vapours are derived , it has been proved by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radiation and absorption are molecular  --  that they depend upon chemical , and not upon mechanical , condition . In attempting to extend this principle to solids I was met by a multitude of facts , obtained by celebrated experimenters , which seemed flatly to forbid such an extension . Mellon , for example , had found the same radiant and absorbent power for chalk and lamp-black . MM . Masson and Courtepee had performed a most elaborate series of experiments on chemical precipitates of various kinds , and found that they one and all manifested the same power of radiation . They concluded from their researches , that when bodies are reduced to an extremely fine state of division , the influence of this state is so powerful as entirely to mask and override whatever influence may be due to chemical constitution . But it appears to me that through the whole of these researches an oversight has run , the mere mention of which will show what caution is essential in the operations of experimental philosophy ; while an experiments or two will make clear wherein the oversight consists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I determine the quantity of heat emitted by two of the bright surfaces . As a radiator of heat one of them far transcends the other . Both surfaces appear to be metallic ; what , then , is the cause of the observed difference in their radiative power ? Simply this : one of the surfaces is coated with transparent gum , through which , of course , is seen the metallic lustre behind ; and this varnish , though so perfectly transparent to luminous rays , is as opaque as pitch , or lamp-black , to non-luminous ones . It is a powerful emitter of dark rays ; it is also a powerful absorber . While , therefore , at the present moment , it is copiously pouring forth radiant heat itself , it does not allow a single ray from the metal behind to pass through it . The varnish then , and not the metal , is the real radiator . Now Melloni , and Masson , and Courtepee experimented thus : they mixed their powders and precipitates with gum-water , and laid them , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cube like this . True , they saw their red powders red , their white ones white , and their black ones black , but they saw these colours through the coat of varnish which surrounded every particle . When , therefore , it was concluded that colour had no influence on radiation , no chance had been given to it of asserting its influence ; when it was found that all chemical precipitates radiated alike , it was the radiation from a varnish , common to them all , which showed the observed constancy . Hundreds , perhaps thousands , of experiments on ' radiant heat have been performed in this way , by various enquirers , but the work will , I fear , have to be done over again . I am not , indeed , acquainted with an instance in which an oversight of so trivial a character has been committed by so many able men in succession , vitiating so large an amounts of otherwise excellent work . Basing our reasonings thus on demonstrated facts , we arrive at the extremely probable conclusion that the envelope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the real radiator in the experiments just referred to . To reason thus , and deduce their more or less probable consequences from experimental facts , is an incessant exercise of the student of physical science . But having thus followed , for a time , the light of reason alone through a series of phenomena , and emerged from them with a purely intellectual conclusion , our duty is to bring that conclusion to an experimental test . In this way we fortify our science . For the purpose of testing our conclusion regarding the influence of the gum , I take two powders presenting the same physical appearance ; one of them is a compound of mercury , and the other a compound of lead . On two surfaces of a cube are spread these bright red powders , without varnish of any kind . Filling the cube with boiling water , and determining the radiation from the ' two surfaces , one of them is found to emit thirty-nine units of heat , while the other emits seventy-four . This , surely , is a great difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having two of its surfaces coated with the same powders , the only difference being that the powders are laid on by means of a transparent gum . Both surfaces are now absolutely alike in radiative power . Both of them emit somewhat more than was emitted by either of the unvarnished powders , simply because the gum employed is a better radiator than either of them . Excluding all varnish , and comparing white with white , vast differences are found ; comparing black with black , they are also different ; and when black and white are compared , in some cases the black radiates far more than the white , while in other cases the white radiates far more than the black . Determining , moreover , the absorptive power of those powders , it is found to go hand-in-hand with their radiative power . The good radiator is a good absorber , and the bad radiator is a bad absorber . From all this it is evident that as regards the radiation and absorption of non-luminous heat , colour teaches us nothing ; and that even as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does mainly of non-luminous rays , conclusions as to the influence of colour may be altogether delusive . This is the strict scientific upshot of our researches . But it is not the less true that in the case of wearing apparel  --  and this for reasons which I have given in analysing the experiments of Franklin  --  black dresses are more potent than white ones as absorbers of solar heat . Thus , in brief outline , have been brought before you a few of the results of recent enquiry . If you ask me what is the use of them , I can hardly answer you , unless you define the term use . If you meant to ask whether those dark rays which clear away the Alpine snows , will ever be applied to the roasting of turkeys , or the driving of steam-engines  --  while affirming their power to do both , I would frankly confess that they are not at present capable of competing profitably with coal in these particulars . Still they may have great uses unknown to me ; and when our coal-fields are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than we are may cook their victuals , and perform their work , in this transcendental way . But is it necessary that the student of science should have his labours tested by their possible practical applications ? What is the practical value of Homer 's Iliad ? You smile , and possibly think that Homer 's Iliad is good as a means of culture . There 's the rub . The people who demand of science practical uses , forget , or do not know , that it also is great as a means of culture  --  that the knowledge of this wonderful universe is a thing profitable in itself , and requiring no practical application to justify its pursuit . But while the student of Nature distinctly refuses to have his labours judged by their practical issues , unless the term practical be made to include mental as well as material good , he knows full well that the greatest practical triumphs have been episodes in the search after pure natural truth . The electric telegraph is the standing wonder of this age , and the men whose scientific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what it is , are deserving of all honour . In fact , they have had their reward , both in reputation and in those more substantial benefits which the direct service of the public always carries in its train . But who , I would ask , put the soul into this telegraphic body ? Who snatched from heaven the fire that flashes along the line ? This , I am bound to say , was done by two men , the one a dweller in Italy , Footnote : Volta the other a dweller in England , Footnote : Faraday who never in their enquiries consciously set a practical object before them  --  whose only stimulus was the fascination which draws the climber to a never-trodden peak , and would have made Caesar quit his victories for the sources of the Nile . That the knowledge brought to us by those prophets , priests , and kings of science is what the world calls ' useful knowledge , ' the triumphant application of their discoveries proves . But science has another function to fulfil , in the storing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ base my appeal to you on the specimen which has this evening been brought before you , whether any system of education at the present day can be deemed even approximately complete , in which the knowledge of Nature is neglected or ignored . ******************** IV . NEW CHEMICAL REACTIONS PRODUCED BY LIGHT . 1868-69. 1 DECOMPOSITION BY LIGHT . MEASURED by their power , not to excite vision , but to produce heat  --  in other words , measured by their absolute energy  --  the ultra-red waves of the sun and of the electric light , as shown in the preceding articles , far transcend the visible . In the domain of chemistry , however , there are numerous cases in which the more powerful waves are ineffectual , while the more minute waves , through what may be called their timeliness of application , are able to produce great effects . A series of these , of a novel and beautiful character , discovered in 1868 , and further illustrated in subsequent years , may be exhibited by subjecting the vapours of volatile liquids to the action of concentrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light . Their investigation led up to the discourse on ' Dust and Disease ' which follows in this volume ; and for this reason some account of them is introduced here . ***** A glass tube 3 feet long and 3 inches wide , which had been frequently employed in my researches on radiant heat , was supported horizontally on two stands . At one end of the tube was placed an electric lamp , the height and position of both being so arranged , that the axis of the tube , and that of the beam issuing from the lamp , were coincident . In the first experiments the two ends of the tube were closed by plates of rock-salt , and subsequently by plates of glass . For the sake of distinction , I call this tube the experimental tube . It was connected with an air-pump , and also with a series of drying and other tubes used for the purification of the air . A number of test-tubes , like F , fig. 2 ( I have used at least fifty of them ) , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped by a cork , through which passed two glass tubes : one of these tubes ( a ) ended immediately below the cork , while the other ( b ) descended to the bottom of the flask , being drawn out at its lower end to an orifice about 0.03 of an inch in diameter . It was found necessary to coat the cork carefully with cement . In the later experiments corks of vulcanised India-rubber were invariably employed . The little flask , thus formed , being partially filled with the liquid whose vapour was to be examined , was introduced into the path of the purified current Of air . The experimental tube being exhausted , and the cock hick cut off the supply of purified air being cautiously turned on , the air entered the flask through the tube b , and escaped by the small orifice at the lower end of into the liquid . Through this it bubbled , loading itself with vapour , after which the mixed air and vapour , passing from the flask by the tube a , entered the experimental tube @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The whole arrangement is shown in fig. 3 , where L represents the electric lamp , ss ' the experimental tube , pp ' the pipe leading to the air-pump , and F the test-tube containing the volatile liquid . The tube tt ' is plugged with cotton-wool intended to intercept the floating matter of the air ; the bent tube T ' contains caustic potash , the tube T sulphuric acid , the one intended to remove the carbonic acid and the other the aqueous vapour of the air . The power of the electric beam to reveal the existence of anything within the experimental tube , or the impurities of the tube itself , is extraordinary . When the experiments is made in a darkened room , a tube which in ordinary daylight appears absolutely clean , is often shown by the present mode of examination to be exceedingly filthy . The following are some of the results obtained with this arrangement : Nitrite of amyl . The vapour of this liquid was in the first instance permitted to enter the experimental tube , while the beam from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the cause of which was then unknown , were observed to form near the place of entry , being afterwards whirled through the tube . The tube being again exhausted , the mixed air and vapour were allowed to enter it in the dark . The slightly convergent beam of the electric light was then sent through the mixture . For a moment the tube was optically empty , nothing whatever being seen within it ; but before a second had elapsed a shower of particles was precipitated on the beam . The cloud thus generated became denser as the light continued to act , slowing at some places vivid iridescence . The lens of the electric lamp was now placed so as to form within the tube a strongly convergent cone of rays . The tube was cleansed and again filled in darkness . When the light was sent through it , the precipitation upon the beam was so rapid and intense that the cone , which a moment before was invisible , flashed suddenly forth like a solid luminous spear . The effect was the same when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diffuse daylight . The cloud , however , which shone with such extraordinary radiance under the electric beam , was invisible in the ordinary light of the laboratory . The quantity of mixed air and vapour within the experimental tube could of course be regulated at pleasure . The rapidity of the action diminished with the attenuation of the vapour . When , for example , the mercurial column associated with the experimental tube was depressed only five inches , the action was not nearly so rapid as when the tube was full . In such cases , however , it was exceedingly interesting to observe , after some seconds of waiting , a thin streamer of delicate bluish-white cloud slowly forming along the axis of the tube , and finally swelling so as to fill it . Fig. 2 . Fig. 3 . When dry oxygen was employed to carry in the vapour the effect was the same as that obtained with air . When dry hydrogen was used as a vehicle , the effect was also the same . The effect , therefore , is not due to any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This was further demonstrated by the deportment of the vapour itself . When it was permitted to enter the experimental tube unmixed with air or any other gas , the effect was substantially the same . Hence the seat of the observed action is the vapour . This action is not to be ascribed to heat . As regards the glass of the experimental tube , and the air within the tube , the beam employed in these experiments was perfectly cold . It had been sifted by passing it through a solution of alum , and through the thick double-convex lens of the lamp . When the unsifted beam of the lamp was employed , the effect was still the same ; the obscure calorific rays did not appear to interfere with the result . My object here being simply to point out to chemists a method of experiments which reveals a new and beautiful series of reactions , I left to them the examination of the products of decomposition . The group of atoms forming the molecule of nitrite of amyl is obviously shaken asunder by certain specific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ products , of which the nitrate of amyl is probably one , being the result of the decomposition . The brown fumes of nitrous acid were seen mingling with the cloud within the experimental tube . The nitrate of amyl , being less volatile than the nitrite , and not being able to maintain itself in the condition of vapour , would be precipitated as a visible cloud along the track of the beam . In the anterior portions of the tube a powerful sifting of the beam by the vapour occurs , which diminishes the chemical action in the posterior portions . In some experiments the precipitated cloud only extended halfway down the tube . When , under these circumstances , the lamp was shifted so as to send the beam through the other end of the tube , copious precipitation occurred there also . Solar light also effects the decomposition of the nitrite-of-amyl vapour . On October 10 , 1868 , I partially darkened a small room in the Royal Institution , into which the sun shone , permitting the light to enter through an open portion of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large plano-convex lens , which formed a fine convergent cone in the dust of the room behind it . The experimental tube was filled in the laboratory , covered with a black cloth , and carried into the partially darkened room . On thrusting one end of the tube into the cone of rays behind the lens , precipitation within the cone was copious and immediate . The vapour at the distant end of the tube was in part shielded by that in front , and was also more feebly acted on through the divergence of the rays . On reversing the tube , a second and similar cone was precipitated . Physical Considerations . I sought to determine the particular portion of the light which produced the foregoing effects . When , previous to entering the experimental tube , the beam was caused to pass through a red glass , the effect was greatly weakened , but not extinguished . This was also the case with various samples of yellow glass . A blue glass being introduced before the removal of the yellow or the red , on taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blue beam . Hence , in this case , the more refrangible rays are the most chemically active . The colour of the liquid nitrite of amyl indicates that this must be the case ; it is a feeble but distinct yellow : in other words , the yellow portion of the beam is most freely transmitted . It is not , however , the transmitted portion of any beam which produces chemical action , but the absorbed portion . Blue , as the complementary colour to yellow , is here absorbed , and hence the more energetic action of the blue rays . This reasoning , however , assumes that the same rays are absorbed by the liquid and its vapour . The assumption is worth testing . A solution of the yellow chromate of potash , the colour of which may be made almost , if not altogether , identical with that of the liquid nitrite of amyl , was found far more effective in stopping the chemical rays than either the red or the yellow glass . But of all substances the liquid nitrite itself is most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A layer one-eighth of an inch in thickness , which scarcely perceptibly affected the luminous intensity , absorbed the entire chemical energy of the concentrated beam of the electric light . The close relation subsisting between a liquid and its vapour , as regards their action upon radiant heat , has been already amply demonstrated . Footnote : ' Phil . Trans. ' 1864 ; ' Heat , a Mode of Motion , ' chap , xii ; and P. 61 of this volume . As regards the nitrite of amyl , this relation is more specific than in the cases hitherto adduced ; for here the special constituent of the beam , which provokes the decomposition of the vapour , is shown to be arrested by the liquid . A question of extreme importance in molecular physics here arises : What is the real mechanism of this absorption , and where is its seat ? Footnote : My attention was very forcibly directed to this subject some years ago by a conversation with my excellent friend Professor Clausius . I figure , as others do , a molecule as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forces , but still capable of motion among themselves . The vapour of the nitrite of amyl is to be regarded as an assemblage of such molecules . The question now before us is this : In the act of absorption , is it the molecules that are effective , or is it their constituent atoms ? Is the vis viva of the intercepted light-waves transferred to the molecule as a whole , or to its constituent parts ? The molecule , as a whole , can only vibrate in virtue of the forces exerted between it and its neighbour molecules . The intensity of these forces , and consequently the rate of vibration , would , in this case , be a Junction of the distance between the molecules . Now the identical absorption of the liquid and of the vaporous nitrite of amyl indicates an identical vibrating period on the part of liquid and vapour , and this , to my mind , amounts to an experimental proof that the absorption occurs in the main within the molecule . For it can hardly be supposed , if the absorption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it could continue to affect waves of the same period after the substance had passed from the vaporous to the liquid state . In point of fact , the decomposition of the nitrite of amyl is itself to some extent an illustration of this internal molecular absorption ; for were the absorption the act of the molecule as a whole , the relative motions of its constituent atoms would remain unchanged , and there would be no mechanical cause for their separation . It is probably the synchronism of the vibrations of one portion of the molecule with the incident waves , that enables the amplitude of those vibrations to augment , until the chain which binds the parts of the molecule together is snapped asunder . I anticipate wide , if not entire , generality for the fact that a liquid and its vapour absorb the same rays . A cell of liquid chlorine would , I imagine , deprive light more effectually of its power of causing chlorine and hydrogen to combine than any other filter of the luminous rays . The rays which give chlorine its colour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are absorbed by the chlorine being really effective rays . A highly sensitive bulb , containing chlorine and hydrogen , in the exact proportions necessary for the formation of hydrochloric acid , was placed at one end of an experimental tube , the beam of the electric lamp being sent through it from the other . The bulb did not explode when the tube was filled with chlorine , while the explosion was violent and immediate when the tube was filled with air . I anticipate for the liquid chlorine an action similar to , but still more energetic than , that exhibited by the gas . If this should prove to be the case , it will favour the view that chlorine itself is molecular and not monatomic . Production of Sky-blue by the Decomposition of Nitrite of Amyl . When the quantity of nitrite vapour is considerable , and the light intense , the chemical action is exceedingly rapid , the particles precipitated being so large as to whiten the luminous beam . Not so , however , when a well-mixed and highly attenuated vapour fills the experimental tube @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the vapour of the nitrite was derived from a portion of its liquid which had been accidentally introduced into the passage through which the dry air flowed into the experimental tube . In this case , the electric beam traversed the tube for several seconds before any action was visible . Decomposition then visibly commenced , and advanced slowly . When the light was very strong , the cloud appeared of a milky blue . When , on the contrary , the intensity was moderate , the blue was pure and deep . In Bruecke 's important experiments on the blue of the sky and the morning and evening red , pure mastic is dissolved in alcohol , and then dropped into water well stirred . When the proportion of mastic to alcohol is correct , the resin is precipitated so finely as to elude the highest microscopic power . By reflected light , such a medium appears bluish , by transmitted light yellowish , which latter colour , by augmenting the quantity of the precipitate , can be caused to pass into orange or red . But the development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar to what takes place in our atmosphere . The blue , moreover , is far purer and more sky-like than that obtained from Bruecke 's turbid medium . Never , even in the skies of the Alps , have I seen a richer or a purer blue than that attainable by a suitable disposition of the light falling upon the precipitated vapour . Iodide of Allyl.  --  Among the liquids hitherto subjected to the concentrated electric light , iodide of allyl , in point of rapidity and intensity of action , comes next to the nitrite of amyl . With the iodide I have employed both oxygen and hydrogen , as well as air , as a vehicle , and found the effect in all cases substantially the same . The cloud-column here was exquisitely beautiful . It revolved round the axis of the decomposing beam ; it was nipped at certain places like an hour-glass , and round the two bells of the glass delicate cloud-filaments twisted themselves in spirals . It also folded itself into convolutions resembling those of shells . In certain conditions of the atmosphere in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pearly lustre ; when hydrogen was made the vehicle of the iodide-of allyl vapour a similar lustre was most exquisitely shown . With a suitable disposition of the light , the purple hue of iodine-vapour came out very strongly in the tube . The remark already made , as to the bearing of the decomposition of nitrite of amyl by light on the question of molecular absorption , applies here also ; for were the absorption the work of the molecule as a whole , the iodine would not be dislodged from the allyl with which it is combined . The non-synchronism of iodine with the waves of obscure heat is illustrated by its marvellous transparency to such heat . May not its synchronism with the waves of light in the present instance be the cause of its divorce from the allyl ? Iodide of Isopropyl.  --  The action of light upon the vapour of this liquid is , at first , more languid than upon iodide of allyl ; indeed many beautiful reactions may be overlooked , in consequence of this languor at the commencement . After some minutes ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grow in density and in beauty as the light continues to act . In every experiments hitherto made with this substance the column of cloud filling the experimental tube , was divided into two distinct parts near the middle of the tube . In one experiments a globe of cloud formed at the centre , from which , right and left , issued an axis uniting the globe with two adjacent cylinders . Both globe and cylinders were animated by a common motion of rotation . As the action continued , paroxysms of motion were manifested ; the various parts of the cloud would rush through each other with sudden violence . During these motions beautiful and grotesque cloud-forms were developed . At some places the nebulous mass would become ribbed so as to resemble the graining of wood ; a longitudinal motion would at times generate in it a series of curved , transverse bands , the retarding influence of the sides the tube causing an appearance resembling , on a small scale , the dirt-bands of the Mer de Glace . In the anterior portion of the tube those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would sprout forth , and grow in a few seconds into perfect flower-like forms . The cloud of iodide of isopropyl had a character Of its own , and differed materially from all others that I had seen . A gorgeous mauve colour was observed in the last twelve inches of the tube ; the vapour of iodine was present , and it may have been the sky-blue scattered by the precipitated particles which , mingling with the purple of the iodine , produced the mauve . As in all other cases here adduced , the effects were proved to be due to the light ; they never occurred in darkness . The forms assumed by some of those actinic clouds , as I propose to call them , in consequence of rotations and other motions , due to differences of temperature , are perfectly astounding . I content myself here with a meagre description of one more of them . The tube being filled with the sensitive mixture , the beam was sent through it , the lens at the same time being so placed as to produce a cone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was visible ; but at the end of this time a faint bluish cloud appeared to hang itself on the most concentrated portion of the beam . Soon afterwards a second cloud was formed five inches farther down the experimental tube . Both clouds were united by a slender cord of the same bluish tint as themselves . As the action of the light continued , the first cloud gradually resolved itself into a series of parallel disks of exquisite delicacy , which rotated round an axis perpendicular to their surfaces , and finally blended to a screw surface with an inclined generatrix . This gradually changed into a filmy funnel , from the narrow end of which the ' cord ' extended to the cloud in advance . The latter also underwent slow but incessant modification . It first resolved itself into a series of strata resembling those of the electric discharge . After a little time , and through changes which it was difficult to follow , both clouds presented the appearance of a series of concentric funnels set one within the other , the interior ones being seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resembled claret-glasses in shape . As many as six funnels were thus concentrically set together , the two series being united by the delicate cord of cloud already referred to . Other cords and Blender tubes were afterwards formed , which coiled themselves in delicate spirals around the funnels . Rendering the light along the connecting-cord more intense , it diminished in thickness and became whiter ; this was a consequence of the enlargement of its particles . The cord finally disappeared , while the funnels melted into two ghost-like films , shaped like parasols . They were barely visible , being of an exceedingly delicate blue tint . They seemed woven of blue air . To compare them with cobweb or with gauze would be to liken them to something infinitely grosser than themselves . In all cases a distant candle-flame , when looked at through the cloud , was sensibly undimmed. 2 . ON THE BLUE COLOUR OF THE SKY , AND THE POLARISATION OF SKYLIGHT . Footnote : In my ' Lectures on Light ' ( Longman ) , the polarisation of light will be found briefly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the communication to the Royal Society of the foregoing brief account of a new Series of Chemical Reactions produced by Light , the experiments upon this subject were continued , the number of substances thus acted on being considerably increased . I now , however , beg to direct attention to two questions glanced at incidentally in the preceding pages  --  the blue colour of the sky , and the polarisation of skylight . Reserving the historic treatment of the subject for a more fitting occasion , I would merely mention now that these questions constitute , in the opinion of our most eminent authorities , the two great standing enigmas of meteorology . Indeed it was the interest manifested in them by Sir John Herschel , in a letter of singular speculative power , addressed to myself , that caused me to enter upon the consideration of these questions so soon . The apparatus with which I work consists , as already stated , of a glass tube about a yard in length , and from 2.5 to 3 inches internal diameter . The vapour to be examined is introduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon it the condensed beam of the electric lamp is permitted to act , until the neutrality or the activity of the substance has been declared . It has hitherto been my aim to render the chemical action of light upon vapours visible . For this purpose substances have been chosen , one at least of whose products of decomposition under light shall have a boiling-point so high , that as soon as the substance is formed it shall be precipitated . By graduating the quantity of the vapour , this precipitation may be rendered of any degree of fineness , forming particles distinguishable by the naked eye , or far beyond the reach of our highest microscopic powers . I have no reason to doubt that particles may be thus obtained , whose diameters constitute but a small fraction of the length of a wave of violet light . In all cases when the vapours of the liquids employed are sufficiently attenuated , no matter what the liquid may be , the visible action commences with the formation of a blue cloud . But here I must guard myself against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The ' cloud ' here referred to is totally invisible in ordinary daylight . To be seen , it requires to be surrounded by darkness , it only being illuminated by a powerful beam of light . This blue cloud differs in many important particulars from the finest ordinary clouds , and might justly have assigned to it an intermediate position between such clouds and true vapour . With this explanation , the term ' cloud , ' or ' incipient cloud , ' or ' actinic cloud , ' as I propose to employ it , can not , I think , be misunderstood . I had been endeavouring to decompose carbonic acid gas by light . A faint bluish cloud , due it may be , or it may not be , to the residue of some vapour previously employed , was formed in the experimental tube . On looking across this cloud through a Nicol 's prism , the line of vision being horizontal , it was found that when the short diagonal of the prism was vertical , the quantity of light reaching the eye was greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plate of tourmaline was held between the eye and the bluish cloud , the quantity of light reaching the eye when the axis of the prism was perpendicular to the axis of the illuminating beam , was greater than when the axes of the crystal and of the beam were parallel to each other . This was the result all round the experimental tube . Causing the crystal of tourmaline to revolve round the tube , with its axis perpendicular to the illuminating beam , the quantity of light that reached the eye was in all its positions a maximum . When the crystallographic axis was parallel to the axis of the beam , the quantity of light transmitted by the crystal was a minimum . From the illuminated bluish cloud , therefore , polarised light was discharged , the direction of maximum polarisation being at right angles to the illuminating beam ; the plane of vibration of the polarised light was perpendicular to the beam . Footnote : This is still an undecided point ; but the probabilities are so much in its favour , and it is in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the mind can rest , that I do not hesitate to employ the phraseology in the text . Thin plates of selenite or of quartz , placed between the Nicol and the actinic cloud , displayed the colours of polarised light , these colours being most vivid when the line of vision was at right angles to the experimental tube . The plate of selenite usually employed was a circle , thinnest at the centre , and augmenting uniformly in thickness from the centre outwards . When placed in its proper position between the Nicol and the cloud , it exhibited a system of splendidly-coloured rings . The cloud here referred to was the first operated upon in the manner described . It may , however , be greatly improved upon by the choice of proper substances , and by the application , in proper quantities , of the substances chosen . Benzol , bisulphide of carbon , nitrite of amyl , nitrite of butyl , iodide of allyl , iodide of isopropyl , and many other substances may be employed . I will take the nitrite of butyl as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with reference to the present question . And here it may be mentioned that a vapour , which when alone , or mixed with air in the experimental tube , resists the action of light , or shows but a feeble result of this action , may , when placed in proximity with another gas or vapour , exhibit vigorous , if not violent action . The case is similar to that of carbonic acid gas , which , diffused in the atmosphere , resists the decomposing action of solar light , but when placed in contiguity with chlorophyl in the leaves of plants , has its molecules shaken asunder . Dry air was permitted to bubble through the liquid nitrite of butyl , until the experimental tube , which had been previously exhausted , was filled with the mixed air and vapour . The visible action of light upon the mixture after fifteen minutes ' exposure was slight . The tube was afterwards filled with half an atmosphere of the mixed air and vapour , and a second half-atmosphere of air which had been permitted to bubble through fresh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mixture , the tube , for a moment , was optically empty . But the pause amounted only to a small fraction of a second , a dense cloud being immediately precipitated upon the beam . This cloud began blue , but the advance to whiteness was so rapid as almost to justify the application of the term instantaneous . The dense cloud , looked at perpendicularly to its axis , showed scarcely any signs of polarisation . Looked at obliquely the polarisation was strong . The experimental tube being again cleansed and exhausted , the mixed air and nitrite-of-butyl vapour was permitted to enter it until the associated mercury column was depressed 1/10 of an inch . In other words , the air and vapour , united , exercised a pressure not exceeding 1/300th of an atmosphere . Air , passed through a solution of hydrochloric acid , was then added , till the mercury column was depressed three inches . The condensed beam of the electric light was passed for some time through this mixture without revealing anything within the tube competent to scatter the light . Soon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the track of the beam , and it continued blue sufficiently long to permit of its thorough examination . The light discharged from the cloud , at right angles to its own length , was at first perfectly polarised . It could be totally quenched by the Nicol . By degrees the cloud became of whitish blue , and for a time the selenite colours , obtained by looking at it normally , were exceedingly brilliant . The direction of maximum polarisation was distinctly at right angles to the illuminating beam . This continued to be the case as long as the cloud maintained a decided blue colour , and even for some time after the blue had changed to whitish blue . But , as the light continued to act , the cloud became coarser and whiter , particularly at its centre , where it at length ceased to discharge polarised light in the direction of the perpendicular , while it continued to do so at both ends . But the cloud which had thus ceased to polarise the light emitted normally , showed vivid selenite colours when looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the texture of the cloud . This point shall receive further illustration subsequently . A blue , equally rich and more durable , was obtained by employing the nitrite-of-butyl vapour in a still more attenuated condition . The instance here cited is representative . In all cases , and with all substances , the cloud formed at the commencement , when the precipitated particles are sufficiently fine , is blue , and it can be made to display a colour rivalling that of the purest Italian sky . In all cases , moreover , this fine blue cloud polarises perfectly the beam which illuminates it , the direction of polarisation enclosing an angle of 90 deg. with the axis of the illuminating beam . It is exceedingly interesting to observe both the perfection and the decay of this polarisation . For ten or fifteen minutes after its first appearance the light from a vividly illuminated actinic cloud , looked at perpendicularly , is absolutely quenched by a Nicol 's prism with its longer diagonal vertical . But as the sky-blue is gradually rendered impure by the growth of the particles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be formed  --  the polarisation begins to decay , a portion of the light passing through the prism in all its positions . which passes , when the Nicol is in its position of minimum transmission , is of a gorgeous blue , the whiter light of the cloud being extinguished . Footnote : This shows that particles too large to polarise the blue , polarise perfectly light of lower refrangibility . When the cloud texture has become sufficiently coarse to approximate to that of ordinary clouds , the rotation of the Nicol ceases to have any sensible effect on the quantity of light discharged normally . The perfection of the polarisation , in a direction perpendicular to the illuminating beam , is also illustrated by the following experiments : A Nicol 's prism , large enough to embrace the entire beam of the electric lamp , was placed between the lamp and the experimental tube . A few bubbles of air , carried through the liquid nitrite of butyl , were introduced into the tube , and they were followed by about three inches ( measured by the mercurial gauge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sending the polarised beam through the tube , I placed myself in front of it , my eye being on a level with its axis , my assistant occupying a similar position behind the tube . The short diagonal of the large Nicol was in the first instance vertical , the plane of vibration of the emergent beam being therefore also vertical . As the light continued to act , a superb blue cloud , visible to both my assistant and myself , was slowly formed . But this cloud , so deep and rich when looked at from the positions mentioned , utterly disappeared when looked at vertically downwards , or vertically upwards . Reflection from the cloud was not possible in these directions . When the large Nicol was slowly turned round its axis , the eye of the observer being on the level of the beam , and the line of vision perpendicular to it , entire extinction of the light emitted horizontally occurred when the longer diagonal of the large Nicol was vertical . But now a vivid blue cloud was seen when looked at downwards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contemplated making on my own account , was first definitely suggested by a remark in a letter addressed to me by Professor Stokes . As regards the polarisation of skylight , the greatest stumbling-block has hitherto been , that , in accordance with the law of Brewster , which makes the index of refraction the tangent of the polarising angle , the reflection which produces perfect polarisation would require to be made in air upon air ; and indeed this led many of our most eminent men , Brewster himself among the number , to entertain the idea of aerial molecular reflection . Footnote : ' The cause of the polarisation is evidently a reflection of the sun 's light upon something . The question is on what ? Were the angle of maximum polarisation 76 deg. , we should look to water or ice as the reflecting body , however inconceivable the existence in a cloudless atmosphere and a hot summer 's day of unevaporated molecules ( particles ? ) of water . But though we were once of this opinion , careful observation has satisfied us that 90 deg. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that therefore whatever be the body on which the light has been reflected , if polarised by a single reflection , the polarising angle must be 45 deg. , and the index of refraction , which is the tangent of that angle , unity ; in other words , the reflection would require to be made in air upon air ! ' ( Sir John Herschel , ' Meteorology , ' par . 233 . ) Any particles , if small enough , will produce both the colour and the polarisation of the sky . But is the existence of small water-particles on a hot summer 's day in the higher regions of our atmosphere inconceivable ? It is to be remembered that the oxygen and nitrogen of the air behave as a vacuum to radiant heat , the exceedingly attenuated vapour of the higher atmosphere being therefore in practical contact with the cold of space . I have , however , operated upon substances of widely different refractive indices , and therefore of very different polarising angles as ordinarily defined , but the polarisation of the beam , by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolutely independent of the polarising angle . The law of Brewster does not apply to matter in this condition , and it rests with the undulatory theory to explain why . Whenever the precipitated particles are sufficiently fine , no matter what the substance forming the particles may be , the direction of maximum polarisation is at right angles to the illuminating beam , the polarising angle for matter in this condition being invariably 45 deg .. Suppose our atmosphere surrounded by an envelope impervious to light , but with an aperture on the sunward side through which a parallel beam of solar light could enter and traverse the atmosphere . Surrounded by air not directly illuminated , the track of such a beam would resemble that of the parallel beam of the electric lamp through an incipient cloud . The sunbeam would be blue , and it would discharge laterally light in precisely the same condition as that discharged by the incipient cloud . In fact , the azure revealed by such a beam would be to all intents and purposes that which I have called a ' blue cloud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to all intents and purposes , an artificial sky . ' Footnote : The opinion of Sir John Herschel , connecting the polarisation and the blue colour of the sky , is verified by the foregoing results . ' The more the subject the polarisation of skylight is considered , ' writes this eminent philosopher , ' the more it will be found beset with difficulties , and its explanation when arrived at will probably be found to carry with it that of the blue colour of the sky itself , and of the great quantity of light it actually does send down to us . ' ' We may observe , too , ' he adds , ' that it is only where the purity of the sky is most absolute that the polarisation is developed in its highest degree , and that where there is the slightest perceptible tendency to cirrus it is materially impaired . ' This applies word for word to our ' incipient clouds . ' But , as regards the polarisation of the sky , we know that not only is the direction of maximum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beams , but that at certain angular distances , probably variable ones , from the sun , ' neutral points , ' or points of no polarisation , exist , on both sides of which the planes of atmospheric polarisation are at right angles to each other . I have made various observations upon this subject which are reserved for the present ; but , pending the more complete examination of the question , the following facts bearing upon it may be submitted . The parallel beam employed in these experiments tracked its way through the laboratory air , exactly as sunbeams are seen to do in the dusty air of London . I have reason to believe that a great portion of the matter thus floating in the laboratory air consists of organic particles , which are capable of imparting a perceptibly bluish tint to the air . These also showed , though far less vividly , all the effects of polarisation obtained with the incipient clouds . The light discharged laterally from the track of the illuminating beam was polarised , though not perfectly , the direction of maximum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all points of the beam , moreover , throughout its entire length , the light emitted normally was in the same state of polarisation . Keeping the positions of the Nicol and the selenite constant , the same colours were observed throughout the entire beam , when the line of vision was perpendicular to its length . The horizontal column of air , thus illuminated , was 18 feet long , and could therefore be looked at very obliquely . I placed myself near the end of the beam , as it issued from the electric lamp , and , looking through the Nicol and selenite more and more obliquely at the beam , observed the colours fading until they disappeared . Augmenting the obliquity the colours appeared once more , but they were now complementary to the former ones . Hence this beam , like the sky , exhibited a neutral point , on opposite sides of which the light was polarised in planes at right angles to each other . Thinking that the action observed in the laboratory might be caused , in some way , by the vaporous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ removed to a room at the top of the Royal Institution . The track of the beam was seen very finely in the air of this room , a length of 14 or 15 feet being attainable . This beam exhibited all the effects observed with the beam in the laboratory . Even the uncondensed electric light falling on the floating matter showed , though faintly , the effects of polarisation . When the air was so sifted as to entirely remove the visible floating matter , it no longer exerted any sensible action upon the light , but behaved like a vacuum . The light is scattered and polarised by particles , not by molecules or atoms . By operating upon the fumes of chloride of ammonium , the smoke of brown paper , and tobacco-smoke , I had varied and confirmed in many ways those experiments on neutral points , when my attention was drawn by Sir Charles Wheatstone to an important observation communicated to the Paris Academy in 1860 by Professor Govi , of Turin . Footnote : Comptes Rendus , ' tome li , pp. 360 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beam of light sent through a room in which were successively diffused the smoke of incense , and tobacco-smoke . His first brief communication stated the fact of polarisation by such smoke ; but in his second communication he announced the discovery of a neutral point in the beam , at the opposite sides of which the light was polarised in planes at right angles to each other . But unlike my observations on the laboratory air , and unlike the action of the sky , the direction of maximum polarisation in M. Govi 's experiments enclosed a very small angle with the axis of the illuminating beam . The question was left in this condition , and I am not aware that M. Govi or any other investigator has pursued it further . I had noticed , as before stated , that as the clouds formed in the experimental tube became denser , the polarisation of the light discharged at right angles to the beam became weaker , the direction of maximum polarisation becoming oblique to the beam . Experiments on the fumes of chloride of ammonium gave me also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not constant , but that it varied with the density of the illuminated fumes . The examination of these questions led to the following new and remarkable results : The laboratory being well filled with the fumes of incense , and sufficient time being allowed for their uniform diffusion , the electric beam was sent through the smoke . From the track of the beam polarised light was discharged ; but the direction of maximum polarisation , instead of being perpendicular , now enclosed an angle of only 12 deg. or 13 deg. with the axis of the beam . A neutral point , with complementary effects at opposite sides of it , was also exhibited by the beam . The angle enclosed by the axis of the beam , and a line drawn from the neutral point to the observer 's eye , measured in the first instance 66 deg .. The windows of the laboratory were now opened for some minutes , a portion of the incense-smoke being permitted to escape . On again darkening the room and turning on the light , the line of vision to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ axis of the beam , an angle of 63 deg .. The windows were again opened for a few minutes , more of the smoke being permitted to escape . Measured as before , the angle referred to was found to be 54 deg .. This process was repeated three additional times the neutral point was found to recede lower and lower down the beam , the angle between a line drawn from the eye to the neutral point and the axis of the beam falling successively from 54 deg. to 49 deg. , 43 deg. and 33 deg .. The distances , roughly measured , of the neutral point from the lamp , corresponding to the foregoing series of observations , were these : 1st observation 2 feet 2 inches . 2nd observation 2 feet 6 inches . 3rd observation 2 feet 10 inches . 4th observation 3 feet 2 inches . 5th observation 3 feet 7 inches . 6th observation 4 feet 6 inches . At the end of this series of experiments the direction of maximum polarisation had again become normal to the beam . The laboratory was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successive experiments , corresponding to five different densities of the gunpowder-smoke , the angles enclosed between the line of vision to the neutral point and the axis of the beam , were 63 degrees , 50 deg. , 47 deg. , 42 deg. , and 38 deg. respectively . After the clouds of gunpowder had cleared away , the laboratory was filled with the fumes of common resin , rendered so dense as to be very irritating to the lungs . The direction of maximum polarisation enclosed , in this case , an angle of 12 deg. , or thereabouts , with the axis of the beam . Looked at , as in the former instances , from a position near the electric lamp , no neutral point was observed throughout the entire extent of the beam . When this beam was looked at normally through the selenite and Nicol , the ring-system , though not brilliant , was distinct . Keeping the eye upon the plate of selenite , and the line of vision perpendicular , the windows were opened , the blinds remaining undrawn . The resinous fumes slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paler . It finally disappeared . Continuing to look in the same direction , the rings revived , but now the colours were complementary to the former ones . The neutral point had passed me in its motion down the beam , consequent upon the attenuation of the fumes of resin . With the fumes of chloride of ammonium substantially the same results were obtained . Sufficient , however , has been here stated to illustrate the variability of the position of the neutral point . Footnote : Brewster has proved the variability of the position of the neutral point for skylight with the sun 's altitude , a result obviously connected with the foregoing experiments . By a puff of tobacco-smoke , or of condensed steam , blown into the illuminated beam , the brilliancy of the selenite colours may be greatly enhanced . But with different clouds two different effects are produced . Let the ring-system observed in the common air be brought to its maximum strength , and then let an attenuated cloud of chloride of ammonium be thrown into the beam at the point looked at ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the character of the polarisation remains unchanged . This is also the case when phosphorus , or sulphur , is burned underneath the beam , so as to cause the fine particles of phosphorus or of sulphur to rise into the light . With the sulphur-fumes the brilliancy of the colours is exceedingly intensified ; but in none of these cases is there any change in the character of the polarisation . But when a puff of the fumes of hydrochloric acid , hydriodic acid , or nitric acid is thrown into the beam , there is a complete reversal of the selenite tints . Each of these clouds twists the plane of polarisation 90 deg. , causing the centre of the ring-system to change from black to white , and the rings themselves to emit their complementary colours . Footnote : Sir John Herschel suggested to me that this change of the polarisation from positive to negative may indicate a change from polarisation by reflection to polarisation by refraction . This thought repeatedly occurred to me while looking at the effects ; but it will require much following up before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in them sufficiently numerous to polarise sensibly the light , and very beautiful effects may be obtained by simple artificial devices . When , for example , a cell of distilled water is placed in front of the electric lamp , and a thin slice of the beam is permitted to pass through it , scarcely any polarised light is discharged , and scarcely any colour produced with a plate of selenite . But if a bit of soap be agitated in the water above the beam , the moment the infinitesimal particles reach the light the liquid sends forth laterally almost perfectly polarised light ; and if the selenite be employed , vivid colours flash into existence . A still more brilliant result is obtained with mastic dissolved in a great excess of alcohol . The selenite rings , in fact , constitute an extremely delicate test as to the collective quantity of individually invisible particles in a liquid . Commencing with distilled water , for example , a thick slice of light is necessary to make the polarisation of its suspended particles sensible . A much thinner slice suffices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mastic , a slice too thin to produce any sensible effect with most other liquids , suffices to bring out vividly the selenite colours . 3 . THE SKY OF THE ALPS . The vision of an object always implies a differential action on the retina of the observer . The object is distinguished from surrounding space by its excess or defect of light in relation to that space . By altering the illumination , either of the object itself or of its environment , we alter the appearance of the object . Take the case of clouds floating in the atmosphere with patches of blue between them . Anything that changes the illumination of either alters the appearance of both , that appearance depending , as stated , upon differential action . Now the light of the sky , being polarised , may , as the reader of the foregoing pages knows , be in great part quenched by a Nicol 's prism , while the light of a common cloud , being unpolarised , can not be thus extinguished . Hence the possibility of very remarkable variations , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really changed , but also in the aspect of the clouds , which have that firmament as a background . It is possible , for example , to choose clouds of such a depth of shade that when the Nicol quenches the light behind them , they shall vanish , being undistinguishable from the residual dull tint which outlives the extinction of the brilliancy of the sky . A cloud less deeply shaded , but still deep enough , when viewed with the naked eye , to appear dark on a bright ground , is suddenly changed to a white cloud on a dark ground by the quenching of the light behind it . When a reddish cloud at sunset chances to float in the region of maximum polarisation , the quenching of the surrounding light causes it to flash with a brighter crimson . Last Easter eve the Dartmoor sky , which had just been cleansed by a snow-storm , wore a very wild appearance . Round the horizon it was of steely brilliancy , while reddish cumuli and cirri floated southwards . When the sky was quenched behind them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; they brightened like a fire . In the Alps we have the most magnificent examples of crimson clouds and snows , so that the effects just referred to may be here studied under the best possible conditions . On August 23 , 1869 , the evening Alpenglow was very fine , though it did not reach its maximum depth and splendour . The side of the Weisshorn seen from the Bel Alp , being turned from the sun , was tinted mauve ; but I wished to observe one of the rose-coloured buttresses of the mountain . Such a one was visible from a point a few hundred feet above the hotel . The Matterhorn also , though for the most part in shade , had a crimson projection , while a deep ruddy red lingered along its western shoulder . Four distinct peaks and buttresses of the Dom , in addition to its dominant head  --  all covered with pure snow  --  were reddened by the light of sunset . The shoulder of the Alphubel was similarly coloured , while the great mass of the Fletschorn was all a-glow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leone . Looking at the Weisshorn through the Nicol , the glow of its protuberance was strong or weak according to the position of the prism . The summit also underwent striking changes . In one position of the prism it exhibited a pale white against a dark background ; in the rectangular position it was a dark mauve against a light background . The red of the Matterhorn changed in a similar manner ; but the whole mountain also passed through wonderful changes of definition . The air at the time was filled with a silvery haze , in which the Matterhorn almost disappeared . This could be wholly quenched by the Nicol , and then the mountain sprang forth with astonishing solidity and detachment from the surrounding air . The changes of the Dom were still more wonderful . A vast amounts of light could be removed from the sky behind it , for it occupied the position of maximum polarisation . By a little practice with the Nicol it was easy to render the extinction of the light , or its restoration , almost instantaneous . When the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the summit of the Dom , together with the shoulder of the Alphubel , glowed as if set suddenly on fire . This was immediately dimmed by turning the Nicol through an angle of 90 deg .. It was not the stoppage of the light of the sky behind the mountains alone which produced this startling effect ; the air between them and me was highly opalescent , and the quenching of this intermediate glare augmented remarkably the distinctness of the mountains . On the morning of August 24 similar effects were finely shown . At 10 A.M. all three mountains , the Dom , the Matterhorn , and the Weisshorn , were powerfully affected by the Nicol . But in this instance also , the line drawn to the Dom being very nearly perpendicular to the solar beams , the effects on this mountain were most striking . The grey summit of the Matterhorn , at the same time , could scarcely be distinguished from the opalescent haze around it ; but when the Nicol quenched the haze , the summit became instantly isolated , and stood out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the production of these effects the only things changed are the sky behind , and the luminous haze in front of the mountains ; that these are changed because the light emitted from the sky and from the haze is plane polarised light , and that the light from the snows and from the mountains , being sensibly unpolarised , is not directly affected by the Nicol . It will also be understood that it is not the interposition of the haze as an opaque body that renders the mountains indistinct , but that it is the light of the haze which dims and bewilders the eye , and thus weakens the definition of objects seen through it . These results have a direct bearing upon what artists call ' aerial perspective . ' As we look from the summit of Mont Blanc , or from a lower elevation , at the serried crowd of peaks , especially if the mountains be darkly coloured  --  covered with pines , for example  --  every peak and ridge is separated from the mountains behind it by a thin blue haze which renders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When this haze is regarded through the Nicol perpendicular to the sun 's rays , it is in many cases wholly quenched , because the light which it emits in this direction is wholly polarised . When this happens , aerial perspective is abolished , and mountains very differently distant appear to rise in the same vertical plane . Close to the Bel Alp for instance , is the gorge of the Massa , and beyond the gorge is a high ridge darkened by pines . This ridge may be projected upon the dark slopes at the opposite side of the Rhone valley , and between both we have the blue haze referred to , throwing the distant mountains far away . But at certain hours of the day the haze may be quenched , and then the Massa ridge and the mountains beyond the Rhone seem almost equally distant from the eye . The one appears , as it were , a vertical continuation of the other . The haze varies with the temperature and humidity of the atmosphere . At certain times and places it is almost as blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the attention must be withdrawn from the mountains and from the trees which cover them . In point of fact , the haze is a piece of more or less perfect sky ; it is produced in the same manner , and is subject to the same laws , as the firmament itself . We live in the sky , not under it . These points were further elucidated by the deportment of the selenite , plate , with which the readers of the foregoing pages are so well acquainted . On some of the sunny days of August the haze in the valley of the Rhone , as looked at from the Bel Alp , was very remarkable . Towards evening the sky above the mountains opposite to my place of observation yielded a series of the most splendidly-coloured iris-rings ; but on lowering the selenite until it had the darkness of the pines at the opposite side of the Rhone ' valley , instead of the darkness of space , as a background , the colours were not much diminished in brilliancy . I should estimate the distance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opposite mountain , at nine miles ; so that a body of air of this thickness can , under favourable circumstances , produce chromatic effects of polarisation almost as vivid as those produced by the sky itself . Again : the light of a landscape , as of most other things , consists of two parts ; the one , coming purely from superficial reflection , is always of the same colour as the light which falls upon the landscape ; the other part reaches us from a certain depth within the objects which compose the landscape , and it is this portion of the total light which gives these objects their distinctive colours . The white light of the sun enters all substances to a certain depth , and is partly ejected by internal reflection ; each distinct substance absorbing and reflecting the light , in accordance with the laws of its own molecular constitution . Thus the solar light is sifted by the landscape , which appears in such colours and variations of colour as , after the sifting process , reach the observer 's eye . Thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the pine , never comes to us alone , but is always mingled with an amounts of light derived from superficial reflection . A certain hard brilliancy is conferred upon the woods and meadows by this superficially-reflected light . Under certain circumstances , it may be quenched by a Nicol 's prism , and we then obtain the true colour of the grass and foliage . Trees and meadows , thus regarded , exhibit a richness and softness of tint which they never show as long as the superficial light is permitted to mingle with the true interior emission . The needles of the pines show this effect very well , large-leaved trees still better ; while a glimmering field of maize exhibits the most extraordinary variations when looked at through the rotating Nicol . Thoughts and questions like those here referred to took me , in August 1869 , to the top of the Aletschhorn . The effects described in the foregoing paragraphs were for the most part reproduced on the summit of the mountain . I scanned the whole of the sky with my Nicol . Both alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the perpendicular to the solar beams to be the direction of maximum polarisation . But at no portion of the firmament was the polarisation complete . The artificial sky produced in the experiments recorded in the preceding pages could , in this respect , be rendered far more perfect than the natural one ; while the gorgeous ' residual blue ' which makes its appearance when the polarisation of the artificial sky ceases to be perfect , was strongly contrasted with the lack-lustre hue which , in the case of the firmament , outlived the extinction of the brilliancy . With certain substances , however , artificially treated , this dull residue may also be obtained . All along the arc from the Matterhorn to Mont Blanc the light of the sky immediately above the mountains was powerfully acted upon by the Nicol . In some cases the variations of intensity were astonishing . I have already said that a little practice enables the observer to shift the Nicol from one position to another so rapidly as to render the alternative extinction and restoration of the light immediate . When this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the alternations of light and darkness resembled the play of sheet lightning behind the mountains . There was an element of awe connected with the suddenness with which the mighty masses , ranged along the line referred to , changed their aspect and definition under the operation of the prism . ***** The physical reason of the blueness of both natural and artificial skies is , I trust , correctly given in the essay on the Scientific use of the Imagination published in the second volume of these Fragments . ******************** V. ON DUST AND DISEASE . Footnote : A discourse delivered before the Royal Institution of Great Britain , January 21 , 1870 . Experiments on Dusty Air . SOLAR light , in passing through a dark room , reveals its track by illuminating the dust floating in the air . ' The sun , ' says Daniel Culverwell , ' discovers atomes , though they be invisible by candle-light , and makes them dance naked in his beams . ' In my researches on the decomposition of vapours by light , I was compelled to remove these ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the space containing the vapours should embrace no visible thing  --  that no substance capable of scattering light in the slightest sensible degree should , at the outset of an experiments , be found in the wide ' experimental tube ' in which the vapour was enclosed . For a long time I was troubled by the appearance there of floating matter , which , though invisible in diffuse daylight , was at once revealed by a powerfully condensed beam . Two U-tubes were placed in succession in the path of the air , before it entered the liquid whose vapour was to be carried into the experimental tube . One of the U-tubes contained fragments of marble wetted with a strong solution of caustic potash ; the other , fragments of glass wetted with concentrated sulphuric acid which , while yielding no vapour of its own , powerfully absorbs the aqueous vapour of the air . Footnote : The apparatus is figured in Fig. 3 . To my astonishment , the air of the Royal Institution , sent through these tubes at a rate sufficiently slow to dry it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experimental tube a considerable amounts of mechanically suspended matter , which was illuminated when the beam passed through the tube . The effect was substantially the same when the air was permitted to bubble through the liquid acid , and through the solution of potash . I tried to intercept this floating matter in various ways ; and on October 5 , 1868 , prior to sending the air through the drying apparatus , it was carefully permitted to pass over the tip of a spirit-lamp flame . The floating matter no longer appeared , having been burnt up by the flame . It was therefore organic matter . I was by no means prepared for this result ; having previously thought that the dust of our air was , in great part , inorganic and non-combustible . Footnote : According to an analysis kindly furnished to me by Dr. Percy , the dust collected from the walls of the British Museum contains fully 50 per cent . of inorganic matter . I have every confidence in the results of this distinguished chemist ; they show that the floating dust of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heavier matter . As bearing directly upon this point I may quote the following passage from Pasteur : ' Mais ici se presente une remarque : la poussiere que Pon trouve a la surface de tous les corps est soumise constamment a des courants d'air , qui doivent soulever des particules les plus legeres , au nombre desquelles se trouvent , sans doute , de preference les corpuscules organises , oeufs ou spores , moins lourds generalement que les particules minerales . ' I had constructed a small gas-furnace , now much employed by chemists , containing a platinum tube , which could be heated to vivid redness . Footnote : Pasteur was , I believe , the first to employ such a tube . The tube contained a roll of platinum gauze , which , while it permitted the air to pass through it , ensured the practical contact of the dust with the incandescent metal . The air of the laboratory was permitted to enter the experimental tube , sometimes through the cold , and sometimes through the heated , tube of platinum . In the first column @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of air operated on is expressed by the depression of the mercury gauge of the air-pump . In the second column the condition of the platinum tube is mentioned , and in the third the state of the air in the experimental tube . Quantity of air State of platinum tube State of experimental tube 15 inches Cold Full of particles . 30 inches Red-hot Optically empty . The phrase ' optically empty ' shows that when the conditions of perfect combustion were present , the floating matter totally disappeared . ***** In a cylindrical beam , which strongly illuminated the dust of the laboratory , I placed an ignited spirit-lamp . Mingling with the flame , and round its rim , were seen curious wreaths of darkness resembling an intensely black smoke . On placing the flame at some distance below the beam , the same dark masses stormed upwards . They were blacker than the blackest smoke ever seen issuing from the funnel of a steamer ; and their resemblance to smoke was so perfect as to lead the most practised observer to conclude that the apparently pure flame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intensity to reveal its clouds of liberated carbon . But is the blackness smoke ? This question presented itself in a moment and was thus answered : A red-hot poker was placed underneath the beam : from it the black wreaths also ascended . A large hydrogen flame was next employed , and it produced those whirling masses of darkness , far more copiously than either the spirit-flame or poker . Smoke was therefore out of the question . Footnote : In none of the public rooms of the United States where I had the honour to lecture was this experiment made . The organic dust was too scanty . Certain rooms in England  --  the Brighton Pavilion , for example  --  also lack the necessary conditions . What , then , was the blackness ? It was simply that of stellar space ; that is to say , blackness resulting from the absence from the track of the beam of all matter competent to scatter its light . When the flame was placed below the beam the floating matter was destroyed in situ ; and the air , freed from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the illuminated particles , and substituted for their light the darkness due to its own perfect transparency . Nothing could more forcibly illustrate the invisibility of the agent which renders all things visible . The beam crossed , unseen , the black chasm formed by the transparent air , while , at both sides of the gap , the thick-strewn particles shone out like a luminous solid under the powerful illumination . It is not , however , necessary to burn the particles to produce a stream of darkness . Without actual combustion , currents may be generated which shall displace the floating matter , and appear dark amid the surrounding brightness . I noticed this effect first on placing a red-hot copper ball below the beam , and permitting it to remain there until its temperature had fallen below that of boiling water . The dark currents , though much enfeebled , were still produced . They may also be produced by a flask filled with hot water . To study this effect a platinum wire was stretched across the beam , the two ends of the wire being connected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regulate the strength of the current a rheostat was placed in the circuit . Beginning with a feeble current the temperature of the wire was gradually augmented ; but long before it reached the heat of ignition , a flat stream of air rose from it , which when looked at edgeways appeared darker and sharper than one of the blackest lines of Fraunhofer in the purified spectrum . Right and left of this dark vertical band the floating matter rose upwards , bounding definitely the non-luminous stream of air . What is the explanation ? Simply this : The hot wire rarefied the air in contact with it , but it did not equally lighten the floating matter . The convection current of pure air therefore passed upwards among the inert particles , dragging them after it right and left , but forming between them an impassable black partition . This elementary experiments enables us to render an account of the dark currents produced by bodies at a temperature below that of combustion . But when the platinum wire is intensely heated , the floating matter is not only displaced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inches long through the air of an ordinary glass shade resting on cotton-wool , which also surrounded the rim . The wire being raised to a white heat by an electric current , the air expanded , and some of it was forced through the cotton-wool . When the current was interrupted , and the air within the shade cooled , the returning air did not carry motes along with it , being filtered by the wool . At the beginning of this experiments the shade was charged with floating matter ; at the end of half an hour it was optically empty . On the wooden base of a cubical glass shade , a cubic foot in volume , upright supports were fixed , and from one support to the other 38 inches of platinum wire were stretched in four parallel lines . The ends of the platinum wire were soldered to two stout copper wires which passed through the base of the shade and could be connected with a battery . As in the last experiments the shade rested upon cotton-wool . A beam sent through the shade revealed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to whiteness . In five minutes there was a sensible diminution of the matter , and in ten minutes it was totally consumed . Oxygen , hydrogen , nitrogen , carbonic acid , so prepared as to exclude all floating particles , produce , when poured or blown into the beam , the darkness of stellar space . Coal-gas does the same . An ordinary glass shade , placed in the air with its mouth downwards , permits the track of the beam to be seen crossing it . When coal-gas or hydrogen is allowed to enter the shade by a tube reaching to its top , the gas gradually fills the shade from above downwards . As soon as it occupies the space crossed by the beam , the luminous track is abolished . Lifting the shade so as to bring the common boundary of gas and air above the beam , the track flashes forth . After the shade is full , if it be inverted , the pure gas passes upwards like a black smoke among the illuminated particles . The Germ Theory of Contagious Disease . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the air ; and the wonder is , not that we should suffer occasionally from its presence , but that so small a portion of it , and even that but rarely diffused over large areas , should appear to be deadly to man . And what is this portion ? It was some time ago the current belief that epidemic diseases generally were propagated by a kind of malaria , which consisted of organic matter in a state of motor-decay ; that when such matter was taken into the body through the lungs , skin , or stomach , it had the power of spreading there the destroying process by which itself had been assailed . Such a power was visibly exerted in the case of yeast . A little leaven was seen to leaven the whole lump  --  a mere speck of matter , in this supposed state of decomposition , being apparently competent to propagate indefinitely its own decay . Why should not a bit of rotten malaria act in a similar manner within the human frame ? In 1836 a very wonderful reply was given to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovered the yeast-plant  --  a living organism , which when placed in a proper medium feeds , grows , and reproduces itself , and in this way carries on the process which we name fermentation . By this striking discovery fermentation was connected with organic growth . Schwann , of Berlin , discovered the yeast-plant independently about the same time ; and in February , 1837 , he also announced the important result , that when a decoction of meat is effectually screened from ordinary air , and supplied solely with calcined air , putrefaction never sets in . Putrefaction , therefore , he affirmed to be caused , not by the air , but by something which could be destroyed by a sufficiently high temperature . The results of Schwann were confirmed by the independent experiments of Helmholtz , Ure , and Pasteur , while other methods , pursued by Schultze , and by Schroeder and Dusch , led to the same result . But as regards fermentation , the minds of chemists , influenced probably by the great authority of Gay-Lussac , fell back upon the old notion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the living yeast-plant , but the dead or dying parts of it , which , assailed by oxygen , produced the fermentation . Pasteur , however , proved the real ' ferments , ' mediate or immediate , to be organised beings which find in the reputed ferments their necessary food . Side by side with these researches and discoveries , and fortified by them and others , has run the germ theory of epidemic disease . The notion was expressed by Kircher , and favoured by Linnaeus , that epidemic diseases may be due to germs which float in the atmosphere , enter the body , and produce disturbance by the development within the body of parasitic life . The strength of this theory consists in the perfect parallelism of the phenomena of contagious disease with those of life . As a planted acorn gives birth to an oak , competent to produce a whole crop of acorns , each gifted with the power of reproducing its parent tree ; and as thus from a single seedling a whole forest may spring ; so , it is contended , these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shake abroad new germs , which , meeting in the human body their proper food and temperature , finally take possession of whole populations . There is nothing to my knowledge in pure chemistry which resembles the power of propagation and self-multiplication possessed by the matter which produces epidemic disease . If you sow wheat you do not get barley ; if you sow small-pox you do not get scarlet-fever , but small-pox indefinitely multiplied , and nothing else . The matter of each contagious disease reproduces itself as rigidly as if it were ( as Miss Nightingale puts it ) dog or cat . Parasitic Diseases of Silkworms . Pasteur 's Researches . It is admitted on all hands that some diseases are the product of parasitic growth . Both in man and in lower creatures , the existence of such diseases has been demonstrated . I am enabled to lay before you an account of an epidemic of this kind , thoroughly investigated and successfully combated by M. Pasteur . For fifteen years a plague had raged among the silkworms of France . They had sickened and died in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furnished only a fraction of the normal quantity of silk . In 1853 the silk culture of France produced a revenue of one hundred and thirty millions of francs . During the twenty previous years the revenue had doubled itself , and no doubt was entertained as to its further augmentation . The weight of the cocoons produced in 1853 was 26,000,000 kilogrammes ; in 1865 it had fallen to 4,000,000 , the fall entailing , in a single year , a loss of 100,000,000 francs . The country chiefly smitten by this calamity happened to be that of the celebrated chemist Dumas , now perpetual secretary of the French Academy of Sciences . He turned to his friend , colleague , and pupil , Pasteur , and besought him , with an earnestness which the circumstances rendered almost personal , to undertake the investigation of the malady . Pasteur at this time had never seen a silkworm , and he urged his inexperience in reply to his friend . But Dumas knew too well the qualities needed for such an enquiry to accept Pasteur 's reason for declining it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prix extreme a voir votre attention fixee sur la question qui interesse mon pauvre pays ; la misere surpasse tout ce que vous pouvez imaginer . ' Pamphlets about the plague had been showered upon the public , the monotony of waste paper being broken , at rare intervals , by a more or less useful publication . ' The Pharmacopoeia of the Silkworm , ' wrote M. Cornalia in 1860 , ' is now as complicated as that of man . Gases , liquids , and solids have been laid under contribution . From chlorine to sulphurous acid , from nitric acid to rum , from sugar to sulphate of quinine ,  --  all has been invoked in behalf of this unhappy insect . ' The helpless cultivators , moreover , welcomed with ready trustfulness every new remedy , if only pressed upon them with sufficient hardihood . It seemed impossible to diminish their blind confidence in their blind guides . In 1863 the French Minister of Agriculture signed an agreement to pay 500,000 francs for the use of a remedy , which its promoter declared to be infallible . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and found perfectly useless . In no single instance was it successful . It was under these circumstances that M. Pasteur , yielding to the entreaties of his friend , betook himself to Alais in the beginning of June , 1865 . As regards silk husbandry , this was the most important department in France , and it was the most sorely smitten by the plague . The silkworm had been previously attacked by muscardine , a disease proved by Bassi to be caused by a vegetable parasite . This malady was propagated annually by the parasitic spores . Wafted by winds they often sowed the disease in places far removed from the centre of infection . Muscardine is now said to be very rare , a deadlier malady having taken its place . This new disease is characterised by the black spots which cover the silkworms ; hence the name pebrine , first applied to the plague by M. de Quatrefages , and adopted by Pasteur. pebrine declares itself in the stunted and unequal growth of the worms , in the languor of their movements , in their fastidiousness as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course of discovery as regards the epidemic is this : In 1849 Guerin Meneville noticed in the blood of silkworms vibratory corpuscles , which he supposed from their motions to be endowed with independent life . Filippi , however , showed that the motion of the corpuscles was the well-known Brownian motion ; but he committed the error of supposing the corpuscles to be normal to the life of the insect . Possessing the power of indefinite self-multiplication , they are really the cause of its mortality  --  the form and substance of its disease . This was well described by Cornalia ; while Lebert and Frey subsequently found the corpuscles not only in the blood , but in all the tissues of the insect . Osimo , in 1857 , discovered them in the eggs ; and on this observation Vittadiani founded , in 1859 , a practical method of distinguishing healthy from diseased eggs . The test often proved fallacious , and it was never extensively applied . These living corpuscles take possession of the intestinal canal , and spread thence throughout the body of the worm . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ automatically through the motions of spinning , without any material to work upon . Its organs , instead of being filled with the clear viscous liquid of the silk , are packed to distension by the corpuscles . On this feature of the plague Pasteur fixed his entire attention . The cycle of the silkworm 's life is briefly this : From the fertile egg comes the little worm , which grows , and casts its skin . This process of moulting is repeated two or three times at intervals during the life of the insect . After the last moulting the worm climbs the brambles placed to receive it , and spins among them its cocoon . It passes thus into a chrysalis ; the chrysalis becomes a moth , and the moth , when liberated , lays the eggs which form the starting-point of a new cycle . Now Pasteur proved that the plague-corpuscles might be incipient in the egg , and escape detection ; they might also be germinal in the worm , and still baffle the microscope . But as the worm grows , the corpuscles grow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aged chrysalis they are more pronounced than in the worm ; while in the moth , if either the egg or the worm from which it comes should have been at all stricken , the corpuscles infallibly appear , offering no difficulty of detection . This was the first great point made out in 1865 by Pasteur . The Italian naturalists , as aforesaid , recommended the examination of the eggs before risking their incubation . Pasteur showed that both eggs and worms might be smitten , and still pass muster , the culture of such eggs or such worms being sure to entail disaster . He made the moth his starting-point in seeking to regenerate the race . Pasteur made his first communication on this subject to the Academy of Sciences in September , 1865 . It raised a cloud of criticism . Here , forsooth , was a chemist rashly quitting his proper metier and presuming to lay down the law for the physician and biologist on a subject which was eminently theirs . ' On trouva etrange que je fusse si peu au courant de la question ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Italie , do nt les resultats montraient l'inutilite de mes efforts , et l'impossibilite d'arriver a un resultat pratique dans la direction que je m'etais engage . Que mon ignorance fut grande au sujet des recherches sans nombre qui avaient paru depuis quinze annees . ' Pasteur heard the buzz , but he continued his work . In choosing the eggs intended for incubation , the cultivators selected those produced in the successful ' educations ' of the year . But they could not understand the frequent and often disastrous failures of their selected eggs ; for they did not know , and nobody prior to Pasteur was competent to tell them , that the finest cocoons may envelope doomed corpusculous moths . It was not , however , easy to make the cultivators accept new guidance . To strike their imagination , and if possible determine their practice , Pasteur hit upon the expedient of prophecy . In 1866 he inspected , at St. Hippolyte-du-Fort , fourteen different parcels of eggs intended for incubation . Having examined a sufficient number of the moths which produced these eggs , he wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and placed the prophecy as a sealed letter in the hands of the Mayor of St. Hippolyte . In 1867 the cultivators communicated to the mayor their results . The letter of Pasteur was then opened and read , and it was found that in twelve out of fourteen cases there was absolute conformity between his prediction and the observed facts . Many of the groups had perished totally ; the others had perished almost totally ; and this was the prediction of Pasteur . In two out of the fourteen cases , instead of the prophesied destruction , half an average crop was obtained . Now , the parcels of eggs here referred to were considered healthy by their owners . They had been hatched and tended in the firm hope that the labour expended on them would prove remunerative . The application of the moth-test for a few minutes in 1866 , would have saved the labour and averted the disappointment . Two additional parcels of eggs were at the same time submitted to Pasteur . He pronounced them healthy ; and his words were verified by the production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more remarkable , because more circumstantial , are recorded in Pasteur 's work . Pasteur subjected the development of the corpuscles to a searching investigation , and followed out with admirable skill and completeness the various modes by which the plague was propagated . From moths perfectly free from corpuscles he obtained healthy worms , and selecting 10 , 20 , 30 , 50 , as the case might be , he introduced into the worms the corpusculous matter . It was first permitted to accompany the food . Let its take a single example out of many . Rubbing up a small corpusculous worm in water , he smeared the mixture over the mulberry-leaves . Assuring himself that the leaves had been eaten , he watched the consequences from day to day . Side by side with the infected worms he reared their fellows , keeping them as much as possible out of the way of infection . These constituted his ' lot temoin , '  --  his standard of comparison . On April 16 , 1868 , he thus infected thirty worms . Up to the 23rd they remained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but on that day corpuscles were found in the intestines of two of them . On the 27th , or eleven days after the infected repast , two fresh worms were examined , and not only was the intestinal canal found in each case invaded , but the silk organ itself was charged with corpuscles . On the 28th the twenty-six remaining worms were covered by the black spots of pebrine . On the 30th the difference of size between the infected and non-infected worms was very striking , the sick worms being not more than two-thirds of the bulk of the healthy ones . On May 2 a worm which had just finished its fourth moulting was examined . Its whole body was so filled with the parasite as to excite astonishment that it could live . The disease advanced , the worms died and were examined , and on May 11 only six out of the thirty remained . They were the strongest of the lot , but on being searched they also were found charged with corpuscles . Not one of the thirty worms had escaped ; a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the contrary , spun their fine cocoons , two only of their moths being proved to contain any trace of the parasite , which had doubtless been introduced during the rearing of the worms . As his acquaintance with the subject increased , Pasteur 's desire for precision augmented , and he finally counted the growing number of corpuscles seen in the field of his microscope from day to day . After a contagious repast the number of worms containing the parasite gradually augmented until finally it became cent . per cent . The number of corpuscles would at the same time rise from 0 to 1 , to 10 , to 100 , and sometimes even to 1,000 or 1,500 in the field of his microscope . He then varied the mode of infection . He inoculated healthy worms with the corpusculous matter , and watched the consequent growth of the disease . He proved that the worms inoculate each other by the infliction of visible wounds with their claws . In various cases he washed the claws , and found corpuscles in the water . He demonstrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and diseased worms . By their claws and their dejections , the diseased worms spread infection . It was no hypothetical infected medium  --  no problematical pythogenic gas  --  that killed the worms , but a definite organism . The question of infection at a distance was also examined , and its existence demonstrated . As might be expected from Pasteur 's antecedents , the investigation was exhaustive , the skill and beauty of his manipulation finding fitting correlatives in the strength and clearness of his thought . The following quotation from Pasteur 's work clearly shows the relation in which his researches stand to the important question on which he was engaged : ***** Place ( he says ) the most skilful educator , even the most expert microscopist , in presence of large educations which present the symptoms described in our experiments ; his judgment will necessarily be erroneous if he confines himself to the knowledge which preceded my researches . The worms will not present to him the slightest spot of pebrine ; the microscope will not reveal the existence of corpuscles ; the mortality of the worms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing to be desired . Our observer would , therefore , conclude without hesitation that the eggs produced will be good for incubation . The truth is , on the contrary , that all the worms of these fine crops have been poisoned ; that from the beginning they carried in them the germ of the malady ; ready to multiply itself beyond measure in the chrysalides and the moths , thence to pass into the eggs and smite with sterility the next generation . And what is the first cause of the evil concealed under so deceitful an exterior ? In our experiments we can , so to speak , touch it with our fingers . It is entirely the effect of a single corpusculous repast ; an effect more or less prompt according to the epoch of life of the worm that has eaten the poisoned food . ***** Pasteur describes in detail his method of securing healthy eggs . It is nothing less than a mode of restoring to France her ancient silk husbandry . The justification of his work is to be found in the reports which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his method , while editing his researches for final publication . In both France and Italy his method has been pursued with the most surprising results . But it was an up-hill fight which led to this triumph . ' Ever , ' he says , ' since the commencement of these researches , I have been exposed to the most obstinate and unjust contradictions ; but I have made it a duty to leave no trace of these conflicts in this book . ' And in reference to parasitic diseases , generally , he uses the following weighty words : ' Il est au pouvoir de l'homme de faire disparaitre de la surface du globe les maladies parasitaires , si , comme c'est ma conviction , la doctrine des generations spontanees est une chimere . ' Pasteur dwells upon the ease with which an island like Corsica might be absolutely isolated from the silkworm epidemic . And with regard to other epidemics , Mr. Simon describes an extraordinary case of insular exemption , for the ten years extending from 1851 to 1860 . Of the 627 registration districts of England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in whole or in part , were prevalent in all the others : ' In all the ten years it had not a single death by measles , nor a single death by small-pox , nor a single death by scarlet-fever . And why ? Not because of its general sanitary merits , for it had an average amounts of other evidence of unhealthiness . Doubtless , the reason of its escape was that it was insular . It was the district of the Scilly Isles ; to which it was most improbable that any febrile contagion should come from without . And its escape is an approximative proof that , at least for those ten years , no contagium of measles , nor any contagium of scarlet-fever , nor any contagium of smallpox had arisen spontaneously within its limits . ' It may be added that there were only seven districts in England in which no death from diphtheria occurred , and that , of those seven districts , the district of the Scilly Isles was one . A second parasitic disease of silkworms , called in France la @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , has also been investigated by Pasteur . Enough , however , has been said to send the reader interested in these questions to the original volumes for further information . To one important practical point M. Pasteur , in a letter to myself , directs attention : ***** Permettez-moi de terminer ces quelques lignes que je dois dicter , vaincu que je suis par la maladie , en vous faisant observer que vous rendriez service aux Colonies de la Grande-Bretagne en repandant la connaissance de ce livre , et des principes que j'etablis touchant la maladie des vers a soie . Beaucoup de ces colonies pourraient cultiver le murier avec succes , et , en jetant les yeux sur mon ouvrage , vous vous convaincrez aisement qu'il est facile aujourd'hui , nonseulement d'eloigner la maladie regnante , mais en outre de donner aux recoltes de la soie une prosperite qu'elles n'ont jamais eue . Origin and Propagation of Contagious Matter . Prior to Pasteur , the most diverse and contradictory opinions were entertained as to the contagious character of pebrine ; some stoutly affirmed it , others as stoutly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I They believed in the existence of a deleterious medium , rendered epidemic by some occult and mysterious influence , to which was attributed the cause of the disease . ' Those acquainted with our medical literature will not fail to observe an instructive analogy here . We have on the one side accomplished writers ascribing epidemic diseases to ' deleterious media ' which arise spontaneously in crowded hospitals and ill-smelling drains . According to them , the contagia of epidemic disease are formed de novo in a putrescent atmosphere . On the other side we have writers , clear , vigorous , with well-defined ideas and methods of research , contending that the matter which produces epidemic disease comes always from a parent stock . It behaves as germinal matter , and they do not hesitate to regard it as such . They no more believe in the spontaneous generation of such diseases , than they do in the spontaneous generation of mice . Pasteur , for example , found that pebrine had been known for an indefinite time as a disease among silkworms . The development of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existing power  --  the bursting into open conflagration of a previously smouldering fire . There is nothing surprising in this . For though epidemic disease requires a special contagium to produce it , surrounding conditions must have a potent influence on its development . Common seeds may be duly sown , but the conditions of temperature and moisture may be such as to restrict , or altogether prevent , the subsequent growth . Looked at , therefore , from the point of view of the germ theory , the exceptional energy which epidemic disease from time to time exhibits , is in harmony with the method of Nature . We sometimes hear diphtheria spoken of as if it were a new disease of the last twenty years ; but Mr. Simon tells me that about three centuries ago tremendous epidemics of it began to rage in Spain ( where it was named Garrotillo ) , and soon afterwards in Italy ; and that since that time the disease has been well known to all successive generations of doctors . In or about 1758 , for instance , Dr. Starr , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly described the disease , with all the characters which have recently again become familiar , but under the name of morbus strangulatorius , as then severely epidemic in Cornwall . This fact is the more interesting , as diphtheria , in its more modern reappearance , again showed predilection for that remote county . Many also believe that the Black Death , of five centuries ago , has disappeared as mysteriously as it came ; but Mr. Simon finds that it is believed to be prevalent at this hour in some of the north-western parts of India . Let me here state an item of my own experience . When I was at the Bel Alp in 1869 , the English chaplain received letters informing him of the breaking out of scarlet-fever among his children . He lived , if I remember rightly , on the healthful eminence of Dartmoor , and it was difficult to imagine how scarlet-fever could have been wafted to the place . A drain ran close to his house , and on it his suspicions were manifestly fixed . Some of our medical writers would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the truth , while those of another , and , in my opinion , a wiser school , would deny to a drain , however foul , the power of generating de novo a specific disease . After close enquiry he recollected that a hobby-horse had been used both by his boy and another , who , a short time previously , had passed through scarlet-fever . Drains and cesspools , indeed , are by no means in such evil odour as they used to be . A fetid Thames and a low death-rate occur from time to time together in London . For , if the special matter or germs of epidemic disorder be not present , a corrupt atmosphere , however obnoxious otherwise , will not produce the disorder . But , if the germs be present , defective drains and cesspools become the potent distributors of disease and death . Corrupted air may promote an epidemic , but can not produce it . On the other hand , through the transport of the special germ or virus , disease may develop itself in regions where the drainage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new thistle growing in your field , you feel sure that its seed has been wafted thither . Just as sure does it seem that the contagious matter of epidemic disease has been transplanted to the place where it newly appears . With a clearness and conclusiveness s not to be surpassed , Dr. William Budd has traced such diseases from place to place ; showing how they plant themselves , at distinct foci , among populations subjected to the same atmospheric influences , just as grains of corn might be carried in the pocket and sown . Hildebrand , to whose remarkable work , ' Du Typhus contagieux , ' Dr. de Mussy has directed my attention , gives the following striking case , both of the durability and the transport of the virus of scarlatina : ' Un habit noir que j'avais en visitant une malade attaquee de scarlatina , et que je portai de Vienne en Podolie , sans l'avoir mis depuis plus d'un an et demi , me communiqua , des que je fus arrive , cette maladie contagieuse , que je repandis ensuite dans cette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some years ago Dr. de Mussy himself was summoned to a country house in Surrey , to see a young lady who was suffering from a dropsy , evidently the consequence of scarlatina . The original disease , being of a very mild character , had been quite overlooked ; but circumstances were recorded which could leave no doubt upon the mind as to the nature and cause of the complaint . But then the question arose , How did the young lady catch the scarlatina ? She had come there on a visit two months previously , and it was only after she had been a month in the house that she was taken ill . The housekeeper at length cleared up the mystery . The young lady , on her arrival , had expressed a wish to occupy a room in an isolated tower . Her desire was granted ; and in that room , six months previously , a visitor had been confined with an attack of scarlatina . The room had been swept and whitewashed , but the carpets had been permitted to remain . Thousands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shown itself in this mysterious way , but where a strict examination has revealed its true parentage and extraction . Is it , then , philosophical to take refuge in the fortuitous concourse of atoms as a cause of specific disease , merely because in special cases the parentage may be indistinct ? Those best acquainted with atomic nature , and who are most ready to admit , as regards even higher things than this , the potentialities of matter , will be the last to accept these rash hypotheses . The Germ Theory applied to Surgery . Not only medical but still more especially surgical science is now seeking light and guidance from this germ theory . Upon it the antiseptic system of Professor Lister of Edinburgh is founded . As already stated , the germ theory of putrefaction was started by Schwann ; but the illustrations of this theory adduced by Professor Lister are of such public moment as not only to justify , but to render imperative , their introduction here . Schwann 's observations ( says Professor Lister ) did not receive the attention which they appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was generally allowed to be occasioned by the Torula cerevisiae ; but it was not admitted that putrefaction was due to an analogous agency . And yet the two cases present a very striking parallel . In each a stable chemical compound , sugar in the one case , albumen in the other , undergoes extraordinary chemical changes under the influence of an excessively minute quantity of a substance which , regarded chemically , we should suppose inert . As an example of this in the case of putrefaction , let us take a circumstance often witnessed in the treatment of large chronic abscesses . In order to guard against the access of atmospheric air , we used to draw off the matter by means of a canula and trocar , such as you see here , consisting of a silver tube with a sharp-pointed steel rod fitted into it , and projecting beyond it . The instrument , dipped in oil , was thrust into the cavity of the abscess , the trocar was withdrawn , and the pus flowed out through the canula , care being taken by gentle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The canula was then drawn out with due precaution against the reflux of air . This method was frequently successful as to its immediate object , the patient being relieved from the mass of the accumulated fluid , and experiencing no inconvenience from the operation . But the pus was pretty certain to reaccumulate in course of time , and it became necessary again and again to repeat the process . And unhappily there was no absolute security of immunity from bad consequences . However carefully the procedure was conducted , it sometimes happened , even though the puncture seemed healing by first intention , that feverish symptoms declared themselves in the course of the first or second day , and , on inspecting the seat of the abscess , the skin was perhaps seen to be red , implying the presence of some cause of irritation , while a rapid reaccumulation of the fluid was found to have occurred . Under these circumstances , it became necessary to open the abscess by free incision , when a quantity , large in proportion to the size of the abscess , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escaped , fetid from putrefaction . Now , how had this change been brought about ? Without the germ theory , I venture to say , no rational explanation of it could have been given . It must have been caused by the introduction of something from without . Inflammation of the punctured wound , even supposing it to have occurred , would not explain the phenomenon . For mere inflammation , whether acute or chronic , though it occasions the formation of pus , does not induce Putrefaction . The pus originally evacuated was perfectly sweet , and we know of nothing to account for the alteration in its quality but the influence of something derived from the external world . And what could that something be ? The dipping of the instrument in oil , and the subsequent precautions , prevented the entrance of oxygen . Or even if you allowed that a few atoms of the gas did enter , it would be an extraordinary assumption to make that these could in so short a time effect such changes in so large a mass of albuminous material . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vessels , through which arterial blood , rich in oxygen , is perpetually flowing ; and there can be little doubt that the pus , before it was evacuated at all , was liable to any action which the element might be disposed to exert upon it . On the oxygen theory , then , the occurrence of putrefaction under these circumstances is quite inexplicable . But if you admit the germ theory , the difficulty vanishes at once . The canula and trocar having been lying exposed to the air , dust will have been deposited upon them , and will be present in the angle between the trocar and the silver tube , and in that protected situation will fail to be wiped off when the instrument is thrust through the tissues . Then when the trocar is withdrawn , some portions of this dust will naturally remain upon the margin of the canula , which is left projecting into the abscess , and nothing is more likely than that some particles may fail to be washed off by the stream of out-flowing pus , but may be dislodged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the cavity . The germ theory tells us that these particles of dust will be pretty sure to contain the germs of putrefactive organisms , and if one such is left in the albuminous liquid , it will rapidly develop at the high temperature of the body , and account for all the phenomena . But striking as is the parallel between putrefaction in this instance and the vinous fermentation , as regards the greatness of the effect produced , compared with the minuteness and the inertness , chemically speaking , of the cause , you will naturally desire further evidence of the similarity of the two processes . You can see with the microscope the Torula of fermenting must or beer . Is there , you may ask , any organism to be detected in the putrefying pus ? Yes , gentlemen , there is . If any drop of the putrid matter is examined with a good glass , it is found to be teeming with myriads of minute jointed bodies , called vibrios , which indubitably proclaim their vitality by the energy of their movements . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that the entire mass of that quart of pus has become peopled with living organisms as the result of the introduction of the canula and trocar ; for the matter first let out was as free from vibrios as it was from putrefaction . If this be so , the greatness of the chemical changes that have taken place in the pus ceases to be surprising . We know that it is one of the chief peculiarities of living structures that they possess extraordinary powers of effecting chemical changes in materials in their vicinity , out of all proportion to their energy as mere chemical compounds . And we can hardly doubt that the animalcules which have been developed in the albuminous liquid , and have grown at its expense , must have altered its constitution , just as we ourselves alter that of the materials on which we feed . Footnote : ' Introductory Lecture before the University of Edinburgh . ' In the operations of Professor Lister care is taken that every portion of tissue laid bare by the knife shall be defended from germs ; that if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they fall . With this in view he showers upon his exposed surfaces the spray of dilute carbolic acid , which is particularly deadly to the germs , and he surrounds the wound in the most careful manner with antiseptic bandages . To those accustomed to strict experiment it is manifest that we have a strict experimenter here  --  a man with a perfectly distinct object in view , which he pursues with never-tiring patience and unwavering faith . And the result , in his hospital practice , as described by himself , has been , that even in the midst of abominations too shocking to be mentioned here , and in the neighbourhood of wards where death was rampant from pyaemia , erysipelas , and hospital gangrene , he was able to keep his patients absolutely free from these terrible scourges . Let me here recommend to your attention Professor Lister 's ' Introductory Lecture before the University of Edinburgh , ' which I have already quoted ; his paper on The Effect of the Antiseptic System of Treatment on the Salubrity of a Surgical Hospital ; ' and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 14 , 1871 . If , instead of using carbolic acid spray , he could surround his wounds with properly filtered air , the result would , he contends , be the same . In a room where the germs not only float but cling to clothes and walls , this would be difficult , if not impossible . But surgery is acquainted with a class of wounds in which the blood is freely mixed with air that has passed through the lungs , and it is a most remarkable fact that such air does not produce putrefaction . Professor Lister , as far as I know , was the first to give a philosophical interpretation of this fact , which he describes and comments upon thus : I have explained to my own mind the remarkable fact that in simple fracture of the ribs , if the lung be punctured by a fragment , the blood effused into the pleural cavity , though freely mixed with air , undergoes no decomposition . The air is sometimes pumped into the pleural cavity in such abundance that , making its way through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cellular tissue of the whole body . Yet this occasions no alarm to the surgeon ( although if the blood in the pleura were to putrefy , it would infallibly occasion dangerous suppurative pleurisy ) . Why air introduced into the pleural cavity through a wounded lung , should have such wholly different effects from that entering directly through a wound in the chest , was to me a complete mystery until I heard of the germ theory of putrefaction , when it at once occurred to me that it was only natural that air should be filtered of germs by the air-passages , one of whose offices is to arrest inhaled particles of dust , and prevent them from entering the air-cells. ***** I shall have occasion to refer to this remarkable hypothesis farther on . The advocates of the germ theory , both of putrefaction and epidemic disease , hold that both arise , not from the air , but from something contained in the air . They hold , moreover , that this ' something ' is not a vapour nor a gas , nor indeed a molecule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As regards size , there is probably no sharp line of division between molecules and particles ; the one gradually shades into the other . But the distinction that I would draw is this : the atom or the molecule , if free , is always part of a gas , the particle is never so . A particle is a bit of liquid or solid matter , formed by the Aggregation of atoms or molecules . The term ' particulate ' has been used in the Reports of the Medical Department of the Privy Council to describe this supposed constitution of contagious matter ; and Dr. Sanderson 's experiments render it in the highest degree probable , if they do not actually demonstrate , that the virus of small-pox is ' particulate . ' Definite knowledge upon this point is of exceeding importance , because in the treatment of particles methods are available which it would be futile to apply to molecules . The Luminous beam as a means of Research . My own interference with this great question , while sanctioned by eminent names , has been also an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will only say that when angry feeling escapes from behind the intellect , where it may be useful as an urging force , and places itself athwart the intellect , it is liable to produce all manner of delusions . Thus my censors , for the most part , have levelled their remarks against positions which were never assumed , and against claims which were never made . The simple history of the matter is this : During the autumn of 1868 I was much occupied with the observations referred to at the beginning of this discourse , and in part described in the preceding article . For fifteen years it had been my habit to make use of floating dust to reveal the paths of luminous beams through the air ; but until 1868 I did not intentionally reverse the process , and employ a luminous beam to reveal and examine the dust . In a paper presented to the Royal Society in December , 1869 , the observations which induced me to give more special attention to the question of spontaneous generation , and the germ theory of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Air . Prior to the discovery of the foregoing action ( the chemical action of light upon vapours , Fragment IV. ) , and also during the experiments just referred to , the nature of my work compelled me to aim at obtaining experimental tubes absolutely clean upon the surface , and absolutely free within from suspended matter . Neither condition is , however , easily attained . For however well the tubes might be washed and polished , and however bright and pure they might appear in ordinary daylight , the electric beam infallibly revealed signs and tokens of dirt . The air was always present , and it was sure to deposit some impurity . All chemical processes , not conducted in a vacuum , are open to this disturbance . When the experimental tube was exhausted , it exhibited no trace of floating matter , but on admitting the air through the U-tubes ( containing caustic potash and sulphuric acid ) , a dust-cone more or less distinct was always revealed by the powerfully condensed electric beam . The floating motes resembled minute particles of liquid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experimental tube . Precautions were therefore taken to prevent any such transfer . They produced little or no mitigation . I did not imagine , at the time , that the dust of the external air could find such free passage through the caustic potash and sulphuric acid . This , however , was the case ; the motes really came from without . They also passed with freedom through a variety of aethers and alcohols . In fact , it requires long-continued action on the part of an acid first to wet the motes and afterwards to destroy them . By carefully passing the air through the flame of a spirit lamp , or through a platinum tube heated to bright redness , the floating matter was sensibly destroyed . It was therefore combustible , in other words , organic , matter . I tried to intercept it by a large respirator of cotton-wool . Close pressure was necessary to render the wool effective . A plug of the wool , rammed pretty tightly into the tube through which the air passed , was finally found competent to hold back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and gave me much trouble ; but they were invariably traced in the end to some defect in the purifying apparatus  --  to some crack or flaw in the sealing-wax employed to render the tubes air-tight . Thus through proper care , but not without a great deal of searching out of disturbances , the experimental tube , even when filled with air or vapour , contains nothing competent to scatter the light . The space within it has the aspect of an absolute vacuum . An experimental tube in this condition I call optically empty . The simple apparatus employed in these experiments will be at once understood by reference to a figure printed in the last article ( Fig. 3. ) s s ' is the glass experimental tube , which has varied in length from 1 to 5 feet , and which may be from 2 to 3 inches in diameter . From the end s , the pipe pp ' passes to an air-pump . Connected with the other end s ' we have the flask F , containing the liquid whose vapour is to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with fragments of clean glass , wetted with sulphuric acid ; then a second U-tube , T , containing fragments of marble , wetted with caustic potash ; and finally a narrow straight tube t t ' , containing a tolerably tightly fitting plug of cotton-wool . To save the air-pump gauge from the attack of such vapours as act on mercury , as also to facilitate observation , a separate barometer tube was employed . Through the cork which stops the flask F two glass tubes , a and b , pass air-tight . The tube a ends immediately under the cork ; the tube b , on the contrary , descends to the bottom of the flask and dips into the liquid . The end of the tube b is drawn out so as to render very small the orifice through which the air escapes into the liquid . The experimental tube s s ' being exhausted , a cock at the end s ' is turned carefully on . The air passes slowly through the cotton-wool , the caustic potash , and the sulphuric acid in succession . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the liquid . Charged with vapour , it finally passes into the experimental tube , where it is submitted to examination . The electric lamp L placed at the end of the experimental tube furnishes the necessary beam . ***** The facts here forced upon my attention had a bearing too evident to be overlooked . The inability of air which had been filtered through cotton-wool to generate animalcular life , had been demonstrated by Schroeder and Pasteur : here the cause of its impotence was rendered evident to the eye . The experiment proved that no sensible amount of light was scattered by the molecules of the air ; that the scattered light always arose from suspended particles ; and the fact that the removal of these abolished simultaneously the power of scattering light and of originating life , obviously detached the life-originating power from the air , and fixed it on something suspended in the air . Gases of all kinds passed with freedom through the plug of cotton-wool ; hence the thing whose removal by the cotton-wool rendered the gas impotent , could not itself have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me that the retina , protected as it was , in these experiments , from all extraneous light , might be converted into a new and powerful instrument of demonstration in relation to the germ theory . But the observations also revealed the danger incurred in experiments of this nature ; showing that without an amount of care far beyond that hitherto bestowed upon them , such experiments left the door open to errors of the gravest description . It was especially manifest that the chemical method employed by Schultze in his experiments , and so often resorted to since , might lead to the most erroneous consequences ; that neither acids nor alkalies had the power of rapid destruction hitherto ascribed to them . In short , the employment of the luminous beam rendered evident the cause of success in experiments rigidly conducted like those of Pasteur ; while it made equally evident the certainty of failure in experiments less severely carried out . Dr. Bennett 's Experiments . But I do not wish to leave an assertion of this kind without illustration . Take , then ' , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Royal Society of Surgeons in Edinburgh on January 17 , 1868 . Footnote : ' British Medical Journal , ' 13 , pt. ii . 1868 . Into flasks containing decoctions of liquorice-root , hay , or tea , Dr. Bennett , by an ingenious method , forced air . The air was driven through two U-tubes , the one containing a solution of caustic potash , the other sulphuric acid . ' All the bent tubes were filled with fragments of pumice-stone to break up the air , so as to prevent the possibility of any germs passing through in the centre of bubbles . ' The air also passed through a Liebig 's bulb containing sulphuric acid , and also through a bulb containing gun-cotton . It was only natural for Dr. Bennett to believe that his ' bent tubes ' entirely cut off the germs . Previous to the observations just referred to , I also believed in their efficacy . But these observations destroy any such notion . The gun-cotton , moreover , will fail to arrest the whole of the floating matter , unless it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Bennett 's memoir that it was so packed . On the whole , I should infer , from the mere inspection of Dr. Bennett 's apparatus , the very results which he has described  --  a retardation of the development of life , a total absence of it in some cases , and its presence in others . In his first series of experiments , eight flasks were fed with sifted air , and five with common air . In ten or twelve days all the five had fungi in them ; whilst it required from four to nine months to develop fungi in the others . In one of the eight , moreover , even after this interval no fungi appeared . In a second series of experiments there was a similar exception . In a third series the cork stoppers used in the first and second series were abandoned , and glass stoppers employed . Flasks containing decoctions of tea , beef , and hay were filled with common air , and other flasks with sifted air . In every one of the former fungi appeared and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doctrine that Dr. Bennett finally espouses . In all these negative cases , the prepared air was forced into the infusion when it was boiling hot . Dr. Bennett made a fourth series of experiments , in which , previous to forcing in the air , he permitted the flasks to cool . Into four bottles thus treated he forced prepared air , and after a time found fungi in all of them . What is his conclusion ? Not that the boiling hot liquid , employed in his first experiments , had destroyed such germs as had run the gauntlet of his apparatus ; but that air which , previous to being sealed up , had been exposed to a temperature of 212 deg. , is too rare to support life . This conclusion is so remarkable that it ought to be stated in Dr. Bennett 's own words . ' It may be easily conceived that air subjected to a boiling temperature is so expanded as scarcely to merit the name of air , and that it is more or less unfit for the purpose of sustaining animal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , and as a matter of fact I live and flourish for a considerable portion of each year in a medium of less density than that which Dr. Bennett describes as scarcely meriting the name of air . The inhabitants of the higher Alpine chalets , with their flocks and herds , and the grasses which support these , do the same ; while the chamois rears its kids in air rarer still . Insect life , moreover , is sometimes exhibited with monstrous prodigality at Alpine heights . In a fifth series of experiments sixteen bottles were filled with infusions . Into four of them , while cold , ordinary unheated and unsifted air was pumped . In these four bottles fungi were developed . Into four other bottles , containing a boiling infusion , ordinary air was also pumped  --  no fungi were here developed . Into four other bottles containing an infusion which had been boiled and permitted to cool , sifted air was pumped  --  no fungi were developed . Finally , into four bottles containing a boiling infusion sifted air was pumped no fungi were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the infusions were cold infusions , and the air ordinary air , did fungi appear . Dr. Bennett does not draw from his experiments the conclusion to which they so obviously point . On them , on the contrary , he founds a defence of the doctrine of spontaneous generation , and a general theory of spontaneous development . So strongly was he impressed with the idea that the germs could not possibly pass through his potash and sulphuric acid tubes , that the appearance of fungi , even in a small minority of cases , where the air had been sent through these tubes , was to him conclusive evidence of the spontaneous origin of such fungi . And he accounts for the absence of life in many of his experiments by an hypothesis which will not bear a moment 's examination . But , knowing that organic particles may pass unscathed through alkalies and acids , the results of Dr. Bennett are precisely what ought wider the circumstances to be expected . Indeed , their harmony with the conditions now revealed is a proof of the honesty and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Pasteur both in the execution of his experiments , and in the reasoning based upon them , is perfectly evident to those who , through the practice of severe experimental enquiry , have rendered themselves competent to judge of good experimental work . He found germs in the mercury used to isolate his air . He was never sure that they did not cling to the instruments he employed , or to his own person . Thus when he opened his hermetically sealed flasks upon the Mer de Glace , he had his eye upon the file used to detach the drawn-out necks of his bottles ; and he was careful to stand to leeward when each flask was opened . Using these precautions , he found the glacier air incompetent , in nineteen cases out of twenty , to generate life ; while similar flasks , opened amid the vegetation of the lowlands , were soon crowded with living things . M. Pouchet repeated Pasteur 's experiments in the Pyrenees , adopting the precaution of holding his flasks above his head , and obtaining a different result . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real precaution . The luminous beam at once shows us its possible effect . Let smoking brown paper be placed at the open mouth of a glass shade , so that the smoke shall ascend and fill the shade . A beam sent through the shade forms a bright track through the smoke . When the closed fist is placed underneath the shade , a vertical wind of surprising violence , considering the small elevation of temperature , rises from the band , displacing by comparatively dark air the illuminated smoke . Unless special care were taken such a wind would rise from M. Pouchet 's body as he held his flasks above his head , and thus the precaution of Pasteur , of not coming between the wind and the flask , would be annulled . Let me now direct attention to another result of Pasteur , the cause and significance of which are at once revealed by the luminous beam . He prepared twenty one flasks , each containing a decoction of yeast , filtered and clear . He boiled the decoction so as to destroy whatever germs it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liquid was filled with pure steam , he sealed his flasks with a blow-pipe . He opened ten of them in the deep , damp caves of the Paris Observatory , and eleven of them in the courtyard of the establishment . Of the former , one only showed signs of life subsequently . In nine out of the ten flasks no organisms of any kind were developed . In all the others organisms speedily appeared . Now here is an experiment conducted in Paris , on which we can throw obvious light in London . Causing our luminous beam to pass through a large flask filled with the air of this room , and charged with its germs and its dust , the beam is seen crossing the flask from side to side . But here is another similar flask , which cuts a clear gap out of the beam . It is filled with unfiltered air , and still no trace of the beam is visible . Why ? By pure accident I stumbled on this flask in our apparatus room , where it had remained quiet for some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three other flasks , filled , in the first instance , with mote-laden air . They are now optically empty . Our former experiments proved that the life-producing particles attach themselves to the fibres of cotton-wool . In the present experiment the motes have been brought by gentle air-currents , established by slight differences of temperature within our closed vessels , into contact with the interior surface , to which they adhere . The air of these flasks has deposited its dust , germs and all , and is practically free from suspended matter . I had a chamber erected , the lower half of which is of wood , its upper half being enclosed by four glazed window-frames . It tapers to a truncated cone at the top . It measures in plan 3 ft. by 2 ft. 6 in , and its height is 5 ft. 10 in . On February 6 it was closed , every crevice that could admit dust , or cause displacement of the air , being carefully pasted over with paper . The electric beam at first revealed the dust within the chamber as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chamber was examined almost daily ; a perceptible diminution of the floating matter being noticed as time advanced . At the end of a week the chamber was optically empty , exhibiting no trace of matter competent to scatter the light . Such must have been the case in the stagnant caves of the Paris Observatory . Were our electric beam sent through the air of these caves its track would be invisible ; thus showing the indissoluble association of the scattering of light by air and its power to generate life . I will now turn to what seems to me a more interesting application of the luminous beam than any hitherto described . My reference to Professor Lister 's interpretation of the fact , that air which has passed through the lungs can not produce putrefaction , is fresh in your memories . ' Why air , ' said he , ' introduced into the pleural cavity , through a wounded lung , should have such wholly different effects from that entering through a permanently open wound , penetrating from without , was to me a complete mystery , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it at once occurred to me that it was only natural that the air should be filtered of germs by the air passages , one of whose offices is to arrest inhaled particles of dust , and prevent them from entering the air-cells . ' Here is a surmise which bears the stamp of genius , but which needs verification . If , for the words ' it is only natural ' we were authorised to write ' it is perfectly certain , ' the demonstration would be complete . Such demonstration is furnished by experiments with a beam of light . One evening , towards the close of 1869 , while pouring various pure gases across the dusty track of a luminous beam , the thought occurred to me of using my breath instead of the gases . I then noticed , for the first time , the extraordinary darkness produced by the expired air , towards the end of the expiration . Permit me to repeat the experiment in your presence . I fill my lungs with ordinary air and breathe through a glass tube across the beam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is shown by the formation of a luminous white cloud of delicate texture . We abolish this cloud by drying the breath previous to its entering the beam ; or , still more simply , by warming the glass tube . The luminous track of the beam is for a time uninterrupted by the breath , because the dust returning from the lungs makes good , in great part , the particles displaced . After a time , however , an obscure disk appears in the beam , the darkness of which increases , until finally , towards the end of the expiration , the beam is , as it were , pierced by an intensely black hole , in which no particles whatever can be discerned . The deeper air of the lungs is thus proved to be absolutely free from suspended matter . It is therefore in the precise condition required by Professor Lister 's explanation . This experiment may be repeated any number of times with the same result . I think it must be regarded as a crowning piece of evidence both of the correctness of Professor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vital development , of optically pure air . Footnote : Dr. Burden Sanderson draws attention to the important observation of Brauell , which shows that the contagium of a pregnant animal , suffering from splenic fever , is not found in the blood of the foetus ; the placental apparatus acting as a filter , and holding back the infective particles . Application of Luminous beams to Water . The method of examination here pursued is also applicable to water . It is in some sense complementary to that of the microscope , and may , I think , materially aid enquiries conducted with that instrument . In microscopic examination attention is directed to a small portion of the liquid , and the aim is to detect the individual particles . By the present method a large portion of the liquid is illuminated , the collective action of the particles being revealed , by the scattered light . Care is taken to defend the eye from the access of all other light , and , thus defended , it becomes an organ of inconceivable delicacy . Indeed , an amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the individual particles of which are so small as wholly to elude the microscope , may , when examined by the method alluded to , produce not only sensible , but striking , effects upon the eye . We will apply the method , in the first place , to an experiment of M. Pouchet intended to prove conclusively that animalcular life is developed in cases where no antecedent germs could possibly exist . He produced water from the combustion of hydrogen in air , justly arguing that no germ could survive the heat of a hydrogen flame . But he overlooked the fact that his aqueous vapour was condensed in the air , and was allowed as water to trickle through the air . Indeed the experiment is one of a number by which workers like M. Pouchet are differentiated from workers like Pasteur . I will show you some water , produced by allowing a hydrogen flame to play upon a polished silver condenser , formed by the bottom of a silver basin , containing ice . The collected liquid is pellucid in the common light ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be laden with particles , so thick-strewn and minute as to produce a continuous luminous cone . In passing through the air the water loaded itself with this matter ; and the deportment of such water could obviously have no influence in deciding this great question . We are invaded with dirt not only in the air we breathe , but in the water we drink . To prove this I take the bottle of water intended to quench your lecturer 's thirst ; which , in the track of the beam , simply reveals itself as dirty water . And this water is no worse than the other London waters . Thanks to the kindness of Professor Frankland , I have been furnished with specimens of the water of eight London companies . They are all laden with impurities mechanically suspended . But you will ask whether filtering will not remove the suspended matter ? The grosser matter , undoubtedly , but not the more finely divided matter . Water may be passed any number of times through bibulous paper , it will continue laden with fine matter . Water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filters of the Silicated Carbon Company , has its grosser matter removed , but it is thick with fine matter . Nine-tenths of the light scattered by these suspended particles is perfectly polarised in a direction at right angles to the beam , and this release of the particles from the ordinary law of polarisation is a demonstration of their smallness . I should say by far the greater number of the particles concerned in this scattering are wholly beyond the range of the microscope , and no ordinary filter can intercept such particles . It is next to impossible , by artificial means , to produce a pure water . Mr. Hartley , for example , some time ago distilled water while surrounded by hydrogen , but the water was not free from floating matter . It is so hard to be clean in the midst of dirt . In water from the Lake of Geneva , which has remained long without being stirred , we have an approach to the pure liquid . I have a bottle of it here , which was carefully filled for me by my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is of a delicate sky-blue ; there is scarcely a trace of grosser matter . The purest water that I have seen  --  probably the purest which has been seen hitherto  --  has been obtained from the fusion of selected specimens of ice . But extraordinary precautions are required to obtain this degree of purity . The following apparatus has been constructed for this purpose : Through the plate of an air-pump passes the shank of a large funnel , attached to which below the plate is a clean glass bulb . In the funnel is placed a block of the most transparent ice , and over the funnel a glass receiver . This is first exhausted and refilled several times with air , filtered by its passage through cotton-wool , the ice being thus surrounded by pure moteless air . But the ice has previously been in contact with mote-filled air ; it is therefore necessary to let it wash its own surface , and also to wash the bulb which is to receive the water of liquefaction . The ice is permitted to melt , the bulb is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ block dwindles to a small one . We may be sure that all impurity has been thus removed from the surface of the ice . The water obtained in this way is the purest hitherto obtained . Still I should hesitate to call it absolutely pure . When condensed light is sent through it , the track of the beam is not invisible , but of the most exquisitely delicate blue . This blue is purer than that of the sky , so that the matter which produces it must be finer than that of the sky . It may be and indeed has been , contended that this blue is scattered by the very molecules of the water , and not by matter suspended in the water . But when we remember that this perfection of blue is approached gradually through stages of less perfect blue ; and when we consider that a blue in all respects similar is demonstrably obtainable from particles mechanically suspended , we should hesitate , I think , to conclude that we have arrived here at the last stage of purification . The evidence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could we push the process of purification still farther , even this last delicate trace of blue would disappear . Chalk-water . Clark 's Softening Process . But is it not possible to match the water of the Lake of Geneva here in England ? Undoubtedly it is . We have in England a kind of rock which constitutes at once an exceedingly clean recipient and a natural filter , and from which we can obtain water extremely free from mechanical impurities . I refer to the chalk formation , in which large quantities of water are held in store . Our chalk hills are in most cases covered with thin layers of soil , and with very scanty vegetation . Neither opposes much obstacle to the entry of the rain into the chalk , where any organic impurity which the water may carry in is soon oxidised and rendered harmless . Those who have scampered like myself over the downs of Hants and Wilts will remember the scarcity of water in these regions . In fact , the rainfall , instead of washing the surface and collecting in streams , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When this formation is suitably tapped , we obtain water of exceeding briskness and purity . A large glass globe , filled with the water of a well near Tring , shows itself to be wonderfully free from mechanical impurity . Indeed , it stands to reason that water wholly withdrawn from surface contamination , and percolating through so clean a substance , should be pure . It has been a subject much debated , whether the supply of excellent water which the chalk holds in store could not be rendered available for London . Many of the most eminent engineers and chemists have ardently recommended this source , and have sought to show , not only that its purity is unrivalled , but that its quantity is practically inexhaustible . Data sufficient to test this are now , I believe , in existence ; the number of wells sunk in the chalk being so considerable , and the quantity of water which they yield so well known . But this water , so admirable as regards freedom from mechanical impurity , labours under the disadvantage of being rendered very hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The chalk-water in the neighbourhood of Watford contains about seventeen grains of carbonate of lime per gallon . This , in the old terminology , used to be called seventeen degrees of hardness . This hard water is bad for tea , bad for washing , and it furs our boilers , because the lime held in solution is precipitated by boiling . If the water be used cold , its hardness must be neutralised at the expense of soap , before it will give a lather . These are serious objections to the use of chalk-water in London . But they are successfully met by the fact that such water can be softened inexpensively , and on a grand scale . I had long known the method of softening water called Clark 's process , but not until recently , under the guidance of Mr. Homersham , did I see proof of its larger applications . The chalk-water is softened for the supply of the city of Canterbury ; and at the Chiltern Hills it is softened for the supply of Tring and Aylesbury . Caterham also enjoys the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made myself acquainted with the works . At Canterbury there are three reservoirs covered in and protected , by a concrete roof and layers of pebbles , both from the summer 's heat and the winter 's cold . Each reservoir holds 120,000 gallons of water . Adjacent to these reservoirs are others containing pure slaked lime  --  the so-called ' cream of lime . ' These being filled with water , the lime and water are thoroughly mixed by air forced by an engine through apertures in the bottom of the reservoir . The water soon dissolves all the lime it is capable of dissolving . The mechanically suspended lime is then allowed to subside to the bottom , leaving a perfectly transparent lime-water behind . The softening process is this : Into one of the empty reservoirs is introduced a certain quantity of the clear lime-water , and after this about nine times the quantity of the chalk-water . The transparency immediately disappears  --  the mixture of the two clear liquids becoming thickly turbid , through the precipitation of carbonate of lime . The precipitate is crystalline and heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white carbonate of lime is formed at the bottom of the reservoir , with a water of extraordinary beauty and purity overhead . A few days ago I pitched some halfpence into a reservoir sixteen feet deep at the Chiltern Hills . This depth hardly dimmed the coin . Had I cast in a pin , it could have been seen at the bottom . By this process of softening , the water is reduced from about seventeen degrees of hardness , to three degrees of hardness . It yields a lather immediately . Its temperature is constant throughout the year . In the hottest summer it is cool , its temperature being twenty degrees above the freezing point ; and it does not freeze in winter if conveyed in proper pipes . The reservoirs are covered ; a leaf can not blow into them , and no surface contamination can reach the water . It passes direct from the main into the house tap ; no cisterns are employed , and the supply is always fresh and pure . This is the kind of water which is supplied to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ***** The foregoing article , as far as it relates to the theory which ascribes epidemic disease to the development of low parasitic life within the human life , was embodied in a discourse delivered before the Royal Institution in January 1870 . In June 1871 , after a brief reference to the polarisation of light by cloudy matter , I ventured to recur to the subject in these terms : What is the practical use of these curiosities ? If we exclude the interest attached to the observation of new facts , and the enhancement of that interest through the knowledge that facts often become the exponents of laws , these curiosities are in themselves worth little . They will not enable us to add to our stock of food , or drink , or clothes , or jewellery . But though thus shorn of all usefulness in themselves , they may , by carrying thought into places which it would not otherwise have entered , become the antecedents of practical consequences . In looking , for example , at our illuminated dust , we may ask ourselves what it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beam of light , but upon our own bodies ? The question then assumes a practical character . We find on examination that this dust is mainly organic matter  --  in part living , in part dead . There are among it particles of ground straw , torn rags , smoke , the pollen of flowers , the spores of fungi , and the germs of other things . But what have they to do with the animal economy ? Let me give you an illustration to which my attention has been lately drawn by Mr. George Henry Lewes , who writes to me thus : ' I wish to direct your attention to the experiments of von Recklingshausen should you happen not to know them . They are striking confirmations of what you say of dust and disease . Last spring , when I was at his laboratory in Wuerzburg , I examined with him blood that had been three weeks , a month , and five weeks , out of the body , preserved in little porcelain cups under glass shades . This blood was living and growing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present , but there were abundant evidences of the growth and development of the corpuscles . ( I also saw a frog 's heart still pulsating which had been removed from the body I forget how many days , but certainly more than a week ) . There were other examples of the same persistent vitality , or absence of putrefaction . Von Recklingshausen did not attribute this to the absence of germs  --  germs were not mentioned by him ; but when I asked him how he represented the thing to himself , he said the whole mystery of his operation consisted in keeping the blood free from dirt . The instruments employed were raised to a red heat just before use ; the thread was silver thread and was similarly treated ; and the porcelain cups , though not kept free from air , were kept free from currents . He said he often had failures , and these he attributed to particles of dust having escaped his precautions . ' Professor Lister , who has founded upon the removal or destruction of this ' dirt ' momentous improvements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the blood of wounds . The blood would putrefy and become fetid ; and when you examine more closely what putrefaction means , you find the putrefying substance swarming with infusorial life , the germs of which have been derived from the atmospheric dust . We are now assuredly in the midst of practical matters ; and with your permission I will refer once more to a question which has recently occupied a good deal of public attention . As regards the lowest forms of life , the world is divided , and has for a long time been divided , into two parties , the one affirming that we have only to submit absolutely dead matter to certain physical conditions , to evolve from it living things ; the other ( without wishing to set bounds to the power of matter ) affirming that , in our day , life has never been found to arise independently of pre-existing life . I belong to the party which claims life as a derivative of life . The question has two factors  --  the evidence , and the mind that judges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mental set or bias on my part that causes me throughout this long discussion , to see , on the one side , dubious facts and defective logic , and on the other side firm reasoning and a knowledge of what rigid experimental enquiry demands . But , judged of practically , what , again , has the question of Spontaneous Generation to do with us ? Let us see . There are numerous diseases of men and animals that are demonstrably the products of parasitic life , and such diseases may take the most terrible epidemic forms , as in the case of the silkworms of France , referred to at an earlier part of this article . Now it is in the highest degree important to know whether the parasites in question are spontaneously developed , or whether they have been wafted from without to those afflicted with the disease . The means of prevention , if not of cure , would be widely different in the two cases . But this is not all . Besides these universally admitted cases , there is the broad theory , now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , indeed , gaining more and more of assent from the most successful workers and profound thinkers of the medical profession itself  --  the theory , namely , that contagious disease , generally , is of this parasitic character . Had I any cause to regret having introduced this theory to your notice more than a year ago , that regret should now be expressed . I would certainly renounce in your presence whatever leaning towards the germ theory my words might then have betrayed . But since the time referred to nothing has occurred to shake my conviction of the truth of the theory . Let me briefly state the grounds on which its supporters rely . From their respective viruses you may plant typhoid fever , scarlatina , or small-pox . What is the crop that arises from this husbandry ? As surely as a thistle rises from a thistle seed , as surely as the fig comes from the fig , the grape from the grape , the thorn from the thorn , so surely does the typhoid virus increase and multiply into typhoid fever , the scarlatina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What is the conclusion that suggests itself here ? It is this : That the thing which we vaguely call a virus is to all intents and purposes a seed . Excluding the notion of vitality , in the whole range of chemical science you can not point to an action which illustrates this perfect parallelism with the phenomena of life  --  this demonstrated power of self-multiplication and reproduction . The germ theory alone accounts for the phenomena . In cases of epidemic disease , it is not on bad air or foul drains that the attention of the physician of the future will primarily be fixed , but upon disease germs , which no bad air or foul drains can create , but which may be pushed by foul air into virulent energy of reproduction . You may think I am treading on dangerous ground , that I am putting forth views that may interfere with salutary practice . No such thing . If you wish to learn the impotence of medical practice in dealing with contagious diseases , you have only to refer to the Harveian oration for 1871 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physician . They must run their course , and the utmost that can be done for them is careful nursing . And this , though I do not specially insist upon it , would favour the idea of their vital origin . For if the seeds of contagious disease be themselves living things , it may be difficult to destroy either them or their progeny , without involving their living habitat in the same destruction . It has been said , and it is sure to be repeated , that I am quitting my own metier , in speaking of these things . Not so . I am dealing with a question on which minds accustomed to weigh the value of experimental evidence are alone competent to decide , and regarding which , in its present condition , minds so trained are as capable of forming an opinion as regarding the phenomena of magnetism or radiant heat . ' The germ theory of disease , ' it has been said , ' appertains to the biologist and the physician . ' Where , I would ask in reply , is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this subject , could for one instant be compared to those of the chemist Pasteur ? It is not the philosophic members of the medical profession who are dull to the reception of truth not originated within the pale of the profession itself . I can not better conclude this portion of my story than by reading to you an extract from a letter addressed to me some time ago by Dr. William Budd , of Clifton , to whose insight and energy the town of Bristol owes so much in the way of sanitary improvement . ' As to the germ theory itself , ' writes Dr. Budd , that is a matter on which I have long since made up my mind . From the day when I first began to think of these subjects I have never had a doubt that the specific cause of contagious fevers must be living organisms . ' It is impossible , in fact , to make any statement bearing upon the essence or distinctive characters of these fevers , without using terms which are of all others the most distinctive of life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the germ theory , and , ten to one , you will find them full of such terms as " propagation , " " self-propagation , " " reproduction , " " self-multiplication , " and so on . Try as he may  --  if he has anything to say of those diseases which is characteristic of them  --  he can not evade the use of these terms , or the exact equivalents to them . While perfectly applicable to living things , these terms express qualities which are not only inapplicable to common chemical agents , but , as far as I can see , actually inconceivable of them . ' Cotton-wool Respirator . Once , then , established within the body , this evil form of life , if you will allow me to call it so , must run its course . Medicine as yet is powerless to arrest its progress , and the great point to be aimed at is to prevent its access to the body . It was with this thought in my mind that I ventured to recommend , more than a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I would here repeat my belief in their efficacy if properly constructed . But I do not wish to prejudice the use of these respirators , by connecting them indissolubly with the germ theory . There are too many trades in England where life is shortened and rendered miserable by the introduction of matters into the lungs which might be kept out of them . Dr. Greenhow has shown the stony grit deposited in the lungs of stonecutters . The black lungs of colliers is another case in point . In fact , a hundred obvious cases might be cited , and others that are not obvious might be added to them . We should not , for example , think that printing implied labour where the use of cotton-wool respirators might come into play ; but the fact is that the dust arising from the sorting of the type is very destructive of health . I went some time ago into a manufactory in one of our large towns , where iron vessels are enamelled by coating them with a mineral powder , and subjecting them to a heat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ establishment was excellent , and one thing only was needed to make it faultless . In a large room a number of women were engaged covering the vessels . The air was laden with the fine dust , and their faces appeared as white and bloodless as the powder with which they worked . By the use of cotton-wool respirators these women might be caused to breathe air as free from suspended matter as that of the open street . Over a year ago a Lancashire seedsman wrote to me , stating that during the seed season his men suffered horribly from irritation and fever , so that many of them left his service . He asked for help , and I gave him my advice . At the conclusion of the season , this year , he wrote to inform me that he had folded a little cotton-wool in muslin , and tied it in front of the mouth ; and that with this simple defence he had passed through the season in comfort , and without a single complaint from his men . Against the use of such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and heated by the breath . While casting about for a remedy for this , a friend forwarded to me from Newcastle a form of respirator invented by Mr. Carrick , a hotel-keeper at Glasgow , which , by a slight modification , may be caused to meet the case perfectly . The respirator , with its back in part removed , is shown in fig. 4 . Under the partition of wire-gauze q r , is a space intended by Mr. Carrick for ' medicated substances , ' and which may be filled with cotton-wool . The mouth is placed against the aperture o , which fits closely round the lips , and the filtered air enters the mouth through a light valve v , which is lifted by the act of inhalation . During exhalation this valve closes ; the breath escapes by a second valve , v ' , into the open air . The wool is thus kept dry and cool ; the air in passing through it being filtered of everything it holds in suspension . The respirator has since taken other forms . FIG. 4. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by our first unpractical experiments into a thicket of practical considerations . But another step is possible . Admiring , as I do , the bravery of our firemen , and hearing that smoke was a more serious enemy than flame itself , I thought of devising a fireman 's respirator . Our fire-escapes are each in charge of a single man , and it would be of obvious importance to place it in the power of each of those men to penetrate through the densest smoke , into the recesses of a house , and there to rescue those who would otherwise be suffocated or burnt . Cotton-wool , which so effectually arrested dust , was first tried ; but , though found soothing in certain gentle kinds of smoke , it was no match for the pungent fumes of a resinous fire . For the purpose of catching the atmospheric germs , M. Pouchet spread a film of glycerine on a plate of glass , urged air against the film , and examined the dust which stuck to it . The moistening of the cotton-wool with glycerine was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remain in dense smoke for three or four minutes , after which the irritation became unendurable . Reflection suggested that , besides the smoke , there must be numerous hydrocarbons produced , which , being in a state of vapour , would be very imperfectly arrested by the cotton-wool . These , in all probability , were the cause of the residual irritation ; and if these could be removed , a practically perfect respirator might possibly be obtained . I state the reasoning exactly as it occurred to my mind . Its result will be anticipated by many present . All bodies possess the power of condensing , in a greater or less degree , gases and vapours upon their surfaces , and when the condensing body is very porous , or in a fine state of division , the force of condensation may produce very remarkable effects . Thus , a clean piece of platinum-foil placed in a mixture of oxygen and hydrogen so squeezes the gases together as to cause them to combine ; and if the experiment be made with care , the heat of combination may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this action is greatly augmented by reducing the platinum to a state of fine division . A pellet of ' spongy platinum , ' for instance , plunged into a mixture of oxygen and hydrogen , causes the gases to explode instantly . In virtue of its extreme porosity , a similar power is possessed by charcoal . It is not strong enough to cause the oxygen and hydrogen to combine like the spongy platinum , but it so squeezes the more condensable vapours , and acts with such condensing power upon the oxygen of the air , as to bring both within the combining distance , thus enabling the oxygen to attack and destroy the vapours in the pores of the charcoal . In this way , effluvia of all kinds may be virtually burnt up ; and this is the principle of the excellent charcoal respirators invented by Dr. Stenhouse . Armed with one of these , you may go into the foulest-smelling places without having your nose offended . But , while powerful to arrest vapours , the charcoal respirator is ineffectual as regards smoke . The smoke-particles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such respirators , tested in a proper room , from half a minute to a minute was the limit of endurance . This might be exceeded by Faraday 's simple method of emptying the lungs completely , and then filling them before going into a smoky atmosphere . In fact , each solid smoke particle is itself a bit of charcoal , and carries on it , and in it , its little load of irritating vapour . It is this , far more than the particles of carbon themselves , that produces the irritation . Hence two causes of offence are to be removed : the carbon particles which convey the irritant by adhesion and condensation , and the free vapour which accompanies the particles . The cotton-wool moistened with glycerine I knew would arrest the first ; fragments of charcoal I hoped would stop the second . In the first fireman 's respirator , Mr. Carrick 's arrangement of two valves , the one for inhalation , the other for exhalation , was preserved . But the portion of the respirator which holds the filtering and absorbent substances , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( see fig. 5 ) . Under the partition of wire-gauze q r at the bottom of the space which fronts the mouth was placed a layer of cotton-wool , c , moistened with glycerine ; then a thin layer of dry wool , c ' ; then a layer of charcoal fragments ; and finally a second thin layer of dry cotton-wool . The succession of the layers may be changed without prejudice to the action . A wire-gauze cover , shown in plan under fig. 5 , keeps the substances from falling out of the respirator . A layer of caustic lime may be added for the absorption of carbonic acid ; but in the densest smoke that we have hitherto employed , it has not been found necessary , nor is it shown in the figure . In a flaming building , indeed , the mixture of air with the smoke never permits the carbonic acid to become so dense as to be irrespirable ; but in a place where the gas is present in undue quantity , the fragments of lime would materially mitigate its action . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stone walls , the first experiments were made . We Placed there furnaces containing resinous pine-wood , lighted the wood , and , placing over it a lid which prevented too brisk a circulation of the air , generated dense volumes of smoke . With our eyes protected by suitable glasses , my assistant and I have remained for half an hour and more in smoke so dense and pungent that a single inhalation , through the undefended mouth , would be perfectly unendurable . We might have prolonged our stay for hours . FIG. 5 . Having thus far perfected the instrument , I wrote to the chief officer of the Metropolitan Fire Brigade , asking him whether such a respirator would be of use to him . His reply was prompt ; it would be most valuable . He had , however , made himself acquainted with every contrivance of the kind in this and other countries , and had found none of them of any practical use . He offered to come and test it here , or to place a room at my disposal in the City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three of his men . Our small room was filled with smoke to their entire satisfaction . The three men went successively into it , and remained there as long as Captain Shaw wished them . On coming out they said that they had not suffered the slightest inconvenience ; that they could have remained all day in the smoke . Captain Shaw then tested the respirator with the same result , and he afterwards took great interest in the perfecting of the instrument . ***** Various ameliorations and improvements have recently been introduced into the smoke respirator . The hood of Captain Shaw has been improved upon by the simple and less expensive mouthpiece of Mr. Sinclair ; and this , in its turn , has been simplified and improved by my assistant Mr. John Cottrell . The respirator is now in considerable demand , and it has already done good practical service . Care is , however , necessary , in moistening the wool with glycerine . It must be carefully teazed , so that the individual fibres may be moistened , and clots must be avoided . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in some cases , have been used instead of cotton-wool : nothing equals the wool , when carefully treated . An experiment made last year brought out very conspicuously the necessity of careful packing , and the enormous comparative power of resisting smoke irritation possessed by our firemen , and the able officer who commands them . Having heard from Captain Shaw that , in some recent very trying experiments , he had obtained the best effects from dry cotton-wool , and thinking that I could not have been mistaken in my first results , which proved the dry so much inferior to the moistened wool and its associated charcoal , I proposed to Captain Shaw to bring the matter to a test at his workshops in the City . He was good enough to accept my proposal , and thither I went on May 7 , 1874 . The smoke was generated in a confined space from wet straw , and it was certainly very diabolical . At this season of the year I am usually somewhat shorn of vigour , and therefore not in the best condition for severe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my own person . With a respirator which had been in use some days previously , and which was not carefully packed , I followed a fireman into the smoke , he being provided with a dry-wool respirator . I was compelled to quit the place in about three minutes , while the fireman remained there for six or seven minutes . I then tried his respirator upon myself , and found that with it I could not remain more than a minute in the smoke ; in fact the first inhalation provoked coughing . Thinking that Captain Shaw himself might have lungs more like mine than those of his fireman , I proposed that we should try the respirators together ; but he informed me that his lungs were very strong . He was , however , good enough to accede to my request . Before entering the den a second time I repacked my respirator , with due care , and entered the smoke in company with Captain Shaw . I could hear him breathe long slow inhalations ; his labour was certainly greater than mine , and after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In seven and a half minutes he had to quit the place , thus proving that his lungs were able to endure the irritation seven times as long as mine could bear it . I continued in the smoke , with hardly any discomfort , for sixteen minutes , and certainly could have remained in it much longer . The advantage arising from the glycerine was thus placed beyond question . During this time I was in a condition to render very material assistance to a person in danger of suffocation . Helmholtz on Hay Fever . In my lecture on Dust and Disease in 1870 , I referred to an experiment made by Helmholtz upon himself which strikingly connected hay fever with animalcular life . About a year ago I received from Professor Binz of Bonn a short , but important paper , embracing Helmholtz 's account of his observation , to which Professor Binz has added some remarks of his own . The paper , being mainly intended for English medical men , was published in English , and though here and there its style might be amended , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I have observed ( says Professor Binz ) of recent English publications on the subject of hay fever , I am led to suppose that English authorities are inaccurately acquainted with the discovery of Professor Helmholtz , as far back as 1868 , of the existence of uncommon low organisms in the nasal secretions in this complaint , and of the possibility of arresting their action by the local employment of quinine . I therefore purpose to republish the letter in which he originally announced these facts to myself , and to add some further observations on this topic . The letter is as follows : Footnote : Cf. Virchow 's ' Archiv. ' vol. xlvi . ' I have suffered , as well as I can remember , since the year 1847 , from the peculiar catarrh called by the English " hay fever , " the speciality of which consists in its attacking its victims regularly in the hay season ( myself-between May 20 and the end of June ) , that it ceases in the cooler weather , but on the other hand quickly reaches a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . An extraordinary violent sneezing then sets in , and a strongly corrosive thin discharge , with which much epithelium is thrown off . This increases , after a few hours , to a painful inflammation of the mucous membrane and of the outside of the nose , and excites fever with severe headache and great depression , if the patient can not withdraw himself from the heat and the sunshine . In a cool room , however , these symptoms vanish as quickly as they come on , and there then only remains for a few days a lessened discharge and soreness , as if caused by the loss of epithelium . I remark , by the way , that in all my other years I had very little tendency to catarrh or catching cold , while the hay fever has never failed during the twenty-one years of which I have spoken , and has never attacked me earlier or later in the year than the times named . The condition is extremely troublesome , and increases , if one is obliged to be much exposed to the sun , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the disease on the season of the year suggested to me the thought that organisms might be the origin of the mischief . In examining the secretion I regularly found , in the last five years , certain vibrio-like bodies in it , which at other times I could not observe in my nasal secretion ... They are very small , and can only be recognised with the immersion-lens of a very good Hartnack 's microscope . It is characteristic of the common isolated single joints that they contain four nuclei in a row , of which two pairs are more closely united . The length of the joints is 0.004 millimetre . Upon the warm objective-stage they move with moderate activity , partly in , mere vibration , partly shooting backwards and forwards in the direction of their long axis ; in lower temperatures they are very inactive . Occasionally one finds them arranged in rows upon each other , or in branching series . Observed some days in the moist chamber , they vegetated again , and appeared somewhat larger and more conspicuous than immediately after their excretion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of secretion contains them which is expelled by violent sneezings ; that which drops slowly does not contain any . They stick tenaciously enough in the lower cavities and recesses of the nose . ' When I saw your first notice respecting the poisonous action of quinine upon infusoria , I determined at once to make an experiment with that substance , thinking that these vibrionic bodies , even if they did not cause the whole illness , still could render it much more unpleasant through their movements and the decompositions caused by them . For that reason I made a neutral solution of sulphate of quinine , which did not contain much of the salt ( 1.800 ) , but still was effective enough , and caused moderate irritation on the mucus membrane of the nose . I then lay flat on my back , keeping my head very low , and poured with a pipette about four cubic centimetres into both nostrils . Then I turned my head about in order to let the liquid flow in all directions . ' The desired effect was obtained immediately , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sun without fits of sneezing and the other disagreeable symptoms coming on . It was sufficient to repeat the treatment three times a day , even under the most unfavourable circumstances , in order to keep myself quite free . Footnote : There is no foundation for the objection that syringing the nose could not cure the asthma which accompanies hay fever ; for this asthma is only the reflex effect arising from the irritation of the nose .  --  B. There were then no such vibrios in the secretion . If I only go out in the evening , it suffices to inject the quinine once a day , just before going . After continuing this treatment for some days the symptoms disappear completely , but if I leave off they return till towards the end of June . ' My first experiments with quinine date from the summer of 1867 ; this year ( 1868 ) I began at once as soon as the first traces of the illness appeared , and I have thus been able to stop its development completely . ' I have hesitated as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no other patient Footnote : Helmholtz , now Professor of Physics at the University of Berlin , is , although M.D. , no medical practitioner .  --  B. on whom I could try the experiment . There is , it seems to me , no doubt , considering the extraordinary regularity in the recurrence and course of the illness , that quinine had here a most quick and decided effect . And this again makes my hypothesis very probable , that the vibrios , although of no specific form but a very frequent one , are at least the cause of the rapid increase of the symptoms in warm air , as heat excites them to lively action . I should be very glad if the above lines would induce medical men in England  --  the haunt of hay fever  --  to test the observation of Helmholtz . To most patients the application with the pipette may be too difficult or impossible ; I have therefore already suggested the use of Weber 's very simple but effective nose-douche . Also it will be advisable to apply the solution of quinine tepid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough that quinine is frequently adulterated , especially with cinchona , the action of which is much less to be depended upon . Dr. Frickhoefer , of Schwalbach , has communicated to me a second case in which hay fever was cured by local application of quinine . Footnote : Cf. Virchow 's ' Archiv. ' ( 1870 ) , vol. li . p. 176 . Professor Busch , of Bonn , authorises me to say that he succeeded in two cases of ' catarrhus aestivus ' by the same method : a third patient was obliged to abstain from the use of quinine , as it produced an unbearable irritation of the sensible nerves of the nose . In the autumn of 1872 Helmholtz told me that his fever was quite cured , and that in the meantime two other patients had , by his advice , tried this method , and with the same success . Footnote : Prof. Helmholtz , whom I had the pleasure of meeting in Switzerland last year , then told me that he was quite convinced that hay fever was produced by the pollen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VOYAGE TO ALGERIA TO OBSERVE THE ECLIPSE . 1870 . THE opening of the Eclipse Expedition was not propitious . Portsmouth , on Monday , December 5 , 1870 , was swathed by fog , which was intensified by smoke , and traversed by a drizzle of fine rain . At six P.M. I was on board the " Urgent . " On Tuesday morning the weather was too thick to permit of the ship 's being swung and her compasses calibrated . The Admiral of the port , a man of very noble presence , came on board . Under his stimulus the energy which the weather had damped appeared to become more active , and soon after his departure we steamed down to Spithead . Here the fog had so far lightened as to enable the officers to swing the ship . At three P.M. on Tuesday , December 6 , we got away , gliding successively past Whitecliff Bay , Bembridge , Sandown , Shanklin , Ventnor , and St. Catherine 's Lighthouse . On Wednesday morning we sighted the Isle of Ushant , on the French side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been fretted by the waves into detached tower-like masses of rock of very remarkable appearance . In the Channel the sea was green , and opposite Ushant it was a brighter green . On Wednesday evening we committed ourselves to the Bay of Biscay . The roll of the Atlantic was full , but not violent . There had been scarcely a gleam of sunshine throughout the day , but the cloud-forms were fine , and their apparent solidity impressive . On Thursday morning the green of the sea was displaced by a deep indigo blue . The whole of Thursday we steamed across the bay . We had little blue sky , but the clouds were again grand and varied  --  cirrus , stratus , cumulus , and nimbus , we had them all . Dusky hair-like trails were sometimes dropped from the distant clouds to the sea . These were falling showers , and they sometimes occupied the whole horizon , while we steamed across the rainless circle which was thus surrounded . Sometimes we plunged into the rain , and once or twice , by slightly changing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to time perfect rainbows spanned the heavens from side to side . At times a bow would appear in fragments , showing the keystone of the arch midway in air , and its two buttresses on the horizon . In all cases the light of the bow could be quenched by a Nicol 's prism , with its long diagonal tangent to the arc . Sometimes gleaming patches of the firmament were seen amid the clouds . When viewed in the proper direction , the gleam could be quenched by a Nicol 's prism , a dark aperture being thus opened into stellar space . At sunset on Thursday the denser clouds were fiercely fringed , while through the lighter ones seemed to issue the glow of a conflagration . On Friday morning we sighted Cape Finisterre  --  the extreme end of the arc which sweeps from Ushant round the Bay of Biscay . Calm spaces of blue , in which floated quietly scraps of cumuli , were behind us , but in front of us was a horizon of portentous darkness . It continued thus threatening throughout the day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at dinner it was difficult to preserve the plates and dishes from destruction . Our thinned company hinted that the rolling had other consequences . It was very wild when we went to bed . I slumbered and slept , but after some time was rendered anxiously conscious that my body had become a kind of projectile , with the ship 's side for a target . I gripped the edge of my berth to save myself from being thrown out . Outside , I could hear somebody say that he had been thrown from his berth , and sent spinning to the other side of the saloon . The screw laboured violently amid the lurching ; it incessantly quitted the water , and , twirling in the air , rattled against its bearings , causing the ship to shudder from stem to stern . At times the waves struck us , not with the soft impact which might be expected from a liquid , but with the sudden solid shock of battering-rams . ' No man knows the force of water , ' said one of the officers , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These blows followed each other at quicker intervals , the screw rattling after each of them , until , finally , the delivery of a heavier stroke than ordinary seemed to reduce the saloon to chaos . Furniture crashed , glasses rang , and alarmed enquiries immediately followed . Amid the noises I heard one note of forced laughter ; it sounded very ghastly . Men tramped through the saloon , and busy voices were heard aft , as if something there had gone wrong . I rose , and not without difficulty got into my clothes . In the after-cabin , under the superintendence of the able and energetic navigating lieutenant , Mr. Brown , a group of blue-jackets were working at the tiller-ropes . These had become loose , and the helm refused to answer the wheel . High moral lessons might be gained on shipboard , by observing what steadfast adherence to an object can accomplish , and what large effects are heaped up by the addition of infinitesimals . The tiller-rope , as the blue-jackets strained in concert , seemed hardly to move ; still it did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pull to the lurching of the ship , the mastery of the rudder was obtained . I had previously gone on deck . Round the saloon-door were a few members of the eclipse party , who seemed in no mood for scientific observation . Nor did I ; but I wished to see the storm . I climbed the steps to the poop , exchanged a word with Captain Toynbee , the only member of the party to be seen on the poop , and by his direction made towards a cleat not far from the wheel . Footnote : The cleat is a T-shaped mass of metal employed for the fastening of ropes . Round it I coiled my arms . With the exception of the men at the wheel , who stood as silent as corpses , I was alone . I had seen grandeur elsewhere , but this was a new form of grandeur to me . The " Urgent " is long and narrow , and during our expedition she lacked the steadying influence of sufficient ballast . She was for a time practically rudderless , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the long ridges , with some hundreds of feet between their crests , rolling upon the ship perfectly parallel to her sides . As they approached , they so grew upon the eye as to render the expression ' mountains high ' intelligible . At all events , there was no mistaking their mechanical might , as they took the ship upon their shoulders , and swung her like a pendulum . The deck sloped sometimes at an angle which I estimated at over forty-five degrees ; wanting my previous Alpine practice , I should have felt less confidence in my grip of the cleat . Here and there the long rollers were tossed by interference into heaps of greater height . The wind caught their crests , and scattered them over the sea , the whole surface of which was seething white . The aspect of the clouds was a fit accompaniment to the fury of the ocean . The moon was almost full  --  at times concealed , at times revealed , as the scud flew wildly over it . These things appealed to the eye , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the whistle and boom of the storm . Nor was the outward agitation the only object of interest to me . I was at once subject and object to myself , and watched with intense interest the workings of my own mind . The " Urgent " is an elderly ship . She had been built , I was told , by a contracting firm for some foreign Government , and had been diverted from her first purpose when converted into a troop-ship . She had been for some time out of work , and I had heard that one of her boilers , at least , needed repair . Our scanty but excellent crew , moreover , did not belong to the " Urgent , " but had been gathered from other ships . Our three lieutenants were also volunteers . All this passed swiftly through my mind as the steamer shook under the blows of the waves , and I thought that probably no one on board could say how much of this thumping and straining the " Urgent " would be able to bear . This uncertainty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I tried to strengthen myself in the face of it . But at length the helm laid hold of the water , and the ship was got gradually round to face the waves . The rolling diminished , a certain amount of pitching taking its place . Our speed had fallen from eleven knots to two . I went again to bed . After a space of calm , when we seemed crossing the vortex of a storm , heavy tossing recommenced . I was afraid to allow myself to fall asleep , as my berth was high , and to be pitched out of it might be attended with bruises , if not with fractures . From Friday at noon to Saturday at noon we accomplished sixty-six miles , or an average of less than three miles an hour . I overheard the sailors talking about this storm . The " Urgent , " according to those that knew her , had never previously experienced anything like it . Footnote : ' There is , it will be seen , a fair agreement between these impressions and those so vigorously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' All through Saturday the wind , though somewhat sobered , blew dead against us . The atmospheric effects were exceedingly fine . The cumuli resembled mountains in shape , and their peaked summits shone as white as Alpine snows . At one place this resemblance was greatly strengthened by a vast area of cloud , uniformly illuminated , and lying like a neve below the peaks . From it fell a kind of cloud-river strikingly like a glacier . The horizon at sunset was remarkable  --  spaces of brilliant green between clouds of fiery red . Rainbows had been frequent throughout the day , and at night a perfectly continuous lunar bow spanned the heavens from side to side . Its colours were feeble ; but , contrasted with the black ground against which it rested , its luminousness was extraordinary . Sunday morning found us opposite to Lisbon , and at midnight we rounded Cape St. Vincent , where the lurching seemed disposed to recommence . Through the kindness of Lieutenant Walton , a cot had been slung for me . It hung between a tiller-wheel and a flue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banging of the cot against its boundaries . But the wind was now behind us , and we went along at a speed of eleven knots . We felt certain of reaching Cadiz by three . But a new lighthouse came in sight , which some affirmed to be Cadiz Lighthouse , while the surrounding houses were declared to be those of Cadiz itself . Out of deference to these statements , the navigating lieutenant changed his course , and steered for the place . A pilot came on board , and he informed us that we were before the mouth of the Guadalquivir , and that the lighthouse was that of Cipiona . Cadiz was still some eighteen miles distant . We steered towards the city , hoping to get into the harbour before dark . But the pilot who would have guided us had been snapped up by another vessel , and we did not get in . We beat about during the night , and in the morning found ourselves about fifteen miles from Cadiz . The sun rose behind the city , and we steered straight into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , round which swarmed apparently a multitude of chimney-stacks . A nearer approach showed the chimneys to be small turrets . A pilot was taken on board ; for there is a dangerous shoal in the harbour . The appearance of the town as the sun shone upon its white and lofty walls was singularly beautiful . We cast anchor ; some officials arrived and demanded a clean bill of health . We had none . They would have nothing to do with us ; so the yellow quarantine flag was hoisted , and we waited for permission to land the Cadiz party . After some hours ' delay the English consul and vice-consul came on board , and with them a Spanish officer ablaze with gold lace and decorations . Under slight pressure the requisite permission had been granted . We landed our party , and in the afternoon weighed anchor . Thanks to the kindness of our excellent paymaster , I was here transferred to a more roomy berth . Cadiz soon sank beneath the sea , and we sighted in succession Cape Trafalgar , Tarifa , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the moon rose in a quiet heaven . She swung with her convex surface downwards , the common boundary between light and shadow being almost horizontal . A pillar of reflected light shimmered up to us from the slightly rippled sea . I had previously noticed the phosphorescence of the water , but tonight it was stronger than usual , especially among the foam at the bows . A bucket let down into the sea brought up a number of the little sparkling organisms which caused the phosphorescence . I caught some of them in my hand . And here an appearance was observed which was new to most of us , and strikingly beautiful to all . Standing at the bow and looking forwards , at a distance of forty or fifty yards from the ship , a number of luminous streamers were seen rushing towards us . On nearing the vessel they rapidly turned , like a comet round its perihelion , placed themselves side by side , and , in parallel trails of light , kept up with the ship . One of them placed itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These comets of the sea were joined at intervals by others . Sometimes as many as six at a time would rush at us , bend with extraordinary rapidity round a sharp curve , and afterwards keep us company . I leaned over the bow , and scanned the streamers closely . The frontal portion of each of them revealed the outline of a porpoise . The rush of the creatures through the water had started the phosphorescence , every spark of which was converted by the motion of the retina into a line of light . Each porpoise was thus wrapped in a luminous sheath . The phosphorescence did not cease at the creature 's tail , but was carried many porpoise-lengths behind it . To our right we had the African hills , illuminated by the moon . Gibraltar Rock at length became visible , but the town remained long hidden by a belt of haze , through which at length the brighter lamps struggled . It was like the gradual resolution of a nebula into stars . As the intervening depth became gradually less , the mist vanished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through it They formed a bright foil to the sombre mass of rock above them . The sea was so calm and the scene so lovely that Mr. Huggins and myself stayed on deck till near midnight , when the ship was moored . During our walking to and fro a striking enlargement of the disk of Jupiter was observed , whenever the heated air of the funnel came between us and the planet . On passing away from the heated air , the flat dim disk would immediately shrink to a luminous point . The effect was one of visual persistence . The retinal image of the planet was set quivering in all azimuths by the streams of heated air , describing in quick succession minute lines of light , which summed themselves to a disk of sensible area . At six o'clock next morning , the gun at the Signal Station on the summit of the rock , boomed . At eight the band on board the ' Trafalgar ' training-ship , which was in the harbour , struck up the national anthem ; and immediately afterwards a crowd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ removal of the apparatus belonging to the Gibraltar party we went on shore . Winter was in England when we left , but here we had the warmth of summer . The vegetation was luxuriant  --  palm-trees , cactuses , and aloes , all ablaze with scarlet flowers . A visit to the Governor was proposed , as an act of necessary courtesy , and I accompanied Admiral Ommaney and Mr. Huggins to ' the Convent , ' or Government House . We sent in our cards , waited for a time , and were then conducted by an orderly to his Excellency . He is a fine old man , over six feet high , and of frank military bearing . He received us and conversed with us in a very genial manner . He took us to see his garden , his palms , his shaded promenades , and his orange-trees loaded with fruit , in all of which he took manifest delight . Evidently ' the hero of Kars ' had fallen upon quarters after his own heart . He appeared full of good nature , and engaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We sought the town-major for a pass to visit the lines . While awaiting his arrival I purchased a stock of white glass bottles , with a view to experiments on the colour of the sea . Mr. Huggins and myself , who wished to see the rock , were taken by Captain Salmond to the library , where a model of Gibraltar is kept , and where we had a useful preliminary lesson . At the library we met Colonel Maberly , a courteous and kindly man , who gave us good advice regarding our excursion . He sent an orderly with us to the entrance of the lines . The orderly handed us over to an intelligent Irishman , who was directed to show us everything that we desired to see , and to hide nothing from us . We took the ' upper line , ' traversed the galleries hewn through the limestone ; looked through the embrasures , which opened like doors in the precipice , towards the hills of Spain ; reached St. George 's hall , and went still higher , emerging on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen . Beyond were the Spanish lines , marked by a line of white sentry-boxes ; nearer were the English lines , less conspicuously indicated ; and between both was the neutral ground . Behind the Spanish lines rose the conical hill called the Queen of Spain 's Chair . The general aspect of the mainland from the rock is bold and rugged . Doubling back from the galleries , we struck upwards towards the crest , reached the Signal Station , where we indulged in ' shandy-gaff ' and bread and cheese . Thence to O'Hara 's Tower , the highest point of the rock . It was built by a former Governor , who , forgetful of the laws of terrestrial curvature , thought he might look from the tower into-the port of Cadiz . The tower is riven , and it may be climbed along the edges of the crack . We got to the top of it ; thence descended the curious Mediterranean Stair  --  a zigzag , mostly of steps down a steeply falling slope , amid palmetto brush , aloes , and prickly pear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ' Governor 's Cottage ' by a car , and drove afterwards to the lighthouse at Europa Point . The tower was built , I believe , by Queen Adelaide , and it contains a fine dioptric apparatus of the first order , constructed by Messrs . Chance , of Birmingham . At the appointed hour we were at the Convent . During dinner the same genial traits which appeared in the morning were still more conspicuous . The freshness of the Governor 's nature showed itself best when he spoke of his old antagonist in arms , Mouravieff . Chivalry in war is consistent with its stern prosecution . These two men were chivalrous , and after striking the last blow became friends for ever . Our kind and courteous reception at Gibraltar is a thing to be remembered with pleasure . On December 15 we committed ourselves to the Mediterranean . The views of Gibraltar with which we are most acquainted represent it as a huge ridge ; but its aspect , end on , both from the Spanish lines and from the other side , is truly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the back of the rock , which I was disposed to regard simply as the debris of the limestone . I wished to let myself down upon it , but had not the time . My friend Mr. Busk , however , assures me that it is silica , and that the same sand constitutes the adjacent neutral ground . There are theories afloat as to its having been blown from Sahara . The Mediterranean throughout this first day , and indeed throughout the entire voyage to Oran , was of a less deep blue than the Atlantic . Possibly the quantity of organisms may have modified the colour . At night the phosphorescence was startling , breaking suddenly out along the crests of the waves formed by the port and starboard bows . Its strength was not uniform . Having flashed brilliantly for a time , it would in part subside , and afterwards regain its vigour . Several large phosphorescent masses of weird appearance also floated past . On the morning of the 16th we sighted the fort and lighthouse of Marsa el Kibir , and beyond them the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bay , sheltered by dominant hills . The sun was shining brightly ; during our whole voyage we had not had so fine a day . The wisdom which had led us to choose Oran as our place of observation seemed demonstrated . A rather excitable pilot came on board , and he guided us in behind the Mole , which had suffered much damage the previous year from an unexplained outburst of waves from the Mediterranean . Both port and bow anchors were cast in deep water . With three huge hawsers the ship 's stem was made fast to three gun-pillars fixed in the Mole ; and here for a time the " Urgent " rested from her labours . M. Janssen , who had rendered his name celebrated by his observations of the eclipse in India in 1868 , when he showed the solar flames to be eruptions of incandescent hydrogen , was already encamped in the open country about eight miles from Oran . On December 2 he had quitted Paris in a balloon , with a strong young sailor as his assistant , had descended near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and received from him encouragement and aid . On the day of our arrival his encampment was visited by Mr. Huggins , and the kind and courteous Engineer of the Port drove me subsequently , in his own phaeton , to the place . It bore the best repute as regards freedom from haze and fog , and commanded an open outlook ; but it was inconvenient for us on account of its distance from the ship . The place next in repute was the railway station , between two and three miles distant from the Mole . It was inspected , but , being enclosed , was abandoned for an eminence in an adjacent garden , the property of Mr. Hinshelwood , a Scotchman who had settled some years previously as an Esparto merchant in Oran . Footnote : Esparto is a kind of grass now much used in the manufacture of paper . He , in the most liberal manner , placed his ground at the disposition of the party . Here the tents were pitched , on the Saturday , by Captain Salmond and his intelligent corps of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cover of the tents . Close to the railway station runs a new loopholed wall of defence , through which the highway passes into the open country . Standing on the highway , and looking southwards , about twenty yards to the right is a small bastionet , intended to carry a gun or two . Its roof I thought would form an admirable basis for my telescope , while the view of the surrounding country was unimpeded in all directions . The authorities kindly allowed me the use of this bastionet . Two men , one a blue-jacket named Elliot , and the other a marine named Hill , were placed at my disposal by Lieutenant Walton ; and , thus aided , on Monday morning I mounted my telescope . The instrument was new to me , and some hours of discipline were spent in mastering all the details of its manipulation . Mr. Huggins joined me , and we visited together the Arab quarter of Oran . The flat-roofed houses appeared very clean and white . The street was filled with loiterers , and the thresholds were occupied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine . We saw many straight , manly fellows who must have been six feet four in height . They passed us with perfect indifference , evincing no anger , suspicion , or curiosity , hardly caring in fact to glance at us as we passed . In one instance only during my stay at Oran was I spoken to by an Arab . He was a tall , good-humoured fellow , who came smiling up to me , and muttered something about ' les Anglais . ' The mixed population of Oran is picturesque in the highest degree : the Jews , rich and poor , varying in their costumes as their wealth varies ; the Arabs more picturesque still , and of all shades of complexion  --  the negroes , the Spaniards , the French , all grouped together , each race preserving its own individuality , formed a picture intensely interesting to me . On Tuesday , the 20th , I was early at the bastionet . The night had been very squally . The sergeant of the sappers had taken charge of our key , and on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the intelligence that the tents had been blown down , and the instruments overturned . Among these was a large and valuable equatorial from the Royal Observatory , Greenwich . It seemed hardly possible that this instrument , with its wheels and verniers and delicate adjustments , could have escaped uninjured from such a fall . This , however , was the case ; and during the day all the overturned instruments were restored to their places , and found to be in practical working order . This and the following day were devoted to incessant schooling . I had come out as a general stargazer , and not with the intention of devoting myself to the observation of any particular phenomenon . I wished to see the whole  --  the first contact , the advance of the moon , the successive swallowing up of the solar spots , the breaking of the last line of crescent by the lunar mountains into Bailey 's beads , the advance of the shadow through the air , the appearance of the corona and prominences at the moment of totality , the radiant streamer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flames , a glance through a polariscope , a sweep round the landscape with the naked eye , the reappearance of the soar limb through Bailey 's beads , and , finally , the retreat of the lunar shadow through the air . I was provided with a telescope of admirable definition , mounted , adjusted , packed , and most liberally placed at my disposal by Mr. Warren De La Rue . The telescope grasped the whole of the sun , and a considerable portion of the space surrounding it . But it would not take in the extreme limits of the corona . For this I had lashed on to the large telescope a light but powerful instrument , constructed by Ross , and lent to me by Mr. Huggins . I was also furnished with an excellent binocular by Mr. Dallmeyer . In fact , no man could have been more efficiently supported . It required a strict parcelling out of the interval of totality to embrace in it the entire series of observations . These , while the sun remained visible , were to be made with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fraction of the sun 's light , this fraction , being still further toned down by a dark glass . At the moment of totality the dark glass was to be removed , and a silver reflector pushed in , so as to get the maximum of light from the corona and prominences The time of totality was distributed as follows : 1 . Observe approach of shadow through the air : totality . 2 . Telescope 30 seconds . 3 . Finder 30 seconds . 4 . Double image prism 15 seconds . 5 . Naked eye 10 seconds . 6 . Finder or binocular 20 seconds . 7 . Telescope 20 seconds . 8 . Observe retreat of shadow . In our rehearsals Elliot stood beside me , watch in hand , and furnished with a lantern . He called out at the end of each interval , while I moved from telescope to finder , from finder to polariscope , from polariscope to naked eye , from naked eye back to finder , from finder to telescope , abandoning the instrument finally to observe the retreating shadow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the actual sun , and keeping him in the middle of the field . It was my object to render the repetition of the lesson so mechanical as to leave no room for flurry , forgetfulness , or excitement . Volition was not to be called upon , nor judgment exercised , but a well-beaten path of routine was to be followed . Had the opportunity occurred , I think the programme would have been strictly carried out . But the opportunity did not occur . For several days the weather had been ill-natured . We had wind so strong As to render the hawsers at the stern of the " Urgent " as rigid as iron , and to destroy the navigating lieutenant 's sleep . We had clouds , a thunder-storm , and some rain . Still the hope was held out that the atmosphere would cleanse itself , and if it did we were promised air of extraordinary limpidity . Early on the 22nd we were all at our posts . Spaces of blue in the early morning gave us some encouragement , but all depended on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Which of them were to grow as the day advanced ? The wind was high , and to secure the steadiness of my instrument I was forced to retreat behind a projection of the bastionet , place stones upon its stand , and , further , to avail myself of the shelter of a sail . My practised men fastened the sail at the top , and loaded it with boulders at the bottom . It was tried severely , but it stood firm . The clouds and blue spaces fought for a time with varying success . The sun was bidden and revealed at intervals , hope oscillating in synchronism with the changes of the sky . At the moment of first contact a dense cloud intervened ; but a minute or two afterwards the cloud had passed , and the encroachment of the black body of the moon was evident upon the solar disk . The moon marched onward , and I saw it at frequent intervals ; a large group of spots were approached and swallowed up . Subsequently I caught sight of the lunar limb as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spot was not to be distinguished from the moon , but rose like a mountain above it . The clouds , when thin , could be seen as grey scud drifting across the black surface of the moon ; but they thickened more and more , and made the intervals of clearness scantier . During these moments I watched with an interest bordering upon fascination the march of the silver sickle of the sun across the field of the telescope . It was so sharp and so beautiful . No trace of the lunar limb could be observed beyond the sun 's boundary . Here , indeed , it could only be relieved by the corona , which was utterly cut off by the dark glass . The blackness of the moon beyond the sun was , in fact , confounded with the blackness of space . Beside me was Elliot with the watch and lantern , while Lieutenant Archer , of the Royal Engineers , had the kindness to take charge of my note-book . I mentioned , and he wrote rapidly down , such things as seemed worthy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but it was all to no purpose . A patch of sunlight fell and rested upon the landscape some miles away . It was the only illuminated spot within view . But to the north-west there was still a space of blue which might reach us in time . Within seven minutes of totality another space towards the zenith became very dark . The atmosphere was , as it were , on the brink of a precipice , being charged with humidity , which required but a slight chill to bring it down in clouds . This was furnished by the withdrawal of the solar beams : the clouds did come down , covering up the space of blue on which our hopes had so long rested . I abandoned the telescope and walked to and fro in despair . As the moment of totality approached , the descent towards darkness was as obvious as a falling stone . I looked towards a distant ridge , where the darkness would first appear . At the moment a fan of beams , issuing from the hidden sun , was spread out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alternate light and shade , produced in illuminated haze by the shadows of floating cloudlets of varying density . The beams are practically parallel , but by an effect of perspective they appear divergent , having the sun , in fact , for their point of convergence . The darkness took possession of the ridge referred to , lowered upon M. Janssen 's observatory , passed over the southern heavens , blotting out the beams as if a sponge had been drawn across them . It then took successive possession of three spaces of blue sky in the south-eastern atmosphere . I again looked towards the ridge . A glimmer as of day-dawn was behind it , and immediately afterwards the fan of beams , which had been for more than two minutes absent , revived . The eclipse of 1870 had ended , and , as far as the corona and flames were concerned , we had been defeated . Even in the heart of the eclipse the darkness was by no means perfect . Small print could be read . In fact , the clouds which rendered the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rendered the darkness less intense than it would have been had the atmosphere been without cloud . In the more open spaces I sought for stars , but could find none . There was a lull in the wind before and after totality , but during the totality the wind was strong . I waited for some time on the bastionet , hoping to get a glimpse of the moon on the opposite border of the sun , but in vain . The clouds continued , and some rain fell . The day brightened somewhat afterwards , and , having packed all up , in the sober twilight Mr. Crookes and myself climbed the heights above the fort of Vera Cruz . From this eminence we had a very noble view over the Mediterranean and the flanking African hills . The sunset was remarkable , and the whole outlook exceedingly fine . The able and well-instructed medical officer of the " Urgent , " Mr. Goodman , observed the following temperatures during the progress of the eclipse : Hour Deg. 11.45 56 11.55 55 12.10 54 12.37 53 12.39 52 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The minimum temperature occurred some minutes after totality , when a slight rain fell . The wind was so strong on the 23rd that Captain Henderson would not venture out . Guided by Mr. Goodman , I visited a cave in a remarkable stratum of shell-breccia , and , thanks to my guide , secured specimens . Mr. Busk informs me that a precisely similar breccia , is found at Gibraltar , at approximately the same level . During the afternoon , Admiral Ommaney and myself drove to the fort of Marsa el Kibir . The fortification is of ancient origin , the Moorish arches being still there in decay , but the fort is now very strong . About four or five hundred fine-looking dragoons were looking after their horses , waiting for a lull to enable them to embark for France . One of their officers was wandering in a very solitary fashion over the fort . We had some conversation with him . He had been at Sedan , had been taken prisoner , but had effected his escape . He shook his head when we spoke of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continuance . There was bitterness in his tone as he spoke of the charges of treason so lightly levelled against French commanders . The green waves raved round the promontory on which the fort stands , smiting the rocks , breaking into foam , and jumping , after impact , to a height of a hundred feet and more into the air . As we returned our vehicle broke down through the loss of a wheel . The Admiral went on board , while I remained long watching the agitated sea . The little horses of Oran well merit a passing word . Their speed and endurance , both of which are heavily drawn upon by their drivers , are extraordinary . The wind sinking , we lifted anchor on the 24th . For some hours we went pleasantly along ; but during the afternoon the storm revived , and it blew heavily against us all the night . When we came opposite the Bay of Almeria , on the 25th , the captain turned the ship , and steered into the bay , where , under the shadow of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Next morning ' a rose of dawn ' rested on the snows of the adjacent mountains , while a purple haze was spread over the lower hills . I had no notion that Spain possessed so fine a range of mountains as the Sierra Nevada . The height is considerable , but the form also is such as to get the maximum of grandeur out of the height . We weighed anchor at eight A.M. , passing for a time through shoal water , the bottom having been evidently stirred up . The adjacent land seemed eroded in a remarkable manner . It has its floods , which excavate these valleys and ravines , and leave those singular ridges behind . Towards evening I climbed the mainmast , and , standing on the cross-trees , saw the sun set amid a blaze of fiery clouds . The wind was strong and bitterly cold , and I was glad to slide back to the deck along a rope , which stretched from the mast-head to the ship 's side . That night we cast anchor beside the Mole of Gibraltar . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends , I drove to the Spanish lines , with the view of seeing the rock from that side . It is an exceedingly noble mass . The Peninsular and Oriental mail-boat had been signalled and had come . Heavy duties called me homeward , and by transferring myself from the " Urgent " to the mail-steamer I should gain three days . I hired a boat , rowed to the steamer , learned that she was to start at one , and returned with all speed to the " Urgent . " Making known to Captain Henderson my wish to get away , he expressed doubts as to the possibility of reaching the mail-steamer in time . With his accustomed kindness , he however placed a boat at my disposal . Four hardy fellows and one of the ship 's officers jumped into it ; my luggage , hastily thrown together , was tumbled in , and we were immediately on our way . We had nearly four miles to row in about twenty minutes ; but we hoped the mail-boat might not be punctual . For a time we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came nearer , but the flags were not yet hauled in . The men put forth all their strength , animated by the exhortations of the officer at the helm . The roughness of the sea rendered their efforts to some extent nugatory : still we were rapidly approaching the steamer . At length she moved , punctual almost to the minute , at first slowly , but soon with quickened pace . We turned to the left , so as to cut across her bows . Five minutes ' pull would have brought us up to her . The officer waved his cap and I my hat . ' If they could only see us , they might back to us in a moment . ' But they did not see us , or if they did , they paid us no attention . I returned to the " Urgent , " discomfited , but grateful to the fine fellows who had wrought so hard to carry out my wishes . Glad of the quiet , in the sober afternoon I took a walk towards Europa Point . The sky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were at the Convent , and the kind and courteous Governor had sent cards to the eclipse party . I failed in my duty in not going . St. Michael 's Cave is said to rival , if it does not outrival , the Mammoth Cave of Kentucky . On the 28th Mr. Crookes , Mr. Carpenter , and myself , guided by a military policeman who understood his work , explored the cavern . The mouth is about 1,100 feet above the sea . We zigzagged up to it , and first were led into an aperture in the rock , at some height above the true entrance of the cave . In this upper cavern we saw some tall and beautiful stalactite pillars . The water drips from the roof charged with bicarbonate of lime . Exposed to the air , the carbonic acid partially escapes , and the simple carbonate of lime , which is hardly at all soluble in water , deposits itself as a solid , forming stalactites and stalagmites . Even the exposure of chalk or limestone water to the open air partially softens it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Graham , Miller , and Hofmann , in a shallow basin , fell from eighteen degrees to nine degrees of hardness . The softening process of Clark is virtually a hastening of the natural process . Here , however , instead of being permitted to evaporate , half the carbonic acid is appropriated by lime , the half thus taken up , as well as the remaining half , being precipitated . The solid precipitate is permitted to sink , and the clear supernatant liquid is limpid soft water . We returned to the real mouth of St. Michael 's Cave , which is entered by a wicket . The floor was somewhat muddy , and the roof and walls were wet . We soon found ourselves in the midst of a natural temple , where tall columns sprang complete from floor to roof , while incipient columns were growing to meet each other , upwards and downwards . The water which trickles from the stalactite , after having in part yielded up its carbonate of lime , falls upon the floor vertically underneath , and there builds the stalagmite . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , along the same vertical . It is easy to distinguish the stalagmitic from the stalactitic portion of the pillars . The former is always divided into short segments by protuberant rings , as if deposited periodically , while the latter presents a uniform surface . In some cases the points of inverted cones of stalactite rested on the centres of pillars of stalagmite . The process of solidification and the consequent architecture were alike beautiful . We followed our guide through various branches and arms of the cave , climbed and descended steps , halted at the edges of dark shafts and apertures , and squeezed ourselves through narrow passages . From time to time we halted , while Mr. Crookes illuminated with ignited magnesium wire , the roof , columns , dependent spears , and graceful drapery of the stalactites . Once , coming to a magnificent cluster of icicle-like spears , we helped ourselves to specimens . There was some difficulty in detaching the more delicate ones , their fragility was so great . A consciousness of vandalism , which smote me at the time , haunts me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this beauty ought not to be at all invaded . Pendent from the roof , in their natural habitat , nothing can exceed their delicate beauty ; they live , as it were , surrounded by organic connections . In London they are curious , but not beautiful . Of gathered shells Emerson writes : I wiped away the weeds and foam , And brought my sea-born treasures home But the poor , unsightly , noisome things Had left their beauty on the shore , With the sun , and the sand , and the wild uproar . The promontory of Gibraltar is so burrowed with caverns that it has been called the Hill of Caves . They are apparently related to the geologic disturbances which the rock has undergone . The earliest of these is the tilting of the once horizontal strata . Suppose a force of torsion to act upon the promontory at its southern extremity near Europa Point , and suppose the rock to be of a partially yielding character ; such a force would twist the strata into screw-surfaces , the greatest amount of twisting being endured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a twisting the rock appears to have suffered ; but instead of the twist fading gradually and uniformly off , in passing from south to north , the want of uniformity in the material has produced lines of dislocation where there are abrupt changes in the amount of twist . Thus , at the northern end of the rock the dip to the west is nineteen degrees ; in the Middle Hill , it is thirty-eight degrees ; in the centre of the South hill , or Sugar Loaf , it is fifty-seven degrees . At the southern extremity of the Sugar Loaf strata are vertical , while farther to the south they actually turn over and dip to the east . The rock is thus divided into three sections , separated from each other by places of dislocation , where the strata are much wrenched and broken . These are called the Northern and Southern Quebrada , from the Spanish ' Tierra Quebrada , ' or broken ground . It is at these places that the inland caves of Gibraltar are almost exclusively found . Based on the observations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account of these ' caves , and of the human remains and works of art which they contain , was communicated by Mr. Busk to the meeting of the Congress of Prehistoric Archaeology at Norwich , and afterwards printed in the ' Transactions ' of the Congress . Footnote : In this essay Mr. Busk refers to the previous labours of Mr. Smith , of Jordan Hill , to whom we owe most of our knowledge of the geology of the rock . Long subsequent to the operation of the twisting force just referred to , the promontory underwent various changes of level . There are sea-terraces and layers of shell-breccia along its flanks , and numerous caves which , unlike the inland ones , are the product of marine erosion . The Ape 's Hill , on the African side of the strait , Mr. Busk informs me has undergone similar disturbances . Footnote : No one can rise from the perusal of Mr. Busk 's paper without a feeling of admiration for the principal discoverer and indefatigable explorer of the Gibraltar caves , the late Captain Frederick Brome. ***** @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our departure , I resumed a series of observations on the colour of the sea . On the way out a number of specimens had been collected , with a view to subsequent examination . But the bottles were claret bottles , of doubtful purity . At Gibraltar , therefore , I purchased fifteen white glass bottles , with ground glass stoppers , and at Cadiz , thanks to the friendly guidance of Mr. Cameron , I secured a dozen more . These seven-and-twenty bottles were filled with water , taken at different places between Oran and Spithead . And here let me express my warmest acknowledgments to Captain Henderson , the commander of H.M.S. " Urgent , " who aided me in my observations in every possible way . Indeed , my thanks are due to all the officers for their unfailing courtesy and help . The captain placed at my disposal his own coxswain , an intelligent fellow named Thorogood , who skilfully attached a cord to each bottle , weighted it with lead , cast it into the sea , and , after three successive rinsings , filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , buckets , or other vessels was thus avoided ; and even the necessity of pouring out the water , afterwards , through the dirty London air . The mode of examination applied to these bottles has been already described . Footnote : On Dust and Disease , p. 168 . The liquid is illuminated by a powerfully condensed beam , its condition being revealed through the light scattered by its suspended particles . ' Care is taken to defend the eye from the access of all other light , and , thus defended , it becomes an organ of inconceivable delicacy . ' Were water of uniform density perfectly free from suspended matter , it would , in my opinion , scatter no light at all . The track of a luminous beam could not be seen in such water . But ' an amount of impurity so infinitesimal as to be scarcely expressible in numbers , and the individual particles of which are so small as wholly to elude the microscope , may , when examined by the method alluded to , produce not only sensible , but striking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the examination of nineteen bottles filled at various places between Gibraltar and Spithead , are here tabulated : No . Locality Colour of Sea Appearance in Luminous beam 1 Gibraltar Harbour Green Thick with fine particles 2 Two miles Clearer green Thick with very from Gibraltar fine particles 3 Off Cabreta Point Bright green Still thick , but less so 4 Off Cabreta Point Black-indigo Much less thick , very pure 5 Off Tarifa Undecided Thicker than No. 4 6 Beyond Tarifa Cobalt-blue Much purer than No. 5 7 Twelve miles Yellow-green Very thick from Cadiz 8 Cadiz Harbour Yellow-green Exceedingly thick 9 Fourteen miles Yellow-green Thick , but less so from Cadiz 10 Fourteen miles Bright green Much less thick from Cadiz 11 Between Capes Deep Indigo Very little matter , St. Mary and Vincent very pure 12 Off the Burlings . Strong green Thick , with fine matter 13 Beyond the Burlings Indigo Very little matter , pure 14 Off Cape Finisterre Undecided Less pure 15 Bay of Biscay Black-indigo Very little matter , very pure 16 Bay of Biscay Indigo Very fine matter . Iridescent 17 Off Ushant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Catherine 's Yellow-green Exceedingly thick 19 Spithead Green Exceedingly thick Here we have three specimens of water , described as green , a clearer green , and bright green , taken in Gibraltar Harbour , at a point two miles from the harbour , and off Cabreta Point . The home examination showed the first to be thick with suspended matter , the second less thick , and the third still less thick . Thus the green brightened as the suspended matter diminished in amount . Previous to the fourth observation our excellent navigating lieutenant , Mr. Brown , steered along the coast , thus avoiding the adverse current which sets in , through the Strait , from the Atlantic to the Mediterranean . He was at length forced to cross the boundary of the Atlantic current , which was defined with extraordinary sharpness . On the one side of it the water was a vivid green , on the other a deep blue . Standing at the bow of the ship , a bottle could be filled with blue water , while at the same moment a bottle cast from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottles were secured , one on each side of this remarkable boundary . In the distance the Atlantic had the hue called ultra-marine ; but looked fairly down upon , it was of almost inky blackness  --  black qualified by a trace of indigo . What change does the home examination here reveal ? In passing to indigo , the water becomes suddenly augmented in purity , the suspended matter becoming suddenly less . Off Tarifa , the deep indigo disappears , and the sea is undecided in colour . Accompanying this change , we have a rise in the quantity of suspended matter . Beyond Tarifa , we change to cobalt-blue , the suspended matter falling at the same time in quantity . This water is distinctly purer than the green . We approach Cadiz , and at twelve miles from the city get into yellow-green water ; this the London examination shows to be thick with suspended matter . The same is true of Cadiz harbour , and also of a point fourteen miles from Cadiz in the homeward direction . Here there is a sudden change from yellow-green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sudden fall in the quantity of suspended matter . Between Cape St. Mary and Cape St : Vincent the water changes to the deepest indigo , a further diminution of the suspended matter being the concomitant phenomenon . We now reach the remarkable group of rocks called the Burlings , and find the water between the shore and the rocks a strong green ; the home examination shows it to be thick with fine matter . Fifteen or twenty miles beyond the Burlings we come again into indigo water , from which the suspended matter has in great part disappeared . Off Cape Finisterre , about the place where the ' Captain ' went down , the water becomes green , and the home examination pronounces it to be thicker . Then we enter the Bay of Biscay , where the indigo resumes its power , and where the home examination shows the greatly augmented purity of the water . A second specimen of water , taken from the Bay of Biscay , held in suspension fine particles of a peculiar kind ; the size of them was such as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , blue , or salmon-coloured , according to the direction of the line of vision . Finally , we come to our last two bottles , the one taken opposite St. Catherine 's lighthouse , in the Isle of Wight , the other at Spithead . The sea at both these places was green , and both specimens , as might be expected , were pronounced by the home examination to be thick with suspended matter . Two distinct series of observations are here referred to  --  the one consisting of direct observations of the colour of the sea , conducted during the voyage from Gibraltar to Portsmouth : the other carried out in the laboratory of the Royal Institution . And here it is to be noted that in the home examination I never knew what water was placed in my hands . The labels , with the names of the localities written upon them , had been tied up , all information regarding the source of the water being thus held back . The bottles were simply numbered , and not till all of them had been examined , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locality and sea-colour corresponding to the various specimens ascertained . The home observations , therefore , must have been perfectly unbiassed , and they clearly establish the association of the green colour with fine suspended matter , and of the ultramarine colour , and more especially of the black-indigo hue of the Atlantic , with the comparative absence of such matter . So much for mere observation ; but what is the cause of the dark hue of the deep ocean ? Footnote : A note , written to me on October 22 , by my friend Canon Kingsley , contains the following reference to this point : ' I have never seen the Lake of Geneva , but I thought of the brilliant dazzling dark blue of the mid-Atlantic under the sunlight , and its black-blue under cloud , both so solid that one might leap off the sponson on to it without fear ; this was to me the most wonderful thing which I saw on my voyages to and from the West Indies . ' A preliminary remark or two will clear our way towards an explanation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the white light is withdrawn . The hue of a purple liquid , for example , is immediately accounted for by its action on a spectrum . It cuts out the yellow and green , and allows the red and blue to pass through . The blending of these two colours produces the purple . But while such a liquid attacks with special energy the yellow and green , it enfeebles the whole spectrum . By increasing the thickness of the stratum we may absorb the whole of the light . The colour of a blue liquid is similarly accounted for . It first extinguishes the red ; then , as the thickness augments , it attacks the orange , yellow , and green in succession ; the blue alone finally remaining . But even it might be extinguished by a sufficient depth of ' the liquid . And now we are prepared for a brief , but tolerably complete , statement of that action of sea-water upon light , to which it owes its darkness . The spectrum embraces three classes of rays  --  the thermal , the visual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the thermal rays are in part visual , the visual rays in part chemical , and vice versa . The vast body of thermal rays lie beyond the red , being invisible . These rays are attacked with exceeding energy by water . They are absorbed close to the surface of the sea , and are the great agents in evaporation . At the same time the whole spectrum suffers enfeeblement ; water attacks all its rays , but with different degrees of energy . Of the visual rays , the red are first extinguished . As the solar beam plunges deeper into the sea , orange follows red , yellow follows orange , green follows yellow , and the various shades of blue , where the water is deep enough , follow green . Absolute extinction of the solar beam would be the consequence if the water were deep and uniform . If it contained no suspended matter , such water would be as black as ink . A reflected glimmer of ordinary light would reach us from its surface , as it would from the surface of actual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would reach us from the body of the water . In very clear and deep sea-water this condition is approximately fulfilled , and hence the extraordinary darkness of such water . The indigo , already referred to , is , I believe , to be ascribed in part to the suspended matter , which is never absent , even in the purest natural water ; and in part to the slight reflection of the light from the limiting surfaces of strata of different densities . A modicum of light is thus thrown back to the eye , before the depth necessary to absolute extinction has been attained . An effect precisely similar occurs under the moraines of glaciers . The ice here is exceptionally compact , and , owing to the absence of the internal scattering common in bubbled ice , the light plunges into the mass , where it is extinguished , the perfectly clear ice presenting an appearance of pitchy blackness . Footnote : I learn from a correspondent that certain Welsh tarns , which are reputed bottomless , have this inky hue . The green colour of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , again , let us fall back upon the sure basis of experiment . A strong white dinner-plate had a lead weight securely fastened to it . Fifty or sixty yards of strong hempen line were attached to the plate . My assistant , Thorogood , occupied a boat , fastened as usual to the davits of the " Urgent , " while I occupied a second boat nearer the stern of the ship . He cast the plate as a mariner heaves the lead , and by the time it reached me it had sunk a considerable depth in the water . In all cases the hue of this plate was green . Even when the sea was of the darkest indigo , the green , was vivid and pronounced . I could notice the gradual deepening of the colour as the plate sank , but at its greatest depth , even in indigo water , the colour was still a blue-green . Footnote : In no case , of course , is the green pure , but a mixture of green and blue . Other observations confirmed this one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and right over the blades of the screw was an orifice called the screw-well , through which one could look from the poop down upon the screw . The surface-glimmer , which so pesters the eye , was here in a great measure removed . Midway down , a plank crossed the screw-well from side to side ; on this I placed myself and observed the action of the screw underneath . The eye was rendered sensitive by the moderation of the light ; and , to remove still further all disturbing causes , Lieutenant Walton had a sail and tarpaulin thrown over the mouth of the well . Underneath this I perched myself on the plank and watched the screw . In an indigo sea the play of colour was indescribably beautiful , and the contrast between the water , which had the screw-blades , and that which had the bottom of the ocean , as a background , was extraordinary . The one was of the most brilliant green , the other of the deepest ultramarine . The surface of the water above the screw-blade was always ruffled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light was withdrawn from some places and concentrated upon others , the water flashing with metallic lustre . The screw-blades in this case played the part of the dinner-plate in the former case , and there were other instances of a similar kind . The white bellies of porpoises showed the green hue , varying in intensity as the creatures swung to and fro between the surface and the deeper water . Foam , at a certain depth below the surface , was also green . In a rough sea the light which penetrated the summit of a wave sometimes reached the eye , a beautiful green cap being thus placed upon the wave , even in indigo water . But how is this colour to be connected with the suspended particles ? Thus . Take the dinner-plate which showed so brilliant a green when thrown into indigo water . Suppose it to diminish in size , until it reaches an almost microscopic magnitude . It would still behave substantially as the larger plate , sending to the eye its modicum of green light . If the plate , instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powder sufficiently fine , and in this condition diffused through the clear sea-water , it would also send green light to the eye . In fact , the suspended particles which the home examination reveals , act in all essential particulars like the plate , or like the screw-blades , or like the foam , or like the bellies of the porpoises . Thus I think the greenness of the sea is physically connected with the matter which it holds in suspension . We reached Portsmouth on January 5 , 1871 . Then ended a voyage which , though its main object was not realised , has left behind it pleasant memories , both of the aspects of nature and the kindliness of men . ******************** VII . NIAGARA . Footnote : A Discourse delivered at the Royal Institution of Great Britain , April 4 , 1873 . It is one of the disadvantages of reading books about natural scenery that they fill the mind with pictures , often exaggerated , often distorted , often blurred , and , even when well drawn , injurious to the freshness of first impressions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with regard to the Falls of Niagara . There was little accuracy in the estimates of the first observers of the cataract . Startled by an exhibition of power so novel and so grand , emotion leaped beyond the control of the judgment , and gave currency to notions which have often led to disappointment . A record of a voyage in 1535 by a French mariner named Jacques Cartier , contains , it is said , the first printed allusion to Niagara . In 1603 the first map of the district was constructed by a Frenchman named Champlain . In 1648 the Jesuit Rageneau , in a letter to his superior at Paris , mentions Niagara as ' a cataract of frightful height . ' Footnote : From an interesting little book presented to me at Brooklyn by its author , Mr. Holly , some of these data are derived : Hennepin , Kalm , Bakewell , Lyell , Hall , and others I have myself consulted . In the winter of 1678 and 1679 the cataract was visited by Father Hennepin , and described in a book dedicated ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a drawing of the waterfall , which shows that serious changes have taken place since his time . He describes it as ' a great and prodigious cadence of water , to which the universe does not offer a parallel . ' The height of the fall , according to Hennepin , was more than 600 feet . ' The waters , ' he says , ' which fall from this great precipice do foam and boil in the most astonishing manner , making a noise more terrible than that of thunder . When the wind blows to the south its frightful roaring may be heard for more than fifteen leagues . ' The Baron la Hontan , who visited Niagara in 1687 , makes the height 800 feet . In 1721 Charlevois , in a letter to Madame de Maintenon , after referring to the exaggerations of his predecessors , thus states the result of his own observations : ' For my part , after examining it on all sides , I am inclined to think that we can not allow it less than 140 or 150 feet , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viz. a hundred and fifty years ago , it had the shape of a horseshoe , and reasons will subsequently be given for holding that this has been always the form of the cataract , from its origin to its present site . As regards the noise of the fall , Charlevois declares the accounts of his predecessors , which , I may say , are repeated to the present hour , to be altogether extravagant . He is perfectly right . The thunders of Niagara are formidable enough to those who really seek them at the base of the Horseshoe Fall ; but on the banks of the river , and particularly above the fall , its silence , rather than its noise , is surprising . This arises , in part , from the lack of resonance ; the surrounding country being flat , and therefore furnishing no echoing surfaces to reinforce the shock of the water . The resonance from the surrounding rocks causes the Swiss Reuss at the Devil 's Bridge , when full , to thunder more loudly than the Niagara . On Friday , November @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Niagara Falls , I caught , from the railway train , my first glimpse of the smoke of the cataract . Immediately after my arrival I went with a friend to the northern end of the American Fall . It may be that my mood at the time toned down the impression produced by the first aspect of this grand cascade ; but I felt nothing like disappointment , knowing , from old experience , that time and close acquaintanceship , the gradual interweaving of mind and nature , must powerfully influence my final estimate of the scene . After dinner we crossed to Goat Island , and , turning to the right , reached the southern end of the American Fall . The river is here studded with small islands . Crossing a wooden bridge to Luna Island , and clasping a tree which grows near its edge , I looked long at the cataract , which here shoots down the precipice like an avalanche of foam . It grew in power and beauty . The channel spanned by the wooden bridge was deep , and the river there doubled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a muscle , unbroken . The ledge here overhangs , the water being poured out far beyond the base of the precipice . A space , called the Cave of the Winds , is thus enclosed between the wall of rock and the falling water . Goat Island ends in a sheer dry precipice , which connects the American and Horseshoe Falls . Midway between both is a wooden hut , the residence of the guide to the Cave of the Winds , and from the hut a winding staircase , called Biddle 's Stair , descends to the base of the precipice . On the evening of my arrival I went down this stair , and wandered along the bottom of the cliff . One well-known factor in the formation and retreat of the cataract was immediately observed . A thick layer of limestone formed the upper portion of the cliff . This rested upon a bed of soft shale , which extended round the base of the cataract . The violent recoil of the water against this yielding substance crumbles it away , undermining the ledge above , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the observed recession . At the southern extremity of the Horseshoe is a promontory , formed by the doubling back of the gorge excavated by the cataract , and into which it plunges . On the promontory stands a stone building , called the Terrapin Tower , the door of which had been nailed up because of the decay of the staircase within it . Through the kindness of Mr. Townsend , the superintendent of Goat Island , the door was opened for me . From this tower , at all hours of the day , and at some hours of the night , I watched and listened to the Horseshoe Fall . The river here is evidently much deeper than the American branch ; and instead of bursting into foam where it quits the ledge , it bends solidly over , and falls in a continuous layer of the most vivid green . The tint is not uniform ; long stripes of deeper hue alternating with bands of brighter colour . Close to the ledge over which the water rolls , foam is generated , the light falling upon which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its passage to and fro , and changed from white to emerald-green . Heaps of superficial foam are also formed at intervals along the ledge , and are immediately drawn into long white striae . Footnote : The direction of the wind with reference to the course of a ship may be inferred with accuracy from the foam-streaks on the surface of the sea . Lower down , the surface , shaken by the reaction from below , incessantly rustles into whiteness . The descent finally resolves itself into a rhythm , the water reaching the bottom of the fall in periodic gushes . Nor is the spray uniformly diffused through the air , but is wafted through it in successive veils of gauze-like texture . From all this it is evident that beauty is not absent from the Horseshoe Fall , but majesty is its chief attribute . The plunge of the water is not wild , but deliberate , vast , and fascinating . From the Terrapin Tower , the adjacent arm of the Horseshoe is seen projected against the opposite one , midway down ; to the imagination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into which the cataract plunges . The delight which natural scenery produces in some minds is difficult to explain , and the conduct which it prompts can hardly be fairly criticised by those who have never experienced it . It seems to me a deduction from the completeness of the celebrated Thomas Young , that he was unable to appreciate natural scenery . ' He had really , ' says Dean Peacock , ' no taste for life in the country ; he was one of those who thought that no one who was able to live in London would be content to ' live elsewhere . ' Well , Dr. Young , like Dr. Johnson , had a right to his delights ; but I can understand a hesitation to accept them , high as they were , to the exclusion of That o'erflowing joy which Nature yields To her true lovers . To all who are of this mind , the strengthening of desire on my part to see and know Niagara Falls , as far as it is possible for them to be seen and known , will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I met , at the head of Biddle 's Stair , the guide to the Cave of the Winds . He was in the prime of manhood  --  large , well built , firm and pleasant in mouth and eye . My interest in the scene stirred up his , and made him communicative . Turning to a photograph , he described , by reference to it , a feat which he had accomplished some time previously , and which had brought him almost under the green water of the Horseshoe Fall . ' Can you lead me there to-morrow ? ' I asked . He eyed me enquiringly , weighing , perhaps , the chances of a man of light build , and with grey in his whiskers , in such an undertaking . ' I wish , ' I added , ' to see as much of the fall as can be seen , and where you lead I will endeavour to follow . ' His scrutiny relaxed into a smile , and he said , ' Very well ; I shall be ready for you to-morrow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the hut at the head of Biddle 's Stair I stripped wholly , and re-dressed according to instructions ,  --  drawing on two pairs of woollen pantaloons , three woollen jackets , two pairs of socks , and a pair of felt shoes . Even if wet , my guide assured me that the clothes would keep me from being chilled ; and he was right . A suit and hood of yellow oilcloth covered all . Most laudable precautions were taken by the young assistant who helped to dress me to keep the water out ; but his devices broke down immediately when severely tested . We descended the stair ; the handle of a pitchfork doing , in my case , the duty of an alpenstock . At the bottom , the guide enquired whether we should go first to the Cave of the Winds , or to the Horseshoe , remarking that the latter would try us most . I decided on getting the roughest done first , and he turned to the left over the stones . They were sharp and trying . The base of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boulders , obviously the ruins of the limestone ledge above . The water does not distribute itself uniformly among these , but seeks out channels through which it pours torrentially . We passed some of these with wetted feet , but without difficulty . At length we came to the side of a more formidable current . My guide walked along its edge until he reached its least turbulent portion . Halting , he said , ' This is our greatest difficulty ; if we can cross here , we shall get far towards the Horseshoe . ' He waded in . It evidently required all his strength to steady him . The water rose above his loins , and it foamed still higher . He had to search for footing , amid unseen boulders , against which the torrent rose violently . He struggled and swayed , but he struggled successfully , and finally reached the shallower water at the other side . Stretching out his arm , he said to me , ' Now come on . ' I looked down the torrent , as it ' rushed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the cataract . De Saussure recommended the inspection of Alpine dangers , with the view of making them familiar to the eye before they are encountered ; and it is a wholesome custom in places of difficulty to put the possibility of an accident clearly before the mind , and to decide beforehand what ought to be done should the accident occur . Thus wound up in the present instance , I entered the water . Even where it was not more than knee-deep , its power was manifest . As it rose around me , I sought to split the torrent by presenting a side to it ; but the insecurity of the footing enabled it to grasp my loins , twist me fairly round , and bring its impetus to bear upon my back . Further struggle was impossible ; and feeling my balance hopelessly gone , I turned , flung myself towards the bank just quitted , and was instantly , as expected , swept into shallower water . The oilcloth covering was a great incumbrance ; it had been made for a much stouter man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupied the centre of two bags of water . My guide exhorted me to try again . Prudence was at my elbow , whispering dissuasion ; but , taking everything into account , it appeared more immoral to retreat than to proceed . Instructed by the first misadventure , I once more entered the stream . Had the alpenstock been of iron it might have helped me ; but , as it was , the tendency of the water to sweep it out of my hands rendered it worse than useless . I , however , clung to it by habit . Again the torrent rose , and again I wavered ; but , by keeping the left hip well against it , I remained upright , and at length grasped the hand of my leader at the other side . He laughed pleasantly . The first victory was gained , and he enjoyed it . ' No traveller , ' he said , ' was ever here before . ' Soon afterwards , by trusting to a piece of drift-wood which seemed firm , I was again taken off my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We clambered over the boulders towards the thickest spray , which soon became so weighty as to cause us to stagger under its shock . For the most part nothing could be seen ; we were in the midst of bewildering tumult , lashed by the water , which sounded at times like the cracking of innumerable whips . Underneath this was the deep resonant roar of the cataract . I tried to shield my eyes with my hands , and look upwards ; but the defence was useless . The guide continued to move on , but at a certain place he halted , desiring me to take shelter in his lee , and observe the cataract . The spray did not come so much from the upper ledge , as from the rebound of the shattered water when it struck the bottom . Hence the eyes could be protected from the blinding shock of the spray , while the line of vision to the upper ledges remained to some extent clear . On looking upwards over the guide 's shoulder I could see the water bending over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intermittent spray-gusts . We were right under the tower . A little farther on the cataract , after its first plunge , hit a protuberance some way down , and flew from it in a prodigious burst of spray ; through this we staggered . We rounded the promontory on which the Terrapin Tower stands , and moved , amid the wildest commotion , along the arm of the Horse-hoe , until the boulders failed us , and the cataract fell into the profound gorge of the Niagara River . Here the guide sheltered me again , and desired me to look up ; I did so , and could see , as before , the green gleam of the mighty curve sweeping over the uipper ledge , and the fitful plunge of the water , as the spray between us and it alternately gathered and disappeared . An eminent friend of mine often speaks of the mistake of those physicians who regard man 's ailments as purely chemical , to be met by chemical remedies only . He contends for the psychological element of cure . By agreeable emotions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , brain , and viscera . The influence rained from ladies ' eyes enables my friend to thrive on dishes which would kill him if eaten alone . A sanative effect of the same order I experienced amid the spray and thunder of Niagara . Quickened by the emotions there aroused , the blood sped exultingly through the arteries , abolishing introspection , clearing the heart of all bitterness , and enabling one to think with tolerance , if not with tenderness , on the most relentless and unreasonable foe . Apart from its scientific value , and purely as a moral agent , the play was worth the candle . My companion knew no more of me than that I enjoyed the wildness of the scene ; but as I bent in the shelter of his large frame he said , ' I should like to see you attempting to describe all this . ' He rightly thought it indescribable . The name of this gallant fellow was Thomas Conroy . We returned , clambering at intervals up and down , so as to catch glimpses of the most impressive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by tabular masses of limestone , and through some curious openings formed by the falling together of the summits of the rocks . At length we found ourselves beside our enemy of the morning . Conroy halted for a minute or two , scanning the torrent thoughtfully . I said that , as a guide , he ought to have a rope in such a place ; but he retorted that , as no traveller had ever thought of coming there , he did not see the necessity of keeping a rope . He waded in . The struggle to keep himself erect was evident enough ; he swayed , but recovered himself again and again . At length he slipped , gave way , did as I had done , threw himself towards the bank , and was swept into the shallows . Standing in the stream near its edge , he stretched his arm towards me . I retained the pitchfork handle , for it had been useful among the boulders . By wading some way in , the staff could be made to reach him , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' he replied , ' that , in case of giving way , you can maintain your grasp , then I will certainly hold you . ' Remarking that he might count on this , I waded in , and stretched the staff to my companion . It was firmly grasped by both of us . Thus helped , though its onset was strong , I moved safely across the torrent . All danger ended here . We afterwards roamed sociably among the torrents and boulders below the Cave of the Winds . The rocks were covered with organic slime , which could not have been walked over with bare feet , but the felt shoes effectually prevented slipping . We reached the cave and entered it , first by a wooden way carried over the boulders , and then along a narrow ledge , to the point eaten deepest into the shale . When the wind is from the south , the falling water , I am told , can be seen tranquilly from this spot ; but when we were there , a blinding hurricane of spray was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , I went behind the water on the Canada side , which , after the experiences of the morning , struck me as an imposture . Still even this latter is exciting to some nerves . Its effect upon himself is thus vividly described by Bakewell , jun : ' On turning a sharp angle of the rock , a sudden gust of wind met us , coming from the hollow between the fall and the rock , which drove the spray directly in our faces , with such force that in an instant we were wet through . When in the midst of this shower-bath the shock took away my breath : I turned back and scrambled over the loose stones to escape the conflict . The guide soon followed , and told me that I had passed the worst part . With that assurance I made a second attempt ; but so wild and disordered was my imagination that when I had reached half way I could bear it no longer . ' Footnote : ' Mag . of Nat .

The struggle , however , to prevent the bow of the boat from being turned by them , was often very severe . The spray was in general blinding , but at times it disappeared and yielded noble views of the fall . The edge of the cataract is crimped by indentations which exalt its beauty . Here and there , a little below the highest ledge , a secondary one juts out ; the water strikes it and bursts from it in huge protuberant masses of foam and spray . We passed Goat Island , came to the Horseshoe , and worked for a time along its base , the boulders over which Conroy and myself had scrambled a few days previously lying between us and the cataract .
