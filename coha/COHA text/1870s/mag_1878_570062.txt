ARTICLE 111. - THE STUDENT IN AMERICAN COLLEGES . MucH has been said in regard to American students abroad , especially those attending German universities . We have had descriptions of student life in various countries , showing what was peculiar to each , and what advantages are offered to our enterprising young men to complete their higher training in foreign institutions . Our own collegiate systems have occupied the best powers of many gifted writers and experienced educators ; so that we may justly conclude that the knowledge on this subject is not behind the average information on any point of public interest . Nor is it strange that this matter should claim so much attention . For college education is second to no public interest save those of religion and our common schools ; and is so intimately connected with the progress of each , that it can not be severed from them except at the cost of incalculable injury to all involved . For the Church looks to the college as the source whence she can get an educated Ministry . The common schools could effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a higher education-without the aid they derive from persons of superior culture who get their training in colleges . This may be seen from the fact that common schools do not attain to excellence except in those communities where there is a number of college-bred men to give tone and direction to primary education . But while much has been said on the best methods of college education , very meagre and unsatisfactory notice has been taken of the subject around which all this interest fixes , the student himself . This is the more strange since he is usually supposed to be a sort of genus by himself . And , as he is relegated to a separate class , it is a little remarkable that scientific men in their zeal for classification have not , on this theory , enumerated his differentite . It is now proposed to describe him as he is-not a nondescript , but a man and a // brother , with like passions as other men . In doing this many errors must be exposed , and common sense permitted to assert its sway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is the embodiment of all mischief and badness . Yet his origin would not lead us to expect this . He usually comes from a cultured family where religion and refinement are the influences which form his character during its most plastic period . Or , if he come from the lower strata of society , there must be something superior in his make which induces him to rise above his surroundings . For this is always a difficult process , and requires strength of chai-acter as well as intellect . ual force . He must break the barriers which poverty or ignorance have placed about him , and adapt himself in manner to those of superior advantages in education and breeding . Still more , this must be done while obtaining the requisite preparation from hooks to begin the college curriculum . The efforts which are often made by youths of this class are almost superhuman . They have no encouragement from those who are naturally loved and honored by them . They are restrained by a sense of awkwardness as well as ignorance . They have not enjoyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , indeed , it is a constant fight hy day for daily bread , and at night with weariness and unfavorable surroundings for a pitiable opportunity to get i-eady for college . Hence young men sent by cultured friends , or sending themselves by their own elevating instincts , can not well be other than choice specimens of youth . Assuredly when they go from home they are such ; and unless there be some baleful influence shed upon them by the college atmosphere , they retain the same pre√©minence . The question meets us fairly : Are they made worse by their residence in college ? They come fresh from their father 's blessing and their mother 's kiss ; guileless , pure , filled with noble aims , thirsting after education and those accomplishments which will fit them for responsibility in life . At their entrance they are met , in nearly every case , by accomplished Christian men who have given themselves to a calling second to none on earth . For the prophetic and priestly office are here very often united ; and in all eases the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of unblemished morals and refined character . Doubtless , exceptions to this general estimate of the teacher , and mistakes in government by the best , will occasionally occur . But it may be safely assumed that whatever influences the instructor can exert , both by precept and example , will be on the side of elevation in sentiment and strictness in moral conduct . But while this is substantially the true description of both professor and student , still , we must not expect all the blossoms to be couleur de rose . Human nature at its best has bad elements , and these will crop out even where every influence would seem to lead to virtue . There are young men who are bad when they go to college . There are , also , those who go there guileless and pure ; but before they leave become reckless and depraved . INot only are there bad men among students ; but there are bad influences peculiar to this kind of life . At the same time , there are no places to which we can send our youth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temptations peculiar to their position . Even when we try to keep them in the Eden of our homes , the serpent may enter there . Besides , we can not always retain them under our guardianship . If the young bird will not , at the proper time , leave the nest voluntarily , the parent bird must , however reluctantly , crowd it out . Every youth who is compos menus must sometime act for himself ; and in doing this will meet with temptation . For trial is the prime condition of life , and no character can be strong without it . However , the chief reason why certain vices appear rank in college is that the youth are aggregated . Scatter the same number in society , and their escapades would not be heard of ; albeit they were far more frequent . It is because they are constantly together , act in concert , and are distinct in dress , carriage , demeanor  --  a nameless something by which every citizen is enabled to say " there goes a student "  - -  that their peccadilloes seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free from offence . Still fewer that period when the passions are both strong and undisciplined . Hence it follows that the offences-provided they come from an equal number of young men , each in his own neighborhood-would scarcely be remarked ; yet when // viewed by a watchful community which forms its judgments on traditional grounds , the offences seem enormous . But this fact of aggregation is always left out of view in estimating student mischief . There are three vices which always rise up in the minds of those who judge college students without due reflection : Drunkenness , with its accompaniments of carousing , malicious mischief , and lying . What has already been said in regard to the facility of observing offences when they are collected , applies with particular force to offences of the first class . The student is known from all others . He is constantly under the watchful eye of some one . His fellow students know all he does ; for it may be truthfully assumed that each one , whether dissipated or not , knows the entire history of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an affectionate watch over their charge . How closely this surveillance should be exercised , and the character of it , will be considered hereafter ; but we say here that the student is always liable , from his relations to his instructor , to be observed if he becomes intemperate . But , still further , the whole community , save the accursed liquor seller and a too facile police , is prone to see and denounce-often to denounce without seeing  --  the finfortunate student who is an inebriate . Besides , the offence being one noticed by all college laws , it secures a prominence in the case of a student that it would not have were the subject merely a youth of the community . We would not exculpate students too far . Their time of life subjects them to strong temptations in this direction . Their good fellowship and generosity excite them to excess in many ways , and hence too often to free indulgence in liquor . Still , there is nothing necessarily connected with their surroundings which leads that way . On the contrary there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than encourage the beastly appetites . Xenophon , in his model system , the education of Cyrus , well described the place where the young men of Persia were educated as one removed from all contact with the rudeness and depravity of the world ; Cyrop. , Book I. , chap . ii. ; so the college is kept free from any contact with the giaspings of trade , the jostle with the ignorant , and the debasing contact // with the vicious . Hence there is no reason in the nature of the place that student life should foster drunkenness . Students are generous , sociable , and fond of adventure . But these traits are commendable in themselves ; and if they are sometimes contaminated by vices , such is the common danger of all our powers . So far as students are guilty of malicious misehieg this arises from a feeling of antagonism which often appears to be inveterate between themselves and the citizens who dwell about their institution . This is l ) est expressed by Town and Cown , and is rarely the fault of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a youth who manifests superior ability in any community , or who possesses more advantages than his fellows , is invariably an object of unjust suspicion by his neighbors . No matter how circumspectly he carries himself there is fault found with his conduct . The charge that he thinks himself superior to his former playmates is the signal for untold petty annoyances . The same , only in an aggravated degree , holds good in the case of a body of students . This feeling of envy segregates them from the rest of the community , and by its unjust suspicious quickens the latent demon in them . Besides , whatever mischief is done by the bad boys of the town is conveniently saddled on the student ; and , as he is charged with what is not his own , lie is tempted to harm those who so unjustly asperse his character . In those combats which occasionally arise between Town and Gown where conclusions are tried by bruising , the provocation almost always comes from the former . For the students having a world of their own do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the necessity to interfere with what is going on outside of their commum ty . There is a kind of mischief which shows itself in the destruction of college property , and annoyance to professors ' houses . But as this arises from an antagonism that exists to some degree between all governed and governing bodies , it is more pertinent to treat of the feeling and its causes , than its particular eff*cts in the case before us . The antagonism between the civil authority and the citizen exists in all States , but is tempered by the knowledge on the part of the individual that // the power of the law is supreme . It is only when wrongs , real or fancied , become intolerable , that the general prevalence of hostility gathers the elements of opposition to effect a rebellion . At other times the feeling against the tax gatherer , or paying the excise , relieves itself merely by grumbling , falsifying the return of taxable property , or by smuggling . For , as the individual is powerless , and selfishness prevents concerted action , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ngs . In the case of parental restraint there are two reasons which prevent opposition on the part of the child . One is that during the helplessness of infancy the authority of the parent is perfected , so that when the child comes to years of ( liscretion the feeling of reverence prevents antagonism . This is ordinarily the case though from harshness and ignorance in the management of children , it sometimes happens that instead of mutual love and confidence increasing with years , distrust and hatred usurp their place , when the ruined child takes every opportunity to annoy the parent . Happily , however , such cases are rare and must be attributed to special depravity and are not to be cited in a consideration of the true relations between parent and child . Natural affection secures tenderness toward the child , and is manifested by a willingness to sacrifice all for his sake ; so that eveii when his rebelliousness leads to self-destruction the sense of fatherhood exclaims : Would God I had died for thee , my son ! While the correct theory of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and child , still the conditions are not altogether the same . For there is no natural affection as a starting point . Here the student comes at an age when the passions are most hot , and the judgment the least cool . Added to this is the feeling that the authority under which he is placed is not backed up by adequate power . For it avails much in securing obedience , to know that the law has power to exact it , or impose condign punishment ; as is the fact with the parent and the State . On the side of the coll*ege there is much power claimed , and in some institutions exercised . In all there is the feeling that they ought to have it , and the show of possession is made in the way // of penalties and disgraces , with expulsion looming up in the background . If the college law would never threaten except when it followed this up by striking the blow , and would not punish for trifling offences , its authority would be fully respected . For it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be punished , once for all , for some grave offence . The continued attitude of a rod suspended over the back will make any person uneasy and rebellious . But if the blow never descends , there will be all the enmity awakened by punishment , and none of the wholesome fear inspired by the infliction of justice . In such a case the ghost of authority will certainly be despised for its imbecility . Again : the nature of this authority is ill defined . Nominally it is parental , and should be such , consistently and patiently , until the student himself by persistent misconduct renders this impossible . The teacher should never , so far as he is concerned individually , act on any other principle than that he is in loco parent/s and by his sympathy make the pupil feel that this relation is well founded . The idea of pupilage , precisely as that of childhood , requires affection for the person and confidence in the superior wisdom of the instructor as a guide to fit the scholar-for independent action when his curriculum is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be formed under precisely the same influences , so far as the differences of the situations will admit , as in the home circle . This is the beau ideal of college government , and never should be departed from in the treatment of an offender except for the good of the students at large . But the college differs from the family in this : the relation is voluntary and can be severed by the pupil when he chooses , and by the institution when it finds the presence of any one detrimental to the moral health of the rest . But the family can not be broken except by death . The prodigal , though he go " a great way off , " is met on his return by the yearning father . Each member of the family is such forever . But not so in college . No young man is shut up to one place of study , and his severance from this or that place , unless it be through disgr*ice , is a matter of indifference to the institution or himself . Hence the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And // when a college finds it necessary for the general welfare that a student be sent away , should he afterward " come to himself " and reform , it is better for him to go to a new place . For his perpetual exclusion has a more wholesome effect on those who are left behind ; since it tends to show that the college authority , when it acts , means to be respected . And the young man himself is more likely in a fresh place , and with different surroundings , to keep the new leaf turned over . We have said that the authority should be parental as long as the student will allow it to be so . In this it differs from the government of the State , and properly occupies an intermediate position between it and the home . Many thoughtful men , however , have held that the government of the college should be conformed exactly to that of the State , in order to prepare young men for undertaking the obligations of citizenship when their pupilage ceases . Such persons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ false notions which parental government is apt to foster , they will be unfitted for the change . For when they act upon these principles in their relations as citizens to the public authority , they will soon learn by a painful experience their unfitness for the new sphere . This , however , might he urged equally well against the family government . Here the authority of the parent is acknowledged by every right-minded person so long as he remains an inmate of the old home , though that time extend far beyond his majority . Hence when it is said that it would never do for students , after they come out into the world , to act as they do in colleges , is not this quite as true of children under parental authority ? They are not yet in a condition to be treated as public citizens , and their nonage prohibits it . But the true idea of family training is to fit the child for the sphere of independent action whenever the time comes for a new roof tree to be planted . Still the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graded according to the age and capacity of each one ; and hence must insensibly throw off command without reason assigned , and make the matured child feel that his rights , his wishes , and his opinions are to be considered . The same is undoubtedly true in college ; and these principles are to be carried out in every case where tbe student 's conduct makes // 618 The Student in American Colleges . this possible . But when , through incorrigible badness , or *tupidity , this course can not be followed , then it becomes necessary for the moral health of the rest that the unworthy member be cut off . Every college which deserves to exist proceeds substantially on these principles . The wisdom which enables the governing power to see just where the pruning knife can be j udiciously employed , is the measure of its success , and gives a college a proud independence . Others , either through the vacillation of weakness , or the sickly hankering after numbers , will be despised for their sacrifice of principle , and insensibly write their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and consistently administered will prevent the feeling of antagonism from arising between professor and student , or destroy it wherever it already exists . No college officer should ever by word or action admit this antagonism , since its bare recognition will give it a status . It may be replied : The feeling is known to exist , that it is assumed in all colleges , and we can not afford to shut our eyes to the fact . And it is held that any wide spread and prevailing prejudice , however unreasoning , must be assumed as a force to be dealt with either in morals or in politics . This is a half truth , and therefore the more dangerous ; since the error it contains gets a standing in foro judicii becanse of the modicum of truth connected with it . Experience teaches every competent observer that the more he recognizes this antagonism , the more it will raise its ugly head . We have heard professors who are both talented and cultured , assert roundly that nearly all students are bad in their college morals ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act deceitfully in their intercourse with their teachers . It is safe to affirm that such an opinion , whether avowed openly , or secretly exercised , will be met by treatment from the student which will only confirm the unfortunate professor . If it be entertainc*d as a most secret thought , or if only a lurking suspicion of its truth be harbored , still it will become manifest to the student from the way he is treated . What , we may ask , would be the result of parental culture starting from this unnatural assumption ? Surely the child would be alienated , and nothing but a crop of lies could be harvested after such // a sowing . Can there be anything more outrageous than the opinion that a body of young men , embracing the choicest fruits of our civilization1 will generally or habitually lie ? Hence it is not surprising that he who holds this opinion should be in antagonism to his pupils . If they did not hate him and be tempted to make his opinion good , they would not have the common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falsely in their intercourse with their professors ; nay that some go so far as to glory in the assertion that they have never told the truth in dealing with them , still it is not just to include all under such a charge . Sober reason must be the champion of the student against the promiscuous charge of falsehood . Many , at the lowest estimate which a harried professor , in his calmer moments could fix , would scorn to be false in their dealing with him ; but keep their consciences with all diligence . And where falsehood crops out in its most aggravated form , this is usually caused by the absurd - should it not be called wicked ? - conduct of some professor who has mistaken his calling . For instead of acting the part of a father , with quiet and dignified firmness , guiding the youth committed to his care , he shows the thinness of his cuticle by appropriating boyish freaks as personal indignities . Each trivial offence becomes a fracture of all the ten commandments , and the professor whose vanity is touched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good order ! No wonder that students band together against such a ruler and make his position hot . No wonder that the weaker shuffle and wriggle under imputations like these , and are tempted to lie when put upon the rack of an angry crossexamination . While having unbounded confidence in the average American student , believing him far better in morals than any other equal number of young men who can be found , yet we think the above method is enough to rouse suspicion and hate . He is not removed from the common influences which sway our nature . " If you prick him will he not bleed ? If you tickle him will he not laugh ? If you wrong him will he not revenge ? If he be like you in the rest , he will resemble you in this . " * * Merchant of Venice , Act Ill . Scene I. // *32O The Student in American Colleges . If the professor proceeds on the principle that the student is ftdse until he prove his veracity , it is the former who compels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depend on himself to ferret out the wrong doer . For if he act the part of a detective , can he , as an honorable man , expect students to put any more confidence in him than he does in them ? From his age and position he ought to be an example of fair , open , confiding action . But as the secret detective can scarcely ask the chevalier dindustrie to aid him in working np the latest case of shop-lifting , so the professor who has no confidence in the general truthfulness of the student , should not ask him to give evidence in his own case or in the prosecution of others . If he would be consistent , he must depend on his own resources as a detective ; remembering , that unless the student is more manly than himself , he need expect no aid from this quarter . So , whenever any mischief is perpetrated , the principle will be : Sauve qui peut ; and de'il take the hindmost . Pursuant to our theory it is much better to assume that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is more likely to do so when his honor is trusted than questioned . Admit that he will often prevaricate ; that when hard pressed he will lie fearfully , both to shield himself and his classmates . Still the former is a common infirmity of our nature when put to the test . The latter is an exceedingly hateful and ugly vice wherever it shows its head , and the question is to hit upon the best method of bruising it and cultivate entire truthfulness in the pupil 's character . The esprit du corps , which in every walk of life has a tendency to stifle the voice of conscience by the cry of party , is especially strong among students . The disposition for mutual defence is a good thing in itself , and only is bad when it subordinates justice to friendship . That professor who assumes invariably that the student tells the truth will at once engage the sympathy of all who endeavor to keep a conscience void of offence . These make common cause with the governing power , and can be depended on in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deception , they may be placed out of question ; and the dishonor of falsehood will be narrowed to a very few , and they so much reproved by isolation that this will go far toward effecting a // cure . Besides , the end of discipline is not the discovery , but the prevention , of offences . For if it be the great object of all collegiate education to make bad boys good men , and good ones still better , then surely this can be done in no way so effectually as by setting a premium on truthfulness and honor . Hence , when the principle is distinctly enunciated that the word of a student will always be accepted ; that even when he has deceived once he will still be believed in the hope that his conduct will be different next time ; that the responsibility of falsehood will be left to rest upon the deceiver himself , and be punished by the detestation of his fellows who always know who the guilty are , then all the remedial agencies of brotherly kindness on the one side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most powerfully in producing a reformation . If evil is not to be overcome with evil but with good , then this is the true method , and when followed out will prevent antagonism . But in truth there is no room for this feeling , since there can not be any divided interest . Teacher and pupil are working for the same great purpose , and neither can prosper save in proportion as the other does . Hence , instead of antagonism there should always be , and in multitudes of cases there are , the strongest bonds which can exist between man and man , save those of parent and child , and often equal to these in tenderness . So if the teacher is wise he will ignore all variance in the interests of himself and pupils ; and when this principle is consistently maintained the bickerings between the governing and governed bodies will cease . It is often assumed that while the student , when he enters college , brings his conscience and purity with him , yet these are gradually lost , and he becomes both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature of the case that this result should follow , nor do we admit it . It is true there is always danger that the gentleness of childhood and refinement of home will be lost by contact with the rude world abroad . This , however , is a common danger , and not peculiar to any discipline through which youth are called to pass . The perfection of character both as a gentleman and a Christian-if these can be thought of apart-is to be wise as serpents and harmless as doves . It is true that many young men form bad associa // tions and become so transformed in morals that their own mothers can scarcely recognize them . But the period of life from seventeen to twenty-one , the usual time of college education , is one of transition . Many characters are injured or reversed in the first years of separation from home , no matter whither the adventurers wander . But , on the other hand , it must be remembered that great multitudes of noble characters are fashioned for life under college training . Revivals of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deepest religious awakenings ever experienced in our country have taken their rise here , and date from the day of prayel for colleges . Untold numbers of young men confessedly aic converted during their college training , and many receive their religious convictions , which though the world know not of them , abide and bring forth fruit after many days . Far more young men date their religious impressions from this period than do their ruin . If it were not so these institutions should be uprooted without delay . For , valuable as intellectual culture be as au auxiliary , it must be looked upon only in this light , entirely subordinate to the improvement of the heart and character . The greatest educator that America has ever produced , perhaps the greatest of this century said : " Characte*-is above Culture . " * We are fully persuaded that none of those Christian gentlemen who give their lives to the instruction of young men , would continue for a day longer to occupy the professor 's chair , if they believed that the general tendency of college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they suspected that it was even an open question . The esprit du corps of student life is proverbial . It has always been one of the most marked features of those engaged in common studies that they have a strong bond of union arising from their kindred pursuits . The guilds of the tradesmen are close , but being for material interests , do not have equal elements of moral strength ; and though they hold men together for a longer period , do not have so much power over their character . The trades ' unions , the political clubs , all have an ambitious end in view , and hence are wholly selfish even when they look to mutual protection . Not so the con * Prest . Woolsey. // nections of young men in college . They are actuated by generous , unselfish , and pure motives . No ulterior aims , no purposes except enjoying the society of each other , and rendering assistance in the studies , or sports common to all . Here some of the strongest friendships of life are formed , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associations as the brightest experiences which have gilded their existence since childhood . This esprit du corps is a leading factor in the education of young men because it introduces the closest and most unrestrained intercourse between kindred spirits . The friction of diverse characters thus closely united , educates more than all the teaching from the professors chair . For , while the latter is the great means of didactic instruction , and the real nucleus of college culture , still what is learned ecv catliedra is , by the intercourse of the students together , digested and assimilated so as to produce the growth of education . The closer and more confidential this intercourse may be , the better does it effect the purpose of growth . Hence the system of secret societies , which spring up in colleges spontaneously , is the necessary outgrowth of the coming of many together . The desire of a yet closer intimacy , a more unrestrained exhibition of youthful friendship , inspires this growth . The horror of many grave instructors and fond parents at the existence of such organizations , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by worthy motives . Yet affectionate zeal in the interests of the pupils committed to the charge of a college faculty , and the love of the parent , are worthy of all regard even though they proceed from groundless fears . But a few common sense reflections , when reason is allowed to guide , must convince that these secret fraternities are not the dangerous firebrands which imagination pictures them . How can persons believe that honorable and pious young men leave behind them their integrity when they enter the secret conclave ; or that the few cabalistic letters , the signs , the grips , contain in them any mortal sin ? Is it likely that the pure minded , if these societies are such as fancy paints them , would remain members after the discovery of the deception practiced upon them ? The students make the societies . There is no magnetic power in the name , or the simple , and usually puerile rites which make up // the paraphernalia of these secret orders , to work a transformation of character . They do not make the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad according to the membership of the order for the time being . The performancesbarring the ridiculous rites of initiation which are a kind of safety valve to let off the exuberant fervor of youth-are , it may be taken for granted , of a piece with the ordinary occupations of student life . These orders may become the apparent nurseries of mischief or vice ; but when this is the case , they are only the barometer which shows the moral atmosphere , and do not create it any more than the mercury in the tube makes the weather . It is often said that the German Bursohen fraternities are nurseries of duelling and hot beds of revolution . But the public spirit of the communities from which these students came created the atmosphere which enabled these things to be possible . The universities themselves could more justly be charged with such influences ; for they bring together great numbers of brilliant men and so aggregate the power which would have worked in other places , though probably not so potently as by concerted action . Still , the influences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , per se , more likely to be wholesome than when a small amount of intellectual power directs a large mass of brute force , as is the case when the demagogue hounds on the ignorant rabble . The American student has some qualities which are different , or in greater preponderance than those possessed by others of his kind . While in all countries he is independent , and restive nuder violent restraint , still the nature of our political institutions causes these traits to be much more marked among us . The traditions which are prevalent in monarchical or despotic governments extend to the systems of education , and hence the student , by force of early training and public sentiment , more easily yields obedience . In this country , however , he thinks he " is a law unto himself , " and therefore brooks control with great reluctance . Our system of almost unlimited freedom extends largely to family government , so that the student comes to college with very crude notions of submission to authority ; and unfortunately is often backed up in his feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // institutions as will condescend to hear and heed the clamors which injudicious parents make when their sons receive punishment , will be in perpetual worry , and deservedly be despised by both student and patron . This spirit of freedom and insubordination is , however , confined within narrow limits . Inside of these the student is noisy and often rude in his treatment of the civil authority , and contemptuous toward Philistines generally . He is sometimes destitute of those outward marks of respect embodied in crooking the pliant knee ; marks which more commonly betoken servility than the deference of hearty affection . Hence his character in this respect is so often misunderstood by teachers from abroad , who expect the reverence due to one who has left the culture of Europe for the wilds of America . Nor is the student slow to test the great man 's power of government and literary pretensions , especially if they be thrust forward with more than Paracelsean egotism . However , it must be said to their credit , that great crimes are exceedingly rare among the young men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that of the more daring offences , such as murder , theft , or counterfeiting , the proportion of offences committed by them is not one to ten perpetrated by an equal number of young men taken at random from the best classes of society . We have no statistics before us on this point ; but from somewhat extended acquaintance with the history of our literary institutions , we can confidently challenge the denial of this statement . But there is one bad trait of American students which is at variance with all his other qualities , and offers no satisfactory means of solution . This is the strong tendency manifested among the higher classes to " haze ) " or in some way annoy the lower classes-especially the Freshman . In Europe we can see that this is a relic of feudal barbarism , having all the evils and none of the redeeming features of service done to superiors . The " fagging " system has continued uninterruptedly in the English schools , and has been winked at by the authorities . In this country , where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ species of service abhorrent , the practice of fagging could not be maintained . But , instead of this , the disposition to domineer shows // itself in hazing , jostling , smoking out , sniping et id omne genus . For this meanness there is no excuse . It is contemptible beyond the power of language to paint . Our young men who engage in such pastime seem to forget that any contest , in order to be manly , must be equal and have no degrading accompaniments . But here there is nothing but inequality , pure baseness , and consequent degradation . The new comers are unorganized , strangers , and helpless . The victims selected for individual wrong are those thought to be weakest intellectually , and possessed of the least courage for personal defence . Were it not that sonic new outrage of this kind occurs almost every week in some one of our colleges , we could not believe that our students could be sufficiently contemptible and cruel for this abominable sport . Fortunately our institutions , both literary and military , have arisen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and soon , it is to be hoped , such outrages will be a thing of the past . One reason for their continuance is that they have been winked at by the proper authorities , and not treated as breaches of the peace to be dealt with by the strong arm of the law like other crimes against municipal government . They should not be treated as college offences . Certainly , when they go to the extent of maiming and bloodshed , they call for punishment from a power adequate to inflict it . Contests in rowing and gymnastics are a new feature of our college life , and claim so much attention that educators begin to inquire seriously into their influence . That exercise should be taken in order to keep the body in proper tone , is not questioned . But how to do this best is yet an open question . For the violent strain of the body , whenever there is a contest , is not conducive to a healthy , normal condition of the system . Hence , while there may be much good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and suitable diet , still this may be more than counteracted by the unnatural exertion which is a necessary attendant on a public contest . The superhuman struggles then made are on a par with any bodily excess , and their certain effect is to injure the health permanently . Besides , this kind of contests leads to making bodily training the great desideratum , and mental culture only a seeondary // matter . When there is added to these things the growing vice of betting , pool selling , all the paraphernalia of the jocky club and the gambling hell , there can be but one conclusion reached by all the good , and that is : Such things have no place in the culture for which colleges were founded . If there must be an alternative between systematic training , with these accompaniments , and none at all , the latter is preferable . A closer union among the students of our American colleges is greatly to be desired . While a great university for the whole conntry is neither desirable nor practicable , still a general acquaintance among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as equalize , the standard of scholarship , and cultivate character . Such intercommunication will be effected in some way ; and it is certainly desirable that this should be brought about through a generous intellectual rivalry rather than in contests of bodily strength . This want has been strongly felt by many of our most liberal minded and advanced educators ; and has found expression in the " Intercollegiate Literary Association . " Whether this organization will meet the want adequately or not remains to be seen ; but at least it is a beginning in the right direction , and if it has not yet resulted in a permanently successful system , will no doubt pave the way for something imore efficient .
