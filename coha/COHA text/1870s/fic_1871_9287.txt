So I jest stepped out to the back gate , and I seed a feller going by with a wheelbarrow ; so I jest sung out to him , " Say , what 'll yer cart off a lot of stones for ? " Well , he looked at the stones , and then at me ; and then he laughed , and sed , " Seein ' its you , I 'll cart ' em off for nothing : and I 'll be blamed if the blasted fool did n't load ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why , its worth a dollar , if its worth a cent .
