THE RELIGION OF TO-PAY . THAT the intellectual world of to-day is drifting away from the religious belief and dogmatic theology of the past , is a fact which is more evident to the student , the wider his acquaintance with the current of contemporary thought in Christendom . In France it would be difficult to show that what the Church a century ago professed to consider the essentials of religious belief exist among any considerable number of the educated classes . In Germany the idea of a supernatural element , either in the creation of the world or in the origin of Christianity , has almost entirely disappeared from the intellect of the nation outside the ranks of theologians and their devotees . All that the theology of that country now exacts from the leaders of thought and action is , that they shall refrain from criticisms on Christian doctrine , and admit its great importance to society as an instrument to restrain the lower classes from attacks upon morality and social order . In England thought is drifting in the same direction , but , drawing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cautious and reverent forms than upon the Continent . To suppose that this wave of skepticism will not reach our own country would be illogical , though it may be difficult to see precisely what form it will assume . However great may be the differences of opinion respecting the character , significance , and end of this movement , few can have any doubt either of its reality or of the direction which it is taking . Its great feature is the slow elimination of all those tenets which have heretofore been considered the essentials of religious belief . It may indeed be claimed that there is really no elimination of such belief , but that what appears as such is only a change , the substitution of one doctrine for another . We readily grant this . Indeed , our object in the present essay is , to show the character of the // change and the tendency of the new views which threaten to supplant the old ones . The inquiry naturally divides itself into two parts : the nature and extent of the movement , considered as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the new ideas which are now taking form . Although the existence of the divergent course of thought to which we have alluded is familiar to all , there are difficulties which prevent the mass of the thinking community , and especially of the religious community , from forming an estimate of its real strength . The view commonly taken by the Church is , that the movement is one which lies wholly without itself , and therefore does not affect it , except in this indirect way : that the Church desires to have all men included within its fold , and therefore laments to find a whole class of thinking men straying from its truth . This distinction is a valid one , and , in order to form a correct conception of the movement toward skepticism , it is necessary to consider two distinct classes  --  the orthodox Church itself , and those who are entirely out of the pale of sympathy with it . So long as we consider the movement as affecting only the latter class , we shall form a very imperfect idea of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has very little interest for us , because there is nothing new in the existence of a large class of educated skeptics . What is most striking in the movement of those outside of the Church is , that their leaders are composed very largely of the leading intellects of the world . Really , however , the movement is not confined to this class , but affects the Church also to an extent of which few form any conception . The Church itself is hardly conscious of it , because it can be appreciated only by a more careful comparison of its own feelings and opinions with those of the past than men generally are in the habit of making . The circumstances are not unlike those of a drifting ship , the passengers of which , seeing no change in the ocean , are unconscious of their change of position . A drift of this sort may not be accompanied by any discussion or agitation whatever . Every man is necessarily satisfied with the truth of his own opinions , and if he changes them he must be satisfied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occur until the new ones have in some way commended themselves to his judgment . The result is , that , how far soever the Church may drift away from the tenets of the past , its views can not , to it , thereby lose the attribute of orthodoxy , nor its position appear any less sound . If the change is slow the believers will , like the victims of Circe and Comus " Not // once perceive their foul disfigurement , But boast themselves more comely than before . " We may therefore admit that there has been no change in the avowed doctrine of the Churches . A theologian may claim that he has yielded nothing to modern science or recent thought , and may challenge us to prove the surrender by himself or his church of a single doctrine which that church considered essential . Such a claim can be met only by a direct personal catechization of its propounder respecting his belief in the literal interpretations of certain theological assertions ; by his general attitude toward the doctrines he opposes ; by the interpretations which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own words . To satisfy ourselves how far the Church has really been influenced by modern thought , we must not seek for changes in its official expressions and requirements , but must rather compare its general attitude and the obvious ways of thinking of its members with the time-honored official utterances of the body itself . It is only by a comparison between these two standards , the written and the unwritten one , that we can measure the actual drift which has taken place . One suggestive circumstance is seen in the almost total disappearance of the old-fashioned doctrinal sermoii from a large class of our fashionable pulpits . A heathen desiring to learn the doctrines of Christianity might attend the best of these churches for a whole year and not hear one word of the torments of hell or the anger of an offended Deity , and not enough of the fall of man or the sacrificial sufferings of Christ to offend the most bigoted disciple of evolution . Listening and observing for himself , he would infer that the way of salvation consisted in declaring his faith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed quite ready to explain away as far as possible ; become a regular attendant at church and church sociables ; put something into the contribution-box every Sunday , and in every way behave as much as possible like his neighbors . Why is this ? Simply because the demand for doctrinal preaching is dying out . The law of supply and demand in our time controls sermons as well as flour-doctrines as well as goods . Men have ceased to demand doctrines , not necessarily because they have ceased to believe in them , but because they have taken the first step toward unbelief by losing their interest in them . Their faith is dragging its anchors without their knowing it . // The strongest indications of church drift are seen in the temporizing attitude of theology toward such modern doctrines as that of evolution ; in its readiness to be satisfied with forms of words , and in its growing disposition to give a shadowy or symbolic interpretation to the language in which it expresses its doctrines . How much of the old doctrine of the punishment of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in hell-fire for ever " is really believed by the Church of to-day as a literal truth ? This is a question which it is difficult to answer positively , because theology , though its official opinion is unchanged , no longer demands from its votaries any definite opinion respecting the nature of that punishment which the wicked are to undergo . They must believe , or at least teach , that the punishment is eternal , but may form their own opinions on the question whether it is physical or mental , positive pain or mere deprivation of some sort of happiness . Thus the word " punishment " is entirely losing its old meaning in this connection , and no well-defined new meaning has taken its place . That this is a concession to modern ideas hardly needs argument . But for historical evidence it would be incredible to most thinking men of the present that our Christian ancestors not only believed the greater part of the human race to be doomed to unending torture , but imagined themselves as seeing the terrible sentence pronounced without a ripple on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposed this bliss might from time to time be heightened by views of the " unspeakable torments " which their brethren were suffering in hell . That this idea has entirely died out it would be unsafe to assert . Only a few years ago a devotional poem of some merit was published by an English divine , evidently intended to give a correct description of judgment and eternity as understood by the author. * It was received with so much favor in influential quarters that an extract from it will be pertinent to our theme . The writer saw before him at the judgment-seat all that portion of the human race doomed to death . Among themI beheld the forms Of many I had known from youth to prime -- Sheep , wayward sheep whom I had vainly sought , Now fronting the Chief Shepherd face to face . // And now the fold was closed : and it was mine To witness I had called in vain . 0 God , Thou know'st , thou only , what sustained me then . " When the terrible sentence was pronounced , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of the body of the saved , said with emotion on all sides , " Amen ! " " God spake , and it was done . Again the floor Of solid crystal where the damn*d stood Opened its mouth , immeasurable leagues ; And with a cry whose piercing echoes yet Beat through the void of shoreless space , the lost Helplessly , hopelessly , resistlessly , Adown the inevitable fissure sank As sank before the ruined hosts of hell , Still down , still ever down , from deep to deep , Into the outer darkness , till at last The fiery gulf received them , and they plunged Beneath Gehenna 's burning sulphurous waves In the abyss of ever-during woe . " Although the beatified beholders all shed tears at the sight , the fate of their doomed brethren was not entirely concealed from their view : " No Lethe rolled its dark , oblivious waves , As some have feigned , betwixt that world of woe And ours of bliss . But rather , as of old Foreshadowed in the prescient oracles , The smoke of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holy seraphim , And in the presence of the Lamb of God , For ever and for ever . At the first Nothing was heard ascending from the deep Save wailings and unutterable groans , Wrung from them by o'ermastering agony . " After a while , however , " order arose from that profound confusion unconfused , " " Silence assumed her adamantine throne , " and the " wrathful blasphemy " ceased . We pass over the questions suggested by this view-questions which even opponents of religion mercifully refrain from asking . It has been decided that the words " eternal punishment " must stand , but every one is free to define them in his own way . A constantly increasing party is making them mean , simply leaving the unsaved // to their own meditations  --  to suffer under the pangs of their own consciences . Under such influences the doctrine of future punishment is dragging its anchors more rapidly than any other toward the rocks which threaten it . On one of these rocks hell becomes a place to which few of the human race are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only the portion so irretrievably wicked that their existence would be a burden to themselves almost anywhere in the universe . On the other rock the punishment is mitigated to an unknown extent , though the requirements for escaping it may be maintained in their utmost rigor . The " Westminster Standard " informs us what the extreme requirements are , and we may judge of them by the following question and answer : " Question 60. - Can those who have never heard the gospel , and so know not Jesus Christ nor believe in him , be saved by their living according to the light of nature ? " Answer. - They who , having never heard the gospel , know not Jesus Christ and believe not in him , can not be saved be they never so diligent to frame their lives according to the light of nature , or the laws of that religion which they profess ; neither is there salvation in any other but in Christ alone , who is the Saviour only of the body of his Church . " Accepting this view , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of philosophers of past and present ages , of the leaders in science and thought at the present day , and of the men who have made the nineteenth century what it is . It is , however , impossible for enlightened man at the present time to conceive of these men going to the old-fashioned place of endless punishment . Under the influence of this feeling , combined with the old doctrine of salvation , hell would become a place where Zoroaster and Confucius , Cicero and Demosthenes , Homer and Virgil , Paine and Voltaire , Galileo and Franklin , Humboldt and Hacekel , with their countless unbelieving followers and disciples , are to exist for ever in an uninterrupted communion of thought . In either case hell is shorn of most of its terrors , and , in the latter case , the extreme of beneficence will be to let each member of the human race choose which place he will go to . Perhaps the most striking example of the readiness of theology to temporize with the irreligious thought of the day , and to explain away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attitude toward the now fashionable theory of evolution . No other modern theory // is so directly opposed to the doctrine which lies at the basis of our orthodox system of theology . The latter teaches that man was created in a state of moral perfection ; in the especial image of his Maker ; free from sin ; not subjected to death ; endowed with a conscience showing him the difference between right and wrong . From this state of perfection he fell into what we know he has been in past times by a single act of transgression , and has been again elevated only by the supernatural interference of his Maker . On the theory of evolution , he was not created at all , in any sense in which the word has ever been understood . Indeed , there never was any personal Adam , the human race being simply the de* scendants of an improved race of apes . Originally man had no more conscience than his brute progenitors , and right , wrong , or morality applied no more to his acts than to those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was only for the same reason that the lower animals are free from it : because no conscience told him the distinction between right and wrong . Conscience was a gradual growth from such small beginnings as we now see in the domestic dog , and never attained such a development as it now has among men . The progress of man , though frequently stationary with certain races and during long periods of time , has , on the whole , been steadily upward , by virtue of the primeval laws of nature itself . Death was in the world from the beginning of life , and was inherited by man from the brute . In one word , the theory pronounces the whole theological doctrine of the origin and fall of man to be a fiction as complete as anything in pagan mythology . When this theory was first propounded , it was very naturally considered as subversive of the whole basis of Christian doctrine , unworthy of the instincts and aspirations of manhood , and incapable of being held by any one having the slightest pretensions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expressed in his Origin of Species , " were , however , adopted so extensively by sympathizers with orthodoxy , that they could not be viewed as decidedly heterodox . A distinction was for a time drawn between Darwinism proper , which was supposed to be true only for the lower animals , and the German extension of the doctrine , which included man himself in its range . But the wall which separates these views rests on too weak a logical basis to stand , and , since the publication of the " Descent of Man , " the doctrine of Darwinism and that of evolution may be regarded as one , so few are the thinkers who support the one and reject the other . // Although the theory of evolution has only begun to receive serious consideration or support within the memory of every reader of this " Review , " yet in our centers of learning individual theologians have already begun to dally with it in a way which , to the spirit of Jonathan Edwards , would have been simply shocking . We do not mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theologians , or that they view arguments against it with anything but sympathy . But it can hardly be denied that they frequently assume an attitude toward it which must be regarded as ominous . Their very anxiety that science and religion shall be at one leads them into the dalliance which is so dangerous . For instance , if one claims that the doctrine of evolution is entirely consistent with the glory of the Creator and with religious faith , his view is apt to be received with entire favor . If the scientific lecturer will attribute all the results he describes to the Divine power , inform his audience that all laws imply a law-giver , rebuke the pride of his atheistic fellow students , dwell on the uncertainty of all scientific generalizations , and keep prominent that void in the human soul which can be filled only by Christianity , he will be considered entitled to rank as a Christian , no matter how completely he teaches and asserts the objectionable doctrine as a purely scientific generalization . He will have no embarrassing questions put to him as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another instance of the same sort is seen in the efforts occasionally made by the representatives of religious faith to persuade themselves that there are two distinct forms of the doctrine of evolution-the one atheistic , the other theistic ; the one irreligious , the other religious . This is founded on a misconception which arises from confounding that general sympathy with religion which a few evolutionists profess with a modification of the doctrine . That evolutionists may vary in their religious profession no one will deny ; and so long as a formal profession of religious faith , without any specification of the particular things believed in , or any explanation of the consistency of faith with evolutionist doctrines is required , so long may we expect these differences . But to assert that there is any difference between the doctrine of evolution as held by one and as held by another , is almost like asserting that there are two theories of gravitation , a moral and immoral one . The doctrine of evolution is , so far as the origin of man , his faculties and his instincts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neither more nor less , neither better nor worse . The naturalist may write Deus // fecit on every bone of his fossil horse , but his theory of the descent of that horse is not thereby modified in the slightest degree . He may preach to his fellow scientist every Sunday on the vanity of the human intellect , but that is not at all germane to his lecture on Monday showing that man was descended from an ape . He may attribute everything to the Divine power without at all lessening the antagonism between his theory and that of the creation of man in a state of moral perfection . Yet it is on such a flimsy basis as a vague declaration of religious faith from evolutionists that many theologians are seeking for a compromise , or at least a truce with evolution . What would Edwards have said to this temporizing ? Would he have dealt with such a doctrine in the evasive phrases and high-flown generalities which his successors now use ? Every one knows that he would not . No evolutionist could have secured admittance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of reverential phraseology . He would not have condescended to argue the inconsistency of the doctrine with that of the fall of Adam and with the plan of salvation . Those who listened to his discourse would have no doubt of his meaning , and the temporizing course now adopted by his successors would have been , to him , the surrender of Christianity itself . The change of position which we have cited is founded on a state of things so well known that few will deny its reality . But the change takes another form , which makes it much more difficult of definition , and leaves us in great doubt how much of what our ancestors would consider religious belief remains as a living reality in our midst . One of the difficulties which theology meets with arises from its supposed necessity of claiming its doctrines to be the expression of eternal and immutable truth . Therefore , when it finds a divergence from those written standards of the past to which it is a part of its traditional policy to adhere , it does not openly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but allows each person to put his own interpretation on the words of his creed . A natural desire to continue identified with the faith in which one has been nurtured leads men to adhere to the expressions of their creed as long as it is possible to do so , and to make every effort to reconcile its words with their opinions . This is most easily done by searching for symbolic interpretations . Thus the language of religious doctrine is becoming less and less literal , and more and more symbolic . Of course , a symbolic language // may be as clear and definite as a literal one , if its meaning and application are clearly and strictly defined . But the very admission of such new definitions of the things supposed to be symbolized , or even the open admission that the language was purely symbolic , would destroy the claim for immutability . The rcsult is , that it is now unfashionable in the extreme for any one in general society , or even in religious circles , to talk about his religious opinions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be kept in concealment as if he were a patient with yellow fever . The tendency of religious doctrine to become less literal , and more mystic and poetical , is of course encouraged by this growing distaste for doctrinal discussion . The mere intellectual acceptance of doctrines as true is being left in the background , and religious services are becoming more and more emotional . Everything looks as if the more advanced church of the present day is developing into a place where the jaded mind shall revel in poetic imagery , and the emotional nature be cultivated by the charms of music and the forms of worship . In fact , have not our more fashionable city churches of nearly every denomination just about attained this ideal ' ? We believe that those who will either deny or regret it will soon be in the minority . Such are the leading features of the influence of modern thought upon theology . They show how the religious system of the present time will fall , if it ever does fall . It will not be by the attacks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasion to make attacks , and , when they do , the Church can cite arguments in its own favor as strong to all appearance as any that are likely to be brought against it . Indeed , as Mr. Lecky has acutely remarked , public thought and opinion are very slightly influenced by mere argument . The tides of thought which flow silently through the minds of great masses of men are far more potent causes of belief than the most logical and conclusive arguments . Our opinions on nearly all subjects are formed by processes of which we are scarcely conscious , and of which only the few are able to give even an intelligible description . If the present state of things goes on , even the Sundayschool scholar can not fail at last to notice the absence of congruity between the doctrines of the catechism and the acts and feelings of the world . The more he sees of the heathen , the Parsce , and the man of business , the less he will feel the distinction betwecn sheep and goats , as drawn by his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these , will die a perfectly quiet // and natural death , with none to mourn their departure . Indeed , they may be gone for years before they will ever be missed , and their loss will be discovered only by those who take enough of interest in them to engage in a search after them . What , then , is the real fact presented to our view ? The great body of orthodox religious doctrine known as systematic theologyembracing the time-honored theory of the origin of man , his relations to his Maker , the origin of conscience , the nature of right and wrong , the moral government of the world , the reward of virtue , and the punishment of vice-is being silently modified under the influence of a current of thought peculiar to our time to an extent which it is difficult to define . Where is the change going to stop ? There are still a few fundamental doctrines to which theologians adhere with a grasp as strong as ever , and which they no doubt flatter themselves will stand against the current of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what are fundamental and what are not ? It is only a few years since the doctrines which some theologians now seem so ready to surrender to evolution were regarded as so fundamental that salvation was denied to those who rejected them . If the ship is dragging her anchors before the rising gale , who shall tell how much further she may be driven ? However firm may be her present anchorage , it behooves us to look to leeward and see what rocks lie in the direction in which the wind is blowing . There is no difficulty in telling them off : The personal Deity a relic of old Jupiter ; man a highly developed animal , having the same origin as the brutes from which he sprang , and distinguished from them only by the development of certain ideas heaven the fairy-land of the infant race ; Providence its Santa Claus ; the Bible a collection of ancient poetry ; the divine law a natural growth in the minds of men ; conscience , right , and duty products of the natural development of humanity ; no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their natural consequences as brought about by the laws of nature or the impulses of mankind ; the future life a beautiful dream , from which we would fain not wake . On such rocks as these all the religious and theological doctrines of the past go to wreck with the mythology of Greece and the belief in witchcraft . The question which now presents itself is , Have we at the present time any religious system which will outlive such a catastrophe ? Of course , the question may arise whether any system which does not recognize the hitherto received truths of // religion as its basis can be called a religious system . This is a question of terminology which it is not worth while to argue at length , because , if we admit that the new system is subversive of the religion of the past , it would then be a something taking the place of that religion , and might therefore properly inherit the old name . The question of terminology has come up before when it has been asked whether those who deny the divinity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the very nature of things , can not be definitively settled . We shall , therefore , leave it entirely with the reader to decide whether what we here call the new religion is or is not worthy the name of religion ; whether it is or is not founded on Christianity ; whether it is or is not a refined and elevated form of the system first taught by Christ himself . All we seek to do is to show him that certain ideas respecting the first duty of man are now prevalent among the most enlightened of mankind ; that when measured by the highest ethical standard they are more worthy of admiration than any similar ideas which have been entertained in the past , and that they are not necessarily founded on anything which has heretofore been considered as religious faith . They are not opposed to such faith so far as to condemn it , but are merely independent of it . The votaries of this new religion include men of every form of religious profession , from the most orthodox believers , who think that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have never made a profound examination of its basis , to the most extreme atheists , materialists , and evolutionists . It is , from the point of view of one who wishes to preserve the great doctrines of God and immortality from any possible catastrophe that may wreck others , a misfortune that the work of pointing out what needs amendment in our present system is left so much in the hands of the opponents of all doctrine . If all sympathizers , with religion in general who admit , as most do , that many doctrines of the past are as good as gone , would frankly state in what they conceive the change to consist , instead of confining their remarks to mysterious whispers , the way would be opened for a good understanding between sects now at war . The great difference between the new religion and that current at the present time in our churches is to be seen not so much in its practical outcome as in the theory on which it is founded . The system of doctrines the subversion of which among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after all , a theoreti // cal rather than a practical system . It embodies a collection of propositions , more or less abstract , respecting the personality of the Creator , the inspiration of the Scriptures , the supernatural origin of Christianity and the future life , which do not now have that great practical effect upon human life and thought which they once had . We do not , of course , deny that they had . such an effect in tixne* y*a*t , awl will have it in the future upon large classes of society . We need not even now argue whether there is any class on whom they are without influence . We only claim that the greater the moral improvement of mankind the less the influence which such doctrines will have upon their daily life and spiritual condition . We shall begin by viewing the supposed decay of belief on its most gloomy side . The great pall which evolution throws over the hopes of the more elevated classes of humanity is the skepticism which it engenders respecting the personal immortality of the individual soul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theory that there was an infinite gulf between the nature of man and that of the lower animals . For the latter Christianity has held out no hope of a future state . Jndeed , it is obvious to all that it would be belittling the position of man to suppose the lower animals immortal . It is the great elevation of man above " the beasts which perish " which has been supposed to mark him as the peculiar object of his Maker 's interest . But , if man is simply a developed animal , why should he hope for any other than an animal existence ? It must be remembered that the difference between a simply perishable animal and the immortal spirit is not merely one of degree , but of kind . The former can never develop into the latter by mere processes of natural growth , because the passage from mortality to immortality is of infinite length , with no intermediate steps . There must have been a man into whom the immortal soul was first breathed , else man is only an animal . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their theory to contradict the notion of such a first man , yet the general tenor of the theory is against such a notion , as involving a sort of supernatural interference of the very kind which the theory was devised to get rid of . The logical incongruity is such that , if evolution is once admitted , immortality can be looked upon as little more than the vaguest kind of a hope , founded on our ignorance of the possibilities of nature . A weakening of the hope of immortality is the more to be regretted because , of all doctrines , that of a future life is the single one which , even should it be ill-grounded , would yet // conduce to human happiness . Nearly every other dogma has two sides associated with it as involving a deception of mankind should it prove to be ill founded . But , if our hope of immortality is unfounded , the fact will never be known to us . No voice will ever come back from the grave to inform mankind that they are deceived , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who have passed away , over the blasting of their hopes . But let us look a little closer at the relation of the doctrine to human life . Why do we desire immortality ' ? So far as each individual desires it for himself , as a means of enjoying eternal happiness , the desire is a purely egoistic one . Of course it may , and undoubtedly does in many cases , grow out of a love of God , but it does not grow out of a desire to do God a service , because the Creator of man can create beings of a higher order , who shall serve his purpose better than the latter possibly can . If it would not be analyzing our most tender feelings too closely , we might comment upon the incongruity between the two views which we find combined in our religious sentiments : that man before his Maker is but " a worm in the dust , " a being so low and so vile as to be unworthy of even his pitying glance ; and , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the creation that the Creator himself desires to preserve every member of the race to eternity , in order that he may enjoy communion with him . Another reason for supporting the doctrine of immortality , and the reason which will probably first occur to the minds of most religious believers , is that mankind can be kept from sin only by the rewards and punishments held out to them in a future life . Every sin in not punished , nor can every virtue be rewarded in this world . If the reward of virtue and the punishment of vice are confined to the imperfect efforts of man , it is asked by the theologian what object is there in being virtuous when we are sure that no good will recur to ourselves ; and in abstaining from the pleasures of sin when , as is often the case , we know that no punishment can follow ? This view is undoubtedly well founded , so long as we admit that human nature is such that men seek only their own selfish gratification in this world , and can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with it . But the question arises , Is human nature thus degraded ? If it is , then it can hardly be considered worthy of the Creator to suppose that he desires eternal communion with such a class of beings . If it is not-if there are men who love virtue and hate wickedness for their own sakes , apart // from all consequences to themselves personally-then we have another basis , entirely independent of rewards and punishments , for keeping such men in the right way . What we now wish to show is that this higher ideal is at least attainable , and we fain hope actually reached by all the better members of the community . We may admit that the masses of mankind in past ages have belonged to the degraded class , yet to claim that all mankind belong to this class is certainly taking a very low view of human nature . The doctrine of evolution asserts the moral as well as the physical perfectibility of man , and assumes his unending progress toward a higher ideal of character . The development of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entirely a physical one . Almost the only growth to which they were subjected was that of the physical capabilities of supporting life in the struggle for existence . But humanity has exhibited a growth of an entirely different character in the gradual development of moral and intellectual qualities . If we consider physical development as of the lowest order of importance , intellectual as the second , and the moral as the highest , then the processes of evolution of which humanity itself has been the subject are the highest of all . Looking at the matter from this point of view , and considering the evolution of the moral sentiments as the greatest step in the progress of animated nature , we may see that a new species of animal has begun to rule the world within quite recent times . This animal we call the refined Christian gentleman of modern society . He was not unknown in the past , specimens being seen in the persons of the Platos and Alfreds who adorned the histories of their times , but who nearly disappeared from the earth during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this being first began to modify the laws under which men lived . Then he seized the administration of government , and now he has made his way into the Church so quietly that no one perceives the change unless his attention is specially called to it . His love of virtue and hatred of sin are founded on an entirely different basis from that of rewards and punishments . He sees upon the earth an ocean of humanity , in which he is only a single drop ; he sees future generations coming upon the earth whose interests are more important than his own ; he knows that the good of others is something vastly more important than any that can come to himself ; he feels that it is his highest duty as an intellectual and moral being to conduce to the general good of this humanity , present and future . The // sole standard by which he measures the moral elevation of his fellow man is the extent to which they are animated by these highest motives . It matters not how we suppose this being to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primarily to consist of . A high sense of duty and a devotion to the happiness of mankind are equally admirable , whether we suppose them to rest on an immaterial basis , or to rise from a peculiar constitution of the brain ; whether we suppose them to have been immediately created by God , or to be the product of a slow development . We might take the standard of excellence offered us by this being as one of the most striking examples of the drift of modern thought from the standards of the old theology . According to the latter , all mankind are to be divided into two great classes , goats and sheep , between whom intervenes a gulf of infinite breadth . The one are under the curse of the Almighty , and doomed to eternal punishment unless they get themselves transferred to the other class before they die ; the others are to be the subjects of unending bliss if they do not fall away from grace . There may be many degrees of excellence between each class , but the space between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best out of the countless millions of the lost is the space between heaven and hell . The class to which a man shall belong is not determined so much by his moral purity or the elevation of his motives , as by his belief in the inspiration of the Scriptures , and the miraculous birth and resurrection of Christ , and his performance of certain mental acts of acceptance toward his Saviour . If he complies with these conditions , his moral constitution may be such that he has daily to repent of a propensity to enjoy the pleasures of sin , lets his notes go to protest and finds it very hard to recall his cattle when he sees them grazing in his neighbors ' fields ; yet if he fights manfully against his wicked propensities , and repents of each bad deed , he may remain among the elect . But if one finds himself an atheist , or even a disbeliever in the divine mission of Christ , his righteousness and moral elevation are but as filthy rags . He may labor for humanity with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the highest and purest of motives , without doing anything to remove from himself the curse of Adam . Such is the official standard of the written theology of our time , but how completely is the world receding from it ! The society of to-day has its standard , in which there is a substantial agreement among all classes and conditions of honest men with well-balanced // minds . If a committee of church-members , preachers , men of business , and men of thought , should be appointed to decide upon the highest worth of any human being , and the question of his merits or demerits as a moral and responsible agent , they would inquire : iDoes he work and think for himself or for the general good of others ? What are his most secret motives and springs of action ? Will he relieve suffering without asking the world to note who did it ? Is his mental constitution such that he is incapable of an act that he would fear to have known to the world ? These questions answered satisfactorily , none would inquire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To view the matter from another standpoint , let us suppose two men , equally virtuous so far as outward merit is concerned , brought before a tribunal of the best of mankind , in order that their innermost motives may be brought to light , and the question decided which is most worthy of acceptance in the eyes of his Maker . The heart of one says : " I am virtuous , because I was taught in my infancy that the good would be rewarded in heaven and the wicked punished in hell . I have often been sorely tempted , but the thought of the consequences to follow temptation has always deterred me from sin . The feeling that my eternal happiness and my communion with God were involved in my life here below has been my staff and comfort through temptation and adversity . " The heart of the other says : " I have no belief in a personal Deity , in a moral government of the universe , in Christ as more than a philosopher , or in a future state of rewards and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty to my fellow man . I was imbued in infancy with the view that , as a member of society , it was my duty to subordinate my own happiness to that of others . My sense of right and wrong was thus developed at a very early age , and by the constant endeavor to do what was right my conscience acquired a constantly increasing development , and asserted more and more its pdwer over my actions . I am not virtuous from any hope of reward or fear of punishment , but only because I feel that virtue is my highest duty , both to myself and to humanity . This feeling has developed to such an extent that the good of my fellow men is now my ruling motive , and vice the object of my most extreme detestation . " We can hardly be mistaken in supposing that the common consent of enlightened mankind would put the second man before the Ilrst . But , when both men shall be cited before the greatest tribu // nal of the universe , will this judgment be affirmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the personal existence of his Maker lead to his eternal condemnation ? If we say that it would , let us see what we would think of a human monarch pronouncing a sentence on the same principles . We know that , from habits of mind not necessary to analyze , the typical king of early ages was extremely punctilious in requiring recognition from his subjects , and it was supposed quite natural that he should be ready to decree banishment or death against a person so rash as to deny his existence . But any civilized monarch of the present day would be ashamed to decree a formal punishment for such an offense , or even to consider it an offense at all . The question now presents itself , if we think of God as condemning one to eternal punishment for atheism , to what do we liken him ? The dilemma we meet is this : if we think of him as condemning one whose course through life has been actuated by the most virtuous motives , because he entertained mistaken views of things eternal , we must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to that of past and unenlightened ages than it does to the conceptions of right and wrong now entertained by the most enlightened men . If we think of him as saving the atheistic moralist , is not some change necessary in our ordinary conceptions of Divine Justice . At first sight it might appear that the downfall of doctrine which we have described does away entirely with religious faith . Of course , if we consider that no faith can be religious except it has hitherto been recognized as orthodox , this may be true . But there is yet another faith besides that of the religion of the present-a faith that whatever is is right ; a faith that the pillars of religion and morality will stand , though the very foundation on which they have always been supposed to rest be washed away by the flood ; a faith that no change in the religious doctrines of enlightened men can occur , except such as will be better for humanity , and bring man nearer to eternal truth ; a faith that the throne of the moral universe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unshaken before all human discussion . Such a faith fears no false teaching , sets no limit on the freedom of human thought , and views with perfect calm the subversion of any and every form of doctrinal belief , confident that the ultimate result will tend to the elevation of the human soul and the unceasing progress of spiritual development . Whatever becomes of other forms of faith , we may expect this to strengthen as long as humanity shall endure .
