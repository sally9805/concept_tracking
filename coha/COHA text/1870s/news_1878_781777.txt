txt It is stated that the Republic of Peru is bankrupt . It owes about $200,000,000 , mostly to the trusting and much-abused British bondholder . It is in default about $6,000,000 for interest , and it is said to be the opinion of the best-informed business men at pma and Callao that no provision will ever be made for the payment of that or any other dues upon the foreign debt . To be sure , the obligation was originally " secured " by a mortgage upon the guano deposits and nitrate beds , which are a Government monopoly , and on sundry railroads that belong to the State and pay no dividends . But how are the bondholders to realize on . the security ? Notwithstanding th e pledge to its creditors , the Government has been letting out profitable contracts for guano to sundry parties , and spending the proceeds for other purposes than meeting . interest accounts . It borrowed money while it had credit , and freely mortgaged it s resources , acknowledged to be very great , for prompt payment , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market . Enormous beds of guano , which cost nothing but the gathering and shipping , and nitrate of soda by the acre , that only required to be put into merchantable shape , were regarded as almost as good as ' ready money subject to draft on sight . Besides , the railroads which ' were to be built with the borrowed capital were to " develop the country " and give a tremendous stimulus to industry and commerce , thus making it easy for Peru to pay her debts either from the direct proceeds of her railway traffic or from taxation on her prosperous people . The railroads have bee n built , at least in part ; at all events , the money has been spent on engineering of the most gigantic kind , but the country thus far fails to develop according to expectation . That daring outlaw from California , HENRY MEIGGS , pocketed a lar ; re share of the proceeds of the loans of71870 andis and ran fragments of railroads over and through and under the Andes , but somehow railroads alone do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manufactures going . Neither do they gather up products that are not produced , or create commerce where it is not . The difficulty with Peru is that the Government has been too much given to developing the country , and the people have left it for the Government to do . Nature has done so much for them that they do not consider it necessary to do anything for themselves . They leave it all to nature and the Government . Millions of birds for countless generations were making deposits for them to draw upon , along the coast and on the neighboring islands , and the Government took possession of them , and said there was no ncecessit y for taxation . Nature had provided an inexhaustible source of revenue : Nitre had been stored up for ages in the soil , and the Government seized it and said , here are riches ready at hand for all emergencies . The mountains are seamed and lined with silver , and these deposits also belong to the Government , but it neither works them with effect nor allows anybody else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the bark of Peru has been seen , not heard , in all lands . The soil is exceptionally rich ; cotton and sugarcane are easily raised ; the vine grows in luxuriance ; the mulberry tree fiourishea , and the silkworm spins , and never strikes for higher wages . In short , Peru has all the natural conditions for an exceptional prosperity . And yet Peru is bankrupt . Instead of using its resources wisely , it began borrowing money on them , discounting the future , and developing the country by the back-action process of building railroads on Government account . The railroads produce no revenue directly or indirectly , the investment is without immediate profit of any kind , the habit of paying current expenses out of Government monopolies is too strong to be resisted by politicians who have no scruple and are in constant fear of popular resistance and revolution . As a consequence , the country owes its $200 , - 000,000 , , and neglects to pay interest or to make any provision to meet obligations incurred so lightly . It will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pay . It is not likely to borrow much more for the purpose of developing , as there is a limit even to the gullibility of British lenders , who have had so much einperience with Turkey and Egypt and Peru that they may begin at last to suspect that " securities " may bear a Government seal and yet not be secure . In the interest of conciliation and national pride we refrain from alluding to any burning of fingers with South Carolina , Georgia , Virginia , or Tennessee bonds . We are speaking now of a humble and derided South American Republic . This sad case of national bankruptcy is due directly to the policy of developing the country and the efforts of a paternal Government to do for the people what they will not do for themselves . The policy can never succeed  --  because prosperity must be built up by an industrious , emfrgetic , and peace-pursuing population or not at all . Peru has some magnificent products besides volcanos , earthquakes , and guano . There is ample material ' for developing national deleted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
