LOUIS NAPOLEON AND THE SOUTHERN CON FEDERACY . SOME four or five years ago new and valuable sources of information were opened to the future historians of the war of the rebellion by the Government 's purchase of the Confederate archives . Those in the possession of the War Department , which illustrate and explain the movements of the Southern armies in the field , are being indexed , classified , and published . Those of the Confederate Department of State are deposited in the Treasury at Washington , and , with the exception of one or two letters of the rebel agents in Canada , have for various reasons not yet been made public . Among these latter curious records of the " lost cause " is the diplomatic correspondence of the Confederacy with its Commissioners in Europe . This consists of a few dispatches from Dudley , Rost , and Mann , who acted as Commissioners of the Confederacy in Europe from the beginning of the war until February , 1862 ; of some later dispatches from Mann at Brussels ; of a few letters of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one hundred and fifty dispatches from Slidell and Mason , the Confederate Commissioners at Paris and London respectively , beginning from the time they reached their posts after the Trent affair , in February , 1862 , and ending abruptly four months before the close of the war ; and , finally , of all official communications forwarded to these Commissioners by Judah P. Benjamin , the Confederate Secretary of State . Parts of these papers were written in cipher , and the translations made at Richmond accompany them . Of these dispatches by far the most important are those of Mr. Slidell . The story which they tell of the intentions and intrigues of Louis Napoleon not only exposes the duplicity of that remarkable // personage in his American diplomacy , but throws interesting sidelights upon the policy of the English Cabinet toward this country . They prove that the French Government was far less friendly to the United States than the British Cabinet ; that it was not owing to any scrupulous observance of the laws of neutrality , on the part of the Imperial Government , that Franco-Confederate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ France . Suggestions and assurances were given to Mr. Slidell and to others , by the Emperor in person , for the building and equipment of such privateers ; every facility was afforded the rebel agents by the imperial officials for this purpose ; and it was entirely due to the vigilance of Mr. Dayton , the United States Minister at Paris , and to a happy accident , that such plans miscarried . It also appears , beyond a reasonable doubt , that many of the rumors afloat in London and Washington during the war , as to the hostile designs of the Emperor , were not without foundation . During the first two years of the rebellion , while openly professing the most friendly feelings for the United States , the arch-plotter of the Tuileries was not only willing to act concurrently with her Majesty 's Government in recognizing the South , or in declaring the insufficiency of the blockade , but he was eager so to do ; he made repeated efforts , unofficial it is true , but none the less earnest , to induce the Palmerston-Russell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Ministry persistently refused or ignored all such overtures . There even appear reasons for believing that , but for the opportune capture of New Orleans , he would have taken some positive step in American affairs even without the c&amp;5peration of England . The tone of this correspondence shows , moreover , that Mr. Mason , Mr. Slidell , and Mr. Benjamin all considered the British Ministry , and Earl Russell especially , as indifferent if not unfriendly to their cause ; and that they never entertained any very sanguine hopes of action , on the part of England , after the Trent affair . Indeed , in the autumn of 1863 Mr. Mason 's long-standing complaints of the cold and distant treatment he had met with from the English officials were finally considered by his government , and , in compliance with an order from Mr. Benjamin , he withdrew from London , deeming his further presence there useless . It was not until the last of January , 1862 , that Slidell and Mason landed at Southampton , and proceeded to their destinations at Paris and London . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come . A series of disastrous reverses , followed by a period of sluggish inactivity , // had strengthened public opinion abroad that the destruction of the Union was an accomplished fact . The cotton famine was already producing its effect on the two millions in the United Kingdom , and on the hundreds of thousands in France , who depended upon that staple for their support ; and rumors were rife in the streets of Paris and London that the Mexican Expedition had other and far greater objects than those openly avowed by the allies . The letters of instruction which the Commissioners carried treated mainly of cotton subsidies , the inefficiency of the blockade , the right of the South to recognition , and the advantages which would accrue to England and France from free trade with the Confederacy . From the beginning the shrewd Commissioners seem to have looked to the foreign policy of Louis Napoleon for the recognition of the Confederacy or for armed intervention . It is needless to dwell upon the condition of the empire at this time , and the causes which shaped that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be perpetuated only by reviving the military passion , by stimulating in his subjects their traditional love of glory , and by dazzling France with repeated victories . It was necessary for him to assume not only the rdle of a savior of society , but that of a Providence in the affairs of nations . An aggressive foreign policy followed as a matter of course . Among the dreams of Louis Napoleon 's youth , which he appears never to have forgotten in maturer years , and which soon formed a part of this foreign policy , was that of restoring to France her long-lost colonial empire . The breaking out of the civil war in the United States afforded him an opportunity for obtaining a foothold on this continent . In one of his dispatches to Mr. Slidell , Mr. Benjamin quotes , in this CQnncctiOn , a letter giving a conversation which the writer had with the Emperor at the Villa Eug6nie in Biarritz , about the beginning of the war : He ( the Emperor ) turned with peculiar and undisguised eagerness to the Mexican question . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Morro , the sums the United States had spent on the fortifications in Florida , the exports and imports of Galveston and Matamoras , in short everything which well-informed local agents could have reported to an experienced statesman eager for information . He examined me again on Texas and its population , the disposition of the French residents , the tendencies of the German colonists , the feeling on the Mexican frontier . Twice , I remember well , he repeated , " La Louisiane n'est ce pas qu'elle est Fran*aise au fond ? " // At last he turned to the colonies , and then stated in round terms ( finding that I quoted from his " Id&amp;s Napoldoniennes " ) the well-known words , " Eb bien , il faut reconstruire 1'empire lA has . " From what I could then gather I was fully persuaded that he proposed to seek in Mexico a compensation for the lost colonies in the West Indies , which , he said , could not be recovered " sans nous brouliler avec nos alli6s . " He insisted upon it that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terre " on the Florida coast for the purpose of protecting her commerce in the Gulf , for , he added , " nous ne voulons pas d'un autre Gibraltar de ce c6t* IA . " Everything looked encouraging to Mr. Slidell upon his arrival at Paris . The Imperial Government , by the Mexican Expedition , by its half - official endorsement of the intemperate brochure of M. de Hauteville on the Trent affair , and by the tone of its official organ , " The Moniteur , " had clearly indicated its hostile policy toward the United States . The current of feeling in Paris ran strongly against the North , and the Laboulayes and Gasparins , in their vain efforts to stem it , had even less success than Exeter Hall and Manchester in England . Although openly declaring that England and France would act together on all American questions , the imperialist leaders had not been cautious in their expressions of the secret policy to be pursued toward the South . As early as May , 1861 , the Due de Morny , the greatest personage in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first Confederate agent at Paris , that " the South would soon be recognized . He considered it a mere question of time " ; and , in several dispatches written during the summer and fall of 1861 , Mr. Rost also declared that he had it on authority which he was not at liberty to doubt , that the Emperor was ready to recognize the Confederacy jointly with England , but that so far he had not been able to persuade England to act with him . We shall see that the letters of Mr. Slidell corroborate these statements . Upon his arrival in Paris , Mr. Slidell , after consulting with the Commissioners whom he superseded , had interviews with M. Thouv6nel , Minister of Foreign Affairs ; Persigny , then Minister of the Interior ; Fould , Minister of Finance ; Rouher , Minister of Commerce ; De Morny ; Count Walewski ; Baroche , President of the Council of State ; and Mocquard , the private secretary of the Emperor . After exchanging views with these high officials , he wrote a letter to his government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of friendliness for the South , and then declares positively : " The Emperor has invited the English Government to // join with him in recognizing the South , but the English Government , owing to Earl Russell , has refused to act simultaneously with him . " The grounds for this rather startling statement , rumors of which seem to have reached the ears of both Mr. Adams and Mr. Dayton , are explained in a later dispatch , dated April 14 , 1862 , which contains an account of an interview which took place on April 11th , between the Emperor and Mr. Lindsay , an English ship-builder , member of Parliament , and Southern sympathizer : Mr. Lindsay spoke of the Federal blockade as being ineffectual , and not in accordance with the fourth article of the Congress of Paris , and mentioned facts in support of his opinion . The Emperor fully concurred in Mr. Lindsay 's opinion , and said he would long since have declared the inefficiency of the blockade and taken the necessary steps to put an end to it , but that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that he had been and was still unwilling to act without it ; that M. Thouv*nel had twice addressed to the British Government , through the Ambassador at London , representations to that effect , but that no definite response had been elicited . The dates of these representations were not mentioned by the Emperor , but M. Bouher ( Minister of Commerce ) had said to Mr. Lindsay that the first had been made during the past summer , say in June , and the other about four weeks ago . . What , then , was to be done ? He could not again address the English Ministry through the official channels , without some reason to believe that his representations would receive a favorable response ; that for that reason he had been desirous to see Mr. Lindsay ; that he was prepared to act promptly and decidedly ; that he would at once dispatch a formidable fleet to the mouth of the Mississippi , if England would send an equal force , and that they would demand free egress and ingress for their merchantmen with their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essential to the world ; . . . that he had from the first considered the restoration of the Union impossible , and for that reason had deprecated the continuance of a contest which could not lead to any other result than separation . He authorized Mr. Lindsay to make this statement to Lord Cowley , and to ascertain whether he would recommend the course indicated to his government . . Mr. Lindsay reported on Sunday , the 13th instant , to the Emperor , the details of the conversation he had with Lord Cowley , the substance of which was , that he did not think his government was prepared to act at present , that the proper moment for action had passed , and that further developments should be waited for . The Emperor was even more emphatic than on Fridaj in the expression of his opinion . He requested Mr. Lindsay to see Lords Palmerston and Russell , and communicate to them everything that had passed . He seemed much dissatisfied with the course of England . He also wished // Mr. Lindsay to see Lord Derby and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would not be proper to address himself to the leaders of the Opposition , but that they might be informed of his views and wishes . He asked Mr. Lindsay to inform himself fully of the intentions of Lord Russell , etc. , and to return as soon as possible to give him the result . He said he did not desire to be embarrassed by the forms and delays of diplomacy , as he felt the necessity of immediate action . On the 18th day of April , six days after the above dispatch , Mr. Slidell again wrote his government on the same subject as follows : Lindsay returned on the 17th instant , and to-day saw the Emperor . Earl Russell , in response to a note which Lindsay had addressed to him , that he was charged with an important message to him from the Emperor , said that he could receive no communications from a foreign power , excepting through the regular diplomatic channels . Lindsay saw Disraeli , who expressed great interest in our affairs , and fully concurred in the views of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to believe that a secret understanding existed between Lord Russell and Seward , that England would respect the Federal blockade , and withhold our recognition ; that , if France would take the initiative , any course she might adopt to put an end to the present state of affairs would undoubtedly be supported by a large majority in Parliament , and , knowing this , Lord Russell would give a reluctant assent to this , to avoid what would otherwise certainly follow , a change of ministry . The Emperor said that Lord Russell had dealt unfairly in sending to Lord Lyons ( the British Minister at Washington ) copies of his representations , made through the Minister at London , on the subject of American affairs , and which had been made known to Seward . He heard Lindsay 's notes of his conversation with Disraeli with great interest , and seemed particularly struck with what he had said about the previous understanding already mentioned , as affording a key to what he had not been able before to comprehend ; and , with the suggestion that if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compelled to follow his example . He repeated that , while he desired to preserve a strict neutrality , he could not consent that his people should continue to suffer from the acts of the Federal Government . He thought the best course would be to make a friendly appeal to it , either alone or concurrently with England , to open the ports , but to accompany the appeal with a proper demonstration of force on our coasts , and , should the appeal appear likely to be ineffectual , to back it by a declaration of his purpose not to respect the blockade . The taking of New Orleans , which he did not anticipate , might render it inexpedient to act ; that he would not decide at once , but would wait some days for further intelligence . Here the interview ended with a request to Mr. Lindsay to keep it secret . There are good reasons for believing that Louis Kapoleon meant just what he said to Mr. Lindsay in these conversations . Ko one , // it is true , understood better than he the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pas dissimuler , ne sait pas r6gner . " And al*though Mr. Dayton , as well as other keen observers who have studied his character , speak of his habitual caution and reserve , yet , like all radically weak men , he was prone to rely on those around him , and at times expressed his views to his friends with a dangerous frankness and familiarity . Moreover , at subsequent interviews with Slidell , Roebuck , and Lindsay , he often repeated this charge against the English Government , in almost the same words . It is evident , too , that he spoke openly to Slidell , since he discussed in later conversations with him all the steps which he meant to take , and several that he did take , in American affairs , such as the six months ' armistice and the offer of mediation . A year later , indeed , this freedom of speech involved him in a serious complication with Roebuck , Lindsay , and Earl Russell . But , fortunately for the Union , at this critical time , when the Emperor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determined upon his " friendly " appeal to the North to open the ports , and , should such appeal appear likely to be ineffectual , to back it by a declaration of his purpose not to respect the blockade , what he " did not anticipate " occurred . While he was speaking , the Federal guns opened fire , and in a few days the news was flashed across the ocean that Farragut and heroic old Bailey had swept past the forts at the mouth of the Mississippi , and that New Orleans had fallen . The disastrous effect of this catastrophe upon the projects of the French Emperor appears from Mr. Slidell 's dismal acknowledgments . In a conversation which he had a few weeks afterward with M. Billault , the Minister sans portefeuille , one of the most conservative and cautious men in the Cabinet , who represented the Government in the Chambers upon all subjects connected with foreign affairs , Mr. Slidell read a note which he had received from Sir Charles Wood , a leading Southern sympathizer in England , denying that the British Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it was as well disposed to the South as the Emperor himself . In answer to this , M. Billault declared that the French Cabinet , with the possible exception of M. ThouvCnel , had been unanimously in favor of the South , and added that , " if New Orleans had not fallen , our recognition could not have been much longer delayed , but that even after that disaster , if we obtained decided successes in Virginia and Tennessee , or could hold // the enemy at bay for a month or two , the same result would follow . " In an interview with M. Thouv*nel , about the same time , Mr. Slidell also reports : Although he did not directly say so , his manner left me fairly to infer that if New Orleans had not been taken , and we suffered no very serious reverses in Virginia and Tennessee , our recognition would very soon have been declared ; and that , if we gained any decided victory there , the capture of our ports would not prevent it at a very early day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have been due partly to his often-expressed conviction that the Union was for ever dissolved , and partly to the exigencies of the situation in Mexico . His famous letter to General Forey was written early in July , and clearly outlines the policy to be pursued toward this country . " In the present state of civilization in the world , " he writes , " the prosperity of America is not a subject of indifference to Europe , for she nourishes our manufactures and gives life to our commerce . We are interested in having the Republic of the United States a powerful and prosperous power , but we are not willing to have that republic take possession of the entire Gulf of Mexico , command from there the Antilles as well as South America , and monopolize the distribution of the products of the New World . " To prevent this a stable government would have to be established in Mexico , and he adds , " We will in that event have restored to the Latin race on the other side of the Atlantic its power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter to General Forey , the Confederate government seems to have become seriously alarmed lest the Emperor , in his dream of " restoring to the Latin race on the other side of the Atlantic its strength and prestige , " should not rest satisfied with the conquest of Mexico alone . In a long letter to Mr. Slidell , on the subject of French intrigues in Texas , looking toward the establishment of that great State as an independent power between the Confederacy and Mexico , Mr. Benjamin incloses a note from M. Th6ron , a French consul in Texas , to Governor Lubbock of that State , which the latter had immediately forwarded to Jefferson Davis . It is dated August 18 , 1862 , and reads as follows : Sin : Will you be kind enough to inform me , confidentially , of your personal opinion on the following questions : 1 . The annexation of the Republic of Texas to the United States , was or was not a good political movement . // 8 . The reestablishment of the old Republic of Texas , will or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your answer to these three questions , sir , will serve me as a guide in my political correspondence with the governments which I have the honor to represent . The Confederate Government was so startled by this novel and blundering attempt to induce the chief official of the State of Texas to carry out to its logical results the cherished doctrine of secession , that M. Th6ron , as well as the French Consul at Richmond , who had been taking a suspicious interest in Texan affairs , was ordered to leave the Confederate States . On July 16th , about a fortnight after the Forey letter was written , Mr. Slidell was granted his first personal audience with the Emperor , at which the latter again expressed his dissatisfaction at the " waiting " policy of the British Cabinet , and declared that his friendly services had not been appreciated by the English Government . He then said : That he had committed a great error , which he now deeply regretted ; that France should never have respected the blockade ; that the European powers should have recognized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possession , and when we were menacing Washington ; . . . . that the difficulty was to find the way to give effect to his sympathies ; that he had always desired to preserve the most friendly relations with England , and that in so grave a matter he had not been willing to act without her cooperation ; that he had several times intimated his wish for action in our behalf , but had met with no favorable response ; and that , besides , England had a deeper interest in the question than France-that she " wished him to draw the chestnuts from the fire " for her benefit . During this whole summer of 1862 neither Mr. Dayton nor Mr. Adams seems to have been willing to attach much importance to the rumors of the hostile designs of the French Emperor , which were flying about the streets of London and Paris , though they often allude to them in their dispatches . " I listen to all such reports , " writes Mr. Dayton in August , to Mr. Seward , " with the utmost distrust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Slidell has ever , on any occasion , exchanged a word with the Emperor . " This skepticism on their part was increased by the denials of members of the British Cabinet that the Emperor had made any propositions whatever to her Majesty 's Government on the American question . Early in June Mr. Mason also heard from trustworthy sources that both Lord Palmerston and Lord Russell declared that no action // was contemplated by their Government in American affairs ; and that they positively denied that any overtures looking toward recognition or intervention had been received by them from France . Greatly surprised at these contradictions , coming , as they did , so soon after Lindsay 's interview with the Emperor , memoranda of which were in his hands , he made further inquiries into the matter , and in a dispatch to Mr. Benjamin expressed his views on the subject as follows " It is notorious that the French Emperor is anxious and willing to recognize the South with England , and has pressed the Ministry to join him in so doing , but that not officially . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Russell refer only to official propositions , and that by diplomatic usage they were justified in taking no notice of any communications which were not strictly official . This opinion of Mr. Mason 's was subsequently confirmed by the Emperor himself , in a later interview with Mr. Slidell in October . The latter spoke of the denials of Lord Cowley , of the report that his government had received any official notification as to the Emperor 's views on the American question , and somewhat naiively asked him for an explanation . At this the wily diplomatist " smiled , and said that he supposed it was in accordance with diplomatic usages to consider nothing to exist that had not been formally written . " It seems probable , therefore , that the denials of the British Cabinet were true ; that the French Ambassador at London had not yet presented any written letters to the English Government , containing any direct statement of the views of the Emperor on the subject of recognition or intervention ; that the latter , evidently distrusting the " tortuous policy of perfidious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of diplomacy  --  to acquaint the British Cabinet unofficially with his views and readiness to act with them , provided the direct proposition came from them ; so that , in case of a rupture with the United States , England might appear to be the party taking the initiative . But Lords Palmerston and Russell , who had probably not forgotten the duplicity of Louis Napoleon in the Crimean diplomacy , and who may have felt that they had been again hoodwinked by that astute intriguer in the negotiations immediately preceding the Mexican Expedition , would take no notice of any unwritten propositions of any kind . The autumn of 1862 passed without change in the aspect of American affairs . In October M. Thouv6nel resigned his office , // ostensibly on account of his views on the Italian diplomacy , though Mr. Slidell surmised from hints which the Emperor had let fall at his October interview , that it was partly occasioned by his lack of vigor on the American question . Before his resignation , however , he declared to Mr. Slidell that the claim made by Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Emperor 's views on the subject of recognition , was a " mauvaise plaisanterie " on the part of the English Government , and assured him that there had been " des pourparlers trZ*s riels " on the subject , and that England was not disposed to act . He was succeeded by M. Drouyn de Lhuys . Soon after this change in the management of the Foreign Office , Mr. Slidell , learning from Persigny that the Emperor was making " des d6marches " in favor of the South throughout Europe , and that he was impatient to act , requested and obtained another personal audience . " The Emperor began the conversation by repeating that the condition of affairs in Europe was very unsatisfactory , especially in Italy and Greece , and that he had to act with extreme caution . After referring to the possibility of joint mediation on the part of France , England , and Russia , which Mr. Slidell considered useless , his Majesty then said : . . . My own preference is for a proposition of an armistice for six months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world . This would put a stop to the effusion of blood , and hostilities would probably never be resumed . We can urge it on the high grounds of humanity and the interests of the whole civilized world . If it be refused by the North , it will afford good reason for recognition , and perhaps for more active intervention . ' I said that such a course would be judicious and acceptable-indeed , it was one that I had suggested to M. Thouv6nel in February last ; that I feared , however , he would find it as difficult to obtain the co&amp;peration of England for it as for recognition . " The Emperor , however , thought that the cooperation of England might perhaps be obtained . The conversation was then changed by the Emperor asking why the Confederacy had not created a navy . After discussing the subject of building ships abroad , Mr. Slidell said that , " if the Emperor would give only some kind of verbal assurance that the police would not watch too closely when we put on guns and men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this the Emperor said : Why could you not have them built as if for the Italian Government ? I do not think it would be difficult , but I will consult my ministers about it . " ' // What followed this interview is well known . In a few days a circular dispatch was sent to England and Russia , suggesting a joint appeal to the belligerents for a six months ' armistice , following in this the original plan of Mr. Slidell . To this , England returned a negative answer , and Russia promptly refused , keeping her promise made through Prince Gortchakoff to Bayard Taylor at St. Petersburg earlier in the war . But the Emperor was not satisfied with the results of this November plan . As soon as he learned of the fate of this scheme , his direct offer of mediation was made through his Minister at Washington , couched in the most friendly terms , and " urged on the high ground of humanity , " which had also been fully discussed with Mr. Slidell . This was emphatically rejected by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Alabama , and the Emperor 's suggestion about building privateers " as if for the Italian Government , " set the rebel agents to work in that direction . M. Drouyn de Lhuys , who was apparently on very confidential terms with Mr. Slidell , and who was perfectly aware , according to the latter , of the peculiar relations existing between one of his subordinates and Mr. Slidell , was consulted on the subject of building these ships . He said that it " was an affair that belonged rather to the Minister of Commerce or of Marine ; that it was better that he should know nothing of it ; that he was quite willing to close his eyes until some direct appeal was made to him . " The Minister of Commerce was then interviewed , and , to Mr. Slidell 's categorical inquiry as to " whether , if we were to build ships of war in French ports , we should he permitted to arm and equip them and proceed to sea , " answered in the affirmative . M. Arman , a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of arming war-steamers which might be built for the Confederacy . " The Emperor assured him that there should be no difficulty on the subject , and authorized him to say so to me . M. Arman suggested that I would probably not be satisfied with any assurance which I did not receive directly from the Emperor , and asked if he would not grant me an audience for that purpose . He replied that he thought that a message from him should satisfy me , but that , as he had already received me , there was no reason why he should not again do so . " A few weeks after this , Mr. Slideli had an audience with the Emperor , and expressed to him his thanks for his sanction of the contract made for the building of // four ships of war at Bordeaux and Nantes . " I then informed him " ( he writes ) " that we were prepared to build several iron-clad ships in France , and that I only required his verbal assurance that they should be allowed to proceed to sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for this purpose . " This modest request , that the chief executive of a neutral power sho*uld not only sanction the building of iron-clads for a belligerent , and allow them to sail , but allow them to sail under the belligerent 's flag , was a little further than the Emperor would go . " He said , " continues Mr. Slidell , " that we might build the ships , but that it would be necess*ry that their destination should be concealed . " It is perhaps unnecessary to add that the work on the four corvettes of the Alabama class and the three iron-clad rams at Nantes and Bordeaux was pushed with energy . During the spring of 1863 the Emperor 's attention was engrossed by the Polish troubles , but in June the crisis seems to have passed . The news from the seat of war in the United States was encouraging for the South ; the crown of Mexico was to be formally offered to Maximilian , and Mr. Slidell learned that the French Cabinet was again discussing the feasibility of taking some positive step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ submitted to the Emperor , through Persigny , a memorandum again demanding the recognition of the Confederate States , and on June 18th was granted another audience . At this interview the Emperor said that he had read the memorandum presented to him by Persigny , and that he was more fully convinced than ever of the propriety of the general recognition of the Confederate States by European Powers , but that the commerce of France and the success of the Mexican Expedition would be jeoparded by a rupture with the United States ; that , in case of trouble with that country , no other Power than England possessed a sufficient navy to give him efficient aid in a war on the ocean , which , however , he did not anticipate , if England would join with him in recognition . He agreed to see Roebuck and Lindsay , who had requested an interview on the subject , as they were about to press a motion in Parliament for the recognition of the Confederacy , and promised to lay the matter before his Cabinet at once . Finally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think I can do something better : make a direct proposition to England for joint recognition . This will effectually prevent Lord Palmerston from misrepresenting my position and wishes on the American question . " On June 19th Mr. Slidell 's private agent in the Ministry of // Foreign Affairs wrote him as to the result of the meeting of the Council : The question which you were pleased to discuss with me to-day was , in effect , submitted to the Council yesterday . The proposition to be made in London was deemed , first of all , inopportune . It was determined , as a middle course , to contradict to the English Cabinet the rumors falsely attributing to us sentiments and a policy less favorable to the South ; to remind it that we had repeatedly made propositions to it , which it did not think proper to welcome ; to declare to it that our disposition had not changed-quite the contrary  --  and to declare to it that we should be delighted to be able to act in consequence ; and that , if it had itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to that which had inspired ours , we should receive it with as much eagerness as pleasure . On June 51st M. Mocquard , the private secretary of the Emperor , sent the following note to Mr. Slidell on the same subject Mv DEAR Mn . SLIDELL : You will doubtless be pleased to receive the following communication , which the Emperor charges me to make to you confidentially . M. Drouyn de Lhuys has written to Baron Gros , our Ambassador in London , to sound Lord John Russell on the question of the recognition of the South , and has authorized him to declare that the Cabinet of the Tuileries was ready to discuss the subject . On June 25th Slidell writes to his government about the interview of Roebuck and Lindsay with the Emperor as follows I have now to report that the interview of Messrs . Roebuck and Lindsay with the Emperor at Fontainebleau was highly satisfactory . They were authorized to state in the House of Commons that the Emperor was not only willing but anxious to recognize the Confederate States , with the coöperation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interview is a matter of history . On the last day of June , Mr. Roebuck pressed a motion in the House of Commons for the recognition of the Confederate States , and in his opening speech said that he was authorized by the French Emperor to state in the House of Commons that he was still anxious and willing to recognize the Confederacy , and that he had again made overtures to the English Government to that effect . He then spoke of the Emperor 's complaint of the uncourteons treatment he had received from the English Cabinet , and accused the Cabinet of misrepresenting the Emperor 's views , of concealing his offers , and of disclosing to Mr. Seward the nature of the Emperor 's dispatches . In answer to this speech , Mr. Layard , Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs , declared // that no official communication had been received from the French Government since the circular note of November 10 , 1862 , on the armistice ; and Earl Russell arose and said that Baron Gros , the French Minister , had just told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his government on American affairs . Mr. Layard further stated that the Emperor 's dispatch of November 10 , 1862 , which was the only dispatch the Emperor could have possibly meant , had been at once published in " The Moniteur " and all the newspapers , and that Mercier himself , the French Minister at Washington , had communicated its contents to Mr. Seward . The impression left on the public by this debate was , that Roebuck had misstated or that the Emperor had deliberately lied . The former hypothesis seemed most popular in this country , the latter in England . The dispatches of Mr. Slidell , however , render both of these solutions of the affair improbable , for various rcasons . Mr. Roebuck and Mr. Lindsay called on Mr. Slidell immediately after their interview with the Emperor , aud described it to him exactly as Roebuck did in the House of Commons . The Emperor told Roebuck and Lindsay only what he had often said to Slidell . A full discussion of the issue raised as to the disclosure to Mr. Seward by Lord Lyons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be tedious . Mr. Seward simply dcnicd that Lord Lyons had communicated to him the contents of the circular dispatch . " The Moniteur , " in its explanation of the affair , admitted that there were no official dispatches except those which were immediately printed , and that the Emperor , therefore , could not have made the accusation attributed to him . Both the English and French officials at the Foreign Offices also declared that there were no such official dispatches to which the Emperor could have referred in March , 1862 . But another explanation of this imbroglio is suggested by Mr. Slidefi 's dispatches . The Emperor may have referred to representations made through his minister at London in the summer of 1861 , which , as he admitted himself , were not labeled " official , " and which he mentioned as early as April , 1862 , in his interview with Mr. Lindsay . On this hypothesis the explanations of the French and English Cabinets were wide of the mark . In a note of M. Mocquard , the Emperor 's private secretary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the purpose of explaining the matter , he admits that his Imperial Majesty had said that " the Cabinet of London boasted at Washington of declining such of the Emperor 's proposals as were in favor of the South , " but denied that // he meant to accuse Lord Lyons of disclosing any official dispatches of the French Government . That Earl Russell , with his dislike for the secret intrigues and double dealing of the Emperor , in making open professions of amity and good will to the United States Government while secretly urging the English Ministry by every unofficial means in his power to join with him in recognizing the South , saw fit to open Mr. Seward 's eyes on this point , is quite possible , if not probable . But of this there can be , of course , no clear proof . Mr. Seward 's published dispatches only show that he had heard many rumors , from many sources , of the feelings and intentions of the Emperor , and that he had that natural distrust of him which every one seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Slidell 's dispatches explain more clearly Baron Gros 's denial of having received any recent official communications on the American question from his government . M. Mocquard , in his explanation of the affair to Slidell , wrote " On the next day after the interview of Messrs . Roebuck and Lindsay with the Emperor , the Minister of Foreign Affairs telegraphed Baron Gros to " officiously " inform Lord Palmerston that , should Great Britain be willing to recognize the South , the Emperor would be ready to follow her in that way. ** M. Dronyn de Lhuys also read to Slidell 's " friend " in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs a letter in which , after directing him to sound Lord Palmerston on American affairs , and to inform him that France was willing to follow the English Cabinet in recognizing the Confederacy , the Emperor added , " Je me demande si je ne devrais pas faire dire officiellement ? * Lord Palmerston que je suis d6cid* *t reconnaitre les *tats Conf*d6r6s . " It seems clear , therefore , that the Emperor did send some kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , requesting the former gentleman to sound Lords Palmerston and Russell on the American question , and to notify them that he was ready to join England in recognizing the Confederacy , provided she would make the official proposition on the subject . Either the French Ambassador did not receive it , or , after Mr. Roebuck 's motion met with such feeble support and such violent opposition , Baron Gros , either with or without instructions , may have deemed it proper to deny that he had received any official communication on the subject of recognition , as indeed he had a right to do if what he received was a purely confidential dispatch . // While the debate on Roebuck 's motion was pending , Lee , crippled and beaten at Gettysburg , retreated beyond the Potomac , Vicksburg surrendered , and the crises on the battle-field and in diplomacy were passed at the same time . During the autumn and winter of 1863 the French Government , however , seems to have done all in its power to assist the rebel agents ; and Mr. Slidell still entertained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precede the Archduke 's formal acceptance of the Mexican crown . James Williams , a confidential agent of the Confederacy , spent two weeks at Miramar in almost daily communication with Jaximilian , and wrote to Jefferson Davis that he was disposed to enter into an offensive and defensive alliance with the Confederacy . Mr. Slidell 's agent in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirmed this , and said that he had seen the memorandum made by Maximilian of the conditions under which he would agree to accept the crown , and that the recognition of the Confederacy headed the list . The corvettes and iron-clads also approached completion , and Mr. Slidell hoped that they would soon put to sea . But he was doomed to bitter disappointment in all his hopes . As early as November 6th he had become uneasy at reports that the destination of the corvettes could be proved by the United States officials , and addressed the following note to the Emperor : The confideat assertions of agents of the Washington Government , and certain remarks made at the Ministries of Foreign Affairs and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consulting your Majesty , orders may be given that will interfere with the completion and armament of ships of war now being constructed at Bordeaux and Nantes for the Government of the Confederate States . The undersigned has the most entire confidence that your Majesty , being made aware of the possibility of such an interference , will take the necessary steps to prevent it . The undersigned has no access to the Minister of Marine , and does not feel authorized to state to the Minister of Foreign Affairs the circumstances under which the construction of these ships was commenced . He relies upon this reason to excuse the liberty which he has ventured to take in addressing himself directly to your Majesty on a subject in which are involved not only vital interests of the Government which he represents , but very grave and delicate responsibilities for himself . Although he received some encouragement from various sources after the writing of the above , his worst suspicions soon proved to be well founded . In the following January a confidential clerk of the contractor who was building the corvettes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destination , which were soon in Mr. Dayton 's hands . The latter at once placed them before the proper authorities . The corvettes were detained , and M. Drouyn de Lhuys and the Minister of Marine both expressed to the American Minister their amazement at this discovery . How genuine their surprise really was can be judged from Mr. Slidell 's previous communications with the Emperor , and from Mr. Slidell 's own statements . " The contract for the corvettes , " he writes to Mr. Benjamin , " was concluded only after the official consent to their armament and sailing was given by the Minister of Marine ; and this was given on the representation that they were intended for commercial purposes , although their real character and destination were fully known to him-he , however , reluctantly signing the order in obedience to superior authority . " In the case of the iRappahannock , too , the English privateer detained in France , Mr. Slidell was again disappointed . Through his faithful friend Persigny he urged that she should be allowed to proceed to sea , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DEAR PzusIoNv : I have given orders that the Rappahannock may leave the ports of France . But the American Minister must know nothing of it . NAPOLEON . But , owing to bad management and various complications , even the Rappahannock was detained . Finally , the waning hopes of Mr. Slidell were utterly destroyed . Maximilian came to Paris , and , to Mr. Slidell 's surprise and chagrin , refused to grant him an interview . After this he wrote despairingly to his government that all hope was gone , and that " the whole policy of the Emperor was changed . " The repeated successes of the North , the unpopularity of the Mexican Expedition , the complications on the Continent , and the stubborn adherence of the English Cabinet to its " waiting policy , " were sufficient to induce a far less vacillating man than Louis Napoleon to conciliate the North , and to wait upon the course of events . Of the rest of Mr. Slidell 's mission nothing need be said . The fall of Richmond rudely destroyed Louis Napoleon 's vision of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left for him but to withdraw with as little humiliation as possible . The beginning of that expedition found him firmly fixed upon his throne , popular // among many classes , and supported by a successful and contented army ; the end of that expedition found him humiliated by his own vacillating policy and by Mr. Seward 's diplomacy , his army disgusted at their lack of success , discontent everywhere . A desperate effort soon became necessary to prop his tottering throne . The march to Mexico , in a measure , led to the march to Paris . Some months ago one of the last survivors of the great men who controlled the policy of England and of the United States during the rebellion , Earl Russell , passed away . In his " Recollections and Suggestions " he acknowledged but one grave error in his management of American affairs-his neglect to detain the Alabama . We believe that when an impartial history of the rebellion is written this will appear true . Whatever may be said about the hostility shown toward the United States by the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligent men should at least give credit to the Ministry which guided Great Britain in those troubled years , for its caution , honesty , and comparatively fair neutrality in the face of Louis Napoleon 's persistent intrigues . In the march of present events in Europe , if the circumstances should be reversed and England should be plunged into a great war , it is only to be hoped that the foreign affairs of the United States will be managed with as much ability , discretion , and fairness , as were then shown by the much-abused Palmerston-Russell Cabinet .
