Stoddard , Richard Henry , 1825-1903 : COSSACK SONG . from Cossack song 1876-1879 Editorial note : 1Kb 1 You must fly , ye winds of Tartary ! 2 If ye hope to catch our band ; 3 For they skim o'er the tall rank grasses , 4 And tramp on the wastes of sand , 5 Swifter than winds or waters , 6 With their long spears in their hand ! 7 Ride on ! ride on , brave Cossacks ! 8 For never a foe will stand ; 9 Ye shall break and scatter their craven ranks , 10 As your mad steeds scatter the sand : 11 The devil himself would run from you , 12 With your long spears in your hand !
