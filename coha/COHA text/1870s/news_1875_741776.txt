txt Not long ago we published a curious story of a settlement between a bank President and a so-called detective , who acted as agent for burglars who bad robbed a NowEngland bank . The settlement took place in Baltimore , where , surrounded by great mystery , the bank official recovered a large amount of bonds . He paid a considerable ransom for his property , sitting in a lonely room ; and . when the money was counted in installments , and the correct figures had been called out in a loud voice by the detective , a corresponding amount of bonds was thrown into the room from a dark entry . This was kept up until the transfer was completed , and the bank President went his way in peace . Not so melodramatic as this , but quite as skillfully managed in the interest of the robbers , was the late restitution of a portion of the plunder taken from the national and savings banks of Winthrop , Me . In both cases the robbers returned that portion of the spoil which was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good bargain before they ventured near the agent of the plundered institution . One night in July last , the office of the Winthrop National Bank and the Winthrop Savings Bank , near Augusta , Me. , was ' entered by burglars , who blew open the safes and made off with the ' contents . The plunder consisted of currency , United States bonds , and vurinus State , railroad , and municipal bonds . The total value of the property stolen was about one hundred thousand dollars , of which one-half was in currency and Government bonds , the rest being in other securities . The national bank lost $10,000 ; but the heaviest loss fell on the savings bank , which was obliged to suspend and put its affairs in the hands of a Receiver . Within two weeks after the robbery , a Philadelphia ' detective , by some curious chance , Lappened to visit the town of Winthrop , and , after carefully examining the traces left by the burglars , he declared that he knew who had " cracked ' the crib , " as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He returned to Philadelphia , and , after some correspondence with the bank officers , reported that he had been approached iu the interest of the burglars , who were willing to restore part of their spoils . Negotiations were opened , and . the Philadelphia detective acted as mediator between the agent of the bank and the thieves . The result of this was that au interview was appointed at a hotel in this City one day last week . At this meeting the detective alone conferred with the " agent " of the robbers , who agreed to return ? fifty thousand dollars ' worth of securities on payment of ten thousand dollars in greenbacks . The stolen Government bonds and currency were not to be restored . Next , the agent of the bank , who bad agreed to this proposition , went to a third-story back room in a building tied for drinking Purposes , in this City , prepared to pay the ransom for the stolen property . Another " agent " than he who had conducted the ' previous negotiations , appeared with a thick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred dollar notes was counted out and delivered to the " agent " of the burglars , who at once delivered over the package and withdrew . The bundle was opened and found to contain all the securities which it had been agreed to return , a schedule having been drawn up beforehand . The representative of the thieves was wrapped in a heavy coat , his face was concealed by a slouched , hat and a handkerchief , and be was otherwise disguised beyond all possibility of recognition . The representative of the bank went safely home with the recovered . securities . No , mention is made of the amount paid the detective for his services in the negotiation . Here are all the elements of a highly successful robbery and conspiracy . Including the money paid as ransom , the Winthrop Bank lost one hundred and ten thousand dollars , of which it recovered fifty thousand dollars . The burglars therefore cleared sixty thousand dollars . They have escaped punishment , although they ventured into the hands of a detective , and actually re- ceived from him the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not safely dispose of otherwise . The bank has actually lost ilixty thousand dollars , or rather , its depositors have , and that its loss is no greater is due to a compromise which their agent made with the robbers . If an amateur detective were to assist ? in a conspiracy , after a robbery planned with a view to such a subsequent scheme , he would be able , probably , to effect some such compromise as that just made in this iity between the Winthrop Bank burglars and the bank officers . Men will usually make great sacrifices to get back that which has been stolen from them . The bank agent in this case was willing to give up more than onehalf ; he took what he could get . Nevertheless , this system of compromise is dangerous ; it is growing in favor ; it offers au inducement for thieves to secure immunity for their crimes by partial restitution . It gives a thief an opportunity to sell to its lawful owners that part of his plunder which he can not safely sell elsewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall eventually have no use for " severe Judges " like Recorder Hackett .
