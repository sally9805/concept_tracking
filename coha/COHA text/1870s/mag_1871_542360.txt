txt OUR WHISPERING GALLERY . V VI THEN we last talked over I-lawVVthornetogether , I resolved that the next time we met I would finish what I had to say to you about my favorite author . Whenever I look at his portrait ,  --  and that is pretty often , I assure you , - some new trait or anecdote or reminiscence comes up and asks to he made known to those who feel an interest in it . But time and eternity call loudly on mortal gossip to be brief . So this April morning shall be our last session over that child of genius , who first saw the light on the 4th of July , 18o4 . One of his favorite books was Lockhart 's Life of Sir Walter Scott , and in 1862 I dedicated to him the Household Edition of that work . When he received the first volume , he wrote to me 1871. 639 // a letter of which I am so proud that I keep it among my best treasures . Upon honor , Jack , I blush while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think better of your uncle after you hear it . " I am exceedingly gratified by the dedication . I do not deserve so high an honor ; but if you think me worthy , it is enough to make the compliment in the highest degree acceptable , no matter who may dispute my title to it . I care more for your good opinion than for that of a host of critics , and have an excellent reason for so doing ; inasmuch as my literary success , whatever it has been or may be , is the result of my connection with you . Somehow or other you smote the rock of public sympathy on my behalf , and a stream gushed forth in sufficient quantity to quench my thirst , though not to drown me . I think no author can ever have had publisher that he valued so much as I do mine . " He began in 1862 to send me some articles from his English Journal for the magazine , which he afterwards collected into a volume and called " Our Old Home . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he says - " I hope you will like it , for the subject seemed interesting to me when I was on the spot , but I always feel a singular de sponclency and heaviness of heart in reopening those old journals now . However , if I can make readable sketches out of them , it is no matter . " In the same letter he tells me he has been re-reading Scott 's Life , and he suggests some additions to the concluding volume . He says : - " If the last volume is not already printed and stereotyped , I think you ought to insert in it an explanation of all that is left mysterious in the former volumes , - the name and family of the lady he was in love with , etc . It is desirable , too , to know what have been the fortunes and final catastrophes of his family and intimate friends since his death , down to as recent a period as the death of Lockhart . All such matter would make your edition more valuable ; and I see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to living connections of the family that may prevent the English publishers from inserting these particulars . We stand in the light of posterity to them , and have the privileges of posterity I should be glad to know something of the personal character and life of his eldest son , and whether ( as I have heard ) he was ashamed of his father for being a literary man . In short , fifty pages devoted to such elucidation would make the edition unique . Do come and see us before the leaves fall . " While he was engaged in copying out and rewriting his papers on England for the magazine , he was very despondent about their reception by the public . Speaking of them one day to me , he said : " We must remember that there is a good deal of intellectual ice mingled with this wine of memory . " He was sometimes so dispirited during the war , that he was obliged to postpone his contributions for sheer lack of spirit to go on . Near the close of the year 1862 he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell me about the kind appreciation of my articles , for I feel rather gloomy about them myself . I am really much encouraged by what you say ; not but that I am sensible that you mollify me with a good deal of soft soap , but it is skilfully applied and effects all you intend it should I can not come to Boston to spend more than a day , just at present . It would suit me better to come for a visit when the spring of next year is a little advanced , and if you renew your hospitable proposition then , I shall probably be glad to accept it ; though I have now been a hermit so long , that the thought affects me somewhat as it would to invite a lobster or a crab to step out of his shell . " He continued , during the early months of 1863 , to send now and then an article for the magazine from his English Note-Books . On the 22d of February he writes : - " Here is another article . I wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are many things which I shall find no opportunity to say unless I say them now ; so the article grows under my hand , and one part of it seems just about as well worth printing as another . Heaven sees fit to visit me with an unshakable conviction that all this series of articles is good for nothing ; but that is none of my business , provided the public and you are of a different opinion . If you think any part of it can be left out with advantage , you are quite at liberty to do so . Probably I have not put Leigh Hunt quite high enough for your sentiments respecting him ; but no more genuine characterization and criticism ( so far as the writer 's purpose to be true goes ) was ever done . It is very slight . I might have made more of it , but should not have improved it . " I mean to write two more of these articles , and then hold my hand . I intend to come to Boston before the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be nearly or quite six months since I was there ! I wonder how many people there are in the world who would keep their nerves in tolerably good order through such a length of nearly solitary imprisonment ? " I advised him to begin to put the series in order for a volume , and to preface the book with his " Consular Experiences . " On the x8th of April he writes - " I do n't think the public will bear any more of this sort of thing . . . . . I had a letter from - , the other day , in which he sends me the enclosed verses , and I think he would like to have them published in the Atlantic . Do it if you like ; I pretend to no judgment in poetry . He also sent this epithalamium by Mrs. - , and I doubt not the good lady will be pleased to see it copied into one of our American newspapers with a few laudatory remarks . Ca n't you do it in the Transcript , and send @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little praise jollifies us poor authors to the marrow of our bones . Consider , if you had not been a publisher , you would certainly have been one of our wretched tribe , and therefore ought to have a fellow-feeling for us . ( Let Michael Angelo write the remarks , if you have not the time . " ) " Michael Angelo " was a little Irish boy who had the care of my room , at the old corner shop , where your uncle lived so many years behind a green curtain . Hawthorne conceived a fancy for the little lad , and liked to hear stories of his smart replies to persistent authors who called during my absence with unpromising-looking manuscripts . On the 30th of April he writes - " I send the article with which the volume is to commence , and you can begin printing it whenever you like . I can think of no better title than this , Our Old Home ; a Series of English Sketches , by , ' etc . I submit to your judgment whether it would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volume without depriving them of any freshness they may have by previous publication in the magazine ? " The article has some of the features that attract the curiosity of the foolish public , being made up of personal narrative and gossip , with a few pungencies. of personal satire , which will not be the less effective because the reader can scarcely find out who was the individual meant . I am not without hope of drawing down upon myself a good deal of critical severity on this score , and would gladly incur more of it if I could do so without seriously deserving censure . " The story of the Doctor of Divinity , I think , will prove a good card in this way . It is every bit true ( like the other anecdotes ) , only not told so darkly as it might have been for the reverend gentleman . I do not believe there is any danger of his identity being ascertained , and do not care whether it is or no , as it could only be done by the impertinent researches of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have some novelty in the collected volume , and , if possible , something that may excite a little discussion and remark . But decide for yourself and me ; and if // you conclude not to publish it in the magazine , I think I can concoct another article in season for the August number , if you wish . After the publication of the volume , it seems to me the public had better have no more of them . " J has been telling us a mythical story of your intending to walk with him from Cambridge to Concord . We should be delighted to see you , though more for our own sakes than yours , for our aspect here is still a little winterish . When you come , let it be on Saturday , and stay till Monday . I am hungry to talk with you. ** I was enchanted , of course , with the " Consular Experiences , " and I find from his letters of that time that he was made specially happy by the encomiums I could not help writing upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was nearly all in type , he began to think about a dedication to the book . On the 3d of May he writes : - " I am of three minds about dedicating the volume . First , it seems due to Frank Pierce ( as he put me into the position where I made all those profound observations of English scenery , life , and character ) to inscribe it to him with a few pages of friendly and explanatory talk , which also would be very gratifying to my own life-long affecticn for him . " Secondly , I want to say something to Bennoch , to show him that I am thoroughly mindful of all his hospitality and kindness ; and I suppose he might be pleased to see his name at the head of a book of mine . " Thirdly , I am not convinced that it is worth while to inscribe it to anybody . We will see hereafter . " The book moved on slowly through the press , and he seemed more than commonly nervous about the proofsheets . On the 28th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - " In a proof-sheet of ' Our Old Home ' which I sent you to-day ( page 43 , or 4 , *r 5 or thereabout ) I corrected a line thus , possessing a happy faculty of seeing my own interest . ' Now as the public interest was my sole and individual object while I held office , I think that , as a matter of scanty justice to myself , the line ought to stand thus , possessing a happy faculty of seeing my own interest and the public 's . ' Even then , you see , I only give myself credit for half the disinterestedness I really felt . Pray , by all means , have it altered as above , even if the page is stereotyped ; which it ca n't have been , as the proof is now in our Concord post-office , and you will have it at the same time with this . " We are getting into full leaf here , and your walk with J- might come off any time . " An arrangement was made with the liberal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring out " Our Old Home " on the day of its publication in Boston . On the 1st of July Hawthorne wrote to me from The Wayside as follows : - " I am delighted with Smith and Elder , or rather with you ; for it is you that squeeze the English sovereigns out of the poor devils . On my own behalf I never could have thought of asking more than ? 50 , and should hardly have expected to get / io ; I look upon the ? i8o as the only trustworthy funds I have , our own money being of such a gaseous consistency . By the time I can draw for it , I expect it will be worth at least fifteen hundred dollars . " I shall think over the prefatory matter for Our Old Home ' to-day , and will write it to-morrow . It requires some little thought and policy in order to say nothing amiss at this time ; for I intend to dedicate the book to Frank Pierce , come what may . It shall reach you on Friday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desirable guest to have in the house . My wife likes her hugely , and for my part , I had no idea that there was such a sensible woman of letters in the world . She is just as healthyminded as if she had never touched a pen . I am glad she had a pleasant time , and hope she will come back . // " I mean to come to Boston whenever I can be sure of a cool day . " What a prodigious length of time you stayed among the mountains ! " You ought not to assume such liberties of absence without the consent of your friends , which I hardly think you would get . I , at least , want you always within attainable distance , even though I never see you . Why ca n't you come and stay a day or two with us , and drink some spruce-beer ? " Those were troublous days , full of war gloom and general despondency . The North was naturally suspicious of all public men who did not bear a conspicuous part in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been President of the United States , and was not identified , to say the least , with the great party which favored the vigorous prosecution of the war . Hawthorne proposed to dedicate his new book to a very dear friend , indeed , but in doing so he would draw public attention in a marked way to an unpopular name . Several of Hawthorne 's friends , on learning that he intended to inscribe his book to Franklin Pierce , came to me and begged that I would , if possible , help Hawthorne to see that he ought not to do anything to endanger the success of his new volume . Accordingly I wrote to him just what many of his friends had said to me , and this is his reply to my letter , which bears date the x8th of July , 1863 - " I thank you for your note of the i*th instant , and have delayed my reply thus long in order to ponder deeply on your advice , smoke cigars over it , and see what it might be possible for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be a piece of poltroonery in me to withdraw either the dedication or the dedicatory letter . My long and intimate personal relatIons with Pierce render the dedication altogether proper , especially as regards this book , which would have had no existence without his kindness ; and if he is so exceedingly unpopular that his name is enough to sink the volume , there is so much the more need that an old friend should stand by him . I can not , merely on account of pecuniary profit or literary reputation , go back from what I have deliberately felt and thought it right to do ; and if I were to tear out the dedication , I should never look at the volume again without remorse and shame . As for the literary public , it must accept my book precisely as I think fit to give it , or let it alone . " Nevertheless , I have no fancy for making myself a martyr when it is honorably and conscientiously possible to avoid it ; and I always measure out my heroism very accurately according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last man in the world to throw away a bit of it needlessly . So I have looked over the concluding paragraph and have amended it in such a way that , while doing what I know to be justice to my friend , it contains not a word that ought to be objectionable to any set of readers . If the public of the North see fit to ostracize me for this , I can only say , that I would gladly sacrifice a thousand or two of dollars rather than retain the good-will of such a herd of dolts and mean-spirited scoundrels . I enclose the rewritten paragraph , and shall wish to see a proof of that and the whole dedication . " I had a call from an Englishman yesterday , and kept him to dinner ; not the threatened , but a Mr. - , introduced by . He says he knows you , and he seems to be a very good fellow . I have strong hopes that he will never come back here again , for J took him on a walk of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ducking , and the poor Englishman was frightened half to death by the thunder On the other page is the list of presentation people , and it amounts to twenty-four , which your liberality and kindness allow me . As likely as not I have forgotten two or three , and I held my pen suspended over one or two of the names , doubting whether they deserved // 644 of me so especial a favor as a portion of my heart and brain . I have few friends . Some authors , I should think , would require half the edition for private distribution . " " Our Old Home " was published in the autumn of 1863 , and although it was everywhere welcomed , in England the strictures were applied with a liberal hand . On the i8th of October he writes to me - " You sent me the Reader ' with a notice of the book , and I have received one or two others , one of them from Bennoch . The English critics seem to think me very bitter against their countrymen , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because their selfconceit can accept nothing short of indiscriminate adulation ; but I really think that Americans have more cause than they to complain of me . Looking over the volume , I am rather surprised to find that whenever I draw a comparison between the two people , I almost invariably cast the balance against ourselves . It is not a good nor a weighty book , nor does it deserve any great amount either of praise or censure . I do n't care about seeing any more notices of it . " Meantime the " Dolliver Romance , " which had been laid aside on account of the exciting scenes through which we were then passing , and which unfitted him for the composition of a work of the imagination , made little progress . In a note written to me at this time he says : - " I ca n't tell you when to expect an instalment of the Romance , if ever . There is something preternatural in my reluctance to begin . I linger at the threshold , and have a perception of very disagreeable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God had given me the faculty of writing a sunshiny book . " I invited him to come to Boston and have a cheerful week among his old friends , and I threw in as an inducement a hint that he should hear the great organ in the Music Hall . I also suc*ested that we could talk over the new Romance together , if he would gladden us all by coming to the city . Instead of coming , he sent this reply : - " I thank you for your kind invitation to hear the grand instrument ; but it offers me no inducement additional to what I should always have for a visit to your abode . I have no ear for an organ or a Jews-harp , nor for any instrument between the two : so you had better invite a worthier guest , and I will come another time . " I do n't see much probability of my having the first chapter of the Romance ready so soon as you want it . There are two or three chapters ready to be written , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I feel as if I should never carry it through . " Besides , I want to prefix a little sketch of Thoreau to it , because , from a tradition which he told me about this house of mine , I got the idea of a deathless man , which is now taking a shape very different from the original one . It seems the duty of a live literary man to perpetuate the memory of a dead one , when there is such fair opportunity as in this case ; but how Thoreau would scorn me for thinking that I could perpetuate him And I do n't think so . " I can think of no title for the unborn Romance . Always heretofore I have waited till it was quite complete before attempting to name it , and I fear I shall have to do so now . I wish you or Mrs. F- would suggest one . Perhaps you may snatch a title out of the infinite void that will miraculously suit the book , and give me a needful impetus to write it . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manage to live economically . I seem to spend little or nothing , and yet it will get very far beyond the second thousand , for the present year If it were not for these troublesome necessities , I doubt whether you would ever see so much as the first chapter of the new Romance . " Those verses entitled Weariness , ' // in the last magazine , seem to me profoundly touching . I too am weary , and begin to look ahead for the Wayside Inn . " I had frequent accounts of his ill health and changed appearance , but I supposed he would rally again soon , and become hale and strong before the winter fairly set in . But the shadows even then were about his pathway , and Cunningham 's lines , which he once quoted to me , must often have occurred to hit-n , - " Cold s the snow at my head , And cold s the snow at my feet ; And the finger of death a at my eyes , Closing them to sleep . " We had arranged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ published in the magazine , in monthly instalments and we decided to begin in the January number of 1864 . On the 8th of November came a long letter from him , and I will read to you an extract from it - I foresee that there is little probability ot my getting the first chapter ready by the 15th , although I have a resolute purpose to write it by the end of the month . It will be in time for the February number , if it turns out fit for publication at all . As to the title , we must defer settling that till the book is fully written , and meanwhile I see nothing better than to call the series of articles Fragments of a Romance . ' This will leave me to exercise greater freedom as to the t-nechanism of the story than I otherwise can , and without which I shall probably get entangled in i-ny own plot . When the work is completed in the magazine , I can fill up the gaps and make straight the crookednesses , and christen it with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serial work , I desire not to pledge myself , or promise the public more than I may confidently expect to achieve . As regards the sketch of Thoreau , I am not ready to write it yet , but will mix him up with the life of The Wayside , and produce an autobiographical preface for the finished Romance . If the public like that sort of stuff ; I too find it pleasant and easy writing , and can supply a new chapter of it for every new volume , and that , moreover , without infringing upon my proper privacy . An old Quaker wrote me , the other day , that he had been reading i-ny Introduction to the Mosses ' and the Scarlet Letter , ' and felt as if he knew i-ne better than his best friend ; but I think he considerably overestimates the extent of his intimacy with me . " I received several private letters and printed notices of ' Our Old Hot-ne ' from England . It is laughable to see the innocent wonder with which they regard my criticisms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hatred , on my part , and never admitting the least suspicion that there may be a particle of truth in them . The monstrosity of their self-conceit is such that anything short of unlimited admiration impresses them as malicious caricature . But they do me great injustice in supposing that I hate them . I would as soon hate my own people . " Tell Ticknor that I want a hundred dollars more , and I suppose I shall keep on wanting more and more till the end of i-ny days . If I subside into the almshouse before my intellectual faculties are quite extinguished , it strikes me that I would make a very pretty book out of it ; and , seriously , if I alone were concerned , I should not have any great objection to winding up there . " On the 14th of November came a pleasant little note from him , which seemed to have been written in better spirits than he had shown of late . Photographs of himself always amused him greatly , and in the little note I refer to there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' photograph , - a grandfatherly old figure enough ; andlsuppose that is the reason why you select it . " I am much in want of car/es de visile to distribute on my own account , and am tired and disgusted with all the undesirable likenesses as yet pre // 646 sented of me . Do n't you think I might sell my head to some photographer who would be willing to return me the value in small change that is to say , in a dozen or two of cards ? " The first part of Chapter I. of " The Dolliver Romance " came to me from The Wayside on the 1st of December . Hawthorne was very anxious to see it in type as soon as possible , in order that he might compose the rest in a similar strain , and so conclude the preliminary phase of Dr. Dolliver . He was constantly imploring me to send him a good pen , complaining all the while that everything had failed him in that line . In one of his notes begging me to hunt him up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Nobody ever suffered more from pens than I have , and I am glad that my labor with the abominable little tool is drawing to a close . " In the month of December Hawthorne attended the funeral of Mrs. Franklin Pierce , and , after the ceremony , came to stay with us . He seemed ill and more nervous than usual . He said he found General Pierce greatly needing his companionship , for he was overwhelmed with grief at the loss of his wife . I well remember the sadness of Hawthorne 's face when he told us he felt obliged to look on the dead . " It was , " said he , " like a carven image laid in its richly embossed enclosure , and there was a remote expression about it as if the whole had nothing to do with things present . " He told us , as an instance of the ever - constant courtesy of his friend General Pierce , that while they were standing at the grave , the General , though completely overcome with his own sorrow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to shield him from the bitter cold . The same day , as the sunset deepened and we sat together in this room , Hawthorne began to talk in an autobiographical vein , and gave us the story of his early life , of which I have already told you somewhat . He said that at an early age he accompanied his mother and sister to a township in Maine , which his grandfather had purchased . That , he continued , was the happiest period of his life , and it lasted till he was thirteen , when he was sent to school in Salem . " I lived in Maine , " he said , " like a bird of the air , so perfect was the freedom I enjoyed . But it was there I first got my cursed habits of solitude . " During the moonlight nights of winter he would skate until midnight all alone upon Sebago Lake , with the deep shadows of the icy hills on either hand . When he found himself far away from his home and weary with the exertion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where half a tree would be burning on the broad hearth . He would sit in the ample chimney and look at the stars through the great aperture while the flame went roaring up . " Ah , " he said , " how well I recall the summer days also , when , with my gun , I roamed at will through the woods of Maine . How sad middle life looks to people of erratic temperaments . Everything is beautiful in youth , for all things are allowed to it then . " The early home of the Hawthornes in Maine must have been a lonely dwelling - place indeed . A year ago ( May 12 , 1870 ) the old place was visited by one who had a true feeling for Hawthorne 's genius , and who thus graphically describes the spot . " A little way off the main-travelled road in the town of Raymond there stood an old house which has much in common with houses of its day , but which is distinguished from them by the more evident marks of neglect and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Cornice and windowledge and threshold are fast falling with the weight of years . The fences were long since removed from all the enclosures , the garden-wall is broken down , and the garden itself is now grown up to pines whose shadows fall dark and heavy upon the old and mossy roof ; fitting roof-trees for such a // mansion , planted there by the hands of Nature herself , as if she could not realize that her darling child was ever to go out from his early home . The highway once passed its door , but the location of the road has been changed ; and now the old house stands solitarily apart from the busy world . Long*r than I can remember , - and I have never learned how long , - this house has stood untenanted and wholly unused , except , for a few years , as a place of public worship ; but , for myself ; and for all who know its earlier history , it will ever have the deepest interest , for it was the early home of Natha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when passing through that town , turned aside to study the features of that landscape , and to re* flect upon the influence which his surroundings had upon the development of this author 's genius . A few rods to the north runs a little mill-stream , its sloping bank once covered with grass , now so worn and washed by the rains as to show but little except yellow sand Less than half a mile to the west this stream empties into an arm of Sebago Lake . Doubtless , at the time the house was built , the forest was so much cut away in that direction as to bring into view the waters of the lake , for a mill was built upon the brook about half-way down the valley , and it is reasonable to suppose that a clearing was made from the mill to the landing upon the shore of the pond ; but the pines have so far regained their old dominion as completely to shut out the whole prospect in that direction . Indeed , the site affords but a limited survey , except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direction lie open fields and dark pine - covered slopes . Beyond these rise long ranges of forest-crowned hills , while in the far distance every hue of rock and tree , of field and grove , melts into the soft blue of Mount Washington . The spot must ever have had the utter loneliness of the pine forests upon the borders of our northern lakes . The deep silence and dark shadows of the old woods must have filled the imagination of a youth possessing Hawthorne 's sensibility with images which later years could not dispel . " To this place came the widowed mother of Hawthorne in company with her brother , an original proprietor and one of the early settlers of the town of Raymond . This house was built for her , and here she lived with her son for several years in the most complete seclusion . Perhaps she strove to conceal here a grief which she could not forget . In what way , and to what extent , the surroundings of his boyhood operated in moulding the character and developing the genius of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have tried simply to draw a faithful picture of his early home . " On the 15th of December Hawthorne wrote to me - " I have not yet had courage to read the Dolliver proof-sheet , but will set about it soon , though with terrible reluctance , such as I never felt before I am most grateful to you for protecting me from that visitation of the elephant and his cub . If you happen to see Mr. - of L- , a young man who was here last summer , pray tell him anything that your conscience will let you , to induce him to spare me another visit , which I know he intended . I really am not well and can not be disturbed by strangers without more suffering than it is worth while to endure . I thank Mrs. Fand yourself for your kind hospitality , past and prospective . I never come to see you without feeling the better for it , but I must not test so precious a remedy too often . " The new year found him incapacitated from writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1864 , he says - " I am not quite up to writing yet , but shall make an effort as soon as I see any hope of success . You ought to be thankful that ( like most other brokendown authors ) I do not pester you with decrepit pages , and insist upon your accepting them as full of the old // spirit and vigor . That trouble , perhaps , still awaits you , after I shall have reached a further stage of decay . Seriously , my mind has , for the present , lost its temper and its fine edge , and I have an instinct that I had better keep quiet . Perhaps I shall have a new spirit of vigor , if I wait quietly for it ; perhaps not . " The end of February found him in a mood which I can best indicate to you by reading this letter , which he addressed to me on the 25th of the month - " I hardly know what to say to the public about this abortive Romance , though I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never finish it . Yet it is not quite pleasant for an author to announce himself , or to be announced , as finally broken down as to his literary faculty . It is a pity that I let you put this work in your programme for the year , for I had always a presentiment that it would fail us at the pinch . Say to the public what you think best , and as little as possible ; for example We regret that Mr. Hawthorne 's Romance , announced for this magazine some months ago , still lies upon the author 's writing-table , he having been interrupted in his labor upon it by an impaIred state of health ' ; or , We are sorry to hear ( but know not whether the public will share our grief ) that Mr. Hawthorne is out of health and is thereby prevented , for the present , from proceeding with another of his promised ( or threatened ) Romances , intended for this magazine ' ; or , Mr. Hawthorne 's brain is addled at last , and , much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not possibly go on with the Romance announced on the cover of the January magazine . We consider him finally shelved , and shall take early occasion to bury him under a heavy article , carefully summing up his merits ( such as they were ) and his demerits , what few of them can be touched upon in our limited space ' ; or , We shall commence the publication of Mr. Hawthorne 's Romance as soon as that gentleman chooses to forward it . We are quite at a loss how to account for this delay in the fulfilment of his contract ; especially as he has already been most liberally paid for the first number . ' Say anything you like , in short , though I really do n't believe that the public will care what you say or whether you say anything . If you choose , you may publish the first chapter as an insulated fragment , and charge me with the overpayment . I can not finish it unless a great change comes over me ; and if I make too great an effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not that I should care much for that , if I could fight the battle through and win it , thus ending a life of much smoulder and scanty fire in a blaze of glory . But I should smother myself in mud of my own making . I mean to come to Boston soon , not for a week , but for a single day , and then I can talk about my sanitary prospects more freely than I choose to write . I am not low-spirited , nor fanciful , nor freakish , but look what seem to be realities in the face , and am ready to take whatever may come . If I could but go to England now , I think that the sea voyage and the Old Home might set me all right . " This letter is for your own eye , and I wish especially that no echo of it may come back in your notes to me . " P. 5 . Give my kindest regards to Mrs. F , and tell her that one of my choicest ideal places is her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On Monday , the 28th of March , Hawthorne came to town and made this house his first station-on his journey to the South for health . I was greatly shocked at his invalid appearance , and he seemed quite deaf . The light in his eye was beautiful as ever , but his limbs seemed shrunken and his usual stalwart vigor utterly gone . He said to me with a pathetic voice , " Why does Nature treat us like little children I think we could bear it all if we knew our fate at least it would not make much difference to me now what became of me . " Toward night he brightened up a little , and his delicious wit flashed out , at intervals , as of old , but 648 May , // he was evidently broken and dispirited about his health . Looking out on the bay that was sparkling in the moonlight , he said he thought the moon rather lost something of its charm for him as he grew older . He spoke with great delight of a little story , called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it carefully through twice , every word of it . He had much to say about England , and observed , among other things , that " the extent over which her dominions are spread leads her to fancy herself stronger than she really is ; but she is not to-day a powerful empire ; she is much like a squash-vine which runs over a whole garden , but if you cut it at the root it is at once destroyed . " At breakfast , next morning , he spoke of his kind neighbors in Concord , and said Alcott was one of the most excellent men he had ever known . " It is impossible to quarrel with him , for he would take all your harsh words like a saint . " He left us shortly after this for a journey to Washington , with his friend Mr. Ticknor . The travellers spent several days in New York , and then proceeded to Philadelphia . Hawthorne wrote to me from the Continental Hotel , dating his letter " Saturday evenincr " announcing the severe illness of his companion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but on Sunday morning the news came that Mr. Ticknor was dead . Hawthorne returned at once to Boston , and stayed here overnight . He was in a very excited and nervous state , and talked incessantly of the sad scenes he had just been passing through . We sat late together , conversing of the friend we had lost , and I am sure he hardly closed his eves that night . In the morning he went back to his own home in Concord . His health , from that time , seemed to give way rapidly , and his friend , General Pierce , proposed that , as early as possible , they should go among the New Hampshire hills together and meet the sprin , , there . The first letter we received from Mrs. Hawthorne , after her husband 's 649 return to Concord in April , gave us great anxiety . It was dated " Monday eve , " and I will read some extracts from it to you - " I have just sent Mr. Hawthorne to bed , and so have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late , and I have not liked to disturb him by sitting up after him , and so I could not write since he returned , though I wished very much to tell you about him , ever since he came home . He came back unlooked for that day ; and when I heard a step on the piazza , I was lying on a couch and feelin5 , quite indisposed . But as soon as I saw him I was frightened out of all knowledge of myself , - so haggard , so white , so deeply scored with pain and fatigue was the face , so much more ill he looked than I ever saw him before . He had walked from the station because he saw no carriage there , and his brow was streaming with a perfect rain , so great had been the effort to walk so far . . . He needed much to get home to me , where he could fling off all care of himself and give way to his feelings , pent up and kept back for so long , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind Mr. Ticknor . It relieved him somewhat to break down as he spoke of that scene But he was so weak and weary he could not sit up much , and lay on the couch nearly all the time in a kind of uneasy somnolency , not wishing to be read to , even , - notable to attend or fix his thoughts at all . On Saturday he unfortunately took cold , and , after a most restless night , was seized early in the morning with a very had stiff neck , which was acutely painful all Sunday . Sunday night , however , a compress of linen wrung in cold water cured him , with belladonna . But he slept also most of this morning He could as easily build London as go to the Shakespeare dinner . It tires him so much to get entirely through his toilet in the morning , that he has to lie do -n a long time after it . To-day he walked out on the grounds , and could not stay ten minutes , because I would not let him Our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind , and he could not bear any longer exercise . He has more than lost all he gained by the journey , by the sad event . From being the nursed and cared for , - early to bed and late to rise , - led , as it were , by the ever-ready hand of kind Mr. Ticknor , to become the nurse and night-watcher with all the responsibilities , with his mighty power of sympathy and his vast apprehension of suffering in others , and to see death for the first time in a state so weak as his , - the death also of so valued a friend , - as Mr. Hawthorne says himself , it told upon him ' fearfully . There are lines ploughed on his brow which never were there before I have been up and alert *ever since his return , but one day I was obliged , when he was busy , to run off and lie down for fear I should drop before his eyes . My head was in such an agony I could not endure it another moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and won , and now I think I shall not fail again . Your most generous kindness of hospitality I heartily thank you for , but Mr. Hawthorne says he can not leave home . He wants rest , and he says when the wind is warm he shall feel well . This cold wind ruins him . I wish he were in Cuba or on some isle in the Gulf Stream . But I must say I could not think him able to go anywhere , unless I could go with him . He is too weak to take care of himself . I do not like to have him go up and down stairs alone . I have read to him all the afternoon and evening and after he waked in the morning to-day . I do nothing but sit with him , ready to do or not do , just as he wishes . The wheels of my small mdnage are all stopped . He is my world and all the business of it . He has not smiled since he came home till to-day , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ; but a smile looks strange on a face that once shone like a thousand suns with smiles . The light for the time has gone out of his eyes , entirely . An infinite weann*is films them quite . I thank Heav en that summer and not winter approaches . " On Friday evening of the same week Mrs. Hawthorne sent off another despatch to us : - " Mr. Hawthorne has been miserably ill for two or three days , so that I could not find a moment to speak to you . I am most anxious to have him leave Concord again , and General Pierce 's plan is admirable , now that the General is well himself . I think the serene jogtrot in a private carriage into country places , by trout-streams and to old farm-houses , away from care and news , will be very restorative . The boy associations with the General will refresh him . They will fish , and muse , and rest , and saunter upon horses ' feet , and be in the air all the time in fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could go for a few g5etits soins . But General Pierce has been a most tender , constant nurse for many years , and knows how to take care of the sick . And his love for Mr. Hawthorne is the strongest passion of his soul , now his wife is departed . They will go to the Isles of Shoals together probably , before their return . " Mr. Hawthorne can not walk ten minutes now without wishing to sit down , as I think I told you , so that he can not take sufficient air except in a carriage . And his horror of hotels and rail-cars is immense , and human beings beset him in cities . He is indeed very weak . I hardly know what takes away his strength . I now am obli*ed to superintend my workman , who is arranging the grounds . Whenever my husband lies down ( which is sadly often ) I rush out of doors to see what the gardener is about . " I can not feel rested till Mr. Hawthorne is better , but I get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safe in the care of General Pierce . " On Saturday this communication from Mrs. Hawthorne reached us : - " General Pierce wrote yesterday to say he wished to meet Mr. Hawthorne in Boston on Wednesday , and go from thence on their way . 6*o May , // " Mr. Hawthorne is much weaker , I find , than he has been before at any time , and I shall go down with him , having a great many things to do in Boston ; but I am sure he is not fit to be left by himself , for his steps are so uncertain , and his eyes are very uncertain too . Dear Mr. Fields , I am very anxious about him , and I write now to say that he absolutely refuses to see a physician officially , and so I wish to know whether Dr. Holmes could not see him in some ingenious way on Wednesday as a friend ; but with his experienced , acute observation , to look at him also as a physician , to note how he is and what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It almost deprives me of my wits to see him growing weaker with no aid . He seems quite bilious , and has a restlessness that is infinite . His look is more distressed and harassed than before ; and he has so little rest , that he is getting worn out . I hope immensely in regard of this sauntering journey with General Pierce . " I feel as if I ought not to speak to you of anything when you are so busy and weary and bereaved . But yet in such a sad emergency as this , I am sure your generous , kind heart will not refuse me any help you can render . . . . . I wish Dr. Holmes would feel his pulse ; I do not know how to judge of it , but it seems to me irregular . " His friend , Dr. 0 . W. Holmes , in compliance with Mrs. Hawthorne 's desire , expressed in this letter to me , saw the invalid and thus describes his appearance in an article full of tenderness and feeling which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - " Late in the afternoon of the day before he left Boston on his last journey I called upon him at the hotel where he was staying . He had gone out but a moment before . Looking along the street , I saw a form at some distance in advance which could only be his , - but how changed from his former port and figure . There was no mistaking the long iron-gray locks , the carriage of the head , and the general look of the natural outlines and movement ; but he seemed to have shrunken in all his dimensions , and faltered along with an uncertain , feeble step , as if every movement were an effort . I joined him , and we walked together half an hour , during which time I learned so much of his state of mind and body as could be got at without worrying him with suggestive questions , - my object being to form an opinion of his condition , as I had been requested to do , and to give him some hints that might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , medically considered , was very unfavorable . There were persistent local symptoms , referred especially to the stomach , - " boring pain , " distension , difficult digestion , with great wasting of flesh and strength . He was very gentle , very willing to answer questions , very docile to such counsel as I offered him , but evidently had no hope of recovering his health . He spoke as if his work were done , and he should write no more . " With all his obvious depression , there was no failing noticeable in his conversational powers . There was the same backwardness and hesitancy which in his best days it was hard for him to overcome , so that talking with him was almost like love-making , and his shy , beautiful soul had to be wooed from its bashful pudency like an unschooled maiden . The calm despondency with which he spoke about himself confirmed the unfavorable opinion suggested by his look and history . " I saw Hawthorne alive , for the last time , the day he started on this his last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I had great misgivings about the jaunt he was purposing to take so early in the season . His tones were more subdued than ever , and he scarcely spoke above a whisper . He was very affectionate in parting , and I followed him to the door , looking after him as he went up School Street . I noticed that he faltered from weakness , and I should have // taken my hat and joined him to offer my arm , but I knew he did not wish to seem ill , and I feared he might be troubled at my anxiety . Fearing to disturb him , I followed him with my eyes only , and watched him till he turned the corner and passed out of sight . On the morning of the i9th of May , 1864 , a telegram , signed by Franklin Pierce , stunned us all . It announced the death of Hawthorne . In the afternoon of the same day came this letter to me - " PEMIGEWASSET HOUSE , PLYMOUTH , N. H. , Thursday morning , 5 o'clock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communicated to you the fact of our dear friend Hawthorne 's death . My friend Colonel Hibbard , who bears this note , was a friend of H , and will tell you more than I am able to write . " I enclose herewith a note which I commenced last evening to dear Mrs. Hawthorne . 0 , how vill she bear this shock ! Dear mother - dear children - " When I met Hawthorne in Boston a week ago , it was apparent that he was much more feeble and more seriously diseased than I had supposed him to be . We came from Senter Harbor yesterday afternoon , and I thought he was , on the whole , brighter than he was the day before . Through the week he has been inclined to somnolency during the day , but restless at night . He retired last night soon after nine o'clock , and soon fell into a quiet slumber . In less than half an hour changed his position , but continued to sleep . I left the door open between his bed-room and mine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was asleep myself before eleven o'clock . The light continued to burn in my room . At two o'clock I went to H s bedside ; he was apparently in a sound sleep , and I did not place my hand upon him . At four o'clock I went into his room again , and , as his position was unchanged , I placed my hand upon him and found that life was extinct . I sent , however , immediately for a physi cian , and called Judge Bell and Colonel Hibbard , who occupied rooms upon the same floor and near me . He lies upon his side , his position so perfectly natural and easy , his eyes closed , that it is difficult to realize , while looking upon his noble face , that this is death . He must have passed from natural slumber to that from which there is no waking without the slightest movement . " I can not write to dear Mrs. Hawthorne , and you must exercise your judgment with regard to sending this and the unfinished note , enclosed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Hawthorne 's lifelong desire that the end might be a sudden one was gratified . Often and often he has said to me , " What a blessing to go quickly ! " So the same swift angel that came as a messenger to Allston , Irving , Prescott , Macaulay , Thackeray , and Dickens , was commissioned to touch his forehead also , and beckon him away . The room in which death fell upon him , " Like a shadow'thrown Softly and lightly from a passing cloud , " looks towards the east ; and standing in it , as I have frequently done , since he passed out silently into the skies , it is easy to imagine the scene on that spring morning which President Pierce so feelingly describes in his letter . On the 24th of May we carried Hawthorne through the blossoming orchards of Concord , and laid him down under a group of pines , on a hillside , overlooking historic fields . All the way from the village church to the grave the birds kept up a perpetual melody . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pleasant , as if death had never entered the world . Longfellow and Emerson , Channinb and Hoare , Agassiz and Lowell , Greene and WhippIe , Alcott and Clarke , Holmes and Hillard , and other old friends walked slowly by his side that beautiful spring morning . The companion of his youth // and his manhood , for whom he would willingly at any time have given up his own life , Franklin Pierce , was there among the rest , and scattered flowers into the grave . The unfinished Romance , which had cost him so much anxiety , the last literary work on which he had ever been engaged , was laid on his coffin . " Alil who shall lift that wand of magic power , And the lost clew regain ? The unfinished window in Aladdin 's tower Unfinished must remain U ' Longfellow 's beautiful poem will always be associated with the memory of Hawthorne , and most fitting was it that his fellow-student , whom he so loved and honored , should sing his requiem .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
