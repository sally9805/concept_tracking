ARTICLE Ill-PROFESSOR FITCH AS A PREACHER . AFTER the sun goes down there is a ruddy glow that lingers in the sky , truly a glory at the end , but it gives no just idea of the daily journey of the sun through the heavens , quietly blessing and fructifying all beneath his rays ; and so when a good man departs , while this after-glow lasts , it is difficult to judge calmly of him and of his works ; but it sometimes happens that a life is exceptionally lengthened out beyond its days of active labor , and that it outlives the strifes , passions , and enthusiasms of its own generation , although it draws with it to the very end an intellectual and spiritual radiance ; in such a case the looker-on who gazes at its vanishing light can do so without excitement , and is able to judge dispassionately of its whole beneficent course . Professor ELEAZAR T. FITCH was not only a distinguished preacher , but he was for many years a distinguished and successful teacher of the art of preaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his traits as a preacher , to look for a moment at the method of instruction in which he developed his ideas of the theory of preaching ; for he was a man who characte*stically stood by his own principles . He regarded the homiletic art as that of constructing the finished pulpit discourse , in which divine truth is set forth in a clear , methodical form of discussion ; and which is founded on the conception of the ancient discourse , whose principles come down from the Greek masters and are elaborated iAto rhetorical systems by the Latin writers . This was not , in deed , the scriptural conception of preaching , but , through the influence of classical studies in the second and third centuries of the Church , it came into vogue , and has continued to prevaiL It was the formal mould in which preaching was cast when Christianity took on scientific shape , and encountered the influences and methods of philosophical thought . Professor Fitch , while he seems to have been thoroughly acquainted with the English and French literature of this subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing he attempted , something valuable of his own . He introduced a // definite principle , or theory , into preaching ; and he infused his own thoughtful experience in the work of preaching divine truth , into his whole system . His course of lectures was comparatively brieg and would not be considered so comprehensive in plan as some modern German treatises on this science-if science it may be called  --  but it was characteristic of Dr. Fitch not to attempt too much , and whatever he did , to do well . He had the artistic eye to finish , and his work was thoroughly done , needing no doing over . In his introduction , after saying that genius is the power to secure results in action , but that its power is increased by discipline , though the discipline and the action are to be separated , so that the true preacher is to rise above discipline , and to act and speak with freedom-he announces his general outline of topics , which , however , it is not necessary here to give ; since we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from notes of the lectures by another hand , and from Dr. Fitch 's few published sermons , how , or in what part he seemed to throw his strength , and where he added something to homiletical science ; or , in other words , what can be gathered of his own individual conception of the ttue philosophy of preaching . The subject of the interpretation and exposition of texts , though clearly set forth , has perhaps nothing peculiar in his mode of treating it ; and so in the analysis of the different parts of the discourse , and in the description of the various kinds of sermonizing , and in the summing up of the sources and materials of discourse ,  --  the whole subject of invention ,  --  and in the matter of style as well , we do not know that there is aught in his lectures , although these . points are all ably and sagaciously handled , which specially show the stamp of his genius , until we come to the subject of the discussion , or the best method of treating divine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is here , it seems to us , he lays out his strength , for here he has a theory , and his own theory , whether false or true . " The ultimate end of discussion in the pulpit , " he says , " is persuasion , or , in other words , to affect the heart and conscience . There are other subordinate ends , to explain , to prove , to bring the subject already known and acknowledged before the mind ; but these are themselves intended to secure the ultimate // end . " In this clear setting forth of divine truth , by definition and explanation , by amplification and description , and above all , by proof and reasoning , so that being brought to bear in its full force upon the mind it may prove a resistless motive to persuasion-in this he places the true idea of preaching . His lectures , if we are not greatly in error , assume this predominating aim of stimulating instruction in the art of moral persuasion , or of the best method of so setting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason and conscience . He has faith in the truth clearly exhibited . That is the fundamental idea of good preaching , to make truth stand in clear light to the reason . In the argumentative form of discussion , which is his favorite one , he demands a distinctness of aim , a precision of plan , a sharpness of discrimination , an honesty of proof , a purity of motive , which rightly belong to truth , and are in consonance with the laws of the mind that the Author of truth has made . In fact , in the treatment of religions truth , he would embody the best principles and laws of thought in discourse , at the same time taking them out of their logical formularies and making them practical living factors in the grand art of persuasion . In his sermon entitled " The mode of preaching the gospel that is adapted to success , " he develops this idea of preaching which has been stated . He lays it down as an axiom that there is one form of truth better than another that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; that there is a kind of truth , which , given by inspiration , is the very power of God to salvation ; that it comprehends all the moral influence of the Deity on the side of the recovery of man from sin to faith and righteousness . This truth must be used and applied to the mind of man in the sure ways of persuasion . " Why , this is the very way , " he says , " and the only way , for one intelligent being to influence the heart of another and bring him to a change of feeling and purpose , by addressing considerations intelligently to his understanding and affectionately to his heart , as God does with man through the gospel . " He thought that the more clearly and forcibly this is done , the more likelihood there is of men 's being convinced and converted . He says , " It better accords with the design of the gospel for a preacher to be plain and intelligible , than to be indistinct and confused // in thought ; better to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be condemned , than to rely on inconclusive arguments which adversaries and gainsayers can easily resist . " He believed , further , in a harmonious system of truths , which , combined , would with greater power than if a truth were presented singly , act on the one purpose of convincing and converting the soul . " The gospel , " he said , " should be preached as a system of consistent truths , bearing with one harmonious design on the great object of repentance and salvation . Now if a preacher of the gospel would hope to bring its salutary power on the hearts of men , he should enter into the design of God in this very respect , and set forth the various doctrines and precepts of the gospel as one harmonious system , having in all its parts one salutary and practical bearing on man . The harmony of which we speak is the agreement of the truths of the scriptures in thei ? practical bearing ; the harmony , not only of the doctrines with one another , but of the doctrines with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctrinal representation agreeing with itself in its various parts might be made out , and yet the various parts in themselves be erroneous and aside from the practical intent of the gospel . But we refer to that system and harmony which exist in doctrines ; their agreeing with each other not merely in abstract speculation , but , above all , in this respect that they all have one practical tendency , lending their united power to the one object of promoting faith and salvation . One will be sustained in its practical bearing with the whole force of all the others . And if there is any way of making bare the sword of the Spirit and presenting it to the heart in all its sharpness , if there is any way of presenting the full power of the gospel before the minds of hearers , this is the way . All will be guides , helps , motives in favor of compliance , none of them hindrances . " And he believed his theory . He acted upon it . It was with a deliberate aim for practical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he preached that powerful series of sermons on systematic theology to the students of Yale College , which rimmed in , so to speak , as by a concentric ring of divine logic , the four years educational course in human studies and human philosophy . Here , it appears to us , he was superior to mere doctrinal preachers in general , because he // did not seem so much to care for speculative consistency - or that did not form so much his real aim-as for the practical end of success in preaching the gospel , and because he earnestly believed that this was the right method of bringing about the greatest results . In a word , while his preaching was doctrinal , it was still more really practical . He presented grander motives to the mind for right action , than the world could do for a lower and opposite course . His doctrinal views may not be accepted by some as perfect , or as containing the whole truth ; but he nevertheless thought that truth was divine reason , that it should be set forth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chiming in with the invariable laws of intelligence ; not confused like a barbarian mythology or a superstitious charm , but binding with sweet harmonious influences the mind of man to the throne of God . " Who can not see and feel , " he says , " that to set forth the gospel as harmonizing in all its parts upon one practical bearing is best adapted to secure success ? How is it possible to gain the credit and assent of the unbelieving to a word , if it is set forth as contradictory in its parts ? How secure sorrow for sin , if sin is set forth in the same breath as a thing odious above all things to the heart of God , and yet as a thing he prefers to . holiness ? How can repentance be secured , if after calling on the sinner himself to repent , you turn round the very next moment and say that it is no work of his , and he must wait for the Holy Spirit to perform the whole work ? How can confidence in God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wills and two hearts at war with one another ? " Adding to what has been already said , the idea that the preacher should preach in a way of application to the hearers so as to call for a decision of their hearts at the time  --  and we get perhaps as good a conception of IDr . Fitch 's main underlying theory of preaching as perhaps could be presented in a brief compass . It was a vigorous and rational conception of preach - ing . It was a theory that could be used . Such preaching , when wielded with the earnestness of faith and in contact with living souls , was a sharp effective weapon of the Spirit . It was a powerful assailing of mind and conscience . Whether it admit // or no of all the variety that is possible and d*sirable ; whether it be the most nataral and primitive method or no ; whether it suit best all kinds of preachers and all classes of hearers ; whether it be liable or not to great abuses and perversion in less earnest and consecrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a rod that buds ; whether it be the last and best and only method of preaching the gospel ; these are questions upon which there may be differences of opinion ; but it was an evidence of genius as well as faith on the part of a young preacher like Professor Fitch , in the midst of many opposing and oppressing circumstances in the theological world at the time of his coming on the stage of action , to have adopted such an earnest theory of preaching , one that demanded the consecration of every faculty , intellectual and moral ; that shamed the formal , faint-hearted and desponding mode of operation in religious things then prevailing ; that aimed at immediate results , and that formed this idea into a philosophy of action . Professor Fitch belonged to that remarkable epoch of revival preachers and theologians whose greatest and organizing mind was Nathanael Taylor , and whose salient characteristics were perhaps most fully represented by Lyman Beecher ; but his own position as an academical preacher , his refined tastes and quietude of spirit , prevented him from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he committed himself with unbounded confidence , into extravagant extremes either of statement or action . It was as difficult for him to be a one-sided theologian as to be a dogmatic one . He defended his own views with spirit , and he fought a good fight for freedom of opinion , bat his deep fund of Christian charity , his mildness and cautiousness of temper , and his genuine spirituality , preserved him from partisan narrowness , and saved his preaching from becoming metaphysical barrenness and empty logomachy . Those older men among us who heard Professor Fitch in his prime , unite with enthusiasm in testifying to the marvelous power and charm of his preaching ; and , what is not often the case , his published discourses , in some true degree bear out this testimony . His oratory was of a finished kind . It was classic rather perhaps than idiomatic ; and it is characteristic both of his day and of his mind , that to one of his earliest discourses // Dr. Fitch prefixes as a motto a sentence from Cicero . His sermons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discourses . Nothing less complete , was , in his estimation , worthy of being brought into the pulpit . Bossuet , Massillon , Claude , Saurin , Robert Hall , were his genuine precursors on the throne of pulpit oratory , and from them all he drew something-the finely balanced plan , the rounded period , the abstract and brilliant , though at times fiery and feeling rhetoric . As might be supposed from his theory of sermonizing , his discourses in their form were argumentative . They were to prove something . They were addressed to the reason . Their basis was thoughtful discussion . They were the opposite of the textual method . There was always a definite theme , developed by brief explanation of the text , or , perhaps , as a more general rule , preconceived as an abstract topic . There could be no doubt in regard to the subject ( thema ) of the sermon . The subject was eliminated and held up in a complete and propositional form . This proposition , once clearly stated , was then , as it were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an animated and vigorous manner . His law of division folloxving the older rhetoricians , was , as a general rule , three-fold , the most logical and best adapted , as he thought , to forcible discussion . He considered that rarely did any subject demand a four-fold division , or a still more minute partition that savored of micrology of thought . There was strict logical unity in his discourses ; but there was moreover aesthetic unity ; and there was , more than all , vital unity . His mind demanded logical unity , but his aesthetic sense likewise delighted in perfect form , and his earnest purpose looking to one divine end in what he said , electrified this logical statement and made the cold form live . He was not satisfied , like Dr. Emmons , to bind his hearers in an iron chain of metaphysical argument ; but his reasoning was transformed into bands and cords of love , whereby he drew men s hearts , and the proud hearts of young men often , in delightful captivity to Jesus Christ . While thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in a great degree he avoided many of the worst faults of exclusively doctrinal preaching . One way in which he did this was by his eloquence . Eloquence is hard to define , but it is enough now to say that it is // something personal , an attribute of the soul , a power manifesting itself in speech which is able to penetrate the hearer 's mind with new life and move him to action ; it is an influence issuing from the inmost mind of the speaker and penetrating the inmost mind of the hearer , and by a strong current of sympathy suddenly set flowing between souls , making them for the time , one in feeling , conviction , purpose . This sympathetic element was . in Dr. Fitch 's preaching . It must be said , however , that it was to an ideal hearer that he preached , and for an ideal hearer that he felt rather than for the real one ; yet he earnestly felt what he preached ; he was truly moved ; and where the heart of the living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of eloquent emotion that was set flowing from this excitation of divine themes , then he was borne on as by a torrent 's force . The preacher 's reasoning did not deaden his sensibilities , nor quench the heart of the ambassador of God 's love in him . When he was stirred by what he was saying , there came from this severe reasoner a strain of pathetic appeal like the music of waters from the rock ; and often too rose a voice of solemn warning that seemed sometimes to catch the sublime rhythm of a prophet 's burden . But it was the truth that roused him more than the wants and sorrows of human hearts . He felt for these , but he was removed from them into an atmosphere of thought above them ; and , although he preached singly and faithfully to save souls , and though his preaching was greatly blessed , yet it was preaching which was orginated and shaped by thinking in the study , and was used as a well-forged instrument upon all minds alike , rather than preaching which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearts of his congregation , and having a peculiar adaptation to their individual wants . Yet this kind of preaching , though in part constitutional and in part belonging to the style of the period , was not inconsistent with his own theory ; and the merit of his theory , and the element of truth there is in it , were proved by the fact that he served successfully at his post for thirty-five years , and continued to the last to be esteemed by one of the most difficult as well as interesting and noble of audiences , as a preacher of uncommon power . He trained many a youthful mind , afterwards eminent in Church and State , to think . He // laid in many a strong nature the foundation of a noble character , He guided many erring souls into the Kingdom of God . Yet it is strange that when we read his sermons ( and this is not peculiar to him alone-Robert Hall would be liable to the same remark ) , sermons that are truly eloquent and that thrilled the hearts of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language of the pulpit at the present . How differently a sermon by Prof. Fitch would read and sound from a sermon by Henry Ward Beecher ! We miss in his sermons the fresh thought there is in best modern preaching ; and as compared with sermons like those of F. W. Robertson and Canon Lyddon , we miss the scholarly and profoundly philosophic thought . We lack also the free breath and play of nature , the lively illustration , the racy English . The words sound solemn and far-off as if they were echoes from eternity . Are we wrong , or was he wrong ? Neither , we presume . His preaching was an immense advance upon the stiff , dry , theological preaching that went before . It marked an epoch in the history of American preaching . It was in comparison simple , earnest , and free . It was like music among the tree-tops-a blessed movement of new life . It was reasoning , but reasoning alive with a heavenly aim , and fired with a cheerful and divine hope . It introduced the rhetorical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and grace . It had the imaginative and dramatic quality in a high degree , such as was rarely before seen in our American preaching ; and it is to be lamented that we do not yet possess in print some of those vivid sermons , so full of the moral picturesque , of powerful character-painting , like the one on the " Sacrifice of Isaac , ' which called forth the warm praises of a former generation . And these last named sermons should be spoken of as modifying the remark , that all his discourses were cast in an argumentative form-now and then he varied this general method by a delightful variety of animated , familiar , and highly dramatic sermons . But as Dr. Fitch 's preaching was , without doubt , a step in advance of a former epoch , why should we , while giving to it its just praise , fear or hesitate to say that there may be , in some respects , still greater improvement in the future . In certam features , it is true , it would be difficult to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even in some points , a decided falling off and retrogression at the present time . Some elements of power seem to have dropped out of modern preaching . There is already some danger of preaching 's losing the intellectual element  --  the staple of sound thought and sound doctrine-of our sermons becoming boneless tissues of essay-writing , or of picture-drawing , without substance , or the reflective and didactic quality ( N*yo ; yv5aeco ; ) , in them . The difficulty now with young preachers in and out of our seminaries is , to iiiduce them to compose doctrinal sermons . They do not seem to really know how to go to work to do it . While we are talking and theorizing about preaching , and there is no subject about which every body feels so competent and ready to dogmatize upon as this , and every one has a theory , and every one has a doctrine , and while we are setting forth earnestly the absolute need and worth of doctrinal preaching , those who have the least experience in this matter perceive that young men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ productions to the public taste , shun this method of close discussion of doctrines , and run to the opposite extreme of addresses to the intuition , the imagination , and the senses of men . God 's spirit moves in the healthy tendencies of opinion and the great currents of public taste and interest . They are not to be neglected or undervalued . Epochs of religious thought and feeling can not exactly be reproduced any more than epochs of political sentiments can be . Sonic things are true beyond peradventure . It must be that while the gospel is preached , doctrinal truth , more or less systematized , more or less methodized in accordance with universal laws of thought , will be a main element of instruction from the pulpit The church of Christ is " the pillar and ground of the truth ; " to it is committed the " mystery of godliness , " or the truth revealed and known purely but to the church , and which as its steward , the church , mainly through its preachers , must teach in its perfectness and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all ? May we not hope in the future that the truth will be preached with more of divine power and effect than in the past ? Will it not be preached less abstractly , and in far more natural and skillful ways ? Will it not be preached more truly as Christ preached the doetrine // of divine things , with juster regard to the inborn consciousness of men ? Will it not be preached with more humble , simple , close and vital reference to the word of God , and with more of richness of exegesis , and of the teaching quality there is in the Scriptures themselves , and thus with greater resemblance to the earliest apostolic preaching ? Will not preaching manifest more freedom , nature , and popular interest ? Will it not get nearer to men ? Will it not have more of the spirit of humanity , or of patient and thorough application to all the needs , sorrows , affections , temptations , doubts , aspirations and struggles of human nature ? Will it not be above all more spiritual ? Will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spiritual life ? Will it not have more of the spirit of Christ , of love , of unction , of the converting power of the spirit of Christ , without at the same time becoming less intellectual and thoughtful ? Will it not enter more deeply into the field of ethics , of the whole moral conduct of life as guided by the Christian law , in its multiform aspects , questions and difficulties , which , strangely enough , the Protestant pulpit has left to the Roman Catholic pulpit to occupy , and to occupy often very badly ? We believe this because we believe in progress , in truly divine progress , wherein the spirit of Christ is ever teaching his church the best methods of proclaiming his truth . We believe there is to be progress in the divine art of preaching without its losing a single element that has already constituted its power . While we hold to that doctrinal preaching which is the extracting of the sweetness and marrow of the truth for the soul to feed upon , yet we believe that exclusively theological @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had its day , and is calculated , like any other false kind of preaching , to kill religious life . " If the first Christians had been so busy with their theology as to find no leisure against the infamis arena , ' their religion ini*ght have remained ( and would it not have deserved to have remained ? ) undistinguished from the pagan worships that surrounded it . A religion that has exhausted its moral force , that has become unexacting and conventional in its discipline , has the feebleness of religion divided from morality , of Paganism itself . Has Christianity exhausted all its destructive and reconstructive powers ? Has it // no new prohibitions , no new commands ? If so , let the clergy confine themselves to theology . If societ*y is finally set on its right basis , if the proper way of living is as clear as daylight to every one , and there remains nothing to struggle against but the weakness of individuals , the human tendency to step aside , ' then let the clergy confine themselves to theology . But most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If so , why are they conservatives ? " * Professor Fitch 's intellect was of noble proportions . There were no barren and incomplete places in his nature . The aesthetic faculties were developed equally with the knowing faculties . He had a love for beauty as well as for truth , and in such a mind the two were almost if not quite synonymous . He preserved a simplicity of spirit , a power of calm reflection by which he was enabled to see through the outward and changing forms of things , and to behold the permanently beautiful and heavenly types upon which they were formed . He was a lover of music as one of the purest forms of art ; and he was a critic and composer of music , grasping the hidden organic laws of harmony . With what appreciation he opens one of his articles upon the organ , as an instrument of public worship : " The subject of music is of wide and varied interest . Its laws demand for their investigation the intellect of the student . Its execution gives scope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strains breathe sweetly to the heart through the portals of sense ; soothing us in infancy , cheering us in life 's conflicts and changes , elevating the soul in hours of worship , and breathing on the ears of the dying the notes that commingle with the melodies of heaven . Then , on the solemn day , it sets forth an emblem of the heavenly world where the praises of God , flowing from the heart and lips of his people and sustained in their expression by that instrument , fill the air with the incense of pure and sweet tones enveloping the whole assembly , and ascending toward the deep empyrean , with their harmony ? " Dr. Fitch believed with Luther , who would " fain see all arts , especially music used in the service of Him who has given and created them ; " and who held those to be fanatics who despised music . He was equally a lover of painting , poetry , sculpture , // especially the last , which above all others is the art of form , an almost purely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of beauty depend probably on delicate perceptions of fitness , propriety , relation , which are purely intellectual ; " and we note this because we think that Dr. Fitch 's aesthetic sense was mainly an exquisite intellectual perception , that could not be satisfied with imperfect forms of things , but strove for the fit form to the idea ; and this delicate intellectual sense or intellective quality of his imagination , showed itself above all in the spet*ial work of the preacher . A sermon , in his eye , was a work of sacred art , an offering to the Most High that should be as perfect as his genius could make it . Like the bronze-workers of the middle ages , men such as Adam Kraft and Peter Yischer of Nuremberg , lie would set up nothing in the house of God that was not wi-ought out with the most deeply meditated skill , that was not , as far as he could make it , the perfection of beauty . His sermons have a scuipturesque finish . Each is a work complete in itself , patiently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all its parts , and in its workmanship and language polished as if with the finest instruments . We should not call his style poetical , for it had not the bold freedom of poetry , and it was too much ruled by the severe laws of the intellect to be highly poetical , but it was rather artistically elegant and harmonious . With a deep purpose of heart , he would ever offer in love and grateful praise to the Lord who had redeemed him , the richest and best that he had ; and moreover , knowing the hardness of men 's hearts , and the scale-armor of prejudice and unbelief with which they armed themselves against the truth , he would make every sermon " a polished shaft " that naught could resist . The constitutional nervous self-consciousness , or whatever was the cause , that prevented Dr. Fitch from being an extemporaneous preacher , excepting at times where he forgot himself and rose above this obstacle , disappeared in the delivery of the written discourse . Then he became absorbed in the truth he was uttering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of every power of expression-often , when his feelings were highly roused , venturing forth boldly upon a short extemporaneous flight from the manuscript ; and does not this prove that the // written method is not to be so indiscriminately condemned as it is now quite the fashion to condemn it . We could ill afford to lose from the pulpit such burning and shining lights as Dr. Fitch , or IDr . Shepard of Bangor , whose idiosyncrasy would nevertheless have driven them entirely away from this divine field of work , had they been compelled to frame their language on the spur of the moment , to fit the laboring thought , often , it may be , too profound , or too subtle , to be instantaneously clothed in appropriate phrase . While we would heartily help on the good reformation that strives to abolish the reading of Written sermons from the pulpit ; while we believe with an old German preacher , that tongues of flame instead of writing pens fell from heaven on the apostles at the day of Pentecost ; yet while there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no more habitually speak without the help of notes , than an eagle can fly without wings , then we do not think that the use of written sermons can be entirely done away . The gospel must be preached through the medium of peculiar temperaments and of varied minds ; and even the apostle Paul with what would seem to be an excess of candor , repeats probably an ill-natured criticism on himself that his bodily presence was weak and his speech contemptible , but his letters - we might say his written discourses - were weighty and powerful . It was a noteworthy trait of Dr. Fitch , that he was very easily satisfied and was remarkably unexacting and uncritical in respect to the preaching of other men . He judged himself severely , but others charitably and lightly . Though he dearly prized close logical thinking , yet he was so genuinely humble , that he found something to praise in every sermon that he heard , something wherewith to nourish spirituality and kindle devotional thought . He was a sincere lover of preaching as well as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wisdom and the power of God to save men . It was the fire and the hammer in the hand of God that nothing could resist . But in listening to preaching he never forgot that he was also a worshipper ; and his own preaching had in an unusual degree the element of praise in it . His mind was devotional and meditative rather than objective and practical , and it showed the nobil // ity of his faith , that in spite of this strong inward bent and character of his mind , his own preaching was so thoroughly practical , earnest , and pointed . It was aimed to convert and sanctify souls . It did not deal in vague ambiguities whether in morbid confessions of doubt , or ecstatic expressions of desire . This is one of the merits of Dr. Fitch 's preaching , that it was healthy and plain and did not fall in too subjective a style of discourse . Subjective preaching has its true place and power , and now and then it manifests wondrous richness , charm and beauty , as in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but subjectiveness is essentially weakness , and in preaching this is especially true , even where the personal experience of the Christian is minutely dwelt upon and analyzed . The preacher is not to go back into his own mind , following up thought and action to their head-sources , through channels of interior darkness . In this way he can not find strength , or light , or instruction , for other minds . H* is not called upon to grope painfully in this dim region of human shadows , impulses and imperfections , for faith 's foundation , for hope 's realization ; but he is to look out of himself to those strong things of God , and of God 's work and nature in man , for the soul to rest uponthose great objective facts , that , standing in eternal sunshine , are like mountains , or like the pillars of the universe-Christ , the Holy Ghost the Comforter , the light and wisdom that is from above , the higher life , the divine law written on the heart , the inspiration , the truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the love , of God . Christ lifted up in the sight of all , like the brazen serpent in the wilderness , draws suffering , yearning , dying souls unto Him . We well remember how often Professor Fitch made use of the passage that seemed to dwell on his lips like the very breath of life to his soul , " Herein is love , not that we loved God , but that He loved us , and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins . However hereafter the great facts of faith may become better reconciled to reason and to the mind 's intuitions , and the whole interior nature of man may become filled with a new divine light , and the real nobleness and grandeur of the mind 's powers may be recognized by a true philoshphy and emancipated from philosophical error and bondage , and however the // objective and subjective may become harmonized , yet there can be no doubt that the way to preach Christ 's gospel , is to preach not ourselves , but Christ Jesus the Lord . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Professor Fitch 's mind . Although thoroughly interested in public affairs , genial , sagacious , at moments humorous , he was a man who lived in ideas-an inward life withdrawn very much from the world of visible things , and dwelling in high and holy contemplations . This satisfied the deepest desires of his mind , and in a long life spent at a seat of learning , and in the society of intellectual men , he never manifested the slightest evidence of the ambitious passion , or of the vain desire . to please men rather than God . He quieted his heart and was still because God was ever with him and fed his soul upon the hidden manna  --  the bread that cometh down from heaven . In his protracted life of service as a preacher of Christ , how many minds whom he led to look on th' ineffable beauty of truth , and who preceded him into the eternal world , have welcomed him where they do not now see in part , but where that which is partial and imperfect is done aw*ty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Time " Where every thing that is sincerely good And perfectly divine , With Truth , and Peace , and Love , shall ever shine About the Supreme Throne Of Him , t ' whose happy-making sight alone , When once our heav'nly-guided soul shall climb , Then all this earthly grossness quit .
