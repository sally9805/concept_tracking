txt What is to be the character of the permanent paper currency in this country is a question , as THE TIMES long ago pointed out , which is still unsettled . The fulfillment of the Government 's promises to pay having been reached , their retention , or increase , or withdrawal , is a matter which naturally comes next , and will certainly be forced into prominence by the inflationists . Perhaps the two sorts of paper mayremain in use together for a term of years yet , but unquestionably the Greenbackers are aggressively disposed , and ; although returning prosperity will weaken them , they will fight persistently to make Government paper the sale representative currency . Danger from that source will end only with the withdrawal of Government paper ; hence , it is not too soon to begin the consideration of the present utility of that form of currency and the reasons for retaining it . The plea , that it is needed so that there shall be currency enough will not bear examination . As the first point in inquiry , How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greenbacks and $322,323 , - 000 bank-notes ? $669,000,000 of paper money alone , against $300,000,000 ( exactly $290,607,014 ) of paper and specie together in 1860 . Since then population has increased perhaps 50 per cent. ; imports and exports , 30 and 85 per cent. , with an increase in general prices ; the same volume per capita as in 1860 ? if this useless comparison is considered a standard by anybody  --  would require $450,000,000 of all currency now . If , then , $600,000 , - 000 of paper alone be assumed as enough for the needs of the next ten or twenty years , the assumption should be deemed fair , although below the present volume ; for that sum is nearly three times the paper in 1860 , is double the total then existing , leaves opportunity for coin to any extent , and must be considered in connection with the fact that ( for reasons which do not require statement ) increase in volume of money need not equal that of population , wealth , or trade . The bank-notes now existing considerably exceed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prices now requires more money ; but assuming $600,000,000 of paper to be desirable , let us see whether that could be had in banknotes . By the pro ? Euat system , that would require a basis of $667,000,000 bonds as security , or an increase of $317,000,000 over what the Treasury now holds in trust for that purpose . On Jan. 1 there were $198 , - 700,000 of 4 per cents , and it is probable that the process of refunding will continue at a rate which would keep in advance of the process of substituting bank for Government paper . Of the three issues of 5-20s , there are $374,164,850 remaining ; of the Os of 1881 , there are $261,321,000 ; of 10-40s , there are $194,566,300 , making a total of $833,000,0000 bonds which by their terms are , or within thirty months will be , redeemable at the option of Government . Further legislation is necessary before refunding can be extended to all these , but Congress has never shown any indisposition to favor the reduction of interest . In order to reach a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore , $317,000,000 more would have to be bought and deposited by the banks . As a source from which these may be drawn , there are $833.000,000 that may yet be funded , besides $250 , - 000,000 of 4 ' 2s , which can not be disturbed for about thirteen years to come . ' Of course , there is no increase in the aggregate amount of the bonds , and , to the extent of $130,000,000 , this further refunding of $833,000,000 would be applied to bonds already deposited as basis for circulation . Nothing more is intended than to inquire what amount of bonds , not subject to redenaPtion in a shorter term than thirty years , may yet be supplied as a fund for the basis of increased circulation . Of the total coin-bearing debt , the banks now have deposited 19 per cent. ; the largest amount ever deposited was 20 per cent . For $600 , - 000,000 of circulation they would require 37 percent . of the total ; of the $533,000 , - 000 of 4s , they would require 53 per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the competition of corporations which are by law or by prudence compelled to own governments , as well as that of the investment market in general . But although the demand from corporations is comparatively constant , that of the general investment market is fluctuating . During this period of , depression , while everybody wants Gov.ernment bonds as investments , the banks do not want them for purposes of circulation ; but the general activity which should create that sort of need of them by the banks would diminish in something like the same degree the general demand for them . It is also true that the Government may not long be able to place bonds at 4 per cent. , so that the refunding process may come short of the $833,000,000 , and even of the remaining $646,000,000 already authorized . But when activity has So returned that money can be put to more profitable use than to buy long-term bonds with it , the same activity which kills their sale for general investment may make it worth while to take them as the basis of additional bank circulation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banks to draw from other holders over $300,000,000 of bonds , and to obtain three-eighths of the total issues ; for , although no such attempt has yet been made , there has been no occasion for making it , and  --  for the same reason , if not to the same extent , that the banks desired the bonds for circulation  --  other holders might be willing to surrender them . The time will come  --  probably within forty years  --  when the withdrawal of Government bonds will have proceeded so far as to compel the finding of some other basis for bank circulation , and before that time comes the consideration of the subject will be necessary . What shall be done then , or what will be the permanent structure of circulation in this country , we do not now discuss . The foregoing aims to show merely that the present banking system can run at least thirty years yet before remodeling it becomes on this account imperative . If funding continues briskly and governments are in general demand , an increase in currency is not needed ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it may make the banks want the bonds ' for purposes of cir culation ; if more circulation is wanted , governments are the less wanted by the investment market at large ; if the old bonds are refunded , the new ones are open to the banks ; if refunding halts , : the old bonds exist all the same . If more circulation is needed , it will be profitable for banks to furnish it , and they will do so ? of this there can be no question . There is room enough , for some years to come , for the banking system as it stands to furnish , by its own voluntary and fatural expansion , all the paper which is needed , were the greenbacks gradually got out of the way , and that bonds enough can be got for the purpose . It follows that the retentionof the greenbacks for the sake of keeping the circulation full is utterly without excuse , and that some other justification for that retention must be sought .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
