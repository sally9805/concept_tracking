OF ' THE MAN IN THE MOON . " He made an instrument , to know If the meon shine at full or no , And prove that she 's not made of green cheese . " BUTLER . WHAT were " the precious things put forth by the moon " ? Surely not the thousand ; and-one absurd theories about its inhabitants which we find are entertained in some shape or other by nearly every nation on earth . The oldest and at the same time the most familiar to our race is the story of the two children who were robbed just as they were bringing water home from *a spring ; hence they may still be seen as dark spots on the face of the full moon on bright winter nights , carrying a bucket between them on a long pole . When this pagan view was duly exorcised by the zealous missionaries who converted the old Saxons , our ancestors , it gave way to a more refined but hardly more credible account . Now it is a man who had stolen a bundle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a punishment , to the moon , where he has to carry his burden for evermore , and suffer at the same time of unceasing cold . This is the original Man in the Moon . It is curious to see how popular superstition has clun , g to this theory in spite of all the light that science has endeavored from time immemorial to shed upon the subject . The mystery is much aided by the remarkable fact that we only know one hnlf of the moon , which is constantly seen by us , while the other half has never yet been beheld by human eye . The face of the moon , which our first father Adam watched , no doubt , with fear and admiration strangely mixed , as it rose on the horizon , is the same which the last man will take leave of when the earth shall perish in fire . Btlt this very fact of a whole world , so near to us and yet lying so utterly beyond our reach , has from of old existed and stimulated the imagination of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the Man in the Moon has occupied the ablest minds of antiquity as well as the most gifted writers of our own day . The result has been necessarily very unsatisfactory first , for thousands of years , because the moon was inaccessible to the eye in the absence of proper instruments , and in recent times , because , even with the aid of such magnificent glasses as those of the Earl of Rosse , which shows objects of the size of a moderate mountain on our satellite , no sign of life has Setered , in the year 1870. by 0 . P. PUTNAM &amp; SON , in the Clerhe 010cr of Lice Dietrict Court of the U. S. for the Southern District of N. Y. // yet been discovered . But failure seems only to have increased the desire to enter into communication with the lunar world , and efforts have been made in every age , from the proposed Tower of Babel , the summit of which was to reach unto heaven , to the colossal mirrors which , a few months ago , a clever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as would attract the attention of the Man in the Moon , and induce him to reply by similar signals . Quite recently the question , whether life  --  the highest manifes tation of Nature 's forces-exists in oth* er planets also , has apparently acquired new interest in the eyes of our savans , and the great controversy between men like Whewell and Brewster has called public attention to this interesting subject . Nor have the authors of the Continent remained inactive ; and from several recent authors in France and Germany we cull a brief account of the Man in the Moon as he has appeared at different times to the most learned of our race . How fully the ancients were imbued with the idea that , while the earth was , as they supposed , the centre of the universe , still other worlds also existed , and might be peopled with beings crcated like ourselves , appears most strikingly in Lucian 's famous Voyage to the Moon . Starting from the smiling coasts of Italy , his gay bark was driven beyond the happy seas on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed the Pillars of Hercules , became the sport of fierce winds , which forced it to wander helplessly for seventy days on a dark and stormy ocean . Then the exhausted travellers landed on a blissful island , with rivers flowing with wine , and vineyards in which each vine was an affectionate maiden . But Lucian could not be tempted ; and , leaving a few of his bewitched companions behind , he sailed on with those that remained faithful . One fine day , however , when the sun shone brightly and the waters were blue and calm , a sudden whirlwind arose and bodily lifted up their little vessel , till it reached a height of a hundred miles ; there , in vague , vacant space , they wandered about , they knew not how , for seven days and seven nights , landing at last ona large island , which hung suspended in the ether , round , and brilliantly illuminated . They had no sooner left their ship , casting a longing look at the earth far below them , with its mountains and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came and summoned them to appear before the monarch . The king of the Moon at once recognized them by their costume as Greeks , for he was a countryman of theirsEndymion . It so happened that he was at that moment engaged in fierce warfare with His Majesty Ph*ton , king of the Sun , and on the very next day a great battle was to be fought . Lucian was , of course , delighted with the opportunity to become thus fully acquainted with the Man in the Moon , and appeared , early on the next morning , on the battle-field . The lunar army , drawn up in battle array , consistcd of nothing less than sixty millions of men , with eighty thousand hippogriffs-men mounted on winged asses with three heads  --  and an equal number of other indescribable creatures , among whom he was especially pleased with thirty thousand men riding fleas of the size of twelve elephants . The list is as long as that of Homer 's heroes before Troy , and has furnished many a name , if not more , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took place on an enormous cobweb stretched out between the sun and the moon , and ended , after true Greek fashion , to the honor of both the contending parties ; they made peace , formed an alliance , and engaged not to trouble their neigh-bors ! The Man in the Moon , Lucian tells us , is not born , but buds forth like the plants of the fields ; nor does he die , but sloxvly and pleasantly passes off in a puff of smoke . His wants are supplied without labor by an over-abundant Nature , which teems on all sides with food and drink ; and he never suffers of indigestion , for his stomach // opens like a game-bag , and serves at the same time as a pocket . his senses are likewise secured against injury ; for he takes out his eyes and puts them in again at will , while his ears are simple plantain-leaves . But the worst remains to be told . The Man in the Moon is a man indeed ; there are no women there to be his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagination was exhausted , or the patience of his readers ; but he returned speedily to the earth , and ends his book rather abruptly . After the romancer came the historian ; and the great writer , whose lives have , ever since they first were read , formed the delight and developed the character of so many thousands , does not neglect the opportunity of telling us all he can learn of the Man in the Moon also . Plutarch says the lights and shadows on the surface of our faithful satellite are so skilfully intermingled , that they represent the natural shape of a human face ; and he is evidently very much annoyed by this watchfulness of a countenance which is utterly beyond our reach , and yet inspects and examines us unceasingly from the height of the starry heavens . It is exceedingly interesting to see how , occasionally , a bright truth shines forth from the dark night of ignorance in which men lived in those days . As Plutarch tries to convince us of his accuracy in reading the features of the Man in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those who differ with him , and among these adversaries he holds up to our contempt a Greek , named Aristarchus  --  and why I Because he had dared to suppose  --  to the disgust of Vesta and the other guardians of the universe-that the ether was immovable , while the earth was in motion , proceeding along the zodiac , and , besides , revolving around its own axis ! And yet that simple truth , felt and uttered by the ancient Greek , remained hid to mankind for thousands of years , was barely acknowledged by Galileo , and is not without opponents even in our day among the savans of the most enlightened nation on earth ! There is something exquisitely painful in watching men as they come near great truths and leave them again to plunge once more , and for centuries , into the darkest of errors . Did not Plutarch himself inveigh against those " paradoxical philosophers , who advance the absurd ideas , that the earth has the shape of a sphere-that there are antipodes , who , head down , hold on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that a weight , which should reach the centre of the globe , would rest there without being held-opinions so very foolish , that the most lively imagination could not admit them as possible ' * ? 1-his views of the moon present to us the same strange mixture of truth with marvellous errors . Plutarch saw in the moon , as in the earth itself ; a deity worthy of our gratitude  --  a being consisting of body and soul , and endowed with nIl the powers of life . Perhaps we shall be less disposed to smile at the great historian , if we recollect that this belief is by no means extinct , but held in our day and defended by men of su. - perior intelligence , such as the French reformer , Father Enfantin , and the founder of modern Communism , Fourier . Plutarch peoples the moon with men and animals made after the models furnished by the earth , but endowed with such delicate organizations that they either exist without eating at all , or , at the worst , inhale the odors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he quotes the wellknown sage , Epimenides , whom we might suspect of having known Liebig 's Meat-Extract , for he was reported to live without any other food than a mouthful of a certain paste , which made up his daily ration . In his effort to explain the difference between the inhabitants of the moon and ourselves , Plutarch sets forth some startling truths , evidently far in advance of his age . We ought to remember , he says , that their climate , their nature , and their constitutions are all very different from our own , and mi*at needs produce very different beings . If we // 468 PUTNAM 'S MAGAZINE . could not get near the sea , but only saw it from a distance , and knew by report that it was salt and bitter , would we be willing to believe the first man who should tell us that its depths are filled with countless animals of every size and shape , and that they use the water exactly as we do air , to breathe and to live ? This is precisely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well refuse to believe in lunar men as in marine monsters . lie gives an additional interest to the former by connecting them intimately with our own life and death . Quoting the opinions entertained by wise men living " in an island of the West , situated far beyond Great Britain and not far from the poles " - could he have meant the people of Boston ? - he states that man consists of three parts , body , soul , and intellect , of which the last is the greatest . The body is earthy , of the earth ; the soul comes from the moon , and the intellect from the sun ; for the understanding is the light of the soul , as the sun is the light of the moon . There are two deaths appointed unto man : one upon earth , when his body returns to its first elements ; then the soul remains for a while suspended between the earth and the moon , till the innate longing for home draws it up to those regions of the moon which face the sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to become a pure and unhampered intellect for all eternity ! Nor does Plutarch neglect to mention the strange influence which the changes of the moon have on earthly a*airs , though he does not ascribe it , as other writers of antiquity have done , to the liberality of the Man in the Moon , who looks with his full face favorably upon the growth of plants and the enterprises of men , but with darkened features askant at others . We must not for*ct that the ancients firmly believed in the entire dependence of agriculture on the phases of the moon , and regulated it accordingly . " Whatever is to be cut , shorn , or gathered , " says Pliny , " is done better as the moon decreases ; but what is to grow again ought to be cut during the increase of the moon ; " and other authors extended the rule even to the cutting of their own hair , fearing baldness if they neglected such precaution . Physicians of great eminence believed , in like manner , that during the increase the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the blood abounded in the veins ; while , as in ebb and tide , brains and blood sank below the level as the moon grew less and less . Nor have these doctrines been confined to the days of ignorance in antiquity , or even the Dark Ages of our era ; they are cherished by millions in our day , and almanacs derive not a little popularity from the care with which they indicate the favorable aspects of the moon for cupping and leeching , for planting and harvesting , and even for the more serious affairs of life . The early Christian writers were perhaps wiser , but hardly less painfully misled , by their habit of literal interpretation of Holy Writ , than the ancients were by their superstition and ignorance . Because the Saviour ordered the apostles to preach the gospel to " all the world and to all the nations of the earth , " the councils of the Church denied the existence of other worlds , and pious divines were occasionally excommunicated for entertaining heretical views on this subject . Yoyages of discovery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a state of vision . Some went to heaven after the manner of the great apostle ; others visited purgatory , and some even descended into hell ; though none of them equalled the despatch with which Mohammed went through seven heavens , saw all their wonders , and ascended to the throne of the Almighty . For such was his speed , that , when he returned , he found his bed still warm , and a vessel filled with hot water , which was just falling over on one side as he left , was kept from spilling a drop by his reappearance . But whatever marvellous accounts these heavenly pilgrims brought home from their ecstatic wanderings , they invariably reasserted the doctrine , that , as the Scriptures only speak of // one world , and the holy fathers teach the same , there can be no other world . Thomas Aquinas , in his famous treatise on the " Sum of all Theology , " distinctly states it to be the great dogma of the Church that the earth is the one and exclusive aim of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the stars were made only to serve man , " to be for signs and for seasons and for days and years , and to be for lights in the firmament of the heavens , to give light upon the earth . " Thus the poor Man in the Moon was abolished with the stroke of a pen , and woe was him who should hereafter imagine the moon to hold created beings like ourselves ! It was only after a long and severe struggle that the actual facts perceived by the senses and recorded by men like Copernicus and Tycho Brahe succeeded in making any impression upon the mind , and led to a general change of beliet Once , however , subjected to a rigorous examination by the light of these newly-discovered truths , the old superstitions and the forced faith of the early Church gave way alike , and sounder views began to be entertained by the better-informed . It was with such lights before him that the great bard of Italy undertook to embody in his immortal poem his views on the worlds lying beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the year 1300 , when barely thirty-three years old , Dante descended into hell . He passed through all its circles in the short space of twenty-four hours , reached the centre of the earth , marked by the gigantic body of Lucifer and reascending to the surface of our globe , he reached on the next day Purgatory Mountain . Here Virgil , who had so far guided his brother-poet , handed him over to Beatrice ; with whom , after being purified , he ascended into heaven , and there first entered the sphere of the moon . Graceful and beauteous above all women , his beloved here turned to him , saying , " Lift up your grateful heart to God , who has led us to this the first of stars . " This first star , which the poet afterwards calls the Eternal Pearl , looked to him like a globe of limpid diamond . As he approached nearer , a light-giving cloud enveloped him and his guide , and the two travellers passed apparently right into the very substance of which the moon is formed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of virginity5 containing pure , virgin-like souls on their way to the angelic paradise , where the Most High thrones in His glory . The poet met here the souls of many who had been forced to break their vows upon earth , but who now enjoyed a degree of bliss , being forgiven , which fully contented their heart . Then proceeding to other stars , the poet ascended higher and higher in the scales of eternal happiness , till he reached the Divine Presence itself . Another Italian poet , by many esteemed the equal of Dante , also describes a short journey he made to the moon . This was Ariosto , whose hero Astofo has reached Nubia after many adventures , and there meets the famous Prester John , the hero of countless legends belonging to the Middle Ages . Aided by his advice , he defeats the Harpies who try to bar the way to a gigantic mountain from which springs the mysterious Nile , but , finding him invincible , escape into an opening at the foot of the mountain . The hero follows them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the summit , there lies the earthly paradise . Astolfo visits it , and , having tasted the fruit that grows on its trees , wonders no longer at the disobedience of our first parents . He discovers at the same time that , once on the immensely high top of this mountain , the road to the moon is not very long . Enoch , and Elias , and the Apostle St. John , moreover , join in encouraging him to visit the moon1 and offer to accompany him for a special purpose . As soon as the sun has sunk into the sea , so as to allow the crescent to become visible , the Saint sends for the chariot on which men commonly are carried to heaven , and , after having driven through the eternal fires , they arrive in the vast kingdom of the mQon. // The paladin finds , to his amazement , that the moon , which looks so small when seen from the earth , is in reality as large as the latter , and so full of life that his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make a great effort to remember his errand . He is next led to an immense valley filled with all that men lose by their own faults , by the ravages of time , or the workings of chance ; not kingdoms and fortunes bestowed and taken again by capricious fortune , but things over which even Fate has no control . The hero sees here the reputations of men undermined or destroyed by time ; all the prayers and vows sent by sinners to heaven ; the tears and sighs of lovers ; the time lost in frivolous amusements ; plans not carried out and wishes left unfulfilled . As if to make amends for so many lost things , there is a precious mountain in this valley consisting of Good Sense ; and even in the moon that article , though not as rare as upon earth , is held in such high appreciation , that it is carefully preserved in little phials marked with the owner 's name . Astolfo finds , to his surprise , how many wise men he has known on earth have left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care , when he sees his own name , to grasp his phial and to consume the contents on the spot . Farther on he meets the Fates spinning busily on the banks of a river , and sees how each thread is ticketed with the name of the owner on earth . An active old man steals the tickets as fast as the silk is spun , and throws them into the water , where they are quickly lost . A few only are saved by two white swans , who carry them to a beautiful nymph . The latter affixes these names to the gates of the temple of Immortality , and there they remain for eternity , visible to all the dwchlefs on earth . After all these strange superstitions and crude notions , light began at last to break . The doctrine of the rotation of the earth had gained many adherents since the days of Copernicus , and the newly-invented instrumentM had enabled the human eye to penetrate into the in* mense space around us , to discover new constellations , and to discern the mountains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yenus and the satellites of Jupiter ; but the Church still ruled supreme , and forbade all theories which seemed to " make the Incarnate Word a liar . " A French writer , F. Chasles , says , with regard to the dread fear which men had iii those days of the word " heretic , " " We in our age would do no harm to our enemy by merely saying that he was a heretic . But it has not always been so . Under Louis XIY , a hero could cheat at play and remain a hero still . The eighteenth century was not so indulgent for these sins ; but to steal your neighbor 's wife was then an elegant , graceful thing . In 1793 , the man who should have spoken openly in favor of Holy Mass would have been guillofined ; a hundred years before , a word against the liturgy would have led to the funeral pile . In 1620 , , in the times of Galileo , it was heresy that was punished with death . " When the great astronomer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the sun , and of the existence of other planets besides our own , he was immediately attacked from all pulpits and by all th means of the press then in e*Astenee The first accusation was made by a Dominican monk , who opened his sermon with the punning text , " Ye men of Galilee , why stand ye gazing up into heaven ? " But Galileo had not yet been terrified , and he dared even give his opinion of the moon in the thilowing words : " Are there on the moon herbs , plants , or animals like our own ? Are there rains , winds , and thunders , as upon the earth ? I do not know , and do not believe it , and still less that there are men in the moon . But , because nothing exists there exactly like what we have , it does not follow that there should not be things there as well as here , which arise , change , and dissolve again , though different from our things , very far from our notions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a person brought up in a vast forest , amid wild beasts and birds , and without // any conception of the ocear ! , would find it impossible to believe that there should exist another world quite different from the firm land , filled with animals who , without legs and wings , still move swiftly , not only on the surface , but in the interior , and that men should live near this element and convey on it houses and goods , without any exertion of their own , swiftly and to great distances ; - as such a person , I say , could never have a correct idea of the sea , its fish , its vessels , and its fleets , so we also can have no idea of the inhabitants of that planet which is separated from us by so vast a distance . " No better description of the probable Man in the Moon could be given in our day , and nothing shows more clearly the immense superiority of Galileo 's mind , than the wise reserve with which he treated the subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wisdom , to hear the venerable old man , a few years later , declare , while kneeling before the tribunal of the Inquisition : " I , Galileo , in the seventieth year of my life , being a prisoner and on my knees before Your Eminences , and having before my eyes the Holy Gospel , which I touch with my own hands , I abjure , curse , and detest the error and the heresy of the motion of the earth " ! Condemned to lifelong imprisonment , and to the weekly recital of the seven penitential psalms , he was allowed , in the same year , to retire to his villa near Florence , but under the condition that " he should live there in solitude , invite no one to visit him , and to receive no one who might present himself . " His works were prohibited and put on the Index of forbidden books-where they still are . What Copernicus had only faintly anticipated , and Galileo , yielding to the timidity of the flesh , had failed to assert , even Kepler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ openly . The slow and painful discovery of his immortal three laws established forever the true fraternity of the earth and the other planets ; but even his views on the moon he ventured only to publish under a disguise in his famous " Dream . " Having read Bohemian hooks , he says , and among them the story of the Virgin Libussa , renowned in the records of Magic , and having at the same time spent several hours in watching the moon and the stars , it was but natural that , when sleep overcame him , he should dream of the former . He thought he was reading a book bought at the fair , which gave him the following account of the Man in the Moon : Duracoto is his name , and his coun try is Iceland , known to the ancients as Thule . His mother made him write this account after her death . He was brought up in that distant island , and on the slopes of Mount Hecla , where he was initiated in the mysteries of the magic art . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Norway , where the young man was initiated into the mysteries of astrology ; and one fine evening he went off travelling towards the North Pole , till he came in contact with the rising crescent of the moon , and explored that remarkable orb . He found it to be an island , called by a Hebrew name , Levana , and at a distance of about 250,000 miles from the earth . lie was most amused with the fact that the men in the moon looked upon their own home as immovable in the heavens , just as we do not feel the earth revolving around the sun , or its own axis . On the other hand , he found days and nights there , as here below , only of nearly equal length . The Man in the Moon , as he saw him , possessed marvellous powers . He could walk or fly or sail around his little globe in the course of a single day ; but he had to hide in deep caverns in order to protect himself from excessive heat and cold . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a single day ; but every day brings them forth anew . Occasionally a violent storm disturbs the peace which otherwise reigns forever among these sublime mountains and unfathomable gorges ; and one of these roused Kepler from his dreams before he could fully examine the inhabitants of the moon . Nor was Kepler much to be blamed // for the obscurity under which he attempted to conceal his true convictions ; for the memory of what Galileo had not been able to endure was still fresh in the minds of men , and another victim of intolerance had but just made his sufferings known to the world . This was the learned Campanella , one of the noblest martyrs of blind and cruel fanaticism , whose name , however , is but rarely mentioned by the side of his greater fellow-sufferers . Like them denying the truth of the ancient Aristotelian and scholastic philosophy , he insisted upon a plurality of worlds , and especially upon the actual existence of created beings in the moon . What he paid for his stanch adherence to truth , he tells us himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lasted forty hours . Garroted with ropes which cut into my bones , suspended , with my hands tied behind my back , over the sharp point of a post , which tore away the sixth part of ; my flesh and drew ten pounds of blood , at the end of forty hours I was utterly undone , and they were forced to pause in my torments . Some insulted me , and , to add to my sufferings , they shook the rope by which I was suspended ; but others praised my courage in an undertone . When I was at last healed , after six months , by a real miracle , they threw me into a ditch , where I was kept for a long time , accused of heresy , because I maintained that the sun and the moon changed ; contrary to Aristotle , who makes the world eternal and unchangeable . " From this fearful ditch he writes again , after having been tortured for the seventh time without succumbing : " It is now twelve years that I suffer , and pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times ; the ignorant have cursed and ill-treated me . My muscles are torn , my bones broken ; my flesh is lacerated , and my blood shed in abundance . I have been given up to the unbounded fury of men , and my food is insufficient and unwholesome . Is not that enough , 0 God , to let me hope that Thou wilt be my help in trouble ? " And yet the noble Lalian endured another torture of thirty-five hours , without allowing a word to escape him ; while Galileo recanted , and Descartes was so frightened that he hid his " Treatise on Light ' * for fear of persecution . Two great events led , during the same century , to renewed efforts to ascertain the precise nature of the Man in the Moon : the improvements in telescopes , which enabled astronomers to ascertain the very striking nature of the moon 's surface , with its mountains , valleys , and lakes , and the discovery of a new continent by Columbus . These encouraging circumstances led to the publication of quite a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's " Man in the Moon , " published in 1638 , . in London , is probably the most important . The pious Bishop of Llandaff represents a young gentleman from Seville setting out on his travels , and reaching , after many adventures among the antipodes , the island of St. Helena , where he can not get accustomed to men , because there are none . having amused himself with the taming of wild geese , which he taught to bear burdens on their broad wings and to carry their master on a simple stick through the air , he escapes , by their assistance , from a wreck , rises to the top of the Peak of Teneriffe , and then sets out on a trip of twelve days through the air . H* manages to make friends with the evil spirits hovering about in those regions , who at first try to frighten his team and to keep him from proceeding , but finally change their mind , and even furnish him with the needful provisions . At length , on a Tuesday , the tith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a high mountain . Soon a number of lunar men gathered around him ; they were twice as large as he himself , and had an olive-brown complexion and pleasing manners , but the most extraordinary costumes . They differed in rank according to their size , and thus formed three classes of men , of ten , twenty , and thirty feet height respectively . Their language was musical , and of great sweetness . Gonzales // was immediately brought before the local prince , who was subject to a higher dignitary , while finally a king raled over the whole globe . The Spaniard was much pleased with the Man in the Moon , as he appeared so far ; only one feature in their daily life troubled him sorely : the aIr around the moon exercised so little pressure on its surface , that , when a man jumped for joy or for fright , he reached instantly a height of some fifty feet , and could not come down again , being there beyond the sphere of attraction . His friends had to go to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feature which struck him at first unpleasantly , was the length of the lunar days and nights , which lasted each a fortnight . The Man in the Moon , moreover , slept soundly during this long day , unable as he was to endure the unbroken brilliancy of the sun . He awoke only when the earth rose to light his globe during the long night . Fortunately , he was virtuous , knowing neither theft nor falsehood nor murder ; and , after a long , happy life , he dried up and disappenred , to the sincere delight of his friends , leaving his body to his family , who kept their ancestors forever with them . The Spaniard , however , soon became homesick , and , as three of his geese had already died , he took leave of the king , who made him many curious presents , and flew off in the presence of an immense crowd of spectators . This rather amusing than instructive account of the Man in the Moon was soon after followed by a much more serious work , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " by Bishop Wilkins  --  a book which obtained the rare distinction of being translated into French and German during the lifetime of the author . While Godwin contented himself with writing a romance in which no regard was had to science or even to probability , Wilkins , on the contrary , treats the question from a scientific and religious point of view . He is , however , as it was natural at his time ( 1640 ) , still very careful not to offend the Church or the orthodox believer , and naIvely expresses a hope that , if his views on a plurality of worlds and the motion of the earth should be occasionally erroneous , the learned will pardon him as readily as the ignorant will have overlooked the mistake . This book , especially valuable as manifesting a remarkable mind , free of superstition , and yet cautious in the extreme , treats the question of the Man in the Moon at full length . He firmly believes that the moon must be inhabited by intelligent beings , as God would surely not have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if he had not also filled it with persons able to enjoy these advantages . lie does not believe however , that they are men like ourselves , but different in nature , proportions , and endowments . Perhaps , he says , they are an intermediate class of beings between ourselves and the angels ; for the interval between these two is too great not to contain creatures of which , as yet , we have no knowledge ; and God , no doubt , has made them of all kinds , to glorify Himself mere fully in the works of His omnipotence and wisdom . The good Bishop is naturally somewhat troubled by the difficulty of communicating with the moon , but he hopes confidently that the spirit of discovery , which even in his day had produced wonders already , will add more and more , till the way to the distant planet will be as open as the path across the great oceans . As we smile at the blindness of our ancestors , he remarks with admirable candor , so posterity will no doubt smile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who for ages fancied themselves to be the only inhabitants of this globe , and thought it impossible to cross the sea that separated them from other continents . This is exactly our case , he continues ; we know as little of the Man in the Moon as these early Irish knew of their neighbors in France , and as little of the means of reaching his dwelling-place as they knew of sails and ships . He regrets that there is no Drake and no Columbus to // PUTNAM 'S MAGAZINE . undertake the perilous voyage to the moon ; nor even a D*edalus to invent a way through the air . Kepler 's boast , that , as soon as the art of flying should be invented , one of his countrymen would be the first to lead a colony to that other world , does not appear to him by any means presumptuous . He thinks of all the necessary precautions . As there are no real castles in the air , the question of food becomes very important , especially since he can not believe , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the spheres will be sufficient nourishment for the a*6rial traveller . How would it do to follow the example of Democritus , and to live for several days on the odor of hot bread ? or , better still , to sleep , after the manner of hybernating animals , during the whole trip ? He suggests a mechanism like the wings of birds , or the possibility of mounting on the back of colossal birds such as he has heard exist in Madagascar ; or , finally , the building of a flying-machine - such as we are building in our day . With charming modesty and great candor he concludes his chapter on the Man in the Moon with the words : " As for me , I dare assert nothing about these Selenites ; but I believe that the coming ages will discovcr more about them . " Among the most fanciful of all the voyages to the moon must be counted the rare work of Cyrano de Bergerac , published in 1649 . " The moon was full , " he says , " the sky clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a good bowl presented to us by a friend near Paris , we fell to talking about the moon , which filled our eyes with its rays . One of us declared it was an opening in the heavens ; another assured us it was the press on which Diana dried Apollo 's neckhandkerchief ; and a third thought it might be the sun himself , who had laid asida his rays and was looking through a hole to see what the world was doing when he was not there ; and I-I said , I do not care to tickle time with such absurdities in order to make it pass more swiftly ; I believe the moon to be a world like our own . ' They laughed at me . Well , ' said 1 , perhaps they are laughing just now in the moon also at somebody who thinks the earth is inhabited , and a world like the moon ' " It seems that this accident led the merry Frenchman to speculate long enough on the true nature of the moon to invent at last , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to our satellite . There he met the Man in the Moon . " After half a mile 's walk I met two large animals , one of which stopped before me , while the other ran away quickly . He returned , however , shortly , with seven or eight hundred others , who surrounded inc on all sides . When I saw them more distinctly , I found that they had the same form and size as we have . From time to time they raised most terrible howls , excited no doubt by their admiration for my beauty , till I thought II had become a beast myself . At last one of these beast-men took me by the side and threw me on his back , as a wolf seizes and carries away a lamb ; and now I saw that , men though they were , they walked on all-fours . " He was handed over to a menagerie-keeper* who taught him to make faces , to throw somersets , and to amuse the public . Fortunately , he fell in with the demon of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shape of a young man in the moon , and who now taught him to become a philosopher . Two things struck him as most strange in lunar life . One was , that , when he wanted to dine , they showed him into a large dining-room , which was perfectly bare and unfurnished . When he had been stripped of all his clothing , he ordered some soup , and at once the rich fragrance of a superb soup rose to his nostrils . He was on the point of running to the place where he thought the tempting dish was waiting for him , when the waiter stopped him , and informed him that the Man in the Moon did not , like earth-born beings , feed on coarse meats and herbs , but only inhaled the concentrated fragrance of a number 474 // of dishes . His room was then lighted up with bottled rays of the sun , that had been carefully purged of their heat , and his bed proved to be a couch formed of roses . The other remarkable feature was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time of the day . When Cyrano asked a passer-by in the street what time it was , the latter , for all answer , opened his mouth , closed his teeth , and turned his face upside down . He learned at last that they made of their teeth a correct dial , so that , when they opened their lips , the shadow of the nose fell upon the precise tooth which showed the hour of the day . The most learned writer on the subject , on the other hand , is no doubt the French savant Gassendi , who examined the question very thoroughly after having compared the views of all his predecessors . That the stars are themselves animated beings , as the ancients believed ; or that they are deities , as others dared assert ; or , finally , that each sphere is governed by a special guardian angel-all these theories he rejects as idle conjectures , the result of vague speculation . That , on the other hand , spirits or demons , of unknown form and nature , may live in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he thinks not impossible . He admits that , to inquire into the fitness of the moon to be the home of beings like ourselves , is a legitimate question , and quotes , in support of this view , the long series of ancient and medieval authors who have written on this subject . The Man in the Moon , however , he thinks , must necessarily be so small as to escape all possible discovery by our imperfect instruments , and thus the diserect author abandons the investigation . From that time forward the Man in the Moon became a favorite topic with churchmen and laymen , from Baxter to Chalmers and from Fontenelle to Descartes . We can find room here only for two visitors which he received from among men , the one in a vision , the other in pure imagination . The former visit was paid by the Swedish enthusi ast , Swedenborg , who gravely assures his readers and followers that he went to the moon on the 22d of September , 1748 , and saw and heard what he 1 ) roceeds to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole universe to be an immense human body , the several parts of which were represented by the different sphere* . Mercury , for instance , represented the memory of immaterial things , and Venus the memory of material things . This is one of the great arcana revealed to him by the angelic spirits . He saw , of course , the Man in the Moon also . His voice came from the abdomen , and resembled distant thunder ; the lunar air , being different from ours , had to be forcibly compressed , hence the violence of its eruption . He represents in the Greatest-Man the scutiform cartilage to which the ribs are attached ! Otherwise he learned to know him only spiritually ; and as beyond his New Jerusalem the pious seer remains incomprehensible to all who are not equally favored with direct inspiration from on high , he does not add much to our knowledge of the other worlds . The other visitor was no less a perso*age than an " American from New York , " under the guise of Sir John 11crschel , Astronomer-Royal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty-four feet in diameter , he had , in 1835 , discovered a number of strange plants in the moon , then mineral structures , buffaloes and unicorns , pelicans and amphibious creatures of marvellous shape . At last , one fine day , four bands of winged beings were seen to come out of a forest , looking very much like gigantic bats . Here was , at last , the veritable Man in the Moon . He was small , barely four feet high , covered all over with long copper-colored hair , except in the face , and endowed with wings consisting of most delicate membranes , which hung comfortably over the back from the shoulders to the calves . The face , of a yellowish hue , resembled that of the orang-outang . The account was so graphically written , the details so minute and so plausible , // and the absence of Sir John Herschel at the Cape of Good Hope so favorable to the hoax , that thousands were taken in , and the pamphlet created a great sensation all over the world . Countless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the original drawings were to be seen in all the shopwindows , and , for a few months at least , very lively and amusing discussions were carried on concerning the genuineness of the discovery . The great astronomer was perhaps the last person to become aware of the liberty which had been taken with his name , and is *aid to have been not a little amused by the controversy that followed . It was about the same time that , With a heart of furious fancies , Whereof 1 am commander , With a burning spear and a horse of air , To the moon wandered Hans Pfaall of Rotterdam , under the guidance of our own Poe , and , in a manner far more ingenious than the above-mentioned moonhoax of Mr. Locke , related what he had seen there of lunar topography , and of the Man in the Moon . And what , we may well ask , after all these visions , fancies , and hoaxes , wl*t is the truth about the Man in the Moon ? Does he exist at all ? We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our estimate , the greater becomes the importance of other heavenly bodies . As long as the earth was placed , by the vanity of man , in the centre of the universe , and looked upon as the most important orb in creation , the question how far the little , aged moon might be inhabited , was of little importance . But since astronomy has taught us beyond all doubt that our earth constitutes but a very se*ondary feature among the planets , being neither the largest nor the smallest , the nearest nor the most remote , the warmest nor the coldest , and since we find it yet teeming with life and blessed with a special incarnation of the Most High , we can not but suppose that life , and life similar to our own , must exist in other planets also . We can no longer presume that those magnificent worlds which we see revolving around our sun , and other suns , should not have been endowed by the Creator at least as highly as our little earth ; nor can we flatter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best possible of worlds . The objections raised against the theory of another race of created beings somewhat like ourselves , living on our satellite , lose every year in weight and importance . Even the absence of an atmosphere around the moon has recently become doubtful , since the famous Italian astronomer , Father Secehi , has discovered a slight atmosphere , through which the peaks of high lunar mountains are seen to penetrate . Doubtless many generations will yet pass away before the inhabitants of our own mother-earth will have positive proofs of the existence of a living Man in the Moon , but the extreme probability of the fact is established beyond all doubt . Actual sight by means of improved instruments , well-ascertained scientific data , and sound philosophical reasoning , all point to the one great fact , that the heavenly bodies may be inhabited , and probably are the abodes of intelligence more or less developed ; so that there is no violence done to reason or faith in supposing the actual existence of a Man in the Moon .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
