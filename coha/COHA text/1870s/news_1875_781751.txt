txt The recent exchange of diplomatic notes between Berlin and Brussels has once more brought Belgium prominently before the public . Some interests of a general character , bound up with the independence of that State , entitle it to a special share of attention . The establishment of the Kingdom of Netherlands ; comprising the Provinces which now form the Kingdoms of Belgium and Holland , was a well-devised measure of the Congress of Vienna . Had them been sufficient homogeneity between the several parts of the Kingdom and among its people , it would have been one of the richest and best-balanced States in Europe . It , however , lasted only fifteen years . Differences in character , manners , language , and religion foreshadowed , at an early hour , the separation which took place in 18M . Of that troubled and not unfruitful period , Belgium is the most meritorious product . It occupies in the political world a larger place than might be inferred : from its geographical area . This is comparatively small ; but its population is much the densest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ derived from two distinct stocks , into one single , wellunited nation , is a community of religious faith and political interests . Belgium has developed and gained consistency and strength under parliamentary and constitutional rule . It has given the world one of the best lessons in the practice of judicious freedom . " All the liberties inwribed in the national covenant , " said King LI:ovoid ) in 1850 , " are practiced without reitraint , and the finest encomium that can be passed on the Belgian people is that they ; bowed themselves worthy of their Consti:talon . " The experience of the last twenty ? ears corroborates this judgment . The Belgian Constitution provides for complete : eparation of Church and State , unfettered iiberty of conscience , unlimited right of assoAation and meeting , perfect freedom of eduint hen , speech , and press ; and these liberties , is the Minister of Foreign Affairs recently : aid in his answer to the German note of lount PEriPoscimn , guaranteed by the : : onstitntion , far from being a cause of weakness to the Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an influence a thousand times more welcome and efficient than the operation of restrictive laws could possibly be . Belgium was set up as a neutral State when a certain political equilibrium and public right prevailed in Europe . While this balance of power was in existence , it was a safeguard for Belgium . The undermrrent of Napoleonic ambition , if really N-er directed against Belgium , was not to be feared then . But the position is much changed to-day . The bulwark behind which public right in Europe was considiired secure , has crumbled . A new power bas sprung up , not more scrupulous than the Xapolconic empire , and even more dangerous to the liberty of other powers . No doubt it does not yet think of annexing Belgium , but its recent intrigues show the tendency of German autocracy . Guarantees are demanded , and Belgium is desired to join the blockade planned in Berlin against Franco and the Roman Catholic Church . These pretensions must , sound alarming to a land which has really no strength but what it derives from the principle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ menacing discussion on the part of German journalists . They assert that every neutral State , in case of war , ought to be able to defend its neutrality against either of the belligerents . Every neutral State should therefore undergo , in order to secure its neutrality , the same sacrifices which other States are making to-day in order to keep up their military situation . In that case neutrality is a mere empty word . No benefit accrues from it . The immunity which neutrals are supposed to enjoy is a fiction , and they are , moreover , subject to the dangerous obligation not to contract any alliance , which might at least secure to them the protection of one of the great powers . A Deputy of the Belgian Parliament sees a means of remedying this evil in disarming . Ile thinks that a neutral State should not be compelled to defend its neutrality against the first belligerent who , under some pretext , or vrithout any , deems it expedient to invade its territory . Ho asks that Belgium shall be exempted from the necessity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military organization . An international declaration should expressly forbid belligerents to violate the frontiers and . territory of neutrals . At the same time , the Belgians claim to be independent at home . Their independence they understand somewhat differently from the Statesman who seems to aim at the dictatorship of Europe . Tho remonstrances made by him on account of certain episcopal letters , and of the Duchesne affair , have created alarm , and not without cause . Something more was at stake than the passing interest of an ordinary incident , and Belgium improved the occasion to define its position and rights in a manner as peremptory . as it was dignified and moder-ate . The Belgians do not mean to be placed by their neutrality under the tutelage of any other power . They are independent , mid their independence has been guaranteed by Europe . It is not likely that Europe , in which England and Russia act to-day as moderators , will ever forget what is duo to Belgium and the other neutral powers .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
