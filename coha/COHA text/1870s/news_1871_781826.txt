txt We can not help hoping that some good result - will come out of " the scrub race " for the Fenian exiles , which has been already described in our columns , and which has , owing to the self-respect and good sense of the exiles themselves , ended in such a remarkable and amusing failure . There are among these exiles several men of education , and , we presume , in spite of their blunders , a good many men of intelligence . Considering what - they have gone through . it would . be absurd as well as cruel to accuse them of self-seeking . They have periled everything in a desperate and foolish game , to be sure , but then men who peril everything in any kind of game , have , at least , one tolerably solid claim to confidence , if not to respect . We can not help feeling , therefore , that it may not be out of place , or ineffectual , to appeal to these new corners , who are likely to be men of influence among their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body of Irishmen are playing in the government of this City . What manner of men the politicians are under whose guidance they act , and of what manner of devices they are capable in order to retain their power , the exiles may form some idea from " the scrubrace " aforesaid . But if they will look into the condition of this City , they will find a state of things which , for badness , has perhaps no parallel in any civilized country , and what is worse , they will find that poor Irishmen are made largely instrumental in keeping it up . Now is it not possible for influential Irishmen , who have proved their courage and disinterestedness in ways not to be mistaken , to do something in aid . of reform in New-York , by leading away their ignorant countrymen from the support and . alliance of the shameless and . audacious plunderers who have made the Municipal Government a by-word , and who , without the aid of Irishmen , it must be frankly said , could . not keep their system in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their recent political history to which we would ask the serious and candid attention of thoughtful Irishmen . The condition of Ireland , under English rule has , for a century , excited the sympathy of the civilized world . The " Irish patriot " was , in the latter part of the last century and . in the beginning of this , an object of interest and admiration wherever he went . The cause of Ireland , too , commanded respect everywhere . Within the last thirty years there has been a great change , however , in foreign sentiment about Irish politics and politicians , and nowhere more than here ; and it has been due , in the main , to observation of the part played by Irishmen in the politics of other countries .. People have been , in the first place , deeply and painfully impressed by the fact that Irish liberals have never shown the least disposition to sympathize or act with the liberals of other countries , or to take an active part in the general work of modern reform . Once placed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than assailEngland , the Irish politician has almost invariably ranged . himself on the side of conservatism and reaction . The Irish emigrants to the Continent during the eighteenth century became , in . France , Germany and Spain , the firmest supporters of absolutism . Half a million of them , nearly , entered the French service during that century , and . though they were all victims of civil and religious tyrany , not a particle of liberalizing influence do they ever appear to have exercised on Continental policies , and not one word of protest against any of the monarchical or sacerdotal excesses by which the century was disgraced is it possible to trace to the pen of an Irish exile . During the present century the tide of Irish emigration has flowed freely to this country , which it found entering on the great struggle against slavery . From O'CONNELL , at home , the Anti-Slavery Party received some eloquent words of encouragement , but we believe we are safe in saying that the hundreds of thousands of Irish voters who reached these shores during the fifteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pro-slavery banners . What is also remarkble , and has done as much to bring odium on Irish politicians as anything , is the fact that the Continental liberals never received from them one expression of sympathy during the great contest with kingcraft and priestcraft in behalf of national unity and civil and religious freedom , which begun in 1820 , and is only ending in the present year . Whatever was said by Irish agitators on Continental polities was said for the Kaiser and the Pope , and ail Irish legion was very enthusiastically raised in 1859 to help to keep Italians out of their own capital , and subject to a despotism . compared to which that under which Ireland groaned , even iu the days of the penal laws , was respectable . The fact of which we most complain is , however , that the exiles of 1818 , who settled in this country , not only weutinto the ranks of the Pro-slavery Democracy , but such of them as settled in this City gradually affiliated with the Ring , and some of them are now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and help to keep their poor and ignorant countrymen obedient to its orders . When we say that all this has truly distressed . and scandalized the friends of freedom and progress all over the world , we characterize it very mildly . Those who see this City plundered and disgraced as it is , who see ruffians on its judicial bench , and thieves in charge of its treasury , and knaves growing rich in every one of its departments , and know that this could . not go on , and never could have corns I9PAEla llad tk0 laottor class of Irish I exiles remaingd true to  --  their preachings and singings in Dublin and . Cork , ? would probably like to use far stronger language about it . When we say , however , that the most effective argument against Irish independence , at least in the eyes of all foreigners , Amerivans included , is furnished by the Governin-env of tins City , we probably say what Irish . will consider are seriously than any reflections on the condition of NewYork . All that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and not for the ' sake of reproach , but in the hope that it may lead the gentlemen who have just reached tifel3e shores from English prisons to weighwell every step they take in entering the ' arena of American politics . They have claimson the ? confidence and affection of their poor countrymen , such as few other men have ; if they would . only use their influence rightly , we believe they might not only do much to , redeem this City , but to elevate and promote the Irish pause in the opinion of the civilized world . They must see that against Great ? Britain they are powerless with the sword. - The spectacle , too , of Irish corruption , and turbulence , and want of political sagacity here furnishes the English enemies of Ireland with the only weapon they ever can or dare use in debate ; and we verily believe that the spectacle of good government in NewYork , set up and maintained by Irish influence , would cause the Irish question to enter on a new and startling , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
