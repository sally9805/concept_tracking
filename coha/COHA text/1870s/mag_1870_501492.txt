txt THOSE among us who are not too young to have had " Evenings at Home " for a schoolday companion and instructor will remember the story*alled " Eyes and No Eyes " and its moral . They will remember that , of the two little boys who accomplished precisely the same walk at the same time , one saw all manner of delightful and wonderful things , while the other saw nothing whatever that was worth recollection or description . The former had eyes prepared to see , and the other had not ; and that made all the difference . I have to confess that , during a recent visit to Salt Lake City  --  a visit lasting nearly as many days as that out of which my friend , Hepworth Dixon , made the better part of a volume-I must have been in the condition of the dull little reprobate who had no eyes to see the wonders which delighted his companion . For , so far as the city itself ; its streets and its structures , are concerned , I really saw nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one or two tolerably decent streets , wherein a few handsome stores are mixed up with old shanties , is not much to see in any part of the civilized world . Other travellers have seen a wondrous sight on the very same spot . They have seen a large and beautiful city , with spacious , splendid streets , shaded by majestic trees and watered by silvery currents flowing in marble channels ; they have seen a city combining the cleanliness and activity of young America with the picturesqueness and dignity of the Orient ; a city which would be beautiful and wonderful anywhere , but which , raised up here on the bare bosom of the desert , is a phenomenon of apparently almost magical creation . Naturally , therefore , they have gone into raptures over the energy , and industry , and *stheticism of the Mormons ; and , even while condemning sternly the doctrine and practice of polygamy , they have nevertheless been haunted by an uneasy doubt as to whether , after all , there is not some peculiar virtue in the having half a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * a builder of cities . Otherwise how comes this beautiful and perfect city , here on the unfriendly and unsheltering waste ? Well* I saw no beautiful and wonderful city , although I spent several days in the Mormon capital , and tramped every one of its streets , and lanes , and roads , scores of times over . Where others beheld the glorious virgin , Dulcinea del Toboso , radiant in beauty and bedight with queenly apparel , I saw only the homely milkmaid , with her red elbows and her russet gown . In plain words , the Mormon city appeared to me just a commonplace little country town , and no more . I saw in it no evidences of preternatural energy or skill . It has one decent street , wherein may be found , at most , half a dozen well-built and attractivelooking shops . It has a good many comfortable residences in the environs . It has two or three decentish hotels , like the hotels of any other fiftieth-class country town . It has the huge Tabernacle , a gigantic barn merely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space  --  a thing in shape " very like a land turtle , " as President George L. Smith , First Councillor of Brigham Young , observed to me . Salt Lake City has no lighting and no draining , except such draining as is done by the little runnels of water to be found in every street , and which remind one faintly and sadly of dear , quaint old Berne in Switzerland . At night you have to trudge along in the darkness and the mud , or slush , or dust , and it is a perilous quest the seeking of your way home , for at every crossing you must look or feel for the plank which bridges over the artificial brooklets already described , // or you plunge helpless and hopeless into the little torrent . Decidedly , a " onehorse " place , in my estimation ; I do n't see how men endowed with average heads and arms could for twenty years have been occupied in the building of a city , and produced anything less creditable than this . I do not wonder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ residents talk of the beauty of their city and the wonderful things they have accomplished , when Gentile travellers of credit and distinction have glorified this shabby , swampy , ricketty , common-place , vulgar , little hamlet into a town of sweetness and light , of symmetry and beauty . For my part , and for those who were with me , I can only say that we spent the first day or so in perpetual wonder as to whether this really could be the Mormon city of which we had read so many bewildering and glorious descriptions . And the theatre-oh , Hepworth Dixon , I like you much , and I think you are often abused and assailed most unjustly ; but how could you write so about that theatre ? Or was the beautiful temple of the drama which you saw here deliberately taken down , and did they raise is its place the big , gaunt , ugly , dirty , dismal structure which I saw , and in which I and my companions made part of a dreary dozen or two of audience , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I observe that , when driven to bay by sceptical inquiry , complacent Mormons generally fall back on the abundance of shade-trees in the streets . Let them have the full credit of this plantation . They have put trees in the streets , and the trees have grown ; and , when we observe to a Mormon that we have seen rows of trees similarly growing in even smaller towns of the benighted European continent , he evidently thinks it is our monogamic perversity and prejudice which force us to deny the wondrous works of Mormonism . Making due allowance for every natural difficulty , remembering how nearly every implement , and utensil , and scrap of raw material had to be brought from across yonder rampart of mountains , and from hundreds of miles away , I yet fail to see.anything very remarkable about this little Mormon town . Perhaps no other set of people could have made much more of the place ; I can not help thinking that no other set of people who were not Digger Indians could have made much less . In fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lake City , one never ought to have entered the town at all . We ought to have remained on this hillside , from which you can look across that most lovely of all valleys on earth , cinctured as it is by a perfect girdle of moun.tains , the outlines of which are peerless and ineffable in their symmetry and beauty . The air is as clear , the skies are as blue , the grass as green as the dream of a poet or painter could show him . There below , fringed and mantled in the clustering green of its trees , you see the city , with the long , low , rounded dome or back of the Tabernacle rising broad and conspicuous . Looking down , you may well believe that the city thus exquisitely placed , thus deliciously shaded and surrounded , is itself a wonder of picturesqueness and symmetry . Why go down into the two or three dirty , irregular , shabby little streets , with their dust or mud for road pavement , their nozzling pigs trotting along the sidewalks , their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commonplace , mean and disheartening aspect everywhere ? But then we did go down  --  and where others had seen a fair and goodly , aye , and queenly city , we saw a muddy , uninteresting , straggling little village , disfiguring the lovely plain on which it stood . Profound disappointment , then , is my first sensation in Salt Lake City . The place is so like any other place Certainly , one receives a bracing little shock every now and then , which admonishes him that , despite the small , shabby stores , // and the pigs , and the dunghills , he is not in the regions of merely commonplace dirt . For instance , we learn that the proprietor of the hotel where we are staying has four wives ; and it is something odd to talk with a civil , respectable , burgess-like man , dressed in ordinary coat and pantaloons , and wearing mutto n-chop whiskers  --  a sort of man who in England would probably be a church-wardenand who has more consorts than an average Turk . Then again it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - ? " and when I say " No , I do n't , " to be told , " Oh , you ought to know him . He came from England , and he has lately married two such nice English girls ! " One morning , too , we have another kind of shock . There is a pretty little chambermaid in our hotel , a new-coiner apparently , and she happens to find out that my wife and I had lived for many years in that part of the North of England from which she comes herself ; whereupon she bursts into a perfect passion and tempest of tears , declares that she would rather be in her grave than in Salt Lake City , that she was deceived into coming , that the Mormonism sl* heard preached by the Mormon propaganda in England was a quite different thing from the Mormonism practised here , and that her only longing was to get out of the place , anyhow , forever . The girl seemed to be perfectly , passionately sincere . What could be done for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in coming out ; and she seemed to be strongly under the conviction that , even if she had money , she could not get away . An influence was evidently over her which she had not the courage or strength of mind to attempt to resist , or even to elude . Doubtless , as she was a very pretty girl , she would be very soon sealed to some ruling elder . She said her sister had come with her , but the sister was in another part of the city , and since their arrival-only a few days , however-they had not met . My wife endeavored to console or encourage her , but the girl could only sob and protest that she never could learn to endure the place , but that she could not get away , and that she would rather be in her grave . We spoke of this case to one of the civil officers of the United States stationed in the city , and he shook his head and thought nothing could be done . The influence which enslaved this poor girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which worked upon her senses and her superstitions . I should think an underground railway would be a valuable institution to establish in connection with the Mormon city . I well remember that when I lived in Liverpool , some ten or a dozen years ago , the Mormon propaganda , very active there , always kept the polygamy institution modestly in the background . Proselytes were courted and won by descriptions of a new Happy Valley , of a City of the Blest , where eternal summer shone , where the fruits were always ripe , where the earth smiled with a perpetual harvest , where labor and reward were plenty for all , and where the outworn toilers of Western Europe could rene*v their youth like the eagles . I remember , too , the remarkable case of a Liverpool family having a large business establishment in the most fashionable street of the great town , who were actually beguiled into selling off all their goods and property and migrating , parents , sons , and daughters , to the land of promise beyond the American wilderness , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folly , they all came back , humiliated , disgusted , cured . They had money and something like education , and they were a whole family , and so they were able , when they found themselves deceived , to effect a rapid retreat at the cost of nothing worse than disappointment and pecuniary loss . But for the poor , pretty serving-lass from Lancashire I do not know that there is much hope . Poverty and timidity and superstitious weakness will help to lock the Mormon chains around her . Perhaps she will // get used to the place in time . Ought one to wish that she may  --  or rather to echo her own prayer , and petition that she may find an early grave ? The graveyards are densely planted with tombs here in this sacred city of Mormonism . The place is unspeakably dreary . Hardly any women are ever seen in the streets , except on the Sunday , when all the families pour in to service in the huge Tabernacle . Most of the dwelling houses round the city are pent in behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their dismal little sucursales , one or two or more , built on to the sides  --  and in each of these additions or wings to the original building a different wife and family are caged . There are no flower gardens anywhere . Children are bawling everywhere . Sometimes a wretched , slatternly , dispirited woman is seen lounging at the door or hanging over the gate of a house with a baby at her breast . More often , however , the house , or clump of houses , gives no external sign of life . It stands back gloomy in the sullen shade of its thick fruit trees , and might seem untenanted if one did not hear the incessant yelling of the children . We saw the women in hundreds , probably in thousands , at the Tabernacle on the Sunday  --  and what women they vere ! Such faces , so dispirited , depressed , shapeless , hopeless , soulless faces ! No trace of woman 's graceful pride and neatness in these slatternly , shabby , slouching , listless figures ; no purple light of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes . I protest that only in some of the crc/in villages of the Swiss mountains have I seen creatures'in female form so dull , miserable , moping , hopeless as the vast majority of these Mormon women . As we leave the Tabernacle , andwalk slowly down the street amid the crowd , we see two prettily-dressed , lively-looking girls , who laugh with each other and are seemingly happy , and we thank Heaven that there are at least two merry , spirited girls in Salt Lake City . A few days after we meet our blithesome pair at Mmtah station ; and they are travelling with their father and mother on to San Francisco , whither we too are going  --  and we learn that they are not Mormons , but Gentiles-pleasant lasses from Philadelphia who had come with their parents to have a passing look at the externals of Mormonism . My object , however , in writing this paper was to speak of the chief , Brigham Young himself , rather than of his city or his system . We saw Brigham Young , were admitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benediction . The interview took place in the now famous house with the white walls and the gilded beehive on the top . We were received in a kind of office or parlor , hung round with oil paintings of the kind which in England we regard as " furniture , " and which represented all the great captains and elders of Mormonism . Joseph Smith is there , and Brigham Young , and George L. Smith , now First Councillor ; and various others whom to enumerate would be long , even if I knew or remembered their names . President Young was engaged just at the moment when we came , but his Secretary , a Scotchman , I think , and Pre*ident George L. Smith , are very civil and cordial . George L. Smith is a huge , burly man , with a Friar Tuck joviality of paunch and visage , and a roll in his bright eye which , in some odd , undefined sort of way , suggests cakes and ale . He talks well , in a deep rolling voice , and with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who irreverently hut accurately likens the Tabernacle to a landturtle . He speaks with immense admiration and reverence of Brigham Young , and specially commends his abstemiousness and hermit-like frugality in the matter of eating and drinking . Presently a door opens , and the oddest , most whimsical figure I have ever seen off the boards of an English country theatre stands in the room ; and in a moment we are presented formally to Brigham Young . 12 // FEB . There must be something of impressiveness and dignity about the man , for , odd as is his appearance and make up , one feels no inclination to laugh . But such a figure ! Brigham Young wears a long-tailed. high-collared coat ; the swallow-tails nearly touch the ground ; the collar is about his ears . In shape the garment is like the swallow-tail coats which negro-melodists sometimes wear , or like the dandy English dress coat one can still see in prints in some of the shops of St. James street , London . But the material of Brigham 's coat is some kincVof rough , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brass buttons . The vest and trowsers are of the same material . Round the neck of the patriarch is some kind of bright crimson shawl , and on the patriarch 's feet are natty little boots of the shiniest polished leather . I must say that the gray frieze coat of antique and wonderful construction , the gaudy crimson shawl , and the dandy boots make up an incongruous whole which irresistibly reminds one at first of the holiday get-up of some African King who adds to a great coat , preserved as an heirloom since Mungo Park 's day , a pair of modern top-boots , and a lady 's bonnet . The whole appearance of the patriarch , when one has got over the African monarch impression , is like that of a Suffolk farmer as presented on the boards of a Surrey theatre . But there is decidedly an amount of composure and even of dignity'about Brigham Young which soon makes one forget the mere ludicrousness of the patriarch 's external appearance . Young is a handsome man-much handsorfter than his portrait on the wall would show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as clear an eye and as bright a complexion as if he were a hale English farmer of fifty-five . But there is something fox-like and cunning lurking under the superficial good-nature and kindliness of the face . He seems , when he speaks to you most effusively and plausibly , to be quietly studying your expression to see whether he is reallytalking you over or not . The expression of his face , especially of his eyes , strangely and provokingly reminds me of Kossuth . I think I have seen Kossuth thus watch the face of a listener to see whether or not the listener was conquered by his wonderful power of talk . Kossuth 's face , apart from its intellectual qualities , appeared to me to express a strange blending of vanity , craft , and weakness ; and Brigham Young 's countenance now seems to show just such a mixture of qualities . Great force of character the man must surely have ; great force of character Kossuth , too , had ; but the face of neither man seemed to declare the possession of such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a man of great ability ; but rather as a man of great plausibility . I can at once understand how such a man , with such an eye and tongue , can easily exert an immense influence over women . Beyond doubt he is a man of genius ; but his genius does not reveal itself to me at least , in his face or his words . He speaks in a thin , clear , almost shrill tone , and with much apparent bonhomie . After a little commonplace conversation about the city , its improvements , approaches etc. , the Prophet voluntarily goes on to speak of himself his system , and his calumniators . His talk soon flows into a kind of monologue , and is indeed a curious rhapsody of religion , sentimentality , shrewdness and egotism . Sometimes sev*eral sentences succeed each other in which his hearers hardly seem to make out any meaning whatever , and Brigham Young appears a grotesque kind of Coleridge . Then again in a moment comes up a shrewd meaning very distinctly expressed , and with a dash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the rhapsody of unctuous words . The purport of the whole is that Brigham Young has been misunderstood , misprized , and calumniated , even as Christ was ; that were Christ to come up to-morrow in New York // or London He would be rnisundertsood , misprized , and caluminated , even as Brigham Young now is ; and that Brigham Young is not to be dismayed though the stars in their courses should fight against him . He protests with especial emphasis and at the same time especial meekness , with eyes half closed and delicatelymodulated voice , against the false reports that any manner of force or influence whatever is , or ever was , exercised to keep men or women in Salt Lake City against their will . He appeals to the evidence of our own eyes , and asks us whether we have not seen for ourselves that the city is free to all to come and go as they will . At this time we had not heard the story told by the poor little maid at the hotel ; but in any case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prove that travellers like ourselves were free to enter and depart . We have , however , little occasion to trouble ourselves about answering ; for the Prophet keeps the talk pretty well all to himself . His manner is certainly not that of a man of culture , but it has a good deal of the quiet grace and self-possession of what we call a gentleman . There is nothing prononcd or vulgar about him . Even when he is most rhapsodical his speech never loses its ease and gentleness of tone . He is bland , benevolent , sometimes quietly pathetic in manner . He poses himself en vic/ime , but with ihe air of one who does this regretfully and only from a disinterested sense of duty . I begin very soon to find that there is no need of my troubling myself much to keep up the conversation ; that my business is that of a listener ; that the Prophet conceives himself to be addressing some portion of the English or American press through my humble medium . So I listen and my companion listens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declare and acknowledge that we are fast drifting into a hazy mental condition by virtue of which we begin to regard the Mormon President as a victim of cruel persecution , a suffering martyr and an injured angel ! Time , surely , that the interview should come to a close . We tear ourselves away , and the Prophet dismisses us with a fervent and effusive blessing . " Good-bye-do well , mean well , pray always . Christ be with you , God be with you , God bless you . " All this , and a great deal more to the same effect , was uttered with no vulgar , maw-worm Lemonstrativeness of tone or gesture , no nasal twang , no uplifted hands ; but quietly , earnestly , as if it came unaffectedly from the heart of the speaker . We took leave of Brigham Young , and came away a little puzzled as to whether we had been conversing with an impostor or a fanatic , a Peter the Hermit or a Tartuffe . One thing , however , is clear to me . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I know now how Tartuffe ought to be played so as to render the part more effective and more apparently natural and lifelike than I have ever seen it on French or English stage . No one can doubt the sincerity of the homage which the Mormons in general pay to Brigham Young . One man , of the working class , apparently , with whom I talked at the gate of the Tabernacle , spoke almost with tears in his eyes of the condescension the Prophet always manifested . My informant told me that he was at one time disabled by some hurt o1 ailment ; and , the first day that he was able to come into the street again , President Young happened to be passing in his carriage , and caught sight of the convalescent . " He stopped his carriage , sir , called me over to him , addressed me by my name , shook hands with me , asked me how I was getting on , and said he was glad to see me out again . " The poor man was as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the Little Corporal had recognized him and called him by his name . There is no flattery which the great can offer to the humble like this way of addressing the man by his right name , and thus proving that the identity of the small creature // has lived clearly in the memory of the great being . Many a renowned commander has endeared himself to the soldiers whom he regarded and treated only as the instruments of his business , by the mere fact that he took care to remember men 's names . They would gladly die for one who could be so nobly gracious2 and could thus prove that they were regarded by him as worthy to occupy each a distinct place in his busy mind . The niggardliness and selfishness of John , Duke of Marlborough , the savage recklessness of Claverhouse , were easily forgotten by the poor private soldiers whom each commander made it his business , when occasion required , to address correctly by their appropriate names of Tom , Dick , or Harry . Lord Palmerston governed the House of Commons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came into contact , by just such little arts or courtesies as this . In one of Messrs . Erckmann and Chatrian 's novels we read of a soldier who declares himself ready to go to the death for Marshal Ney because the Marshal , who originally belonged to tile same district as himself , had just recognized his fellow-countryman and called him by his name . But the hero of the novel is somewhat grim and sarcastic , and he thinks it was not so wonderful a condescension that Ney should have recognized an old comrade and called him by his name . Perhaps the hero of the tale had not himself received any such recognition from Ney-perhaps if it had been vouchsafed to him he , too , would have been ready to go to the death . Anyhow , this correct calling of names , and quick recognition has always been a great power in the governing of men and women . " Deal you in words , " is the advice of Mephistophiles to the student , in Faust , " and you may leave others to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was able to appreciate the governing power of Brigham You ngall the better when I had heard the *xpression of this poor Mormon 's gratitude and homage to the great President who had shaken hands with him and addressed him promptly and correctly by his name . This same Mormon was very communicative . Indeed , as a rule , I found most of the men in Salt Lake City ready and even eager to discuss their " peculiar institution , " and to invite Gentile opi*ion on it . He showed us his two wives , and declared that they lived together in perfect harmony and happiness ; never had a word of quarrel , but were contented and loving as two sisters . He delivered a panegyric on the moral condition of Salt Lake City , where , he declared , there was no dishonesty , no drunkenness , and no prostitution . I believe he was correct in his description of the place . From many quite impartial authorities I heard the same accounts of the honesty of the Mormons . There certainly is no drunkenness to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have heard others assert the contrary ) that Salt Lake City is really and truly free from this vice ; and I suppose it goes without saying that there is little or no prostitution in a place where a man is expected to keep as many wives as his means will allow him . Intelligent Mormons rely immensely on this absence of prostitution as a justification of their system . They seem to think that when they have said , " We have no prostitutes , " all is said ; and that the Gentile , with the shames of London , Paris and New York burning in his memory and his conscience , must be left without a word of reply . Brigham Young , in conversation with me , dwelt much on this absence of prostitution . Orson Pratt preached in the Tabernacle during our stay a sermon obviously " at " the Gentile visitors , who were just then specially numerous ; and he drew an emphatic contrast between the hideous profligacy of the Eastern cities and the purity of the Salt Lake community . I must say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can thus be settled ; I do not think prostitution so great an evil as polygamy . If this blunt declaration should shock anybody 's moral feelings I am sorry for it ; but it is none the less the ex // pression of my sincere conviction . Pray do not set me down as excusing prostitution . I think it the worst of all social evils-except polygamy. 1 think polygamy the worse evil , because I am convinced that , regarded from a physiological , moral , religious , and even merely poetical and sentimental point of view , the only true social bond to be sought and maintained and justified is the loving union of one man with one woman-at least until death shall part the two . Now , I regard the existence of prostitution as a proof that some men and women fail to keep to the right path . I look on polygamy as a proof that a whole community is going directly the wrong way . No man proposes to himself to lead a life of profligacy . He falls into it . He would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the flesh and the devil were not now and then too strong for him . But the polygamist deliberately sets up and justifies and glorifies a system which is as false to physiology as it is to morals . Observe that I do not say the polygamist is necessarily an immoral man . Doubtless he is often-in Utah I really believe he is commonly  --  a sincere , devoted , mistaken man , who honestly believes himself to be doing right . But when he attempts to vindicate his system on the ground that it banishes prostitution , I , for myself , declare that I believe a society which has to put up with prostitution is in better case and hope than one which deliberately adopts polygamy . I am emphatic in expressing this opinion because , as I am opposed to any stronghanded or legal movement whatever to put down Brigham Young and his system , I desire to have it clearly understood that my opinions on the subject of polygamy are quite decided , and that no one who has clamored , or may hereafter clamor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can have less sympathy than I have with Mormonism 's peculiar institution . Let me return to Brigham Young . I saw the Prophet but twice-once in the street and once in his own house , where the ' interview took place which I have described . The day after that on which I last saw him he left Salt Lake City and went into the country-some people said to avoid the necessity of meeting i'Ir . Colfax , who was just then expected to arrive with his party from the West . My impressions , therefore , of Brigham Young and his personal character are necessarily hasty , and probably superficial . I can only say that he did not im* press me either as a man of great genius , or as a mere charlatan . My impression is that he is a sincere man-that is to say , a man who sincerely believes in himself , accepts his own impulses , prejudices and passions as divine instincts and intuitions to be the law of life for himself and others , and who , therefore , has attained that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice of self is listened to as the voice of God . With such a sincerity is quite consistent the adoption of every craft and trick in the government of men and women . Nobody ca&amp;doubt that Napoleon I. was perfectly sincere as regards his faith in himself , his destiny , and his duty ; and yet there was no trick of lawyer , or play-actor , or priest , of which he would not condescend to avail himself if it served his purpose . This is not the sincerity of a Pascal , or a Garibaldi , or a Garrison ; but it is just as genuine and infinitely more common . It is the kind of sincerity which we meet every day in ordinary life , when we see some dogmatic , obstinate father of a family or sense-carrier of a small circle trying to mould every will and conscience and life under his control according to his own pedantic standard , and firmly confident all the time that his own perverseness and egotism are a guiding inspiration from heaven . After all , the downright , conventional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I sometimes doubt whether there ever was in rerurn natur* any one such creature . I suppose Tartuffe had persuaded himself into self-worship , into the conviction that everything he said and did must be right . I look upon Brigham Young as a man // of such a temperament and character . Cunning and crafty he undoubtedly is , unless all evidences of eye , and lip , and voice belie him ; but we all know that many a fanatic who boldly and cheerfully mounted the funeral pile or the scaffold for his creed had over and over again availed himself of all the tricks of craft and cunning to maintain his ascendancy over his followers . The fanatic is often crafty just as the madman is : the presence of craft in neither case disproves the existence of sincerity . I believe Brigham Young to be simply a crafty fanatic . That he professes and leads his creed of Mormonism merely to obtain lands and beeves and wives , I do not believe , although this seems to be the general impression among the Gentiles who visit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a prophet and a heaven-appointed leader , and that this belief prevents him from seeing how selfish he is in one sense and how ridiculous in another . Any man who can deliberately put on such a coat in combination with such a pair of boots , as Brigham Young displayed during my intervie*v with him , must have a faith in himself which would sustain him in anything . No human creature capable of looking at any two sides of a question where he himself was concerned , ever did or could present himself in public and expect to be reverenced when arrayed in such uncouth and preposterous toggery . I can not pretend to have had any extraordinary revelations of the inner mysteries or miseries of Mormonism made to me during my stay at Salt Lake City . Other travellers , nearly all other travellers indeed , have apparently been more fortunate or more pushing and persevering . I fancy it is rather difficult just now to get to know much of the interior of Mormon households ; and I confess that I never could quite understand how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justified in worming their way into Mormon confidences , and then making profit one way or another by revelations to the public . But one naturally and unavoidably hears , in Salt Lake City , of things which are deeply significant and which he may without scruple put into print . For example-there was a terrible pathos to my mind in the history of a respectable and intelligent woman who , years and years ago , when her life , now fading , was in its prime , married a man now a shining light of Mormonism , whose photograph you may see any*vhere in Salt Lake City . She has been superseded since by divers successive wives ; she is now striving in a condition far worse than widowhood to bring up her seven or eight children , and she has not been favored with even a passing call for more than a year and a half by the husband of her youth , who lives with the newest of his wives a few hundred yards away . I am told that such things are perfectly common ; that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of families which may be described practically as households without husbands and fathers . I believe the lady of whom I have just spoken accepts her destiny with sad and firm resignation . Her faith in the religion of Mormonism is unshaken , and she regards her forlorn and widowed life as the heaven-appointed cross , by the bearing of which she is to win her eternal crown . Of course the Indian widows regard their bed of flames , the Russian womenfanatics behold their mutilated and mangled breasts with a similar enthusiasm of hope and superstition . But none the less ghastly and appalling is the monstrous faith which exacts and glorifies such unnatural sacrifices . These dreary homes , widowed not by death , seem to be the saddest , most shocking birth of Mormonism . After all , this is not the polygamy of the East , bad as that may be . " Give us , " exclaimed M. Thiers in the French Chamber , three or four years ago , when Imperialism had reached the zenith of its despotic power " give us liberty as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these superseded // and lonely wives in Salt Lake City , crying aloud in the bitterness of her heart , " Give us polygamy as in Turkey ! " That the thing is a religion , however hideously it may show , I do not doubt . I mean that I feel no doubt that the great majority of the Mormon men are drawn to and kept in Mormonism by a belief in its truth and vital force as a religion . I do not believe that conscious and hypocritical sensuality is the leading impulse in making them or keeping them members of the Mormon church . I never heard of any community where a sensual man found any difficulty in gratifying his sensuality ; nor are the vast majority of the Mormons men belonging to a class on whom a severe public opinion would bear so directly that they must necessarily wander thousands of miles away across the desert in order to be able comfortably to gratify their immoral propensities . To me , therefore , the possibility which appears most dangerous of all is the chance of any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foot against this perverted and unfortunate people . Left to itself , I firmly believe that Mormonism will never long bear the glare of daylight , the throng of witnesses , the intelligent rivalry , the earnest and active criticism , poured in and forced in upon it by the Pacific railroads . But if it can bear all this then it can bear anything whatever which human ingenuity or force can put in arms against it ; and it will run its course and have its day , let the Federal Hercules himself do what he may . Meanwhile it would be well to bear in mind that Mormonism has thus far cumbered the earth for comparatively a very few years ; that all its members there in Utah counted together would hardly equal the population of a respectable street in London ; and that at this moment the whole concern is ricketty and shaky , and threatens to tumble to pieces . I know that some of the ruling elders are panting for persecution ; that they are openly doing their very best to " draw fire ; " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the passions of Federal officials resident at Salt Lake by threats of terrible deeds to be done in the event of any attempt being made to interfere with Mormonism . Many of these Mormon apostles , dull , vulgar and clownish as they seem , have foresight enough to see that their system sadly needs just now the stimulus of a little persecution , and have fanatical courage enough to put themselves gladly in the front of any danger for the sake of sowing by their martyrdom the seed of the church . " That man , " said William the Third of England , speaking of an inveterate conspirator against him " is determined to be made a victim , and I am determined not to make him one . " I hope the United States will deal with the Mormons in a similar spirit . At the same time , I would ask my brothers of the pen whether those of them who have visited Salt Lake City have not made the place seem a good deal more wonderful , more alluringly mysterious , more grandly paradoxical in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convinced that if people in Lancashire and Wales and Sweden had all been made distinctly aware that Salt Lake City is only a dusty or muddy little coinmonplace country hamlet , where labor is not less hard and is not any better paid than in dozens or scores of small hamlets this side the Missouri , one vast temptation to emigrate thither , the temptation supplied by morbid curiosity and ignorant wonder , would never have had any conquering power , and Mormonism would have been deprived of many thousand votaries . For , regarded in an artistic point of view , the City of the Saints is a vulgar sham ; a trumpery humbug ; and I verily believe that it has swelled into importance not more through the fanatical energy of its governing elders and the ignorance of their followers , than through the extravagant exaggeration and silly wonder of most of its hostile visitors and critics . JUSTIN MCCARTHY . // F ' AUNTON street is long and high . A wide road , skirted by equally wide I strips of turf , in whose shallow gutters ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time ) grow May-weed , yarrow , and nettle , herbs of repellant touch *and vile odor , it runs on the top of Taunton Hill , from whose broad and long crest you can see more of western Connecticut , in its development of bare round hills , mullein-stalks , stones , and life-everlasting , than is good for the soul of the thrifty , or pleasant to the eyes of the discerning . Whatever is agreeable to behold lies on either hand in the white , red , or brown farm-houses , each in its own green yard , with a garden on one hand and a lane leading to the barn and shed on the other ; some more adorned than others with lilac-bushes and sticky rose-acacias , others more neatly ordered about- doorstep , chip-yard , and picket-fence ; but all wearing a certain patient and pathetic homeliness that must have risen thousands of times before dying eyes , and filled them with homesick tears . On the very top of Taunton Hill , or , rather , on the middle of its broad back , stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eastern slope , the graveyard . No elegant cemetery where one can return to dust regardless of expense in rosewood and velvet , wept over by marble angels holding cold blossoms ; but a quiet , deserted-looking place of burial , wearing the natural loneliness of death altogether separated from life , except at the rare and silent funerals that gathred there on business ; or when , once in a decade , some profane antiquary , fumbhag after dates among the brown stones , discovered among those gaping and agonized cherubs a record to the effect that Mrs. Lovina Jinkinson 's " etherial parts became a seraph on the 15th of June , " and smiled behind his silk handkerchief . Half a mile beyond this abode of religion and mortality was a small red house , standing in its own yard and having a little garden to the south , but neither lane nor barn ; a drooping elm tree shaded it in front , and one huge apple-tree spread its gnarled growth over the end of the garden ; cinnamon-roses grew on either side of the flat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grim aspect of those always-shut windows , behind whose green glass , greener paper shades preserved a ghastly twilight in the " front room . " But a little sidling path , well worn through the turf ; led round the corner to the south door , a place of cheerier countenance , where broods of chickens peeped and pecked ; where the cat washed her face in the sunshine ; and where the opened door gave l ) leasant glimpses of a clean kitchen , with Sire Mariner in a tall , list-bottomed arm-chair sitting by the fire doing nothing , and Polly , his daughter , bustling about doing everything . Desire Mariner ( commonly called Sire ) was a placid , weakly , peace-loving old man , who had been sexton and shoemaker time out of mind in Taunton street . If you wanted a pair of shoes he could make them in three weeks , if nothing happened ; if you wanted a grave dug it took him all day to do it . His wife had lived in a state of bustle and aggravation while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried on the business . " Well , Polly , what b* you a goin ' to do now ? " said Mrs. Perkins , the deacon 's wife , to Polly , as she entered the house behind her , coming home from Marah Mariner 's funeral .
