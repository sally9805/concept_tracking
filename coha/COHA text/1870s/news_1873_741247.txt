txt Whatever their merits otherwise , our fashionable styles of house-building are plainly unfavorable to ghosts . Those misty beings are not partial to modern improvements . Where there are so many dwellings precisely alike , ghosts are deprived of that advantage in the way of surroundings which is so conducive to proper ghostly effect , and to the terror justly inspired by it . " Keeping , " as Mr. FUSELI , or some other lecturer on art , declared , " is everything . " There is a " St. Peter , " by CARLO DOLE ' , in the Pitti Palace , wherein it is plain the artist became enamored of a certain gorgeous and glossy-plumed cock who struts in the foreground . As a consequence , the Saint is made to look like a poulterer . In like manner , your ghost is belittled and put out of countenance by smart new furniture , many windows , fresh paint , and lively frescoes . He may be conjured up among such vanities , perhaps , but he will be of the vulgar optical type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pepper . This being so , we hold that all true ghosts and all material lovers of the genuine article ought to be very much obliged to any one who palpably has their interests at heart , and proves it by conduct that gives posthumous evidence of that praiseworthy regard . Such a person , no doubt , was the late Widow BCRDErr , of Gilmorton , England , whose singular will has lately been made , and is likely to continue to be made , the subject of much brisk legal contention . Mrs. BURDETT was first married . to a surgeon , and , after he died , married his brother . This was twenty-five years ago . In 1849 she had a son , to whom she was deeply attached . He became a cripple , and died in 1867 . After this the mother , who had long . lived on bad terms with her husband , separated from him . Mrs. BURDErr had previously made a will in favor of her sod ; but providing for his dying before herself . In the latter case her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entirely excluding her husband . Suit has now been brought by the husband 's next of k n to set aside the will -- first , on the ground that the testatrix was not , at the time of execution , in her right mind ; and , secondly , that she was unduly influenced . The former assumption is founded on the remarkable terms of the will , with which , in the interest of the ghosts , we are more immediately concerned . Mrs. Burdett directs that her house shall remain bolted and barred for a term of twenty years next after her death . The doors and windows are to be bricked entirely up . One small door , in a wing projecting in the rear , is to be left , with many locks and safeguards , for the use of a " respectable married couple , " who are to live in the house rent-free to see the various directions fully obeyed . No one else is on any account whatever to enter the house ; and every article in it is to remain undisturbed exactly as loft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , enforces these injunctions more strongly still . The casements on the inside of all the windows and doors are to be protected by zinc or iron shutters , covered with planking firmly screwed down , and . sealed . with the seal of the three executors . To conclude , Mrs. BURDETT 'S pony , her fowls , pigeons , and dogs are all to be shot . The will is in contest , as we have said , and , pending the issue , nothing has been done . The fact that Mrs. BuanErr insisted , some time after her son 's death , that he was not dead , and memorialized the Secretary of State for permission to disinter the holy  --  which was done and her error demonstrated  --  has been urged , among other things , as proof of her insanity ; and , as the j ary of the Court of Probate have been unable to agree , the whole business will pass , we suppose , into the Court of Chancery . Now , the Court of Chancery has usually been favorable to ghosts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . for long periods , and , so far as this matter goes , any sensible friend of the apparitions may be pleased if the contestants of the will are not . But , pending the litigation , it would seem no more than fair that Mrs. BunnErr 's behests as regards bricking up the house should be carried out , so that spirits of that turn of mind may enjoy a sanctuary , impenetrable oven to " glimpses of the moon , " and wherein the eye of impertinent curiosity would , therefore , seek to peer in vain . A large , oldfashioned country mansion , thus cloaked in impenetrable gloom , to the awe-struck souls of neighboring rustics would soon become an object of profound respect , and in good time would be duly tenanted. by them , we may be sure , with the spirit of Mrs. BURDETT and a host of congenial friends . But the incidental advantage of having a " haunted house " in the neighborhood is but one of the prosperous results that Mrs. BURDETT 'S bricking-up process may . be expected to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mind to keep her late objectionable spouse out of the house after her demise ; but may she not have really contemplated revisiting herself a spot where she had lived so long , and . to which she was so much attached ; and may not her precautions have been designed to deter the profane from disturbing her there I These questions might be answered , we should say , by Mr. D. D. HOME , who could scarcely find a better field for the exercise of his peculiar talents than the Burdett mansion after it has been bricked up , let us say , for four or five years , and dust and cobwebs share with wandering ghosts its melancholy shades . If the Great Apollo of the Spiritualists could not secure a fitting circle of disembodied persons under circumstances like these , we should be tempted to approve , without reserve , of Mr. BROWNING 'S memorable onslaught , and to say that Mrs. BURDETT 's posthumous preparations for the encouragement of ghosts were as futile as " Mr. Sludge 's " punishment was well deserved .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
