THE CANONS OF THE COLORADO . ( THIRD PAPER . ) BY MAJOR J. W. POWELL . THE walls were now more than a mile in height . Stand on the south steps of the Treasury Building in Washington and look down Pennsylvania Avenue to the Capitol Park , measure the distance with your eye , and imagine cliffs extending to that altitude , and you will understand what I mean . Or , stand at Canal Street in New York and look up Broadway to Grace Church , and you have about the distance ; stand at Lake Street Bridge in Chicago and look down to the Union D*p6t , and you have it again . A thousand feet of this is up through granite crags , then slopes and perpendicular cliffs rise one above the other to the summit . The gorge is black and narrow below , red and gray and flaring above , and crags and angular projections on walls which , cut in many places by side caiXons , seem to be a vast wilderness of rocks . Down through these gloomy depths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept up their roar ; always watching and peering ahead-for the narrow cafion was winding and the river was closed so that we could see but a few hundred yards , and what might be below we knew not . We strained our ears for warning of the falls and watched for rocks , or stopped now and then in the bay of a recess to admire the gigantic scenery ; and ever as we went , there was some new pinnacle or tower , some ' crag or peak , some distant view of the upper plateau , some deep , narrow side cafion , or some strangely shaped rock . On we went , through this solemn , mysterious way . The river was very deep , the cafion very narrow and still obstructed , so that there was no steady flow of the stream , but the waters wheeled , and rolled , and boiled , and we were scarcely able to determine where we could go with greatest safety . Now th' boat was carried to the right , perhaps close to the wall , again she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other side , where , caught in a whirlpool , she spun about like a chip . We could neither land nor run as we pleased ; the boats were entirely unmanageable ; now one , now another was ahead , each crew looking after its own safety . We came to another rapid ; two of the boats ran it perforce ; one succeeded in l4nding , but there was no foothold by which to make a portage , and she was pushed out again into the stream ; the next minute a // **dD CA*N OF THE COLORADO . // great reflex wave filled the open compartment ; she was water-logged , and drifted at the mercy of the waters . Breaker after breaker rolled over her , and one tossed her deck downward . The men were thrown out , but they clung to the boat , and she drifted down alongside of us , and we were able to catch her . She was soon bailed out and the men were aboard once more , but the oars were lost ; their place being supplied by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playing in the cafion that day . Sometimes they rolled down in great masses , filling the gorge with gloom ; sometimes they hung above from wall to wall , covering the cafion with a roof of impending storm , and we could peer long distances up and down this caiXon corridor , with its cloud roof overhead , its walls of black granite , and its river bright with the sheen of broken waters . Then a gust of wind would sweep down a side gulch and make a rift in the clouds , revealing the blue heavens , and a stream of sunlight poured in . Again the clouds drifted away into the distance and hung around crags and peaks , and pinnacles , and towers , and walls , covering them with a mantle that lifted from time to time and set them all in sharp relief . Then baby clouds crept out of side cafions , glided around points , and crept back again into more distant gorges . Other clouds stretched in strata across the cafion , with intervening vista views to cliffs and rocks beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formed rapidly above ; these soon grew into brooks , and the brooks into creeks , which tumbled over the walls in innumerable cascades , adding their wild music to the roar of the river . When the rain ceased , the rills , brooks , and creeks ran dry . The waters that fall during the rain on these steep rocks are gathered at once into the river ; they could scarcely be poured in more suddenly if some vast spout ran from the clouds to the stream itself . When a storm bursts over the cafion a side gulch is a dangerous place , for a sudden flood may come , and the inpouring water raise the river so as to drown the rocks before your very eyes . On the 16th of August we were compelled to stop once more and dry our rations and make oars . The Colorado is never a clear stream , and , owing to the rains which had been falling for three or four days , and the floods which were poured over the walls , bringing down great quantities of mud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entered opposite our camp  --  a clear , beautiful creek , or river , as it would be termed in the Western country , where streams are not so abundant . We had named one stream , above , in honor of the great chief of the bad angels , and as this was a beautiful contrast to that , we concluded to name it " Bright Angel River . " In a little gulch just above the creek , I discovered the ruins of two or three old houses , which were originally of stone laid in mortar . Only the foundations were left , but irregular blocks , of which the houses were constructed , were scattered about . In one room I found an old mealing stone , deeply worn , as if it had been much used . A great deal of pottery was strewn about , and old trails were seen , which , in some places , were deeply worn into the rock . It was ever a source of wonder to us why these ancient people sought such inaccessible places for their homes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no kinds here of any considerable extent which they could have cultivated . To the west of Oraiby , one of the towns in the Province of Tusayan , in northern Arizona , the inhabitants have actually built little terraces along the face of the cliff where a spring gushes out , and there made their site for gardens . It is possible that the ancient inhabitants of this place made their agricultural lands in the same way . But why should they seek such spots ? Surely the country was not so crowded with population as to demand the utilization of a region like this . The only solution which suggests itself is this : We know that for a century or two after the settlement of Mexico , many expeditions were sent into the country now comprised in Arizona and New Mexico , for the purpose of bringing the town-building people under the dominion of the Spanish Government . Many of their villages were destroyed , and the inhabitants fled to regions at that time unknown , and there are traditions among the people who now inhabit the pueblos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lands . It may be that these buildings were erected at that time . Sure it is that they had a much more modern appearance than the ruins scattered over Nevada , Utah , Colorado , Arizona and New Mexico . These old Spanish conquerors had a monstrous greed for gold , and a wonderful lust for saving souls . Treasure they must have , if not on earth , why , then in heaven ; and when they failed to find heathen temples bedecked with silver they propitiated heaven // Doubtless some of these people preferred a third alternative , and rather than be baptized or hanged , they chose to be imprisoned within these cafion walls . Our rations were rapidly spoiling , the bacon being so badly injured that we were compelled to throw it away , and our saleratus had been lost overboard . We had now plenty of coffee , but only musty flour sufficient for ten days , and a few dried apples . We must make all haste possible . If we met with difficulties as we had done in the cafion above , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , THE GRAND by seizing the heathens themselves . There is yet extant a copy of a record made by a heathen artist to express his conception of the demands of the conquerors . In one part of the picture we have a lake , and near by stands a priest pouring water on the head of a native . On the other side a poor Indian has a cord about his throat . Lines run from these two groups to a central figure , a man with a beard and full Spanish panoply . The interpretation of the picture writing is this : " Be baptized as this saved heathen , or be hanged as that damned heathen . " // qwq shone with great power , and the mercury stood at 115o , so that we had rapid changes from great extremes , which were very disagreeable . It was especially cold in the rain at night . The little canvas we had was rotten and useless ; the rubber ponchos , with which we started from Green River City , were all lost ; more than half the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had an entire suit of clothes , nor had we a blanket apiece . So we gathered drift-wood and built fires , but the rain came down in torrents and extin* guished them , and we sat up all night on the rocks shivering . We were , indeed , much more exhausted by the night 's discomfort than by the day 's toil . So difficult were the portages on August *8th that we advanced but two miles in this work . I climbed up the MU-Av CAI*ON , LOOKING WEST . qwq boat and were carried down stream over another rapid . The men in the boats above saw our trouble , but were caught in whirlpools , and went spinning about so in the eddies that it seemed a long time before they came to our relief . At last they came . The boat was turned right side up and bailed out , the oars , which , fortunately , had floated along in company with us , were gathered up , and on we went without even landing . On the 20th , the characteristics of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walls were sloping , and composed of black slates that stood on edge . These nearly much smaller scale than the great bays and buttresses of Marble Cafion . The river was still rapid , and we stopped to let down with lines several times , but made greater progress , running ten miles . On a terrace of trap we discovered an -- other group of ruins . Evidently , there wa* once quite a village here . Again we found mealing-stones and much br6ken pottery , . and upon a little natural shelf in the rock , back of the ruins , we found a globular basket that would hold perhaps a third of a bushel .. It was badly broken , and , as I attempted to take it up , it fell to pieces . There were many beautiful flint chips* scattered about , as if this had been the home of an old arrow-maker . The next day , in nearing a curve , we heard a mad roar , and down we were carried with a dizzying velocity to the head of another rapid . On either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ granite walls , and the sharp bends cut off our view . A few moments and we should be carried into unknown waters . Away we went on a long , winding chute . I stood on deck , supporting myself with a strap fastened on either side to the gunwale , . and the boat glided rapidly where the water was smooth . Striking a wave , she leaped and bounded like a thing of life , and we had a wild ride for ten miles , which we madein less than one hour . The excitement was so great that we forgot the danger until we heard the roar of a great fall . below , when we backed on our oars , and were carried slowly toward its head , and succeeded in landing just above . We found we could make a portage , and at this we were engaged for some hours . Just here we ran out of the granite .

In this our boats from shore in great glee . way cunous little alcoves are formed , in The next day we came to rapids again , . which are quiet bays of water , but on a over which we were compelled to make a // portage . While the men were thus employed I climbed the wall on the north-east to a height of about 2,500 feet , where I could obtain a good view of a long stretch of cafton below . Its course was to the south-west . The walls seemed to rise very abruptly for 2,500 or 3,000 feet , and then there was a gentle sloping terrace on each side for two or three miles , and then cliffs rising from I , 5oo to 2,500 feet . From the brink of these the plateau stretches back to the north and south for a long distance . Away down the cai ' on on the right wall I could see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand on the brink of the cafion . The effect of the terrace was to give the appearance of a narrow , winding valley with high walls on either side , and a deep , dark , meandering gorge down its middle . It was impossible from this point of view to determine whether there was granite at the bottom or not ; but from geological considerations I concluded we should have marble walls below , and this proved to be the case , except that here and there we passed through patches of granite , like hills thrust up into the limestone . At one of these places we made another portage , and , taking advantage of this delay , I went up a little stream to the north , wading all the way , sometimes having to plunge in to my neck , and in other places to swim across little basins that had been excavated at the foot of the walls . Along its course were many cascades and springs gushing out from the rocks on either side . Sometimes a cottonwood tree grew over the water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hundred and fifty feet , and climbed around it to the right on broken rocks . As I proceeded the cafton narrowed very much , being but fifteen or twenty feet wide , the walls rising on either side many hundreds of feet-perhaps thousands . In some places the stream had not exca-* vated its channel vertically through th' rocks , but had cut obliquely , so that one wall overhung the other . In other places it was cut vertically above and obliquely below , or obliquely above and vertically below , so that it was impossible to see out overhead . But I could go no farther . Th* MARBLE PINNACLE IN EANAB CANON . // time which I estimated it would take to make the portage had now almost expired , so I started back on a round trot , wading in the creek and plunging through basins , and finding the men waiting for me . Farther on we passed a stream which leaped into the Colorado by a direct fall of more than a hundred feet , forming a beautiful cascade . There was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet in thickness , and there were much softer beds below . The harder beds above project many yards beyond the softer , which are washed out , forming a deep cave behind the fall , and the stream poured through a narrow crevice above into a deep pool below . Around on the rocks , in the cave-like chamber , were set beautiful ferns with delicate fronds and enameled stalks ; the little frondlets had their points turned down to form spore-cases . It had much the appearance of the maidenhair fern , but was larger . This delicate foliage covered the rocks all about the fountain and gave the chamber great beauty . It was curious to see how anxious we were to make up our reckoning every time we stopped , now that our diet was confined to plenty of coffee , a very little spoiled flour , and a very few dried apples . It had come to be a race for a dinner . On the 23d , we ran twenty-two miles , and on the 24th , twenty miles . Such fine progress put all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daylight was lost , and on the 25th , though we were retarded by a portage , we made thirty-five miles . During this last day we passed monuments of lava standing in the river , mostly low rocks , but some of them shafts more than a hundred feet high . Three or four miles farther down these increased in number . Great quantities of cooled lava and many cinder-cones were seen on either side , and then we came to an abrupt cataract . Just over the fall on the right wall a cindercone , or extinct volcano with a well-defined crater , stands on the very brink of the cafion . From the volcano vast floods of lava have been poured down into the river , and a stream of the molten rQck has run up three or four miles , and down we knew not how far . Just where it poured over the caiion wall is the fall . The whole north side as far as we could see was lined with black basalt , and high up on the opposite wall were patches of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and caves , melted snow ! giving to the wall a spotted appearance . Up to this time , since leaving the Cob The rocks are broken in two along a line rado Chiquito , we had seen no evidence that which here crosses the river , and the beds which we had traced coming down the cation for thirty miles have dropped 8oo feet on the lower side of the line , forming what geologists call a fault . The volcanic cone stands directly over the fissure thus formed . On the side of the river opposite , mammoth springs burst out of this crevice one or two hundred feet above the river , pouring in a stream quite equal to the Colorado Chiquito . This stream seemed to be loaded with carbonate of lime , and the water flowing away leaves an incrustation on the rocks , and this process has been continued for a long time , for extensive deposits are noticed in which are basins with bubbling springs . The water is salt . As we floated along I was able to observe the wonderful phenomena relating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled to a height of twelve or fifteen hundred feet , perhaps by more than one flood . This would dam the water back , and in cutting through this great lava-bed a new channel has been formed , sometimes on one side , sometimes on the other . The cooled lava , being of firmer texture than the rocks of which the walls are composed , in some places remains ; in others a narrow channel has been cut , leaving a line of basalt on either side . It is possible that the lava cooled faster on the sides against the walls , and that the center ran out ; but this is only conjecture . There are other places where almost the whole of the lava is gone , only patches of it being seen where it has caught on the walls . As we proceeded we could see that it ran out into side cations . In some places this basalt has a fine columnar structure , often in concentric prisms , and masses of these columns have coalesced . In places , when the flow occurred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it is now , for we could see where the basalt rolled out on the sand , and what seemed curious to me , the sands were not metamorphosed to any appreciable extent . At places the bed of the river is of sandstone or limestone , in others of lava , showing that it has all been cut out again where the sandstone and limestone appear , but there is a little yet left where the bed is of lava . What a conflict of water and fire there must have been here ! Imagine a. river of molten rock running down into a river of // IJE CANONS OF THE COLORADO . the Indians inhabiting the plateaus on either using the water which burst out in springs at side ever approached the river , but one the foot of the cliffs for irrigation . The corn morning we discovered an Indian garden at was looking quite well , though not sufficiently advanced to give us roasting ears ; but there were some nice green squashes . We carried ten or a dozen of these on board our boats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the robbery . We excused ourselves on the plea of our great want . We ran down a short distance to where we felt certain no Indians could follow , and what a kettle of squash sauce we made ! True , we had no salt with which to season it , but it made afine addition to our unleavened bread and coffee . Never was fruit so sweet to us as those stolen squashes . At night we found , on making up our reckoning , that wehad again run thirty-five miles during the day . What a supper we made - unleavened bread , green squash sauce , and strong coffee ! We had been for a day or two on half rations , but now we had no stint of roast squash . A few more days like this and we should be out of prison . On the 27th the river took a more southerly direction . The dip of the rocks was to the north , and we were rapidly running into the lower formation .

We landed into the river . There was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clambered up over the how great we could not tell , and below that granite pinnacles for a mile or two , but a rapid filled with huge rocks for two or three could see no way by which we could let hundred yards .

High above the river we could walk along on the top of the granite , which was broken off at the edge and set with crags and pinnacles , so that it was very difficult to get a view of the river at all . In my eagerness to reach a point where I could see the roaring fall below , I went too far on the wall , and could neither advance nor retreat , and stood with one foot on a little projecting rock and clung , with my hand fixed in a little crevice . Finding I was caught here , suspended four hundred feet above the river , into which I should fall if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men came and passed me a line , but I could not let go the rock long enough to take hold of it ; then they brought two or three of the longest OUR MESSENGER . oars . All this took time , which seemed very precious to me. the right wall , a great rock projected half-way But at last the blade of one of the oars across the river . It had a sloping surface exwas pushed into a little crevice in the tending up stream , and the water , coming rock beyond me in such a manner that down with all the momentum gained in the they could hold me pressed against the falls and rapids above , rolled up this inclined wall . Then another was fixed in such a plane many feet and tumbled over to the left . // I decided that it would be possible to let satisfied we could get over the danger immedown over the first fall , then run near the diately before us ; what there might be right cliff to a point just above the second , below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could pull out into a little chute , the cliffs the cafion seemed to make another and , having run over that in safety , to pull great bend to the south , and this , from our with all our power across the stream to previous experience , meant more and higher avoid the great rock below . On my return to the boats , I announced to the men that we were to run it the next morning . After supper Captain Howland asked to have a talk with me . We walked up a little creek a hort distance , and I soon found that his object was to remonstrate against my determination to proceed ; he thought we had better abandon the river here . I learned that his brother , William Dunn nd himself had determined to go no farther in the boats . We returned to camp , but nothing was said to the other men . During the two days previous our course had not been plotted , so I sat down and did this for the purpose of finding where we were by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I took out the sextant to make observations for latitude , and found that the astronomic determination agreed very nearly with that of the plotquite as closely as might be expected from a meridian observation on a planet . I concluded w , e must be about forty-five miles in a direct line from the mouth of the Rio Virgen . If we could OUR MESSENGER 'S BOY . reach that point , we knew there qwq Then I awoke my brother and told him of Howland 's determination . He , at least , promised to stay with me . Next I called up Hawkins , the cook , and he made a like promise ; then Sumner , Bradley , and Hall , and they all agreed to go on . At last daylight came and we had breakfast , without a word being said about the future . The meal was as solemn as a funeral . After breakfast I asked the three men if they still thought it best to leave us . The elder Howland thought it was , and Dunn agreed with him ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the party , failing in which , he decided to go with his brother . Then we crossed the river . The small boat was very much disabled and unseaworthy . With the loss of hands consequent on the departure of the three men we should not be able to run all the boats , so I decided to leave the " Emma Dean . " Two rifles and a shot - gun were given to the men who were going out . I asked them to help themselves to the rations and take what they thought to be a fair share . This they refused to do , saying they had no fear but that they could get something to eat ; but Billy , the cook , had a pan of biscuits prepared for dinner , and these he left on a rock . Before starting we took our barometers , fossils , minerals , and some ammunition , and left them on the rocks . We were going over this place as light as possible . The three men helped us lift our boats over a rock twenty-five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the first falls . Just before leaving I wrote a letter to my wife and gave it to Howland . Sumner gave him his watch , directing that it be sent to his sister , should he not be heard from again . The records of the expedition had been kept in duplicate , and one set of these was given to Howland ; and now we were ready to start . For the last time they entreated us not to go on , and told us that to go on was madness ; that we could never get through safely ; that the river turned again to the south into the granite , and a few miles of such rapids and falls would exhaust our entire stock of rations , when it would be too late to climb out . It was rather a solemn parting and some tears were shed , for each party thought the other was taking the dangerous course . My old boat having been deserted , I went on board " The Maid of the Cafion . " The three men climbed a crag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The " Maid " pushed out , we glided rapidly along the foot of the wall , just grazing one great rock , pulled out a little into the chute of the second fall , and plunged over it . The open compartment was filled when we struck the first wave below , but we cut through it , and then the men pulled with all their power toward the left wall and swung clear of the dangerous rock below . We were scarcely a minute in running it , and found that , although it looked bad from above , we had passed many places that were worse . The other boat followed without more difficulty . We landed at the first practicable point below , fired our guns as a signal to the men , above that we had gone over in safety , and remained a couple of hours , hoping they would take the smaller boat and follow us . We were behind a curve in the cafion and could not see up to where we left them . As they did not come we pushed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and falls , all of which we ran in safety . Just after dinner we came to another bad place . A little stream came in from the left , and below there was a fall , and still below another fall . Above , the river tumbled down over and among the rocks in whirlpools and great waves , and the waters were white with foam . We ran along the left , above this , and soon saw that we could not get down on that side , but it seemed possible to let down on the other , so we pulled up stream for two or three hundred yards and crossed . There was a bed of basalt on this northern side of the cafion , with a boki escarpment that seemed to be a hundred feet high . We could climb it and walk along its summit to a point where we were just at the head of the fall . Here the basalt seemed to be broken down again , and I directed the men to take a line to the top of the cliff and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remained in the boat to keep her clear of the rocks and prevent her line from being caught on the projecting angles . I climbed the cliff and passed along to a point just over the fall , and descended by broken rocks , and found that the break of the fall was above the break of the wall , so that we could not land , and that still below the river was very bad , and there was no possibility of a portage . Without waiting farther to examine and determine what should be done , I hastened back to the top of the cliff to stop the boats from coming down . When I arrived I found the men had let one of them down to the head of // the fall ; she was in swift water and they were not able to pull her back , nor were they able to go on with the line , as it was not long enough to reach the higher part of the cliff which was just before them ; so they took a bight around a crag , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The boat was in very swift water , and Bradley was standing in the open compartment holding out his oar to prevent her from striking against the foot of the cliffs . Now she shot out into the stream and up as far as the line would permit , and then wheeling , drove headlong against the rock ; then out and back again , now straining on the line , now striking against the cliff . As soon as the second line was brought we passed it down to him , but his attention was all taken up with his own situation , and he did not see what we were doing . I stood on a projecting rock waving my hat to gain his attention , for my voice was drowned by the roaring of the falls , when just at that moment I saw him take his knife from its sheath and step forward to cut the line . He had evidently decided that it was better to go over with his boat as it was , than to wait for her to be broken to pieces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the stream , the stern-post broke away , and she was loose . With perfect composure Bradley seized the great scull oar , placed it in the stern rowlock , and pulled with all his power  --  and he was a strong fellow  --  to turn the bow of the boat down stream , for he wished to go bow down rather than to drift broadside on . One , two strokes were made , a third just as she went over , and the boat was fairly turned ; she went down almost beyond our sight , though we were more than a hundred feet above the river . Then she came up again on a great wave , and down and up , then around behind some great rocks , and was lost in the tumultuous foam below . We stood speechless with fear ; we saw no boat ; Bradley was gone . But now , away below , we saw something coming out of the waves . It was evidently a boat ; a moment more and we saw Bradley standing on deck swinging his hat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in a whirlpool . The stern-post of his boat remained attached to the line which was in our possession . How badly she was disabled we knew not . I directed Sumner and Powell to run along the cliff and see if they could reach him from below . Rhodes , Hall , and myself ran to the other boat , jumped aboard , pushed out , and away we went over the falls . A wave rolled over us and our craft became unmanageable ; another great wave struck us , the boat rolled over , and tumbled , and tossed , I know not how . All I know is , that Bradley was soon picking us up . Before long we had all right again , and rowed to the cliff and waited until Sumner and Powell came up . After a difficult climb they reached us , when we ran two or three miles farther , and turned again to the north-west , continuing until night , when we ran out of the granite once more . At twelve o'clock on August 29th we emerged from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valley from which low mountains were seen coming to the river below . We recognized this as the Grand Wash . A few years before , a party of Mormons taking with them a boat , set out from St. George in Utah , and came down to the mouth of the Grand Wash , where they divided , a portion of the party crossing the river to explore the San Francisco Mountains . Three men , Hamblin , Miller , and Crosby , taking the boat , went on down the river to Colville , landing a few miles below the mouth of the Rio Virgen . We had their manuscript journal with us , so we knew the stream well enough . At night we camped on the left bank in a mesquite thicket . The sense of relief from danger and the joy of success were great . When he who has been chained by wounds to a hospital cot until his canvas tent seems like a dungeon , and the groans of those who lie about him are an increasing torture-when such a prisoner at last goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sees ! How beautiful the sky , how bright the sunshine , what " floods of delicious music " pour from the throats of the birds , how sweet the fragrance of earth , and tree , and blossom ! The first hour of convalescent freedom seems rich recompense for all the pain , the gloom and the terror . Something like this was the feeling we experienced that night . Ever before us had been an unknown danger heavier than any immediate peril . Every waking hour passed in the Grand CaiXon had been one of toil . We had watched with deep solicitude the steady disappearance of our scant supply of rations , and from time to time when we were hungry had seen the river snatch a portion of the little left . Danger and toil were endured in those gloomy depths where often the clouds hid the sky by day , and but a narrow zone of stars // Lould be seen at night . Only during the few hours of deep sleep consequent on hard labor had the roar of the mad waters been hushed ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the gloom had disappeared , *and the firmament was bounded only by the wide horizon . The river rolled by in silent majesty ; the quiet of the camp was sweet , our joy was almost ecstasy . We sat till long after midnight talking of the Grand Cafion , of home , and , more than all , of the three men who had left us . Were they wandering in those depths , unable to find a way out ? Were they searching over the desert lands above for water ? Or were they nearing the settlements with the same feeling of relief that we ourselves experienced ? We ran through two or three short , low caftions the next day , and on emerging from one , discovered a band of Indians in the valley below . They saw us and scampered away to hide among the rocks . Although we stopped and called for them to return , not an Indian could be seen . Two or three miles farther down , in turning a short bend in the flyer , we came upon another camp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I could shout to them , and being able to speak a little of their language , I told them we were friends . But they all fled to the rocks except a man , a woman , and two children . We stopped and talked with them . They were without lodges , but had built little shelters of boughs , under which they wallowed in the sand . The man 's only garment was a. hat , the woman 's a string of beads . At first they were evidently much terrified , but when I talked to them in their own language , told them we were friends , and inquired after people in the Mormon towns , they were soon reassured , and begged for tobacco . Of this precious article we had none to spare . Sumner looked in the boat for something to give them , and found a little piece of colored soap , which they received as a valuable present ; rather , however , as a thing of beauty than of use . They were either unwilling or unable to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we pushed oft for we had no time to lose . Soon after dinner one of the men exclaimed : " Yonder 's an Indian in the river ! " Looking for a few minutes , we certainly did see two or three figures . The men bent to their oars and pulled toward them . Approaching , we saw three white men and an Indian hauling a seine . We were at the mouth of the long-sought river ! As we came near , the men seemed far less surprised to see us than we were to see them . They evidently knew who we were , and on talking with them they told us that we had been reported lost long ago , and OUR MESSENGER 'S WIFE . /
