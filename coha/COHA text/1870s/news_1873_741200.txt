txt A morning newspaper gives the following account of the interview between Speaker Blaine and Brigham Young . Brigham wanted to impress the Speaker with the idea that Congress had no right whatever to interfere with the local affairs or the Governor of the Territory in any respect ; that any attempt at interference was a breach of faith , and said that they should be left just as the organic law left them , and have full power to do all legislation without let or hindrance . The speaker reminded Brigham that the Presidential contest of 1861. was fought on the distint issue of the right of Congress to control the domestic institutions of the territories , and that Mr. Lincoln was chosen on that grouud ; that Congress had exercised its power by abolishing the relations of master and slave , and that its authority was plenary in the premises , and the extent of its exercise a matter of discretion ; that the organic act of Utah was by its terms subject to amendment , alteration , and reveal ; and that no enactment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chose to annul . Brigham said if that is your doctrine , our interests and our rights demand that we be admitted as a State . We have requisite population , resources , and wealth . It may be true , Mr. Young , the speaker replied , that you have the necessary population and wealth ; but , speaking to you with the frankness with which I should speak were I on the floor of Congress I must say to you that Utah can never be admitted as a State so bong as the institution of polygamy is upheld and practised by the Mormon Church . and , as I understand , by the great mass of your people . This remark seemed to nettle Brigham consideraby , but he kept his temper , and proceeded to a long dissertation on the relative purity of the morals of the Eastern cities in comparison with the morals of Utah , contending that the superiority was on the side of the latter . " But , Mr. Young , " returned the speaker , " what you denounce in the East is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be wrong even by those who indulge in it . What you do in Utah is not only done openly by the sanction of the law , but has the approval and command of the Churon . With such practices and opinions radically differing from those of the people of the United States , you can not , in my judgment , ever be admitted to a participation iu too Covernment of the Union . " " Well , then , " said Brigham . " what are you going to do about it I " You seem always to be worrying over Utah in Congress , and attempting to legislate for us . " " Why , " replied the speaker , " what specific measures Congress will .. adopt is not for me to say , but I will assure you that Congress will adopt such measures as , in its opinion , may be necessary to maintain the federal authority in this Terri- tory , but as to Congress worrying about Utah , it is my impression that the worrying.is all on the other side . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do anything to persecute your people for what theymay conscientiously believe , however much Lmay differ from them . but at the same time -I woilla not leave ou your nilim the impression thareongreas may not at an early time legislate in your affairs in just such a manner as they may deem beat for the general good .
