txt Shortly after 9 o'clock yesterday morning one of the most , disastrous fires that has visited New-York in several years broke out in Hale 's piano factory , situated about the centre of the block bounded by Thirty-fifth and Thirtysixth streets and Tenth and Eleventh avenues . What was known as the old factory ran through from street to street , occupying a width of five lots . On Thirty-fifth-street , toward Eleventh-avenue , running the length of 12 lots , and of a width of a little over half a block was the new factory , nearly completed . Both buildings were of brick , of the flimsiest construction . The old one was eight and the new one nine stories in height . The latter was erected on the ruins of the factory which fell in process of construction late in 1871 and killed several persons . The new factory was used principally for the storage of lumber , and only a few workmen were employed there . In the old factory some 250 hands were busily engaged yesterday morning . The fire originated in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drying department , a small room used for drying glued sounding-boards . There was a large stove , above which wee hung wooden cases with slides , in which the sounding-boards were placed . The men say that no coal was used , the fire in the stove being fed with shavings , of which the factory furnished an abundance . The cases had become very dry and it is supposed that some of the ignited shavings escaped and communicated flame to the cases . It is supposed that the fire started somewhere about 9 o'clock , and that more than half an hour was wasted by the carvers , who worked on the fourth floor , in a vain attempt to extin ? guish it before giving the alarm . Some of the men say they tried hard to put out the flames , and did not cease their efforts until compelled to flee for their lives . The appliances against fire consisted of some Babcock extinguishers , a number of pails of water on each floor , four hogsheads of water on the fifth floor , and a hydrant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firemen received the first alarm  --  the Police say it was 9:43 when it reached them . The engines in the vicinity at once hurried to the scene , but when they arrived the entire building was a mass of smoke and flame . In the meantime . a scene of terror and confusion that has seldom been paralleled was being enacted . The carvers , seeing that there was no time to lose , hurried to seee themselves . Some rushed to their tool-boxes , and gathering their tools , escaped with them . Others ran from the bnilding at once , without waiting for anything , spreading the alarm through the floors below as they descended . A few brave Inc n sprang up the stairs to warn their fellow  --  orkmen on the three floors above . Those on the fourth and floors below got out without trouble . The floors above filled in a few minutes with a dense , stifling smoke , which caused most of the occupants to lose their presence of mind . Some rushed to the windows ; others endeavored to get upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 62 years of age. , appeared to be paralyzed , and stood stock-still . Ile undoubtedly perished , as no trace of him has since been seen . He was married , and has a grown-up family , but his fellow-workmen did not know his residence . A few of the more cool-headed shouted to their comrades to run to the fire-escapes , and a number hearkened to the advice and followed them . Seine jumped from the windows . Two were killed and three injured . Many who were about to jump were dissuaded from doing so by the crowd , who cried out to them from below . Several shouted back that they had no alternative . It appeared as though persons in the building prevented a number from jumping by pulling at their clothes . Many made the leap in safety , their fall being broken by feather-beds placed on the walk by the neighbors . At length the windows were cleared of all but one man , Albert Lee , aged 52 , who hoarded at No. 411 West , Thirty-sixth-street . He was heard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall backward into the flames . He is believed to have perished . The flames , fanned by a brisk gale from the west , spread with astonishing rapidity . At 10:16 the walls of Hale 's old factory fell in with a crash that was heard half a mile on either side . Instantly the air was filled with blazing brands , some of them several feet long , sparks , and dust . A moment afterward the new factory was a sheet of flame , and quicker than it takes to write it , lice factories , 22 tenements , 15 shanties , and 18 stables and sheds were burning . The heat was intense . ' The people in the tenements had made an attempt to save their household goods but most of them were forced to fly before they had succeeded in accomplishing hardly anything . Bedding and other articles of a combustible nature caught fire where they had been dropped , and the burning straw , lifted by strong gusts of wind , mingled with the sparks and brands which already filled the air , endangering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire . Some of the flying embers were wafted as far as Thirty-fourth-street and Broadway , igniting the Gospel Tent and destroying it in a very few minutes . The employes of Graham 's silk factory , on the south side of Thirty-fifthstreet , fought like heroes against the danger , but were finally obliged to fly through a back window . The engineer of Rohe 's immense packing establishment , on the north side of Thirty-sixth-street , turned on the hose upon the roof and front of the building and succeeded in saving it with a slight scorching . Citizens armed with brooms beat down the sparks in every direction , doubtless with good results . Other citizens dammed up the gutters , and with pails and tin cans dipped up the overflow from the hose pipes and dashed it against houses that were threatened . Tho firemen labored heroically . One engine ? No. 34 , a self propeller  --  was caught in Thirty-fifth-street , in front of the old factory , and all its hose and woodwork burned . The company were forced to leave it to its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life was worth to stand in Tenth-avenue , and existence in the side streets was for a while impossible . The scene was a grand one . An area of flame extending over a breadth of nearly two blocks formed the groundwork of the picture . Above was an atmosphere of dense smoke , through which the sun carried to the space between the new and old buildings , and , being placed upon the roof of a shanty was raised to that of the old factory , . ' whereon about 60 men were congregated . A part of these men were taken down by the firemen , while others clambered ? down the chain fire . escape . The heat very soon became intense , and the unfortunate men who were awaiting rescue became excited and wandered ita search of some speedier means 1 ) 1 escape . It is thought that a MIng number went into the binning building agaen , hoping that they could fight their wav through the flames to safety on the walk . The firemen were finally compelled by the heat to take down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How many men were left behind can not , now be ascertained , A foreman of one of the engine companies estimated that the lives or 40 persons had been destroyed in the building , and a man who escaped front the sixth story of the factory told the firemen that he bad descended to the ground by means of a fall-rope , and had left GO men behind him , not one of whom followed him down . Thomas McCormack , a mason in the employ of Peter J. Vanderbilt , the builder of the factories for J. P. Hale k Co. , was at work on the third floor of the old factory . and eight other masons were engaged in repairing the haif-circle arches in the apartment ; walls . When he and his companions heard the alarm of fire they rau through the narrow passageways that led beneath a number of arches , to the staircase . intending to go down to the street . The smoko that rolled upward baffled them . and then , with infinite difficulty , they passed between the piles of boxed-up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the roof , where they ? found about 50 inert assembled . McCormack was lucky enough to catch hold of the chain fire-escape , and thus escaped to the ground . At the tim he was . descending eight other mat were on the chain . McCormack 's belii ? t is that about 40 men were left behind him , and he thought they could not have escaped even ' 1 though a ladder was resting against the roof and the firemen were aiding the laborers to descend . McCormack bad nworked on the buildings from the time their foundations were laid , and knew that the material used was not of . the best . Further than this , the apartments in the old factory were cho , sed up with boxes and pianos , and men in an excited state could not easily find their way to the stairs . In all the time McCormack worked in the buildings ho never saw a line of Lose in them . the air above was studded thickly with burning brands and glowing sparks that whirled about with every gust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falling walls , mingled with the crackling of timbers , the labored pulling of the ' engines , and the excited shouts of the firemen . The flames ran across Thirty-sixth-street and destroyed five buildings there . They leaped Thirty-fith street , and destroyed nearly the entire block , extending almost to Thirty-fourthstreet . Nearly all the houses facing on Tenth-avenue , except some small ones on the corner of Thirty-sixth-street , were licked up . A cluster of shanties perched on a rock on Thirtysixth-street , opposite Hale 's new factory , were wiped out , and a number of dwellings toward Eleventh-avenue met a similar fate . Houses in every direction for blocks were more or less scorched . The water gave out about 10:30 , and the engines were obliged to lay their pipes to Eighth-avenue and chimneys and a few tottering walls , immense heaps of steaming bricks , and a huge pile of glowing charcoal , to mark the site of over 60 factories , dwellings , stables , and sheds . Almost from the outbreak of the fire the excitement in regard to the probable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast . First it was said that 5 men were in the ruins , then 20 , then 50 , then 80 , then 100 ; then 200 . At 10:15 a telegram was received at the New-York Hospital saying that over 100 persons were dead . Thirteen ambulances were soon on the ground , three from the New-York Hospital , two from the Ninety-ninth-Street Hospital , one from the Chambers-Street Hospital , and seven from Bellevue . They rendezvoused at the corner of Thirtieth-street and Tenth-avenue , and the accompanying Surgeons and a number of volunteers were kept busy dressing slight wounds . The dead body of a woman who died in a rear house in Thirty-fifth-street half ' an hour before the fire , was carried out by the surgeons . About 4:30 a Mrs. Pfluger ? residing at No. 908 Tenth-avenue , was taken with hysteria in the street while standing in the crowd , and was attended to by the ambulence corps . It was very difficult in the face of the many contradictory stories told to ascertain definitely how many persons were in the ruins . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another , Nicholas Mank , aged 21 , a varnisher , have perished . Mank 's father and brother were in the crowd last evening , weeping . Nicholas and his brother Peter were both employed in Hale 's factory . Peter got out but Nicholas has not been seen since . Mrs. Kiernan , who resided on Thirty-sixth-street , east of the old factory , says she saw a number of men drop from the cornice , from which they hung for some time shouting for4help . The sight has made her seriously ill . Mrs. Smith , another resident of the same street , on the west side of the factory , says she saw two men drop into a narrow space alongside the factory . They did not come out of the little alleyway leading on to Thirty-sixth-street , which was their only means of exit . Miss Theresa Geis , whose father 's residence was destroyed , and Mrs. Chard , ? ho keeps a candy store across the way , say that they saw two men drop from one of the chain fire-escapes into the ruins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the side windows of the old factory  --  about the seventh from Thirty-fifth-street , they think ? at a height of six stories . These men were not picked up . Joseph Gladstone , who also lives across the way from the factory in Thirty-sixthstreet , says he saw a man attempting to get down on the chain fire-escape from the seventh story of the new factory . Mr. Gladstone could see that the chain was hot , and ho heard somebody shout directions to the man to wrap his coat around it . The man let go after descending about four feet , and was seen no more . A number of persons assert that from six to twelve men jumped out of the upper windows of the old factory a moment before the walls fell , and that they were covered up . All sorts of stories of this kind were told , but it was difficult to corroborate them . Few persons other than the relatives of those mentioned byiname reported at the Police station in search of missing friends , and of those few the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose of obtaining admission within the Police lines . The employes of the factory say , however , that many of their comrades resided in Weehawken , Hoboken , and other distant places , which the news would not reach quickly . Mr. John Hertel , the foreman of the varnishers , who occupied the top floor , says he had 80 men under him , and of these only three  --  Lee , Greb , and Mankhave not turned up . C. P. Waring says ho was the next to the last man to leave the seventh story , and lie knows that that man escaped . They dropped two floors and crept out the rest of the way on their hands and knees . Both these men believe that there are bodies other than Lee 's , Greb 's , and Mank 's in the ruins , but they say that the number will not exceed seven or eight all told . Mr. Hartell says that of the entire force employed in the factory only 10 are unaccounted for , and at least two of these must be credited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belief is that there are from seven to 15 more dead , but it will be impossible to search successfully for their bodies for a day or two yet on account of the heated condition of the ruins . Five cats that took refuge on the top of the old factory were burned . Several chickens were roasted , and one with its feathers completely bunted off was rescued alive . Three horses were killed , two belonging to Kennedy , the ice man , and the other , while harnessed to a wagon load of pickles , ready to start cut of the factory . Mr. Walker saved his $10,000 mare Mayhird and her foal by jumping her over a back fence , and out through a hallway into Thirty-fourth-street . An Irishman known as Pat , employed in Hall 's factory , had his hair burned completely of ? . A tortoise went through the fire , in the factory-yard uninjured . The safes of Messrs . Hale and Graham were recovered during the afternoon . They fell where they could be readily got at . There were four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two ladders . Besides these there were front and rear stairs and two hoistways . When the members of Engine Company No. 34 reached the doorway of the burning factory a number of men emerged from it , some of them carrying patent fire-extinguishers upon their backs . This fact shows that efforts had been made for a long time to extinguish the flames without calling upon the Fire Department .
