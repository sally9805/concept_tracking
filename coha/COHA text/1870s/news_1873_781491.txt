txt The Harlem steam-boats bavo latterly ceased to nett the lives of their passengers by racing . This improvement , however , is probably only a temporary one . Bo soon as the warm Spring weather shall lead the pilots ' fancy to lightly turn to thoughts of racing , we shall doubtless have a repetition of the scenes so familiar last season , when the rival Harlem steam-boats made themselves a terror to peaceful schooners and ferry-boats , by racing from Peck-slip to Harlem at the top of their speed . Will not some passenger have the public spirit to enter a complaint against the first pilot who begins the Spring racing season I Let him note the number of revolutions made by the engine while the boat is raoing. and give a surreptitious look at the steam gauge , so that he can be an intalli-gent witness : Then let him go before a mainstrate. and demand that the statute against racingte enforced against the offender . ' This statute , it should be remembered , gives a fee of $50 to the ' informer by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its provisions . An astute passenger could easily have made a comfortable living last Summer by bringing about the prosecution of these Harlem pilots . MT . STANLEY has proved himself to be a courageous and capable explorer . He triumphed over the African climate , the savage negroes , and . the wild beasts that beset his path toward UDR , and proved his ability to cope with and overcome all the difficulties that a merely . savage country might oppose to his plans . Naturally this success gave him confidence in himself , but it ought not to have inspired such over-weaning self-confidence as to lead him to risk a visit to Chicago . Nevertheless , the reckless man has been to Chicago and lectured there . The result is what might have been expected . We are now told that his agent , unable to resist the influence of the memories and associations which cluster around that unique city , has absconded , taking with him $800 of Mr. STANLEY 'S professional earnings . The explorer has thus been taught that the ways of Chicago are not those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human nature which proteoted him on the shores of Tanganzyska are useless on the borders of Lake Michigan . Our libraries here frequently suffer at the bands of vandals who abuse their privileges , but we have never yet bad experience of such abuse as that which has befallen the library at Troyes. in France . Printing was established there so early as the fifteenth century , and the trade still flourishes in the place , which has an aroma of learning about it , and has long been famous for its magnificent library . This collection , formed in a great degree from those of suppressed monasteries , is marvellously rich , not only in curious printed books of the utmost rarity , but in manuscripts and prints of immense value . The keeper of these treasures has , for many years , been a certain M. HARMAND , a man of sixty . He was previously a professor in a college in the town , and thus appeared to be a fitting person for the post of librarian . For a long time his proceedings have caused great dissatisfaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have been skillful in the art of stifling inquiries , and to have been endowed with such remarkable capacities for making himself superlatively unpleasant to those who were disposed to be inquisitorial , that they soon let him alone . Eventually , however , proofs became too strong against him . A bookseller in the town published , in 1866 , a catalogue of his stock . It came under the notice of a learned bibliographer , who was astounded that a provincial bookseller should be possessed of works of which only a few copies are extant . The porter of the library was at length instructed to keep a careful watch , and the result has been a mass of evidence tending to incriminate the librarian of having robbed in a wholesale manner . The inquiry , which excites great interest , is now proceeding at Troyes . Apropos of this , let us ask what has become of the mutilator detected in the Astor Library four months ago i We hope that the trustees have not been displaying any ill-judged lenity . The extreme difficulty of bringing eases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the more essential The inebriate asylum at Binghamton stands in bad odor with the State authorities , and an effort is now being made to place the entire institution under State control . It is really a private asylum , organized by a number of stockholders , who subscribed some $30.000. and succeeded in obtaining from the State something like $500.000 in the course of several years . Senator Woof ) now holds that the State should take possession , so as to give the people the benefit of it , the present managers charging from $10 to $20 per week for the patients , and otherwise controlling it for their own private interests . One of the few really funny pieces of " humbug " now on exhibition is the appearance in the field of one " Gonxisr. " a partially reclaimed Irishman . the editor of a weekly newspaper , as a " reformer " of " journalism . " This person sets about his work in the following manner : He carefully collects all the dirt which the World and other unconverted papers throw at THE TIMES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who have given him mortal offense , adds a little slander of his own private manufacture , and then sets up a mournful howl over the " indecenies " of the Press . The chief object of this interesting trick is to enable the aforesaid " GoDarrt " to " wreak revenge " ( as he himself expresses it to his friends ) for certain exposures of a contemptible literary fraud of which he was guilty some little time ago . It has often been said , and never denied , that this is not the only bit of sharp practice of which the same " Gemini " has been guilty , and that his paper came into his bands by a series of manmuvrea of which an honest man would have no special reason to be proud . So the " personal " journals assert . Wnat is quite clear is , that , under pretense of deprecating personalities , the sanguinaryminded " GOMIS " is the author or disseminator of the worst and most reckless form of slanders , and that his Celtic thirst for " revenge " leads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the City . When " Gooirie " has fully slaked his noble passion for blood , be will , perhaps , realize that even his stage load of readers can take very little interest in those personal grudges which seem to cmcupy the greater part of his time and thoughts . Meanwhile , as example is more forcible than precept , the irascible reformer alluded to above gives us his idea of the proper tone of political discussion , by describing Commissioner DAVENPORT as a " youthful and unknown adventurer , " with " that mixture of impnaence with smartness which covers up so many defects of mind and morals ; " Gen. BUTLER Is a " rascal , " " rather proud " of being one ; the Republican Party is dead , and its leading men " have grown careless , and insolent , and Indifferent to public opinion , and finally corrupt . " Then " Gomm " casts his eye , in a " fine frensy rolling , " over the Inhabited globe , and finds is all exceeding bad , and deplores the fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general powers of superintendence over it . How soon he would put us all straight t It would be a heaven upon earth , and the almighty Gomm would be fully revenged on his foes  --  especially on that avid man whose name he is so fond of printing , and who appears to sit on his breast like a nightmare , and causes him agonies of torment .
