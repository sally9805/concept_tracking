Historical Estimate of Gonnecticut . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contributions to Blaclcwood 's Magazine , under the no'v't de plume of " Cornelius ODowd , " have beeui one of its greatest attractions since the days of " Christopher North , " excused himself some time ago , for replying to an attack which bad been made upon him in the Ottawa Times ( Upper Canada ) , by relating the following anecdote . He had met in Paris a somewhat staid countryman of his-if it is proper ever to apply such an epithet to one of that chronically unquiet race-whose absence from his paternal acres excited his surprise . His estate , it is true , lay in a disturbed country , and his life had been more than once menaced ; but he was one of those bold , determined sort of fellows who actually feel a sort of wild pleasure in defying the dangers amidst which they live . " How is it , " asked Mr. O'Dowd , " that I see you // here ? Have they burned down Shanarogue ? or what has happened ? " " No , " replied the new corner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country is tolerably qniet , too ; but I found the other day that a fellow had come from the far end of Donegal to shoot me , and so I thought it time to be off . If it had been one of my own people near at hand , I 'd not have minded it ; but when a man living far away from me , who never saw me in his life , and whom I never harmed , comes all this distance to have a shot at me , I felt it meant business , and that there was no time for trifling . " " So " - said Mr. O'Dowd , when he found himself the object of the wrathful attack of the writer in the Ottawa Times , on account of having expressed in one of his Articles , what he had considered at the time some very harmless opinions- " if the shot had come from any quarter , the most remote , in the United Kingdom , I 'd not have replied to it . It was his long range that attracted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introduction because we find ourselves in just the predicament which Mr. O'Dowd so humorously depicts . A shot has been fired at us " at long range ! " In the April number of Blackwood s Magazine ( 1870 ) appeared an Article which bears the title of " Blue Laws , " in which an attack is made upon the memory of the excellent men who founded the colonies of Connecticut and New Haven . Our limits will allow us at present to notice only the attack upon the founders of the latter colony , as this more immediately concerns us ; although much that we shall offer in reply will serve in a measure as an answer to what is said in ridicule of the colony of Connecticut , in which colony that of New Haven was merged in 1665 . It is stated in Blaelcwood that " in the Blue Laws of New Haven * * * it was ordered that no one should travel , cook victuals , make beds , sweep house , cut hair or shave on the Sabbath or Fasting day ; that no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every male should have his hair cut around according to a cap . To make any motion of marriage to any man 's daughter or maid servant , not having first obtained leave and consent of the parents or masters so to do , ' was made punishable either by fine or whipping , or both , at the discretion of the bench , ' and according to the gravity or // aggravation of the offence . " The judicious writer closes with this last citation , and to our surprise , makes no mention of the " law " forbidding the " working of beer barrels on Sunday , " which is the usual accompaniment to the edition of the code which is in vogue in this country . It is to be regretted , also , that the readers of Blackwood were not also informed that at a period when the fields of corn were much injured by the depredations of the numberless squirrels which swarmed in the forests , the " General Court of the Jurisdiction , " in view of the fact that it was the outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " thereafter no planter should have or plant any outside row in his corn-field . " We could add to the " code " indefinitely , but to come back to the " Blue Laws , " as actually set down in Blaclcwood , we suspect that our readers have heard of them before and know what to think of them . But this English writer may not be aware that there never were any such " laws , " though for a hundred years it has been the fashion with the enemies of New England , sometimes for political , and sometimes for sectarian reasons , to vilify the founders of the New Haven Colony , by charging them with having enacted a collection of very precise and foolish laws , to which this name " Blue Laws " has been given in derision , and of which these that he has set down are only a specimen . Now there is this that may be said in explanation , and perhaps in extenuation . Such stories fall in with the American idea of humor . Here , among a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all bounds of common sense , is no humor at all . The writer in Blackwood seems to have been aware of this American peculiarity , and has evidently intended to proceed with due caution in making his selection from the famous " code ; " - all which is duly appreciated , and for which grateful acknowledgment is hereby made . But it is not to be wondered at , that he has been so egregiously imposed upon . This fling about " Blue Laws " has been made so often that we do not doubt that there are thousands of our own countrymen , even of those who are tolerably well informed as to the history of their country , who do really believe that such " laws , " with the omission perhaps of some of the more palpably absurd , were once in existence in the old New Haven Colony . // Occasionally , when statements that such " laws " as these were once in force here , have come from a tolerably respectable source , and seemed to be made ignorantly , this journal has taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The last occasion in which this was done , we remember , was in the April number , 1867 , page 365 ; when a publisher in good standing in the city of New York had been so unwise as to publish a compilation made by a " Mr. M. MeN . Walsh , A.M. , LLB. , of the New York Bar , " called " the Lawyer in the Schoolroom , " in which these " laws " were all soberly put down . But we had made up our minds that it was useless to follow such slanders . We had become tolerably pachydermatous on the subject We are quite sure that for some centuries to come , whatever may be said to the contrary , and however clear the truth may be made to appear , that these stories will be repeated whenever any designing demagogue or religious zealot thinks that he can use them to inflame sectarian or political animosity against New England ideas and New England institutions . So , with Mr. O'Dowd , we could have said that if a shot of this kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the United States , we would not reply to it In fact , only a few days before meeting with the Article in question , we received from a correspondent of New England birth , who lives nearly as far towards the setting sun as this English writer lives towards the rising sun , who asked , in all innocence , if it were true that this " code " was once in force in New Haven . He complained that New England men were taunted with these *b laws " in their far western home by those of the baser sort , and requested that the facts might be given in the New Faglander . Even this did not lead us to break our resolution . But we must confess that there is something in the " long range " of this new assailant that " attracts " us ! So with this apology for devoting any space at all to a subject which we fear that many of our readers will consider to be stale and altogether unprofitable , we will address ourselves to the task . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light on the subject , or even saying anything new . All that can be said has been said over and over again , and satisfactorily , by the late Prof. Kingsley of Yale College and by Rev. Dr. Bacon . We propose // to do no more than condense what they have said , and place ii* in a compact form and one easily accessible . In fact , so largely do we propose to draw from these two authorities , that in our shorter quotations we may not always be careful to give them due credit . And now , for the benefit of the writer in Blaclcwood , we once more put on record what has been so many times before , that it is no more true that it was ever " ordered " within the jurisdiction of New Haven " that no one should cook victuals ) make beds , sweep house , cut hair , or shave on the Sabbath day , " than it is true that such laws are in existence to-day in the United Kingdom of Great Britain . There is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is just as little evidence that there was ever a " law " prohibiting a woman from kissing her child on Sabbath or Fasting day ; and just as little evidence that there was a " law " forbidding any one to keep Christmas or Saint days . How these and other stories were first started is perfectly well known in this country , and before we close , we may overcome our disinclination to weary the better informed of our readers , and restate the facts . With regard to the requirement that the hair of every male should be " cut round according to a cap , " it should perhaps be stated that the more approved version of this " law " is that a pumpkin-in agricultural districts sometimes called a punk * severed in the middle , " was enjoined as a more appropriate article to be used . This was to be placed upon the head , and the hair was to be " cut round " by it . We are able to show to any curious inquirer a picture in a well known work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bye , and which now lies ( no disrespect is intended ) at convenient distance from our elbow , in which picture the modus operaudi is quite amusingly represented . But , the picture to the contrary notwithstanding , historical accuracy obliges us to say that this " law " - which we should think might have been put in force in many of the families of the period to the great convenience of all concerned-whether its demands were that the hair should be " cut round " by a " pumpkin , " a " punk , " or a " cap , " is altogether mythical , and certainly never had any existence in the New Haven Colony . With regard to the law respecting " marriage , " there is here a // grain of truth , but it is mutilated apparently with the design of making it appear if possible ridiculous . No such words are used as " making motion of marriage . " The reason , too , for the law , as given in its preamble , is omitted entirely . The words are : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by clandestine and unlawful marriages "  --  and " considering that much inconvenience hath grown to some members of this jurisdiction by the irregular and disorderly carriage of young persons of both sexes upon pretence of marriage , the court do order that , " &amp;c. , &amp;c . But the law is a long one , and we see no reason for inserting it entire ; for it appears from the law itself and from the action of the court under it , as we learn from its records , that it was framed and that in its practical working it had respect to what it designates as " disorderly night meetings , " " unnecessary familiarity , " &amp;c. , &amp;c . When there is any evidence offered to show that the young people of New Haven in the seventeenth century had aily more impediments thrown in their way for becoming acquainted with each other with reference to the formation of any proper matrimonial connection , than they had at the same time in England , we shall be ready to discuss the subject more fully . Meanwhile we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether it is considered even to-day in England exactly honorable , according to the rules of society , for one gentleman to ask the hand of the daughter of another gentleman , without first obtaining the approval of her parents or legal guardians . With regard to traveling on Sunday , there is no question that all unnecessary traveling was at least by implication prohibited . But this was no peculiarity of the New Haven Colony , or to the New England Colonies . Even in Virginia , which certainly was not under Puritan influences , it was enacted " that the Lord 's day be kept holy , and no journey be made on that day , unless from necessity . And all inhabitants inhabiting in this country ( Virginia ) having no lawful excuse , shall every Sunday resort to the parish church or chapel , and there abide orderly during common prayer , preaching , and divine service , upon the penalty of being fined fifty pounds of tobacco by the County Court . " // 254 April , So much in way of reply at present . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the New Haven Colony , which was distinguished from all the New England Colonies by  --  the absence of what may be termed frivolous and extravagant legislation , should not only have the almost exclusive credit of whatever of that kind of legislation there was in other places , but , besides , the odium of a host of most absurd stories that are altogether fictitious . But in this connection we can not do better than give place to some quotations from Dr. Bacon 's admirable " Historical Discourses , " pp. 96 , 97 , 98 . " Great ridicule has been thrown upon the Puritans for their sumptuary laws , their regulations respecting dress , manners , and expenditure , their authoritative interference with the varying fashions of the day . And to a great extent it has been taken for granted , upon unfounded report , that the old New Haven Colony was the scene of whatever was most absurd , or most ludicrous in that sort of legislation . Liars of all degrees , as if to take their revenge on Governor Eaton for his law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memory , by defaming the colony for which he lived . " " Now as for sumptuary laws-laws regulating expenditure and restraining extravagance and folly-I have no disposition to vindicate them on the score of policy . But that they are intrinsically and essentially ridiculous , I can not admit . I have never ascertained from history that such laws , enacted by Lycurgus or Numa Pompilius , brought boundless contempt upon their authors . And how such laws must needs be more absurd or ludicrous in Massachusetts , than they were in Sparta or in Rome , I am at a loss to understand . And still more mysterious is it , how the New Haven Colony , in which no such laws ever existed , should be made a scape goat to bear away into the wilderness the sins in this particular of her more eastern confederates . " It may not be out of place to state in this connection that in the inventory of the estate of Governor Eaton after his death , we find mentioned " plate " to an amount considerably above one hundred pounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in silver , of the value of forty pounds sterling , which Mrs. Eaton claimed " as her proper estate . " His " wearing apparel , " not including jewelry , which is set down by itself is inventoried at fifty pounds sterling . There is mention made of " the green chamber , " with " a cypress chest , " " the blue chamber , " and various other rooms and " chambers , " with abundant furnishing , " the hall " with its " drawing table , " " round table , " " green cushions , " " great chair with needle work , " " high chairs " and " high stools , " " low chairs " and " low stools , " " Turkey carpet , " " high wine stools , " " great brass andirons , " together with " books , and a globe , and a map , " which last are inventoried at about ? 50 ; all which show that , in the words of an old historian , notwithstanding the failure of his commercial plans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answerable to his place . " Dr. Bacon continues : " Laws were made , in some of the colonies , prohibiting the use of tobacco , which was considered as a sort of intoxication . To the lovers of tobacco , this doubtless seems arbitrary and absurd . But such as are unable to enter into their peculiar feelings , having never acquired a relish for this filthiest and most noisome of narcotic poisons , may be excused from joining on this account in the condemnation of Puritan tyranny , and may perhaps be allowed to entertain some doubt whether such a law , especially in a new colony . might not be reasonably vindicated . But , however that piestion may be decided , the matter of fact is , that the use of tobacco , in a proper place , was not unlawful in the New Hacen jurisdiction . The only law here , on this subject , was a law to guard against accidents by fire ; and it prohibited the taking of tobacco in the streets , ' or about the houses , ' or in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Laws were made elsewhere to restrain the vagaries and follies of fashion in regard to female attire . But 1 can find no evidence that anything of the kind was here attempted . Here the ladies were permitted , as now , to put on whatever decorations seemed good in their own eyes , and in the eyes of their husbands and fathers ; subject to no other checks than those imposed by the good sense of a sober-minded , intelligent community . " // " The reason of all this must be found in the fact , that the settlers of New Haven , and especially those two by whose influence every thing of this kind appears to have been chiefly directed , were men who saw , or at least felt , the impolicy of legislative interference in such matters . The other colonies were settled by emigrants from various provincial towns , and agricultural districts ; and in the eyes of such people , however intelligent and sensible in other respects , novelties and extravagances of apparel are apt to seem particularly heinous . New Haven was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the principal adventurers were merchants ; and the two leaders were men who had seen the various modes and fashions of various countries , and whose position in their own country had enabled them to see so much of Vanity Fair , ' that they were not easily alarmed by the few rags of it which might follow them into the wilderness . If the weighter matters of education , religious order and instruction , sound morals , and the thorough execution of justice , could be secured , they were willing that others should care for the mint , anise , and cummin , ' of apparel and furniture . " But , after all , the vindication of the colonists who settled New Haven , from the charge of having enacted such a code as the " Blue Laws " are popularly supposed to have been , is a very inconsiderable matter . The real mischief of the calumny , and the wickedness of the calumniator who started it , and the wickedness of those who in every succeeding generation have repeated it , consists in this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the noblest men to be found in our whole colonial history . Who is it in the first hundred and fifty years of American history who deserves to be ranked higher in all that gives dignity to character than Theophilus Eaton ? Where is the man , who , as a scholar and a Christian statesman , will be pronounced superior to John Davenport ? It is not then so much the wickedness of the calumny , but " The pity of it , the pity of it , the pity of it , " that affects us . The whole country is the poorer to-day , because the names and the virtues of these two leaders of the New Haven colony are not better known and everywhere recognized // 257 as among the very first in the roll of the illustrious men of the country . Our aim then is not so much to silence this contemptible calumny as to assist in removing the effects of it , and to inspire among our countrymen an interest in those truly noble men , whose glory has been so long tarnished . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been so thoroughly and satisfactorily done by the late Professor Kingsley , in his " Historical iDiscourse , " delivered in 1838 , on the two hundredth anniversary of the settlement of New Haven , and especially by Dr. Bacon , in his volume of " Discourses , " that we shall feel that we have done enough if we can only lead those who are ignorant of the early history of New England to study carefully what they have written . Our limits will permit only a meagre outline here . From what has already been said , it has appeared that the colonists who settled New Haven , in 1638 , came from the city of London . They were men , who , for the most part , had been engaged in commerce . Their leaders had enjoyed at home high social position , and they were distinguished among all the colonists that came at any time to any part of New England for their superior culture , their wealth , their knowledge of affairs , the largeness of their views , and the greatness of the plans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in particular of others of reputation , Governor Eaton had been " a merchant of great credit and fashion . " His father is spoken of as having been a " famous minister " in Coventry . The son had gone early to the great metropolis , and had there engaged in trade to the Baltic ; had been deputy governor of the company of merchants to which he belonged ; had visited the Northern nations of Europe , and been the representative of Charles the First at the Court of Denmark . He was connected by marriage with the daughter of the bishop of Chester , and is said to have been " a great reader " as well as " a great traveller . " John Davenport , a son of the Mayor of Coventry , and , when a boy , a schoolmate of Theophilus Eaton , had been admitted into one of the colleges of Oxford at the age of fourteen , and at nineteen had entered upon public life as a preacher in // London . He became vicar of St. Stephen 's , Coleman St. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a minister . Notwithstanding his youth , he acquired a high position among the men of the Pnritan party in the Church of England . Says Mather : " the ablest men about London were his nearest friends . " " Dr. Preston , the master of Em . manuel College in Cambridge , a man who had declined the bishopric of Gloucester  --  a man who by his eloquence as a preacher , his learning and skill in controversey , and his various talents for business , was more than any other man of his time the head of the Puritans-had such affection for him , and confidence in him , that he left his posthumous works to his care . " Mr. Davenport was first " staggered in his conformity " by debates between himself and Mr. John Cotton ; and notwithstanding the special effoi-ts to prevent it of Archbishop Laud , who said , " I thought I had settled his judgment , " he was led to declare against conformity to the Church of England . To escape the warrants that were sent out against him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once secured by the congregation of English Christians there , as a colleague to their aged pastor Mr. John Paget . But he soon began to conceive grander designs . He had been , while yet living in London , interested in the formation of the Massachusetts colony , by finding that a man of the eminence of Mr. John Cotton had determined to leave his country and go to New England to share in its fortunes . He became one of the original patentees of the colony of Massachusetts . Says Mather : " His purse was in it , his time was in it , and he contributed unto it all manner of assistances , " although at the time he had no thought of leaving England himself . But now his thoughts turned towards the possibilities of what might be still further accomplished there . Visions of a new colony , out of the bounds of any existing jurisdiction , without any charter , or any recognition of dependence on the king , were opened before him . As Dr. Bacon says : " Is it not possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it should be necessary , an absolute independence of the English crown and of the English state ? " He who reads the record " will find nothing to contradict such an hypothesis . " Without doubt whether it would do to // " assert " this or not , this was what he hoped practically to accomplish . He returned to England , and , with the codperation of his early schoolmate and life long friend , Theophilus Eaton , formed in London among his old parishioners , in Coleman St. , the colony which with such flattering prospects of success entered the harbor of " Quinnipiack " in the spring of 1638 , and proceeded to lay the foundations of the town of New Haven . Says Dr. Bacon in his comments on their plans , " May it not have been among their imaginings , that the progress of tyranny in their native country would bring to New England increasing multitudes of such men as they were , with increasing resources , till , in a few years , they should be able to defy invasion ? Nay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrested by the breaking out of civil war , and the subversion of the monarchy , might not such an idea have been realized , and the Declaration of Independence have been anticipated by more than a century ? " It was the intention of the colonists to build up a commercial city , as their chief men had been accustomed to commercial pursuits ; and something of their character is revealed in the foresight and enlarged views which they manifested even in the manner in which they proceeded to lay out the streets of the new town . There was nothing like it on the American continent Compare the crooked , narrow , haphazard lanes following the cow paths and hardly worthy of the names of streets , which still survive in all the older parts of the first towns which were built in other places , with the broad , convenient , and well ordered streets of New Haven , and it will be seen at once that these men understood what a city is and how it should be laid out . The commendation now bestowed by strangers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing . One of the oldest historians says that it " outdid the rest of the country in fair and stately houses . " For more than two hundred years , similar praises have been heard . Its beauty has probably done more to cultivate the taste , and give direction in the laying out of all subsequent American towns and cities , than any other town in the United States ; and even now , wherever , in the South or West , a town is to be found which // is specially commended for its attractions , it has come to be spoken of in the language of its citizens and of strangers , as another New Haven . ' ' Savannah is called the New Haven of the South . " Cleaveland , not to speak of a score of other cities , is known as " the New Haven of the West . " This foresight and this attention to the convenience of future generations were no accidents . The men who exhibited these qualities had seen the world in all its phases , had seen its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town , so that those who should come after them might profit by their wide experience . Says Professor Kingsley : " As to the plan which was adopted for streets , for a public square , convenient access to the harbor , and communication with the surrounding country , the sound judgment exercised is every where visible ; nor do I suppose that any important change , in these respects , would be made if after the experience of two centuries we could direct what the original design should have been . The high character and broad views of these founders of New Haven are still further shown by the regard which they paid to education . One of the first things done by the General Court , at the very time that they were taxing themselves for laying out the town and preparing the means of defense against the savages , was to establish a public school for the instruction of youth ; and a committee was appointed to consider " what yearly allowance is meet to be given to it out of the common stock of the town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day of the landing when an entry appears in the record to this effect , " that Thomas Fugill is required to keep Charles Higginson , an indented apprentice , at school one year ; or else to advantage him as much in his education as a year s learning comes to . " ' Professor Kingsley says " Charles Higginson was probably the first apprentice indented in the colony , and this condition of his apprenticeship was recorded undoubtedly as an example of privileges to be granted to all in the same circumstances . Here is a proceeding which marks as distinctly as any measure could the views entertained by the leaders of the colony of the value of education , the protection which ought to be extended to the indigent , and their regard // Blue Laws . 261 for popular rights . If any one hereafter shall wish to inspect the early colonial records of New Haven to find subjects of reproach or merriment , let him be referred to the entry of the indentures of Charles Higginson . If all the ridiculous and absurd reports which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fact , this single record , in the opinion of the intelligent and unprejudiced , would throw them at once into the shade . Such a course of policy as is here unfolded , such charity for a class of the community at that time , and still under every European government , but little regarded , would cover a multitude of sins . No suggestion for the adoption of a rule by which an elementary education was secured to apprentices could have been received from any law of the parent country . No act of parliament , it is believed , embracing such a provision , exists in England , with all its improvement and wealth to the present day . ' " But not only were the advantages of a common-school education immediately secured to all , but with a wise reference to what is essential to the full success of common-schoo s themselves , provision was very early made for the higher branches of instruction , and a Grammar School was established . " And , still further , in 1654 , " when the colony was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when the estates of individuals were greatly diminished , and even doubts were entertained by some whether it was expedient to struggle any longer against disaster , Mr. Davenport gave a strong proof of his confidence in the stability of the settlement , and its ultimate prosperity , by the efforts which he made for the beginning of a College . He brought forward before the General Court a plan for such an institution , and the town of New Haven notwithstanding its depresssed state made a donation of land for its encouragement . " It is not necessary to follow the course of wise legislation on this subject , but the result was that " a school was brought to each man 's door ; " and , till very recently when the tide of foreign immigration has poured in upon us as a flood , a native of New Haven or Connecticut , of mature age , unable to read and write " has been looked upon as a prodigy . " The result of all this foresight , moreover , has been , as was demonstrated in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there // is no spot on this continent which has produced so many eminent men , literary , intellectaal , and practical , in proportion to its inhabitants , " as the State which now embraces within its limits the territory of the two colonies of New Haven and Connecticut . From among the mass of evidence which amply sustains the claim of the writer of the Article to which we now refer , we select a short extract from Dr. Horace Bushnell 's " Speech for Connecticut . " " If you enter into the legislative bodies west of us , and ask who are the members , you will find the sons of Connecticut among them in a large proportion of numbers , as compared with any other State . In the Convention , for example , that revised the Constitution of New York in 1821 , it was found that , out of one hundred and twenty-six members , thirtytwo were natives of Connecticut , not including those who were born of a Connecticut parentage in that State . If you add to the thirty-two natives of Connecticut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and those who came in through Vermont , New Jersey , and other States , it is altogether probable that they would be found to compose a majority of that body ; presenting the very interesting fact that Connecticut is found sitting there to make a Constitution for the great State of New York . * * * * * " If we repair to the halls of the American Congress , we shall there discover what Connecticut is doing on a still larger scale of comparison . The late Hon. James Hillhouse , when he was in Congress , ascertained that forty-seven of the members , or about one-fifth of the whole number in both houses , were native born sons of Connecticut . Mr. Calhoun assured one of our representatives , when upon the floor of the house with him , that he had seen the time when the natives of Connecticut , together with all the graduates of Yale College ( New Haven ) there collected , want ed only five of being a majority of that body . I took some pains in the winter of 1843 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that time . There could not be as many natives among the members as in the days of Mr. Hillhouse ; but including native citizens and descendants born out of the State , I found exactly his number , forty-seven . " // And , furthermore , Mr. G. P. bluster , in his History of Connecticut , published a few years ago , shows ( Vol . II , page 609 ) that this State , so circumscribed in its area , and so limited in its population , has been the birth place of one-twelfth of all the United States Senators . Lanman 's " Dictionary of the United States Congress " shows that Connecticut has produced onethirteenth of all the members of Congress , in both branches ; and this number would perhaps be more than doubled if there should be included those who were the sons of parents born in Connecticut , and those who have received their early training and education in the State . The large number of Connecticut men who have been in Congress was once made the theme of an amusing speech by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Article in the New Englander already referred to . " A number of years ago , says a writer in the Democratic Age , happening to be in Paris on the 4th of July , with many other Americans , we agreed to celebrate the day ' by a dinner at the Hotel Meurice . There were seventy-two of us in all . We had but one guest . This was M. de Tocqueville , who had then rendered himself famous by his great work upon Democracy in America . During the festivities of the evening , after the cloth had been removed , and speechifying had commenced , some gentleman alluAed en passant to the fact that he was born in Connecticut . " connect-dc-coot , ' exclaimed Monsieur de Tocqueville , as he suddenly rose with the enthusiasm of a Frenchman . Vy messieurs , I vill tell you , vid the permission of de presidante of this festival , von very leetal story , and then I vill give you von grand sentiment , to dat little State you call Connect-dc-coot . Von day , yen I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one map of the Confederation in my hand . Dere was von leetle yellow spot dat dey call Connect-dc-coot . I found by the Constitution , he was entitled to six of his boys to represent him on dat floor . But yen I make de acquaintance personelle with de member , I find dat more than tirty of the Representatif on dat floor was born in Connect-de-coot .

' " Still further , as the results of what has been done for education in Connecticut , Dr. Bushnell says : " It is remarkable that a very large share of the colleges in our nation draw their lineage not from Harvard , but from Yale . " The writer in the New Englander , from whom we have already quoted , cites also the great theologians of New England , and gives the names of Jonathan Edwards , Samuel Hopkins , Asa Burton , Nathaniel Emmons , Nathaniel W. Taylor , Bennett Tyler , and horace Bushnell ; every one of whom , as he says , was a native of Connecticut , and , with the exception of Dr. Burton , educated at Yale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writer through his citations of men of Connecticut birth and education , who have acquired for themselves a continental reputation in all the professions , in diplomatic life , in the army , in the navy , as poets , as essayists , as orators , as historians , as editors , as artists , as inventors , as philanthropistswhich abundantly and triumphantly sustain the somewhat remarkable claim which he makes for Connecticut . And , now , if an explanation of all these rich results is sought , it is undoubtedly true that they are not to be traced to any single cause , but we can not but think they are due in a great incasure to the far-sighted legislation of the colonists from the church in Coleman St. They had the wisdom to see , in the first half of the seventeenth century , that the strength and the dura // bility of the political edifice which they were building depended upon the general intelligence of the whole people . At the first , their plan embraced not only what we call " common-schools , " but all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they did was felt throughout the State , and these results which we behold to-day  --  and we have only glanced at them-are the direct consequences . It is indeed a fitting monument to Governor Eaton , that to-day the Latin School of New Haven , which was endowed through the munificence of his son-in-law , Governor Hopkins , and its far-famed university , which received such liberal gifts from another member of his family , Governor Yale , will for centuries to come perpetuate the memory of what he and his family did here for the cause of learning . The character of the men who composed the New Haven colony is also illustrated by the whole course of their legislation on the subject of religion . It should be remembered that the great object of the establishment of the colony was religion . If it had not been for this , as Professor Kingsley has said , " perhaps not an individual of the settlement would have ever removed to America . " " iReligion was , in their eyes , in the highest sense , a matter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others nearest their hearts . " They had all been accustomed in their native land to pay tithes , and to see religious institutions supported by law . There is nothing singular therefore in the fact that they made legal provision for the support of the ministers whom they had themselves chosen , and who were the objects of their especial respect and reverence . These clergymen , in the colony of New Haven , as in all the other colonies of New England , " were men of learning , as well as of talents ; they had , most of them , received their education in the English universities , and had enjoyed all the advantages in preparing themselves for their profession which England afforded . " What we wish to call attention to is the fact that a system was adopted for their support which was far less onerous than the one to which the colonists had been accustomed at home . The laws which were enacted , also , requiring attendance on religious worship were far more forbearing , lenicnt , and mild , than the laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land . The laws of Virginia , even , on this subject , were more severe than those in any part of all New England . And it is to be recollected that these early laws enforcing attendance on public worship . " concerned Congregationalists alone ; as none other than Congregationalists were in the colony . " But the thing to which we wish to call special attention is the liberality , so extraordinary for the time , which was manifested to those who dissented from their religious views . In the year 1665 , when the King 's commissioners visited New England , they reported that the people of Connecticut embracing at that time New Haven will not hinder any from enjoying the sacraments , and using the common prayer book , provided that they hinder not the maintenance of the public minister ; - as high a religious privilege as any enjoyed by dissenters in England at the present day . And further , " when , after an interval of more than half a century , religious societies were formed in Connecticut , which adopted the ritual of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowed , but all belonging to them as soon as it could be conveniently done were released from contributing to the support of the Congregational ministers . The same liberty was allowed to those who adopted other forms of worship , nor is there reason to believe that these changes in the original enactments were made without the concurrence of a large majority of the Congregational clergy . " The facts in the case are these : " When all the inhabitants of the New Haven and Connecticut colonies entertained the same views of religion , all , by law , were required to attend on the religions instruction thus provided , and were satisfied that it should be so . " Then when " a diversity of religious opinions was introduced , the laws were accommodated to this new state of the community . " Douglass , who had little sympathy with the Puritans said in 1753 , " I never heard of any persecuting spirit in Connecticut ; in this they are egrefomtsiy aspersed . " Professor Kingsley close 's his discussion of this subject with the following words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from any one who knows whereof he affirms , that no example can be produced in the whole history of Christian nations where a community unanimous in their religion and urged by so many inducements to maintain it have // changed their laws and made every concession desired more promptly , fully , and cheerfully , than the people of Connecticut . " But it is not so much this liberality displayed towards those who differed from them in religious views-unusual as this was at that time-which constitutes the chief claim of the early colonists of New Haven to respect . It is their glory , that for more than two hundred years  --  or as long as there was here no sensible admixture of foreign population-as the result of the institutions which they established , the whole world might be challenged to show a community which was more generally under the practical influence of religious principle than the towns included within the limits of the old jurisdiction of the New Haven colony  --  and we might say the colony of Connecticut . In fact the state was popularly known as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the present time , when probably one quarter of the population of the city of New Haven is of foreign birth , we do not care to institute any comparisons . But as long as there was a homogeneous population , there can be no question what was the character of the people of New Haven and Connecticut for high Christian morality and that it was the result of the institutions originally established here . From the mass of evidence that might be adduced , we select for quotation only a single passage , from a Letter written not many years ago to the citizens of Kentucky by one of her most distinguished sons-Hon . Cassius M. Clay . He speaks of a period , as it will be seen , about two hundred years after the first settlement of the town . " Bred among slaves , I regarded them with indifference , seeing no departure from morals or economical progress in the tenure . " * * * . * " Tn 1830 I went on to Yale College , in a free state . * * I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luxuriously on a soil which here would have been deemed the high road to famine and the alms house . A city of ten or fifteen thousand inhabitants rose up in the morning , passed through all the busy strife of the day , and lay down again at night in quiet and security and not a single police officer was any where to be seen . There were more than five hundred young men congregated from all climes , of various habits and temperaments in the quick blood of youth and all conquering // passion , and there was not found in all the city , so as the public were aware , a single woman so fallen as to demand a less price for her love than honorable marriage . A grey haired judge of seventy years and more , in a lifetime of service had pronounced sentence of death upon but five criminals in a *rhole State and three of these were brought down to ruin by intemperance . I had been taught to regard Connecticut as a land of wooden nutmegs and leather pumpkin-seed ; yet there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people where no man was to be found who could not write his name and read his laws and his Bible . These were strange things ; but far more strange , passing strange , will it be , Kentuckians , if you shall not come to the same conclusion to which I was compelled-that liberty , religion , and education were the cause of all these things , and the true foundation of individual happiness and national glory . We quote also a distinguished Roman Catholic writer , who says of the fathers of New England ( Catholic l'IForld , April , 1867 ) although it is evident from the Article that he has New Haven and Connecticut particularly in mind : " They have founded noble institutions of learning and general education . They have transmitted a Christian tradition which has entered into the very roots and fibres of intellectual and social life so strongly as to be ineradicable . " We call attention now to the manner in which the neighboring Indians were treated by the New Haven colony . Dr. Bacon asserts that " New Haven was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scrupulous justice towards them . He continues : " How often and how justly has Penn been lauded for the fact that under his administration his colony had no collision with the Indians , and is not the same praise due to the civil and religious leaders of the New Haven colony for the parallel fact that the relations between New Haven and the wild tribes around were always those of perfect amity . " The Indians of this neighborhood , as all our records show , looked upon their English neighbors as their protectors . When one of them felt himself wronged by the white men he came to the courts here with his complaint as freely as if he // were a citizen . The testimony of an Indian was good against a white man . Again and again white men were found guilty and punished on no other testimony . The white man who wronged an Indian was punished the more severely , as his conduct tended to prejudice the heathen against the gospel and to cause the name of God to be blasphemed among the Gentiles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treated the more gently because of his ignorance , and being dismissed with such punishment as the rules of righteousness seemed to - require in such a case was told that had he been an Englishman he would not have come off so easily . All the maligners of the Puritans may be defied to show that one rood of ground within this colony was acquired otherwise than by a free fair bargain and equitable payment . " Hubbard ascribes the fact that there never was an open war between the native Indians and the English in the New Haven colony to a " due carefulness in doing justice to them upon all occasions . " Professor Kingsley declares : " The treatment of the savages of Pennsylvania by William Penn was not a whit more equitable or kind than that showed the native inhabitants of this spot . The distinguishing policy of Penn , in his intercourse with the Indians , consisted in this , that he allowed no lands to be purchased of them except on account of the government ; the very course pursued here . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they were the first to develop , practically and successfully , in a state , views respecting the origin and the object of civil government , which were far in advance of the age in which they lived , and which in the progress of time have now come to be recognized as the only true views . It is strange that the importance of this work of theirs has been so little appreciated . It seems to have been supposed that all which has been said in their behalf was only intended as a defense against the taunts of their enemies . But , in our opinion , the founders of New Haven made here a more valuable contribution to the advance . ment of popular rights than was made either in Plymouth , or in Massachusetts , or even in the colony on the Connecticut The day that the " company " of Gov . Eaton and Mr. Daven // port made their " plantation covenant , " which was pi*obably before they sailed from England , marks an era in the history of constitutional government . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolutism was everywhere triumphant , they exhibited a broad comprehension of the questions at issue , a practical common sense , and all the qualities of true statemanshin In that age of theories , they showed themselves to be men of action . They brought into existence a State , and exhibited it to the world as an existing fact , and built it up on priiiciplcs which are now seen to lie at the foundation of the very idea of a free Christian commonwealth . It is to be remembered that statesmanship is one of the highest attainments of the human mind . It has in all ages of the world attracted the attention of the greatest intellects ; and it is considered no serious disparagement to say of the most exalted personages in history that they have not succeeded here . It is no easy matter even when the principles on which a government shall be administered are settled , to guide the ship of state safely in the well known and long traveled track . But practically to make some advance in political science-to strike out new principles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society  --  to do this when it is necessary to go counter to the inveterate prejudices of a whole country which have been inherited through ages  --  to found a state on new principles  --  to adapt the theories of the closet to the thousand practical and complicated wants of a commonwealth ; surely this shows inventive , and philosophical , and practical capacity of the very highest kind . They who fail here , as so many great men have failed , have no occasion to blush for themselves . And to those who succeed , it is but a scant recompense for all the labors and hardships which they have undergone , if succeeding generations , who profit by their hand to hand fight with the difficulties of their situation , content themselves with apologizing for the few inconsiderable mistakes which are inseparable from any new undertaking , and fail to give them appropriate honor for the great principles which they were so early to comprehend and so successfully to illustrate . Even in such a matter as estimating the indebtedness of the world to the inventor of some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the common welfare , men do not judge of this by the first rude machine which is made to do the work . Imperfections are expected as a matter of course . The boat on which the first application of steam was made for purposes of locomotion , on the waters of the Hudson river , was doubtless a humble affair enough . It would be very easy now for the veriest novice to pick flaws and deride its clumsy mechanism . Yet the title of inventor of the modern steamer is not D given to the men who came afterwards , and perfected the machinery and adapted it to the wants of the world as they are to-day , but to Fulton . He has all the glory of it , and will have it for ages to come . So we contend that the early settlers of New Haven made great advances in political science . They were the first to give to the world an example of a free government , organized on Christian principles . In estimating what is due to Fulton , no man in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the river people in derision said he was going to make go by boiling a tea-kettle on board ; and in making our estimate of the place in history which is due to Theophilus Eaton , to John Davenport , and to Edward Hopkins , we must take into the account what were at the time the prevalent ideas in Europe , and particularly in England , respecting the nature , the origin , and the objects of civil government . And , first , with regard to the origin of Government . This is no mere question of the schools . It is a practical question . According to the way in which it is answered , everything in the State will be shaped . Now , in England the views which prevailed were those which were afterwards reduced to system by Sir Robert Filmer . When Charles I came to the throne , the theory which was accepted was , that , by the law of God , all legitimate authority resides in the king ; that there is no inferior power which can limit him in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the patriarchal regimen of families , each next heir being always king by divine right , and as incapable of being restrained in his sovereignty as of being excluded from it . The doctrine was held , more comprehensive and more monstrous even than that // of the IDred Scott decision , which so shocked the moral ' sense of the American people-that no subject has any positive rights in behalf of which he may " decline illegal requ.isitior*s . " Sir Robert Filmer declared that a subject is " bound to obey the kiug 's command against law , nay , in some cases , against divine laws . " Preachers were rewarded and advanced in position for proclaiming that " the king might take the subject 's money at his pleasure , and that no one might refuse his demand on penalty of damnation . " There could be no lawful resistance to the fting . The University of Oxford pronounced a solemn decree , that it is in no case lawful for subjects to make use of force against their princes ; " and all persons promoted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A little later this same university anathematized as " false , seditious , and impious , " the doctrine that civil authority is derived from the people . Furthermore , there could be no release from this thraldom . The subject could not divest himself of the allegiance which he owed to the Lord 's anointed . As long as he had life , he was amenable to the despotic power of the Star Chamber and the Court of High Commission . This " patriarchal scheme " of government , as it was called , embodied one oC the two dogmas with which the human mind throughout Christendom had been bound down for ages in helpless slavery . The other dogma had respect to religion . According to its teachings , the consciences of men were in the keeping of the Roman Catholic priesthood ; and life and immortality could be secured only through the sacraments as they were dispensed by its accredited agents . The Reformation in the sixteenth century broke the fetters imposed upon religious thought and action . The right of private judgment in religion was claimed for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in England . But the human mind thus enfranchized began at once to investigate the nature of civil government The pertinent question was put- " Were men made for kings , or kings for men ? " It is not necessary to describe the rise of the great Puritan party , or to trace the progress of the struggle for civil freedom which went on from the time of Henry VIII . Men groped their way gradually towards the light . Many grand ideas gained a lodgment in English soil . Many noble // words were spoken . Progress was made . But after a hundred battles had been fought , how little had been accomplished for freedom at the accession of Charles I. The doctrine of the king 's absolute power beyond the law had been stoutly contested , but it could hardly be said that it had been much limited . The doctrine that there is any compact , tacit or express , between the king and his subjects was scouted . The clergymen of the established church preached absolute nonresistance ; and abhorence was everywhere avowed , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the royal prerogative . The Puritan party had boldly entered upon the contest for freedom ; but their views were not yet clear , even to themselves ; neither did they know their own strength . Besides , the battle seemed to be going against them . The plan of establishing a new home beyond the ocean had a little before begun to be agitated . The colony of Plymouth had been established . The importance of this event we fully and gratefully recognize . The constitution which was framed in the cabin of the Mayflower , marks a new epoch . But those men were not entirely disentangled from the old traditions . They supposed themselves still under English rule . They did not desire to shake it off . They subscribed themselves " the loyal subjects of our dread sovereign King James ; " and what they did , they declared was done for the " honor of our king and country . " The colonists who settled Massachuestts not only made no progress in theory upon the colony of Plymouth , but they did not go as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Their claim to the rights which they asserted was founded in their estimation on the fact that they were freeborn Englishmen . And it is questionable whether in England to this day , civil rights are supposed to rest on anything more venerable or more sacred than the provisions of Magna Charta , and the Common Law . The colonists , also , who settled the river towns on the Connecticut did not forget that they too were Englishmen . For months they supposed that they were yet within the patent of the old Massachusetts colony , and acted accordingly . Not so John Davenport and Governor Eaton . They formed their colony in London for the express purpose of carrying out // new and peculiar views respecting human rights and civil government , which they had brought out in advance of all others . They saw that there were rights which were theirs , not because they were Englishmen , but because they were men . They fell back on the natural and inherent rights which belonged to them by virtue of their manhood . They had shaped their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opinion that if they went beyond the limits of any existing English government , they were free to expatriate themselves . And when they reached Boston , on their way to their new hoine , though they were invited and urged to remain there , they refused , and would not be drawn aside from their purpose by the great inducements which were offered . It was a part of their plan to establish a State by mutual agreement , and on Christian principles , beyond the reach of English authority , and without any reference of any kind whatever , express or implied , to the government of the king , or any of the institutions of their native land . Here was the first example of such a government on the American continent Their action was almost immediately followed by the colonists on the Connecticut , who had at last found out that their new home was outside of the Massachusetts patent A few months after the settlement at New Haven , those colonists also published to the world this memorable declaration : " Forasmuch as it hath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His divine providence , so to order and dispose of things , that we , the inhabitants and residents of Windsor , Hartford , and Wethersfleld , are now cohabiting , and dwelling in and upon the river Connecticut , and the lands thereunto adjoining , and well knowing where a people are gathered together , the word of God requireth that , to maintain the peace and union of such a people , there should be an orderly and decent government established according to God , to order and dispose of the affairs of the people at all seasons , as occasions should require ; do therefore associate and conjoin ourselves to be as one public STATE or COMMONWEALTH ; and do for ourselves and our successors , and such as shall be adjoined to us at any time hereafter , enter into combination and confederation together , " &amp;c. , &amp;c . They furthermore provide in this // Constitution ' ' ' for the organization of a General Court , *7 in which , as they declare , " shall consist the SUPREME POWER OF THE COMMONWEALTH . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To establish their claims to the honor and to the gratitude of posterity , it is not necessary to show that the government which they set up was free from all imperfection . Some of the details of their government , as we can now see , were not judicious . So Fulton 's steamboat was a very rude affair , and has been improved upon to such an extent that it can scarcely be recognized in the steamer that plies our rivers and lakes , and dares the terrors of the ocean . Neither is it necessary to show that the right to set up an independent government had not been claimed at home by others of the Puritan party before their day . Just in the same way it may be true that many shrewd men had guessed what might yet be done with steam in the way of propelling a boat over the water . But this makes no difference . Fulton was the first to make a boat to go ! He reduced the theory to practice , and who will dispute his claim to the glory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ established in New Haven as a historical fact , by compact , without any permission given or asked from either the Pope of IRome or the King of England , and without the slightest reference to them ; and what had once been done could be done again , and was done again within a few months at Hartford . The question as to whether they were wise in every particular of their action , is as nothing by the side of this one great significant fact . True , they did this in their days of weakness ; and by force they were after a time brought once more under the power of England . But this example of theirs was not lost , and when the fulness of time came , and the seed then sown had ripened , those very same claims of the right of self-government were announced once more in the memorable Declaration of 1776 , by which the rule of England was cast off utterly and forever . And now with regard to the object of civil government What were the views which were then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be remembered that in the reign of James I. and Charles I. it was the fashion for all who were in sympathy with // the Court , and in consequence advocates of the divine right of the King and his uncontrolled authority in the State , to justify his claims by arguments drawn from the Old Testament . This , perhaps , is not strange . The Bible , after having been hid for ages from the sight of the people , had been brought to light once more at the Reformation ; and it was almost like the putting of a new revelation into the hands of the people . The enthusiasm and the veneration with which it was regarded were still nearly as fresh as at the first . It was studied by all parties ; by some , with the humble desire of learning what were really its teachings , and of couforming their lives to them , and by others as a grand arsenal in which might be discovered weapons of offense and defuse for the maintenance of their own peculiar view . Thus it was very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think that they had really found in the Pentateuch , and in the account given there by Moses of the institution of the Jewish priesthood , an analogy for their own order ; and to found on it a claim to be divinely constituted priests of God , and to be divinely appointed to instruct and rule over his church . As a consequence , the whole history of the children of Israel , and especially the books of Leviticus and IDeuteronomy , and the books of Samuel , and of Kings , acquired a practical importance in their eyes which we can hardly appreciate . So , too , it came about , as might have been expected , that multitudes of people , who were very little careful of ordering their lives by either the precepts of the Old Testament or the New , were deeply read in all that pertains to the antiquated ceremonies of the Jewish ritual , and in the history of each one of the Jewish kings . Statesmen , as well as divines , ladies , and even men of fashion , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Jewish history which had any bearing on the subject of the king 's prerogative and showed a familiarity in the use of all the strange Hebrew names that are so lacking in euphony to the English ear , which to us , as we read the story of those times , seems quite incomprehensible , and even to border on the ludicrous . Such being the case , it is not surprising that some most egregious blunders were made . We need only allude to the entire misconception into which some of the advocates of the // King 's unlimited power fell in their interpretation of the warnings of the prophet Samuel , when he described to the Israelites what they might expect of a king , if they were so unwise as to allow a regal government to be set up over them . From a comparison of 1 Sam . viii , 1-22 with what Josephustells us Antiq. vi , 3 , we learn that on account of the misdemeanors of the sons of Samuel , whom he had made judges in Israel , and of the injuries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had beoome very uneasy and dissatisfied with their government . They came to the prophet , and entreated him to appoint some person to be king over them . Samuel was greatly afflicted on account of his hatred to kingly government . He could neither eat nor sleep , but all night long he continued awake and revolved the matter in his mind . At last " God appeared to him , and comforted him , saying , That he ought not to be uneasy at what the multitude desired , because it was not he , but Himself whom they so insolently despised , and would not have to be alone their king . So I command thee to ordain them such an one as I shall name beforehand to be their king , when thou hast first described what mischiefs kingly government will bring upon them . " Samuel therefore announced to them in the words which may be found 1 Sam . viii , 11-18 : " This will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you : He will take your sons , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be his horsemen ; and some shall run before his chariots . And he will appoint him captains over thousands , and captains over fifties ; and will set them to ear his ground , and to reap his harvest , and to make his instruments of war , and instruments of his chariots . And he will take your daughters to be confectionaries , and to be cooks , and to be bakers . And he will take your fields , and your vineyards , and your olive yards , even the best of them , and give them to his servants . And he will take the tenth of your seed , and of your vineyards , and give to his officers , and to his servants . And he will take your men-servants , and your maidservants , and your goodliest young men , and your asses , and put them to his work . He will take the tenth of your sheep ; and ye shall be his servants . And ye shall cry out in that day because of your king which ye shall have chosen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uttered for the purpose of discouraging the Israelites from having a king were actually and in good faith supposed to afford proof that a king is divinely authorized to do all these things , and in fact govern according to his own individual pleasure . The maxim of the Stuarts and their followers was : " Impune quidvis facere , id est Regem esse . " Accountability to no one entered into their very idea of a king . It would be easy to multiply illustrations ; but enough has been said to show that in the eyes of the ruling party in England , the object of civil government was practically nothing else than to satisfy the whims and caprices of the prince and his favorites . Now in opposition to all such views , so Inonstrous as they seem to us , the great Puritan party stood up in resistance . They claimed that the object of civil government was " the common welfare of all . " And if we who are descended from the Englishmen of that day have escaped such thraldom as that under which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is a part of the debt of gratitude which we individually and personally owe to the men who dared resist the Stuarts , and limit them in the exercise of their prerogative . But to follow more particularly the New Haven colony . Their first political action was to bind themselves to establish " such civil order as would best conduce to the securing of purity and peace " in government " to themselves and their posterity ; " and one of the first enactments , which they intended , doubtless , as a concise declaration of the object and character of their whole system , reads as follows : " It is ordered by this Court , and the authority thereog that no man 's life shall be taken away , no man 's honor or good name shall be stained , no man s person shall be imprisoned , banished , or otherwise punished , no man shall be deprived of his wife or children , no man 's goods or estate shall be taken from him , under color of law , or countenance of authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ express law of this jurisdiction , established by the General Court , and sufficiently published . " Here is expressed what , from the first , has been ever considered the American idea of the object of civil government . We claim no precedence in this for New Haven . Similar declarations were made in each one of the New England cobnies. // On every fit occasion these principles were reasserted , till at last in 1776 , they were made the corner stone of the new political edifice then erected , and the announcement was made for the " free and independent " government then instituted , that these truths are held to be self-evident : " that all men are created equal ; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights ; that among these are life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness ; that , to secure these rights , governments are instituted among men , deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed ; that , whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends , it is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and to institute a new government , laying its foundations on such principles , and organizing its powers in such form , as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness . " We have been obliged to make this somewhat long digression , because it is important to keep in mind the fact that the world practically owes to the men who colonized New England the first true conception of the object of civil government . But there was still another problem , the solution of which was to test what manner of persons these were who first settled New Haven . By what kind of legislation was the " common welfare of all " to be secured ? They might fail here . There certainly could be no more difficult question . Little was to be learned from the experience of the past . They had gone beyond all the old familiar headlands of the political faith of their native land , and had embarked on an unknown and untried sea . So if they should fail in ' devising , at the outset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government , we do not understand how any fair-minded man , who understands the circumstances of the case , could find it in his heart to make them the object of ridicule . Fulton did not adapt his boat at once to all the necessities of business and all the wants of the traveling public , but no one allows this to detract in the slightest from the praise awarded to him . Now as a matter of fact , not only in New Haven but everywhere in New England , the early legislation of the colonists , for its dignity and wisdom , deserves and has won the applause of the ablest jurists , and the most profound // students of history . While in the Old World , during these two hundred years , there has been change and revolution without end , while Blaclewood s iifagazine itself ; even within this last twelve-month , testifies to the tottering condition of every political institution in England , however venerable and honorable , and exposes with withering sarcasm the imbecility and the charlatanry of the statesmanship of her rulers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it as you may-have required in all this time scarcely any change in order to adapt them to the varied wants of the present time . It can hardly be doubted , too , that in all the peculiarities of their form , they will outlast every government in Europe . Time has proved that they were founded on principles which will stand . Now , among these governments thus established in New England , Mr. Bancroft singles out Connecticut , and says of it : " There is no State in the Union , and I know not any in the world , in whose early history if I were a citizen , I could find more of which to be proud and less that I should wish to blot . " Dr. Horace Bushnell says : " Its early history is the most beautiful that was ever permitted to any State or people in the world . " And now to come down more particularly to the system of legislation adopted in New Haven , we will call attention to the way in which the first settlers proposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But , in forming an opinion of the wisdom of what they did , we must of course first inquire what were the peculiarities of their situation ? It is to be remembered that they had given up all that was dear to them in their English homes , because they were prevented there from acting in accordance with what they considered " truth , simplicity , and purity in the worship of God . " They knew perfectly well that Archbishop Laud , who had failed to convince their minister , John Davenport , by argument in England , had , on hearing of his retreat to America , uttered against him the significant threat , " my arm shall reach him there . " " They knew , " as Dr. Bacon has said , " that there was a royal commission then in being , the object of which was to put them at the mercy of this old enemy of theirs and ten // other courtiers of a kindred spirit . They knew it was intended by the court that the same iron rod which had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strike them here in the wilderness . They knew that as soon as they should have built their houses and got their lands under cultivation , as soon as they should have enough of what was taxable and tithable to excite covetousness , the king would be sending over his needy profligates to govern them , and the archbishop his surpliced dependents to gather the tithes into his storehouse . Knowing this , they were resolved to leave no door open for such an invasion . They came hither to establish a free Christian commonwealth ; and to secure that end they determined that in their commonwealth none should have any civil power " who were not in thorough sympathy with them . Accordingly they ordained-what in their circumstances it would have been perfect folly not to have ordained-that " political power of every kind should be committed only to those men whose moral character and sympathy with the great design of the plantation should be certified " by their being able to procure admission into their church . They had expatriated themselves , had made every sacrifice , had gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this sole purpose of securing religions immunities . We do not envy the man who can find anything to carp at in this determination of theirs to exclude from all participation in the government of their colony all who might be supposed to favor in any way the ecclesiastical domination of the parent country , or the bringing them once more under the power of that terrible ecclesiastical commission , which was armed with power to inflict on them , for nonconformity to the ritual which they abhorred , " loss of life or member , " according to its discretion . The garrison of a beleaguered fort is entitled by the law of nations to exercise some extraordinary rights . We claim that New Haven was thus in fact a little outpost on the very verge of civilization ; held by what without exaggeration may be called a " forlorn hope ; " exposed to be overwhelmed at any moment by a powerful and unscrupulous enemy ; and , as their action is scrutinized today , we claim for them , then and there , belligerent rights . We do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ April , a similar law was then in existence in England , or to ash how long it has been since a man could not be even a guager of beer in the customs unless he was a member in regular standing of the church of England , and partook of the sacraments as dispensed by its clergy . We claim that this was the only course that was at all safe for them ; and we have the utmost confidence that every honorable and generous opponent will join with us in denouncing the miserable narrowness and meanness of the man who would complain of this action . In further illustration of the fact that their action in this respect was determined by the political relation in which they stood to England , Dr. Bacon has said : " If we regard ( what they did ) as a measure for the encouragement or promotion of piety , undoubtedly it must be pronounced a great mistake . Piety is not to be promoted by making it the condition of any civil or political distinctions . This they knew as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into their fundamental agreement , ' it was not for the sake of bestowing honors or privileges upon piety , but for the sake of guarding their liberty , and securing the end for which they had made themselves exiles . " Undoubtedly , by this limitation of the right of suffrage to those who gave such evidence of being actuated by Christian principle that they were willing to receive them into their church , they " hoped to secure also honesty and integrity in the public service , to bring the best men into office ; those who would well understand the public good , and understandingly pursue it . " " They were aware , that such as are the electors , such ultimately will be those who are elected to administer the government . " Their opinion as to the correspondence between the character of laws and the character of those who make them , was summed up in these words : " Governments rather depend upon men , than men upon governments . Let men be good , and the government can not be bad ; if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if men be bad , let the government be never so good , they will endeavor to warp and spoil it to their turn . I know some say , let us have good laws , and no matter for the men who execute them : but let them consider , that though good laws do well , good men do better ; for good laws may // want good men , and be abolished or evaded by ill men ; but good men never want good laws nor suffer ill ones. ** While , then , as a political measure the limitation of the right of suffrage to members of their own church seems a wise one , as a permanent rule for determining the qualifications of voters , it was likely , as Professor Kingsley has shown , to " promote neither their civil nor ecclesiastical interests . The test promised much more than it could accomplish . " And he adds , " hardly any truth has been more fully confirmed by the experience of mankind , than that religious professions like professions of patriotism , may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from which they can honestly proceed . " But even if they failed to devise a sure protection against such incapacity and dissoluteness as they had been familiar with among the magistrates of their native land , they deserve our respect for their attempts to keep out all but wise and good men from positions of authority in the government which they sought to establish . The other principle which they incorporated into their system was this-that they would be " governed by the rules held forth in Scripture . " This principle was perhaps the most important thing of all in the eyes of the whole company of planters . It was peculiar to them . It was the key to all they did ; and undoubtedly was agreed upon before they left England as the foundation of their whole enterprise . There is danger that , in this nineteenth century , we may forget what a great step in advance the New Haven colonists made when they incorporated this idea into the constitution of their young republic . At home the extreme doctrine , as we have already said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " that if princes commanded anything which subjects might not perform , because it is against the laws of God or of Nature , or impossible , yet subjects are bound to undergo the punishment without resisting , or railing , or reviling ; and so to yield a passive obedience where they can not yield an active one . " In opposition to all such views , the purpose of these men was to found a Christian state , where the object should be the " common welfare of all , " as they expressed it ; and where // this " common welfare " was to be sought by making the word of God , as it is found in the Bible , the foundation of all legislation . Or , as Dr. Bacon says : " Christianity  --  the ethics of Christianity-was to be the constitution of the commonwealth , the supreme law of the land . " And he continues : " Never before , save when God brought Israel out of Egypt , had any government been instituted with such an aim . They had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principles of truth and righteousness embodied in the word of God , and the wisdom which He giveth liberally to them that ask Him . They thought that their end , the common welfare of all , ' was to be secured by founding pure and free churches , by providing the means of universal education , and by laws maintaining perfect justice , which is the only perfect liberty . To have failed in such an attempt had been glorious . Their glory is that they succeeded . " But the wisdom displayed by these men in thus making it a part of their " fundamental agreement , " when they formed their " company " in England , that they would be governed by the rules embodied in the Scriptures , till such time as they should be able to make a code of laws specially adapted to their new circumstances in the wilderness , will not fully appear without attention is turned to the political bearing of their action . " They had reason to apprehend that any recognition of the laws of England , however qualified , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own ultimate subjection to the very tyranny from which they had fled . " By thus taking the Scriptures as their guide in the settlement of all their affairs , they hoped that they might escape some of the perils by which they felt themselves to be environed . But apart from any such advantages of a political character which they might hope to reap , they attached the greatest importance to this theory , " that the ethics of Christianity should be the supreme law of the land . " This view has now come to be accepted in this country by Christian people of every name as the only true one ; and it is but right that the men who first distinctly gave utterance to it should not be forgotten , but should be held in grateful and respectful remembrance evermore by the whole American people . Yet strange as it may // seem , there have been those in every generation who have judged of this legislation , through which it was proposed to make Christianity the supreme law of the land , by their own narrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they could jeer at and turn into ridicule . Of all such persons we can only say-So much the worse for them , if they lack the ability to appreciate what honor is due to the men who first attempted to carry it out in practice . On arriving in this country , the planters were in no haste to make any special code of laws . As might be expected , they found a great deal to do . Although they claimed to be a State , they might very properly be regarded , in another point of view , as a large family . They were , in fact , a party of old neighbors , acquaintauces , and friends , and members of the same church . The " general directions of the Scriptures** proved quite sufficient for all their wants . Five years passed away , and still the system worked well , and still they were too much occupied to draw up a formal code , adapted to their new wants ; and it was therefore ordered by the General Court of the jurisdiction in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were delivered by Moses , and as they are a fence to the moral law , being neither typical nor ceremonial , nor having any reference to Canaan , shall be accounted of moral equity , and generally bind all offenders , and be a rule to all the courts in this jurisdiction in their proceedings against offenders , till they be branched out into particulars hereafter " This adoption of the civil laws of the Hebrew commonwealth has been made the theme of so much ridicule , that we shall not hesitate to transfer in full to our pages the admirable discussion of the subject which may be found in Dr. Bacon 's volume of " Historical Discourses . " " Remember now that , situated as they were , they must adopt either the laws of England or some other known system . A system entirely new , they could not frame immediately . Should they then adopt the laws of England as the laws of their young republic ? Those were the very laws from which they had fled . Those laws would subject them at once to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prelates , in their several jurisdictions . The adoption of the laws of England would have been fatal to the // object of their emigration . Should they then adopt the Roman civil law , which is the basis of the jurispru*lence of most countries in Europe ? That system is foreign to the genius of Englishmen , and to the spirit of freedom , and besides , was unknown to the body of the people for whom laws were to be provided . What other course remained to them , if they wished to separate themselves from the power of the enemies who had driven them into banishment , and to provide for a complete and vital independence , but to adopt at once a system of laws which was in every man 's hand , which every man read , and , as he was able , expounded in his family , and with which every subject of the jurisdiction could easily be made familiarly acquainted ? " And what was there of absurdity in this code , considered as a code for just such a settlement as this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raise such a question ? Is it in a Christian country , that the question must be *rgued , whether the Mosaic law , excluding whatever is typical , or ceremonial , or local , is absurd , as the basis or beginning of a system of jurisprudence ? Suppose the planters of Quinnipiack had taken as their rule , in the administration of justice , the laws of Solon , or Lycurgus , or the laws of the twelve tables : suppose the agreement had been , that the laws of King Alfred should be followed in the punishment of offenders , in the settlement of controversies between individuals , and in the division of estates : - where had been the absurdity ? Who will tell us , that the laws of Moses are less wise or equitable than the laws of any other of the legislators of antiquity ? " The laws of Moses were given to a community einig-rating from their native country , into a land which they w*re to acquire and occupy , for the great purpose of maintaining in simplicity and purity the worship of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came hither for the self-same purpose . Their emigration from their native country was a religious emigration . Every other interest of their community was held subordinate to the purity of their religious faith and practice . So far then as this point of comparison is concerned , the laws which were given to Israel in the wilderness may have been suited to the wants of a religious colony planting itself in America . // " The laws of Moses were given to a people who were to live not only surrounded by heathen tribes on every frontier save the seaboard , but also with heathen inhabitants , worshipers of the devil , intermixed among them , not fellow-citizens , but men of another and barbarous race ; and the laws were therefore framed with a special reference to the corrupting influence of such neighborhood and intercourse . Similar to this was the condition of our fathers . The Canaanite was in the land , with his barbarian vices , with his heathenish and hideous superstitions ; and their servants and children were to be guarded against the contamination of intercourse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hebrews were designed for a free people . Under those laws , so unlike all the institutions of oriental despotism , there was no absolute power , and , with the exception of the hereditary priesthood , whose privileges as a class were well balanced by their labors and disabilities , no privileged classes . The aim of those laws was equal and exact justice ; ' and equal and exact justice is the only freedom . Equal and exact justice in the laws , and in the administration of the laws , infuses freedom into the being of a people , secures the widest and most useful distribution of the means of enjoyment , and affords scope for the activity , and healthful stimulus to the affections , of every individuaL The people whose habits and sentiments are formed under such an administration of justice , will be a free people . " But it is worth our while to notice two of the most important effects of their renouncing the laws of England , and adopting the Mosaic law . In the first place , the principle on which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " In England the usage prevailed of giving all real estate to the eldest son . " This is the pillar of the English aristocracy . Let this one principle be taken away ; let estates , instead of passing undivided to a single heir , be divided among many heirs , and that vast accumulation of wealth in the hands of a few great families is at an end . But the Jewish law divides inheritances among all the children , giving to the eldest son , as the head of the family , only a double portion . This promotes equality among the people , breaking up the rich man 's great estate into as many portions as he has children , and thus insuring the con // stant division and general distribution of property . How different is the aspect of this country now , from what it would have been , if the feudal law of inheritance had been from the beginning the law of the land ! How incalculable has been the effect on the character of the people ! " Notice in the next place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inflicting of capital punishments , was made by adopting the Hebrew laws , instead of the laws of England . By the laws of England , more than one hundred and fifty crimes were , till quite lately , punishable with death . By the laws which the New England colonists adopted , this bloody catalogue was reduced to eleven . On such a difference as this , it would be idle to expatiate . In determining what kind of men our fathers were , we are to compare their laws , not with ours , but with the laws which they renounced . The greatest and boldest improvement which has been made in criminal jurisprudence , by any one act , since the dark ages , was that which was made by our fathers , when they determined , that the judicial laws of God , as they were delivered by Moses , and as they are a fence to the moral law , being neither typical , nor ceremonial , nor having any reference to Canaan , shall be accounted of moral equity , and generally bind all offenders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Whatever improvements in this respect we have made since their day , may be resolved into this : - We have learned to distinguish , better than they , between that in the laws of Moses which was of absolute obligation , being founded on permanent and universal reasons only , and that which was ordained in reference to the peculiar circumstances of the Hebrew nation , and which was therefore temporary or locaL " Although we have already gone beyond the limits that we had proposed to ourselves , we can not forbear dwelling for a moment longer on the character of the two great leaders of the New Haven colony . In all New England there were no abler men , or men of more extensive experience , or broader culture , than Theophilus Eaton and John Davenport . Dr. Bacon says , as the result of his study of the public records of the services of Governor Eaton : " I have acquired new views of the dignity which belongs to the place of the // civil magistrate . " Hubbard , the historian of Massachusetts , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man had in him great gifts , and as many excellences as are usually found in any one man . He had an excellent princely face and port , commanding respect from all others . He was a good scholar , a traveler , a great reader ; of an excceding steady and even spirit , not easily moved to passion , and standing unshaken in lids principles when once fixed upon ; of a profound judgment , full of majesty and authority in his judicatures , so that it was a vain thing to offer to brave him out ; and yet in his ordinary conversation , and among friends , of such pleasantness of behavior and such felicity and fecundity of harmless wit as can hardly be paralleled . " Mather declares of him that " for a score of years he was the glory and pillar of New Haven colony . " He says of him , " He carried in his very countenance a majesty which can not be described ; and in his dispensations of justice , he was a mirror for the most imitable impartiality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the obligations which the oath of a judge lays upon him . Hence he who would most patiently bear hard things offered to his person in private cases , would never pass by any public affronts or neglects , when he appeared under the character of a magistrate . But he still was the guide of the blind , the staff of the lame , the helper of the widow and the orphan , and all the distressed . None that had a good cause was afraid of coming before him . " The same writer describes him also as he appeared at home : " As in his government of the commonwealth , so in the government of his family , he was prudent , serious , happy to a wonder ; and albeit he sometimes had a large family , consisting of no less than thirty persons , vet he managed them with such an even temper , that observers have affirmed they never saw a house ordered with more wisdom . " " He kept an honorable and hospitable table . " " He countenanced the addresses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their inquiries. ** And we find still another witness in one who had been a servant in his family , whose beautiful testimony reminds us of what that ablest of all modern English critics , so gifted with the power of insight-Samuel Taylor Coleridge-said respecting the character of Falconbridge , in " King John , " and the inferen // ces he drew respecting his courtesy and chivalrous spirit , from the single reply addressed to him by his old servant , " James Gurney . " Falcoubridge requests the attendant to withdraw , saying , " James Gurney , wilt thou give us leave awhile ? " And the answer is , " Good leave , good Philip . " To which Falconbridge replies , " James , There 's toys abroad . Anon I 'll tell thee more . " This other New Haven servant could say , many years after his master 's death : " Whatever difficulty in my daily walk I now meet withal , still something that I either saw or heard in my blessed master Eaton 's conversation , helped me through it alL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had enjoyed in his youth all the advantages of education which the universities of his native land could afford . While still but a young man , he became one of the prominent clergymen of London . While there , he enjoyed advantages of seeing the world in all its phases . " He was acquainted with great men and great things . " Living in a country and in an age in which " religion was a matter of political regulation , " he became attracted to that great patriotic party which arose for the salvation of the liberties of England ; " which stood for popular rights ; for law against prerogative ; for the doctrine that kings and magistrates were made for the people , and not the people for kings-that ministers were made for the church , and not the church for ministers . " Driven from England , his thoughts turned to the consideration of the great political questions which were then everywhere so much discussed . He conceived original views respecting the nature of government , its origin , the end which it should aim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accomplished , the soundness and the value of which the world is learning to-day to appreciate more and more . He displayed a good sense , a wide comprehension of the whole subject , as tested by the severe ordeal of the experience of more than two hundred years , which was not surpassed in that age by any man whatever in England , on the continent of Europe , or in America . Having removed to this wilderness , he was not forgotten by the lead- // 291 1871. ing men of the Puritan party at home . When , in the progress of time , the struggle for popular rights there came to a crisis , and the great Revolution had commenced , letters were sent from members of both houses of parliament " earnestly inviting him " as a wise master-builder to return , at least for a season , " in order to assist in conducting it to a happy issue . " But the people of New Haven " could not see their way clear to spare him for so long a time as such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ post . Here for thirty years he continued to display a diligence in all that pertained to the duties of his special calling , a self-sacrificing generosity , a magnanimity , which secured for him the strong and reverent affection of his people to the end . His devotion to the interests of popular education , and to all that was needed for the permanent welfare of the colony was untiring . Yet he did not allow himself to be absorbed with public affairs . As a scholar , he manifested the same devotion to study which had led him when in London " to protract his lucubrations into the late hours of the night . " As a preacher , he maintained the reputation among his contemporaries of being " a person beyond compare for all ministerial abilities . 7 As a man , he was one of the truly noble characters of his generation ; dignified , and courteous ; ever manifesting iniplicit confidence in God , and a strong sense of duty . He was known and honored for his virtues and his great public services , throughout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Nov . ANGLLI* AC EccLESLE ORNAMENTUM ET MORTUUS , UTRIUSQUE TRISTE DESIDERIUM . We will say one word also of the colonists themselves . The intellectual and moral endowments of the " company " as a whole were estimated very highly at the time in the other neighboring colonies . It was not alone their two leaders who were men of mark . Hubbard speaks of " the eminency of sundry other persons who were suited for civil offices , and capable to manage those of a vaster territory than this ( New Haven ) was , or was ever like to be . " The character of these men appears from the fact that in eighteen successive annual elections , // they made such a man as Theophilus Eaton their chief magistrate ; and for thirty years , through all sorts of changes , they adhered to their honored pastor , with constant attachment . " From what has been said by some of the revilers of these colonists , it might be supposed that they were a company of weak and enthusiastic men , easily led and managed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Weak , enthusiastic people , easily managed by one man to-day , will be just as easily led by another to-morrow . " The lasting hold , which their two leaders had over them , had its seat in the understandings and affections of the people . " It was none other than the power of intellectual superiority , combined with unquestionable worth . ' An intelligent and independent community , who could appreciate for 50 long a period the virtues of such leaders , were without a doubt themselves possessed in no small degree of the same virtues . This exhibition of mutual confidence and affection displayed here for so many years between the leaders and those who were led , is certainly creditable to both . We said , at the commencement of this Article , that we had no expectation that anything that could be said would ever effectually put an end to the circulation of this miserable calumny about the " Blue Laws " of the New Haven colony . It furnishes such a convenient weapon , and can be so easily made to serve the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it will probably continue to be repeated for a hundred years to come . Yet we think that we have shown , to the satisfaction of all who are really desirous of knowing the truth , that the character of the colony as a whole , and especially the character of its distinguished leaders , was such that these " laws " could by no possibility ever have been enacted . We will add , that there is not the shadow of evidence that they were ever in existence . The records of the courts , and of all the public proceedings of the colony , remain in perfect preservatiou to this day . They have been published , together with the code which Governor Eaton was directed in 1665 to draw up , and are everywhere easily accessible ; and there is no trace in them of anything of the kind . However , our work will not be done , till we give an explanation of the way in which this libel originated . // Yet we feel a certain reluctance about devoting any space at all to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which very many of our readers are well acquainted . Still there are others who need to be informed ; and it would seem as if about once in a score of years it was a matter of necessity , though a disagreeable one , to repeat the explanation . We shall endeavor to make it as brief as possible . We pass over then to a period nearly a hundred years distant from the settlement of New Haven , to a time when it had become incorporated with the colony of Connecticut The colony , too , which had been established at the mouth of the Hudson river , under the auspices of the Dutch West India Company , had come under the control of the English crown . The state of things which ensued has been so graphically described by Dr. Bacon ( New Englander , April No. 1866 , pp. 292-305 ) , that we shall transfer a brief quotation from his Article to our pages . " Already the Church of England was virtually the established Church , in that province . * * It was also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ecclesiastical conformity with England would greatly promote their loyalty , and the permanence of their dependence on the crown . The royal governors of New York were therefore doing whatever in their power they could do to show that the English conquest of that province from the Dutch had brought in the Church of England ; and that English ascendeucy was the ascendency of the English prayer-book , and the English hierarchy , no less than of the English language . * * From the moment that New Amsterdam became New York , the royal power , with the pomp and prestige attendant on a royal government , was nearer to Connecticut than it had ever been before . The almost independent selfgovernment instituted by the founders of the colony , and confirmed by a charter from King Charles II , had become precarious . Its dissolution , and the reduction of the people into an immediate and entire dependence on the crown were confidently expected by all malcontents , and eagerly helped on by those who thought that under royal governors , like Andros and // Cornbury , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a Puritan people . " The " Society for the propagation of the Gospel " was meanwhile established in England to help on this important work . Under its direction , missionaries of the Church of England entered New England at the nearest point , which was of course Connecticut ; and a few congregations were gathered by them in different places in the colony . It is very natural that , under these circumstances , mutual jealousies should spring up . The people of Connecticut who had been for two or three generations on the soil were simple in their manners , strongly attached to the faith of their fathers , and proud of the liberties which they enjoyed under their charter . The English emigrants who had been attracted to the newly acquired province of New York were generally in hearty sympathy in their religious views with the most extreme claims of the High Church party , and in politics were Tories . When they left home , the Puritan party which had done so much for the liberties of England , was in disgrace . Its principles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon everything and everybody belonging to it . Even if these emigrants had any of them been moderate in their views at home , the tendency , when once in New York under the rule of a royal governor , was to magnify more and more all the institutions of their native land , and especially the power and the dignity of the king , from whom was to come all favor and advancement ; and in the same way to despise those sturdy republican neighbors with whom they were not unfrequently brought into collision , and whom they found so contented with their independence , and their self government . Now it is to be remembered that , in those days when all traveling was attended with every kind of difficulty , New Haven-which was the nearest town of importance , and the one with which they had most to do-was to them practically " New England . " It was the part of New England about which they knew the most , and that part of it which they pictured to themselves whenever " New England " was spoken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stories , true or false , which in any way redounded to the discredit of the descendants of the // Puritans , anywhere throughout all New England , were at once , in the common apprehension of the people of New York and of all those in other places who possessed the same sympathies , attached to New Haven ; and this colony was made to bear the burden . And when these advocates of arbitrary and hereditary right learned , as they soon did , the early history of New Haven ; and found that -- in accordance with the principles afterwards avowed in the " Declaration " of 1776-an independent government had once been set up here by voluntary compact ; and that those who did it had done so with the belief that their own elected magistrates had " as perfect an authority to exercise all the functions of government as any potentate on earth , " they were astounded at the " bigotry " and the " fanaticism " displayed ! " The doctrine that the majesty of a state , with laws and powers ordained of God , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands of a few exiles under the rafters of a barn , with no sanction of papal bull or royal charter , " inspired them with bitter and relentless hatred . Henceforth they could believe any stories about this Puritan city , however absurd ! Massachusetts and Plymouth were too far removed from their range of vision , for anything about either of them , even though it were true , to remain long in their memories connected with those particular colonies . If they heard of the enactment in a former age of sumptuary laws in those distant regions , or laws with regard to tobacco , or laws in regulation of the dress of females , they soon forgot the locality , and fell into the habit of laying them to the charge of New Haven , where it is to be always remembered there was never artytlung of the kind / New Haven was situated on the frontier , and had to take the brunt of everything . But the spirit of independence was rapidly spreading . Mr. Bancroft tells us that after a time even the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England " in their efforts for " a liberal constitution . " The opening days of the IRevolntion dawned , and now was seen at last the triumph of those principles so long misunderstood , and so lQng derided ; to es* tablish which John Davenport and Theophilus Eaton left their homes and braved all the terrors of the wilderness in 1638. // But there were royalists in the different colonies , as is well known , who could have no sympathy with what they felt to be the frenzy which had impelled the American people to cast off their allegiance to Great Britain . Among them were some of the most respected persons in the country , for whose conscientious convictions we feel all proper respect . There were others whose conduct in that crisis has justly excited universal contempt . Among the number of those included in the last class is Dr. Samuel Peters ; who , " at the commencement of the revolutionary war , was an Episcopal missionary at Hebron , Connecticut As he was very active in asserting the royal claims , he became obnoxious to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mob ; though it is believed no personal violence was done him . About 1774 he went to England , highly exasperated against his country , and especially against his native State . He employed himself while the war continued , in reviling the colonists ; and , in 1781 , published in London , without his name , what he called A general History of Connecticut , from the first settlement under George Fenwick , Esq. , to its latest period of amity with Great Britain ; including a description of the country , and many curious and interesting anecdotes . ' " In this " History " were collected all the extravagant stories that had been set afloat during the previous fifty years to gratify the stupidity of those among the lower classes in New York who were descended from the Dutch , or the hatred of the most bitter of the British royalists . This " History " is the first and the only " authority " for the " Blue Laws " which were attributed to the early New Haven colonists . Professor Kingsley says ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work first appeared , its extravagances and falsehoods were so apparent and gross , that any attempt to contradict or expose them , was considered unnecessary and superfluous . The work was evidently designed chiefly , to render the people of Connecticut odious and despicable abroad ;  --  but its abuse was so outrageous , and its statements so opposed to the most notorious facts , that even with respect to foreigners , it was thought to need no refutation . There were , however , in Connecticut , at the time this pretended History appeared , individuals who sympathized strongly with its author . They had // cherished the same antipathies and resentments as Peters himself ; and as the English interest declined in the United States , they were glad to seize even upon such support , as this miserable farrago afforded them . Its stories were to their taste ; and they repeated them so often , as apparently to create in themselves a sort of belief in the truth of some of them . The credit , however , acquired by this work was never extensive ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to call for direct animadversion . Dr. Trumbull once told me , in reply to the question , why , in his History of Connecticut , he had made no allusion to this work of Dr. Peters ,  --  that he had considered a reference to it as wholly unnecessary ; since any one , on very slight examination , would see that it was refuted in so many of its statements by indubitable public documents , that it could gain no credit He said , that he had been well acq&amp;iainted with Dr. Peters from very early life ( I think he stated that they were both natives of Hebron ) , that they were contemporary in college ( Dr. Peters graduated at Yale College in 1757 , Dr. Trumbull in 1759 ) , and that an occasional intercourse between them had been maintained , till Dr. Peters went to England in 177 He added , that of all men with whom he had ever been acquainted , Dr. Peters , he had thought , from his first knowledge of him , the least to be depended upon as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " According to Dr. Peters , the epithet " blue** was applied to the laws of New Haven because these laws were thought to be peculiarly sanguinary ; and he says that " blue ' * is here equivalent to " bloody . " *Ye have already called attention to the fact that while , according to the laws of England , one hundred and fifty crimes were punishable with death , in New Haven the catalogue was reduced at once to eleven . And if there was , at that time , any distinction between New Haven and the other united colonies of New England , the distinction was in favor of New Haven for mildness . It may be worth while to give a few specimens , from which the character of the work can be judged . We will not select those which are more manifestly exaggerations , for many of these are too well known . But with regard to Yale College , for instance , he says : " Thdmas Peters established a school in // Saybrook , which his children had the satisfaction to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " At his death , which did not happen till after the restoration of Charles II , he bequeathed his library to the school above mentioned . " Professor Kingsley says : " There is not the slightest evidence , that there was any early school in Saybrook , higher than a common school ; or any school whatever , to which the Rev. Thomas Peters left a library . As to Yale College , it was founded and incorporated without any reference to Saybrook ; and it owed its origin , in no sense , to any school before existing there , or any where else . This story was probably told to give in England the credit of beginning the college to one of the name of Peters . " IDr . Peters says : " Exact in tything mint and anise , the furies of Ne*v Haven for once affected the weightier matters of justice . They had no title to the land : they applied to Quinnipiog , the sachem , for a deed or grant of it . The sachem refused to give the lands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and immediately voted themselves to be the children of God , and that the wilderness , in the utmost parts of the earth , was given to them . This vote became a law forever after . It is true , Davenport endeavored to christgan ire Quinnipiog , but in vain : however , he converted Sunksquaw , one of his subjects , by presents and great promises ; and then Sunksquaw betrayed his master , and the settlers killed him . This assassination of Quinuipiog brought on a war between the English and Indians , which never ended by treaty of peace . The Indians , having only bows and arrows , were driven back into the woods ; whilst the English , with their swords and guns , kept possession of the country . But conscious of their XTant of title to it , they voted Sunksquaw to be Sachem , and that whoever disputed his authority should suffer death . Sunksquaw , in return , assigned to the English those lands , of which they had made him Sachem . Lo ! here is all the title @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Professor Kingsley says : " The story here told is an entire fabrication ; there being no foundation whatever for it in fact . The Indian deed to the English , of the territory of Quinnipiac , is on record ; and the conveyance was made by eight Sachems , one of whom // was a female . No mention is made in the records , or in any other writings , before this History by Peters was published , of any such Sachem as Quinnipiog , or Sunksquaw , or of any contest with the Indians . All the records , traditions , and the accounts published in the other colonies , which have any relation to the transactions of the first settlers of New Haven with the natives , are irreconcilable with this story . It is the sheer production of malice and resentment , and made up in utter disregard of truth . ' Dr. Peters says : " New Haven is built on a plain , which is divided into three hundred squares , of the size of Bloomsburysquare , with streets twenty yards wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built upon , having houses of brick and stone on each front , above five yards asunder : every house with a garden , that produces vegetables sufficient for the family . Two hundred houses are annually erected . " Professor Kingsley says : " New Haven , at the time this was written , had probably not more than four hundred and twenty houses , ten or twelve of which may have been of brick or stone . " The object in giving this exaggerated description of the wealth and importance of New Haven was probably to induce the English government to fit out a military expedition against it , as they did , in fact , a short time after . But it is hardly worth while to spend any more time on this perfectly untrustworthy book . No person in America , who knew anything about the history of his country , ever seriously quoted Dr. Peters 's " History " as an authority on any subject whatever . The " Comic History of England , " or the " Travels of Baron Munchausen , " would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious purpose . And yet this falsehood about the " Blue Laws , " which was thus first concocted for a purpose , has a vitality , which , in some of its aspects , is amusing . The writer of these pages , at the time of the two hundredth anniversary of the first settlement of New Haven , when Professor Kingsley so effectually demonstrated the utter impossibility that such laws could have been ever in existence , was assured with the utmost positiveness by an aged lady of his acquaintance that she had the best of reasons for believing in them , for she had not only often heard them talked about and quoted ; but in fact she had then a copy of the veritable " Blue Laws** in // her possession , which she esteemed as one of her greatest treasures . On being requested to produce the curious document , after some search she brought forth a somewhat dilapidated copy of an old edition of the well known " Statutes of Connecticut , " and triumphantly pointed to the blue paper with which they were bound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our respected friend of the delusion which she had cherished during a long life . The laws of Connecticut in a blue cover was evidently a suspicions circumstance ; and we doubt if she did not continue to the end of her life a staunch believer in the " Blue Laws . " We were intending to give some account of the progress of this falsehood since the days of Samuel Peters ; but it seems hardly worth the space which would be required . We can assure our readers , however , that it would make an amusing episode . Every few years , some fierce hater of the Puritans comes across the story in some out-of-the-way place , and thinks he has discovered a rare bit of history which will show up their narrowness and bigotry . Straightway , it is brought out with a great flourish of trumpets , and the unfortunate book-maker finds himself to his surprise , the object of universal laughter . And now another phase of the comedy is pretty sure to follow . Some honest , painstaking , unsophisticated , good man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , picks the " code " up from this book , after it has been forgotten by every one else , and incorporates it in a really respectable volume ; and so , once more on such authority , it gains a new resurrection ! We will give . only a single example . Some years ago , a Mr. Henry Caswell resided for a time in this country . His ignorance , and his antipathies , would seem to have been of the kind to expose him to be caught in just such a trap . The consequence was that , in a book which he published , these " Blue Laws " were paraded in all their length and breadth , and he gave as his authority the historian Hutcliinson . But unfortunately for him , Hutchinson died before Samuel Peters had concocted the " code , " and of course never alluded to it . Mr. Caswell probably reasoned thus : The " laws " are undoubtedly genuine . Hutchinson therefore gives a full account of them . Consequently // 301 the inquiring student will be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in " ilutchinson . " We hardly need to add that Mr. Caswell 's book was utterly worthless ; and it is now valuable only for the fact that it misled a very respectable English author , the Rev. Isaac Taylor . He seems to have chanced upon the book , and , in the honesty of his heart , supposed that any statement on the subject of American history made by an Englishman who had resided for a time in the United States must be trustworthy , especially if it was supported by " Hutchinson , " of whom it is doubtful if he had ever heard . Accordingly in his turn Mr. Taylor found a place for the " Blue Laws " in his book , " Words and Places , " and clinched the whole thing as he thought by referring to " ilutchinson . " Now Mr. Taylor , being somewhat known in the United States , was written to on the subject , as we happen to know , by a gentleman who is probably the highest living authority on all questions pertaining to the early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story was a forgery . The writer of the letter was the lIon . J. Hammond Trumbull , for some years Secretary of State for the State of Connecticut . We hardly need add that the opinion of the highest law officer in England with regard to the genuineness of some supposed English statute  --  and one known , moreover , by all English historical students to be a forgery-would not be any more conclusive . Now what was the result ? Mr. Taylor has since published a second edition of his " Words and Places , " and adds in a note , the kind considerateness of which is deserving of grateful acknowledgment : " Since the first edition of Words and Places ' was published , I have received a letter from an American correspondent , in which he informs me that these so-called Blue Laws ' are a forgery . My correspondent assigns no reasons , but I sincerely hope his statement is correct . " And now to return to the statements about the " Blue Laws " in Blaclcwood 's Aifagazine , which have led to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were prepared by some person who knew very little respecting the subject about which he was writing . From the internal evidence , we should judge that the author had gone to some public library , and had there collected // a mass of pencil notes which he could not afterwards decipher , and whose relation to one another he could not remember . At all events he has made an odd jumble . * So what we complain of ; in this case , is not deliberate misrepresentation . It is the persistent and malignant hostility to this eQuntry and everything connected with it , of which every number of the Magazine for years has furnished a greater or less number of exampies . This particular Article is only another illustration of the readiness which it always manifests to catch at any idle story which can be dressed up in such a way as to damage our repu-. tation , without caring in the least whether the story is true or false . The unexpected places , and unexpected connections , in which uncalled for sneers , insulting comparisons , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will crop out , has long been a matter of amusement with all in this country who look over its pages . We Americans are in the habit of receiving very severe lectures from our English friends respecting the unscrupulous character of our newspaper press . We do not deny that there are newspapers here which are bad enough ; but , really , as far as the treatment of this country is concerned , we doubt if there is hny paper in America more unscrupulous than Blackwood 's Miagazine . Its abuse was at its hottest at the time of the slaveholders ' rebellion . We take at random a specimen . In January , 1865 , we find the following : " Another cause also contributed not a little to the continuance of this struggle  --  the immense notoriety it has attracted throughout the world to America and the Americans . These people , for the first time in their lives , found themselves an object of European interest . Up to this time they had been little known as a people on this side of the Atlantic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curious taste in drinks , had certainly been associated with their name ; but beyond gun-stocks and gin juleps , sherry cobblers and Indiarubber boots , they had not been supposed to have conferred much on humanity . To become suddenly famous as a great military nation was then an immense bribe to national vanity . Hitherto it was their boast to consume more pdt6 de foie gras , more champagne , and more Parisian finery , than any other peo // pie ; but what if they could rival France in glory as well as gluttony ? * * * * * * " Now , I am much disposed to believe that these people would have made peace long ago if we had not given them so much of our attention and our interest . If , instead of sending out our own graphic correspondent to describe , and our artist to draw them , we had treated the whole as a vulgar commonplace row , from which there was no one useful lesson to be learned , moral or military : - had we ignored them in our journals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our platforms omitted all their dreary lamentations over fratricidal conflict ' and decimating war , ' my conviction is , the combatants would have been chewing the cud of peace together two years since . " You made a ring for them , and what could they do but fight ? You backed this one against that , and they went in with a will , only too proud to attract so respectable an audience , and be a matter of notoriety to such a well-dressed company . Had you really been sincere you would have turned your backs on the performance . Had you felt half the horror you pretend , you would have gone home and declared the sight too disgusting to look on . * * * * " You can not make marshals of France out of drab-coated Philadelphians or pedantic Bostonians , any more than you can make the very names of their battle'flelds ring in verse . " Think of IRancocus , Little Lick , Spottsylvania , and Funksville , and ask * Yankee laureate to commemorate them . What are poets to do with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , redolent as they are of liquoring up ' and the tobacco quid ? " Now it was in the spirit of this Article that our country was treated during all those long years . Abuse of all kinds was heaped upon us . The artfulness with which everything that happened was misrepresented so as to appear to our disadvantage would have been consummate , if the mark had not been overshot so completely . As it was , it afforded a monthly feast of amusement . And we do not forget , in this connection , another of those dastardly sneers which were then so common in Blackwood . // Its writers seemed never to weary of slandering our sofdiers as " mercenaries , " and of declaring that they were nearly all of " foreign birth . " It would be worse than idle to say one word now for the purpose of refuting that old calumny . We do not need to state that there is not a village in the whole length and breadth of the North which did not freely give , from first to last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the winter 's snow is now fast disappearing from the low mounds which mark the last resting places of the brave men who fell in the conflict , their names , carved in marble on the headstones that look down on the faded wreaths and whitened flags that are coming once more to the light of day , are , in their full proportion , and far more than their full proportion , the familiar English . Puritan , names of the colonists who originally came to Plymouth , to Massachusetts , to Connecticut , and to New Haven . But our subj ect does not require that we should speak in praise of the other united colonies of New England . They need no praise from us . We speak only for New Haven ; and we can say that the " roll of honor " of her University , which bears the name of one of the members of the family of her first Governor , shows that the example and the principles of Theophilus Eaton are still held in honor , for YALE contributed a larger number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole country . And , among the noble dead from the ranks of her yo*ing men , she mourns to-day one who bore the familiar name of WINTHROP - a descendant of the first Governor of Connecticut under the charter , and of many other men eminent in American history-one of the first costly sacrifices of the war , who fell lamented by the whole country ; - and that other , whose memory is still so green in the hearts of all - chivalrous , frank , fearless , possessed of that culture and those accomplishments which seemed to insure him early one of the highest places in the regards of his countrymen-WILLIAM WHEELER-worthy representative of his distinguished ancestor , JOHN DAVENPORT .
