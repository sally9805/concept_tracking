txt Serious charges against Gen. M. C. Butler , who at present represents the State of South Carolina in the United States Senate , were made and sullstantiated in the suit of Lysander D. Childs and John P. Southern against William E. Everett and others , the judgment roll in which has just been filed in the County Clerk 's Office , in this City . Prom the facts as disclosed , it would seem that " Hamburg Massacre " . Butler is as much an adept at selling his influence where great public trusts are involved as he was in the line of conduct which resulted in affixing to him the pseudonym by which he is at present popularly known . The disreputable conduct on the part ' of Butler is evidenced by the most conclusive testimony , namely , the testimony , of his own handwriting . Concisely summed up , Butler 's conduct was this , that , while a delegate to the Tax-payers ' Convention of the State of South Carolina he made a bargain with a number of persons engaged in a speculation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his influence as a member of the convention to further the schemes of the speculators ; that in consideration for such conduct on his part he was to receive 10 per cent . of the profits which should accrue to the speculation from the action of the convention ; and that he really performed his share of the bargain . The story of Butler 's perfidy and the manner in which it was disclosed form an interesting narrative which has hitherto been untold . The suit of Messrs . Childs and Southern , which has resulted ii making public the facts connected with Butler 's venality , was begun in the Supreme Court in this City for the purpose of having an accounting in regard to the venture in South Carolina bonds which has been referred to . The plaintiffs alleged that they and the defendants entered into an agreement ? in April , 1871 , for the purchase and sale of the bonds in question . The parties advanced- various sums of money , and were , according to their compact , to share proportionately in the gains or losses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have it , the venture resulted in a loss , and the outstanding debts and liabilities having been , as alleged by the plaintiffs , paid by the latter , they sued for an ? accounting , &c.; Everett , in his answer , made a general denial , and then went on to allege that on or about March 1 , 1871 , an agreement had been made between the parties to the action and M. C. Butler and M. W. Gary by which it was coyemitted and agreed " that in consideration of and on condition that Butler and Gary would , by their personal influence or any other means they might employ , induce the convention then about to assemble at Columbia , in that State , to pass certaid resolutions , the purport of which was then agreed upon by the parties , touching the financial condition of the State of South Carolina , which would produce the effect of enhancing the value of the bonds of said . State in the market  --  at that time very low . " The scheme was , so said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy in such quantities of bonds as they might determine among themselves , the whole number of bonds to be so many as would at par value amount to $400,000 . These bonds were to be purchased at the low prices then prevailing , and were to be held " for the rise to be produced by the action of the convention . " They were then to be sold at a profit , and out of such profit Butler and Gary were to be paid " for their services in inducing the action of the convention a percentage of 10 per cent of said profits so realized by each on the amount of bonds bought and sold . " As a matter of defense , Everett insisted that such agreement was contrary to public policy and . therefore , null and void . The case was sent for trial before John S. Lawrence of this City , as Referee , and sworn testimony was introduced before him touching the matters in dispute . lie reported in favor of the plaintiffs . Among his findings of fact are seine which show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Referee found that it had been arranged and agreed between the parties " that such agreement would be made in case influence could be secured with certain members of the convention called the Tax-payers ' Convention , which was about to be held in Columbia . S. C. ; by which the convention would recognize the then existing debt of South Carolina ; The agreement itself , conclusively showing Butler 's guilt , which was introduced and sworn to before the Referee , is as follows : Wm. 0 . Courtenay , John B. Palmer , Wm . E. Everett , James S. Murdock , Columbia , S. C. , Robt . Murdock , Charleston , S. C. New-York . Address P. 0 . Box 2,644 . OFFICE OF COURTESAY , EVERETT &; Co. , No. 83 PEARL-STREET , NEW-YORK , 187 ? . Whereas , the undersigned being desirous to take action to reinstate the value of the bonded debt of the State of South Carolina : It is hereby agreed the undersigned to agree to pay to M. C. Butler and M. W. Gary 10 per cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchase and sale of at least $500,000 of said State bonds , the increase to be measured by the advance due from an indorsement of the-public meeting to be held on or about the third day of May next , at Columbia , approving the payment in full of all the present bonded debt of the State , and agree to use their best efforts to that effect . in consideration of said 10 per cent . aforesaid mentioned . NEw-YORK , April 17 , ' 71 . ( Signed , ) W. E. EVERETT . L. D. CHILDS , J. B. PALMER , by L. D. Childs , J. P. SOUTHERN . We accept the terms of the above agreement . ( Signed , ) M. C. BUTLER , att'y , &c.; M. W. GARY , att'y at law . The M. W. Gary above mationed , who participated with Butler in the fraud on the persons who had intrusted their interests to this precious couple , was from the same countyEdgefield  --  as Butler , and is now one of the State Senators of South Carolina , and singularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that body . With the 10 per cent . inducement constantly before their minds Messrs . Butler and Gary did the best they could to earn their money , that is by doing the work in the convention which they had agreed to do . The conventton met at Columbia on May 9 , 1871 , and continued its sessions until the close of May 12 , 1871 . Its proceedings were published by its order . From this it appears that 30 out of the 32 counties of the State sent delegates , and that R. K. Scott , then Governor of the State , was among those admitted to the privileges of the floor . The convention was a non-pertisan one , and honestly designed to meet and grapple with the existing burdens of the State , which bore heavily on the property-owners . Hon. D. H. Chamberlain , afterward Governor , recognizing the great amount of good the convention might bring about , appeared there as one of the delegates from Richland County . Butler and Gary represented Edgefield County , and Richard Lathers , who has since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seat in the New-York State Senate from Westchester County , was one of the Charleston delegates . The proceedings of the convention not only show how Butler and Gary did their 10 per cent . work , but , viewed in the light of the present disclosures , are in parts exceedingly ludicrous . Thus , on page 15 of the printed report of the proceedings ; it appears that Butler nominated Gary for permanent President , and , that the latter- , annazantLv seeing that as presiding officer his chances of useful ness to the bond speculation would be curtailer ? declined , saying that he was not there as an aspirant for any office , " but as a representative of the people of Edgefield . " Ho said that he had no ambition , and was unwilling that by the use of his name " the harmony of the convention should be disturbed . " He concluded by remarking : " I do think , at a time like the present , when we ? are oppressed , we should present ' a united front ; we should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I must decline the nomination . " W. D. Porter , of Charleston , who had been previously nominated , was then chosen permanent President , and Butler was elected as First Vice-President . Almost immediately after the organization had been effected Butler introduced and procured the adoption of a resolution referring to the bonded debt of the State and calling for the appointment of a committee of eleven in regard to such debt . The committee were directed to confer with Gov . Scott on the subject , and most of the important topics before the convention were referred to such committee , of which  --  as a matter of course  --  Butler was Chairman . Col. Richard - Lathers , of Westchester County , N. ? Y. , was a member of the committee . Gary was made Chairman of the Committee on Election and Suffrage Laws , and in speaking on the adoption of his report gave ' utterance to the following remarks , which show how well he and Butler knew the solemn character of the trust they were abusing : " I would ask , why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Why have the wise men of the State met in council ? From the fact that taxes have been levied by the present Legislature which , in our impoverished condition , we are unable to pay . To say that these abuses of the Government have been effected by the Republican or Radical Party would be unjust , for it would be a gross misnomer to dignify those now in power by any party name . They are known by all honest men , North , South , East , and West , irrespective of party alliances , as thieves and robbers ; for they are not governed by , nor to they regard the principles and policy embodied in the platform of , the Republican Party . We ' have assembled , then , to take counsel against these abuses of power , to represent the intelligence and the tax-payers of South Carolina , and to enter a solemn protest against the past record of those in power . " Butler , with his committee of eleven , went to work with a will , and on May 12 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the bonded debt of the State . The grand total of such debt was set down at $8,865,908 98 . Besides this there were $1,800,000 of bonds which had been pledged for a loan of $800,000 of cash advances . The committee recommended , that the Governor be requested to confer with the financial agent of the State and to telegraph to New-York not to sell any more bonds of the State at less than SO per cent. ; thathe be requested to proceed to New-York and to make the most economical arrangement possible for holding the $1,800,000 of bonds referred to until the limit of 80 per cent . became " attainable . " The committee also recommended the application of part of the $1,800,000 of bonds in satisfaction of a part of a debt of $994,000 , of which $744,000 were overdue and $250,000 about to become due at that time . The $744,000 , the committee stated , constituted so much of the lire loan debt for ' which the capital of the bank of the State was pledged , and they " indulged in the hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then follows this very significant paragraph in the committee 's report " It may be reasonably objected to these suggestions that the present market price of the bonds is only 65 per cent. , while the calculations made proceed on the basis of 80 per cent . for the bonds . But it is quite reasonable to expect that , upon this exhibition of the exact condition of the deiit of the State , and upon the concurrence of his Excellency the Governor in the general course of arrangements herein recommended , there will be an immediate and considerable advance in the market value of the bonds , and greatly increased facilities for holding them off the market . " Tho resolutions which they recommended. , and which were adopted , show conclusively , ' if any proof were ? wanting , how hard Butler tried to gain the 10 per cent . The first two of these are as follows : Resolved , As the sense of this convention , that the funded debt of the State , as described in the report of the Committee of Eleven of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honor and - funds-  of-the State are lawfully pledged for the redemption thereof . Resolved , That the general plan for the arrangement of the funded debt , suggested by the committee , be recommended to the favorable consideration of his Excellency the Governor .
