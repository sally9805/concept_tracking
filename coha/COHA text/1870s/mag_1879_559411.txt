GERMAN SOCIALISM IN AMERICA . " No one who watches events which are now happening can doubt that , if Socialism should continue to advance with so much rapidity as it has lately shown in Germany and the United States , the day is not far distant when the Socialists will be able to control the legislations of these countries . " SUCH were the warning words recently uttered at the English University of Cambridge by the eminent economist and member of Parliament , Mr. Henry Fawcett . There is little doubt that most Americans who have chanced to notice this prophecy have summarily dismissed it with the consoling reflection that there is no danger , because there is no truth in Mr. Fawcett 's fears . Yet the mere partial fulfillment of these forebodings would mark a change more momentous than any that is recorded in the history of our race . To examine in detail , however , the origin and progress of modern Socialism , or the certain consequences which the triumph of its principles would involve , is no purpose of the present paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view , it will be necessary to cast a cursory glance at the growth and doctrines of the new creed , before approaching a subject which is but a branch of the parent tree that has fastened its roots in the countries of the Old World . In studying the operations of surrounding society the conclusions of the modern mind are ordinarily determined by certain antecedent conditions . Results are predicted by certain rules or laws , fixed and formulated by the light of repeated and recorded experience . While science has become a history , history has become a science . Given to the modern historian certain premises , his conclusions are at hand , and his inferences are ordinarily derived with the same certainty with which the chemist forecasts the com // bination of atoms . So it became possible for Edmund Burke to predict the effects of the French Revolution , and thus the powerful mind of Pitt foresaw the inevitable fall of Napoleon . Men so short-sighted as Jefferson may have seen in the outburst of the French Revolution the dawn of an era of universal happiness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of history , the salient and inevitable results of the people 's reign could be predicted with the same precision with which Leverrier foretold the existence of a new planet . And why ? For the simple reason that in various guises " all this had been before . " From time immemorial modern society had formed two great camps . The men who had all to gain had striven with the men who had all to lose . The one side formed the defensive , the other the offensive party . The one became the party of conservatism , the other the party of reaction . No sooner had the democrats reached the coveted goal of wealth than , like Juno , a goddess in pursuit but a cloud in possession , the principles of the pursuer vanished with the attainment of his end . The ardent democrat of yesterday became the stanch conservative of to-day . The democracy of one era became the conservatism of the succeeding one . The dream of one age was the science of the next . Again and again the mass of the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society was declared not sufficiently elastic to meet the strain . Each fresh generation had asked itself the question , How far can radicalism advance without bursting the bonds of society ? And each time the question was solved by repeating it . But the cause of strife  --  the summum 1*onum-had been wealth alone . And there could be no radical displacement of the fundamental fabric of society , so long as all parties stood on the one ground of the supreme value of property . The aim and the object of all classes were identical . They all bowed down to Mammon . Suddenly , within the memory of men still living , there sprang into existence , in full panoply , a counter party  --  a counter revolution , nominally endowed with public and universal aims , and destined to redeem the great mass of human sufferers by organized and orderly confederation . Hitherto our civilization had been one of property . It was now proposed to make it one of competency . Universal cooperation was to take the place of universal competition . The capi-* talist and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of society . State effort was to supplant individual effort , and the central Government to be controlled and governed by universal and united // cooperation . It was for the first time proposed to Swedenborgianize society by investing every man with a dynamic value in the mechanism of state . Never before had this doctrine been advanced . Never had it been known to cast before it even the faintest shadow . Neither the republican society of Plato , of Fourier , or of Babeuf ; nor the hierarchical and aristocratic of Saint Simon ; nor the theocratic of the Essenes ; nor the despotic of the Peruvians or Jesuits ; nor the polygamous of the the Mormons ; nor the materialistic of Robert Owen ; nor the terrorism of Robespierre , had ever contemplated universal and equal distribution of property , coupled with a general and coercive recruiting of its members . In Germany , the classic land of modern Socialism , the new creed was first proclaimed . Hardly twenty-five years have elapsed since it first found expression in the person of its great tribune , Ferdinand Lassalle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robespierre , the philosophic mind of Kant , and the personal magnetism. of O'Connell . His numerous apostles , stronger than the great prophet himself in their denunciation of the " cruel , brazen law of wages , " soon built up the party now known as the party of German Socialism . If we are to believe the words of the great German Chancellor , this man , despite his professions , detested the burgher because he was not sufficiently imbued with admiration for his leader , while he despised the workman because he bargained too closely for submission ; and , " in revenge , " says Prince Bismarek , " he worshiped Lassalle . " But however this may be , Lassalle , " thinker and man of war , " as his epitaph reads , will remain the first high priest of the new social creed , and the prophet of a social system which has made all Europe quake and brought the most powerful minister of modern times to declare that " in all the great German Empire his dog alone remains unshaken in his allegiance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lassalle and Karl Marx , and the great learning which they brought to the cause , that the intellectual classes of Germany were permeated with the new principles of Socialism , and it is to them that it owes its growth and success in the fatherland . How different from France , where the remnants of feudalism had provoked the anarchic attack of the great Revolution , and finally spent its untutored forces in the after-birth of the July Revolution and the Commune ! For neither the Commune nor communism could &amp;ndure so long as the first Napoleon went down to posterity with the Code in his hand , and so long as discontent was confined to the lowest orders . Indeed , most traces of Socialism have now // vanished from French soil , and the fact would seem partly due to the slow and silent operation of the Code Napoleon , which imposes upon all testators an equal distribution of property , and partly to the distribution of a great debt among the masses of the people . If , on the other hand , we turn to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another picture . It is not from the working classes that the ranks of nihilism are recruited in the great empire of the Czars . The Russian moujik is content with the poverty and obscurity that fall to his lot . It is only when roused by agitators like Serge Netchaieff , an ex-professor of Moscow University , that he is moved from the lethargy of his passive condition . In Russia , Socialism , as the recent and alarming students ' riots attest , is confined almost wholly to the intellectual classes which struggle in sympathy with the movement in Germany . Within the last eight years the Russian nihilists have quadrupled their numbers , and the existence of Socialism may well be considered ominous and dangerous to an autocracy where the intellectual classes wield the powers of state , and number in their own ranks secret members of the new persuasion . Indeed , the wave of liberalism and nihilism which has lately passed over the dominions of the Czar is not viewed without concern by the German Chancellor himself , whose powerful and forecasting intellect has even crossed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by his enemies in the greatest republic of modern times . It is the present purpose to consider the advance of Socialism in America , and especially the importation to this country of German Socialism with its measures and its men . We have reason to believe that few Americans perceive the danger that is daily growing in their presence under the shrewd and fostering protection of Prince Bismarck . Not many months ago , when Europe was panic-stricken by four successive attempts in one year upon the lives of three monarchs , Prince Bismarck , by the famous bill passed in the Reichstag , laid low the Socialist propaganda in Germany . By the repressive measures of this bill two million Germans were deprived of their constitutional rights . Of these two millions , the German Government , supremely conscious of its own best interests , is now making attempts , direct and indirect , to drive a large portion to this country . It is here proposed to show how far this element of German Socialism has already fixed its fangs in the most susceptible portion of our people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and loquacious agita // t*ors , to diffuse its poison into all classes sufficiently indigent and sufficiently ignorant to join the great caravan of the discontented . It seems indeed curious that Socialism , a movement so menacing to the peace of the military despotisms of the Russian and German Empires , should have reached our shores , and found foothold in this land of freedom and of plenty . It was long believed that neither discord nor discontent could ever cross the threshold of the young republic . She was the home of the oppressed , the asylum of the outcast . In a land flowing with milk and honey , where fortune and nature had vied with each other in their gifts , men thought to see and to foresee the realization of humanity 's fondest hopes . Endowed with wealth , with all the fundamental principles of political liberty , a boundless and exhaustless territory , it seemed as if America were destined to dispel the night of ages , and to regenerate mankind . With earnest solicitude the wisest heads of Europe watched the progress of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secession , foreseen and predicted by De Tocqueville , brought all calculation to a standstill , and modified and convulsed the whole condition of our social fabric . It introduced caste . It made of the republic a plutocracy . It altered and remolded our commercial and economic systems . It fostered protection . It created speculation , extravagance , an immense debt , and poverty . It was through the operation of these changes and innovations that the prevalence of Socialistic principles became possible in the United States ; and while we have been discussing the possibility of a Mongol invasion , and the incapacity of the negro for responsible government , we have failed to notice the new enemy who may at no distant day plunge capital and labor into a conflict calculated to test the strength of a weak government even more severely than the late civil war . To the ninety-nine out of every hundred of our people , Socialism in this country means nothing more than an empty name applied to strange and visionary radicals . To such it will be surprising if not alarming to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ populous States of the Union , thousands upon thousands of enrolled members of the regular Socialist organization , and that in numbers they largely exceed the organization which first elicited attention in Germany . We do not include the " Butlerites " and " Kearneyites " and other children of discontent , ever ready to give ear to their tempters , and to follow in the wake of the first successful demagogue or party that may lead the crusade against capitaL Such // demagogues are already at hand , and dare to-day to raise their voice in the supreme councils of the nation . Not many months have passed since a United States Senator declared in debate at Washington that the combat of the future day between the men who own the public debt and those who are to pay it , " if it is to be paid at all . " Nor does this estimate include the unnumbered thousands who have signified their allegiance to the cause of Socialism , without affixing their signatures as enrolled members of the brotherhood . The large number of self-supporting Socialist newspapers alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the present silent ) mass of men . And the success and extent of the movement are the more appreciable after a careful comparison of the relative increase of the Socialist vote , recently polled in the large cities of the Union , with that cast in Berlin during latQ years . By this it appears that the result at the polls of our large political centers , such as New York and Chicago , shows a more rapid growth of the Socialist vote than that cast at Berun , when the increase was considered sufficiently alarming to call for restrictive measures . And the wonder grows greater when upon investigation it is ascertained that the moving spirits of our Socialist party are German agitators-many of them recently imported from the fatherland . These men lend to the cause all their knowledge , pertinacity , and experience . We speak of such men as F. Leib and Paul GrottI*au , convicted and condemned , some time since , by the tribunals of Berlin , and Gustav ILyser and Henry Eude-both escaped from the prisons of Frankfort , the latter having since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the sympathy and the union of the American party with the German movement may be seen from the fact that , previous to the last election in Germany , a considerable sum was raised in the United States to aid the Socialists in defraying election expenses in Prussia . There these funds were instrumental in swelling the majority against a friendly Government . Mr. Seward once declared that of all the elements which entered into our national composition the German was the element which he most feared . The discontented and revolutionary spirit which characterizes the German mind , coupled with the little learning which every citizen of the fatherland brings with him , and the clannishness of his race , seemed to Mr. Seward a danger menacing to the existing order of things . It is indeed true that the German combines in his nature traits dangerous to the fundamental princi // pies of the present system of our society . Abject in adversity and minority , he becomes aggressive when favored by fortune and number . We have seen these features developed in Europe and even in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the German , when at the beginning of the century so-called Dutch slaves were sold in cargoes to the highest bidder . In the year 1817 six thousand German redemptioners were landed in Pennsylvania , where whole families were purchased by free negroes , of which there were then large numbers in Maryland. * That the German , despite the quality of infection that characterizes his doctrines , is of a clannish nature which with difficulty loses all traces of German origin , may be easily seen in Pennsylvania , the State which has suffered most from the ravages of Socialism . In that State there may be found at the present day whole communities of these people who have preserved the mother tongue to the exclusion of the Engish language . There can indeed be little doubt that German colonization , wherever it goes , is apt to illustrate the dictum of Lamartine when he said of the Turks that they were camped in Europe . As the Turk brings with him all the peculiarities of barbarism , so the German imports all the characteristics of the fatherland , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a barrier or the Koran for a curb . Mr. Seward 's fears apply pertinently to a large part of the six million Germans who now form a portion of the American Union . Of these the Socialists justly claim large numbers , and , if we examine the first acts and constitution of the Socialistic Labor party , it will appear that from its very foundation the chief officials and ringleaders of the organization were and still are Germans , not a few of whom have been expelled or have fled from their native country because of conspiracy against society . Nevertheless , these men have become the leaders of a great national and American movement . At the first National Convention of Socialists , held at Philadelphia July 19 , 1876 , the year preceding the great railway strikes , threefourths of the delegates present bore German names . A previous convention had been held at Pittsburg , the hotbed of the railway strikes , but no regular constitution was there adopted . At the Union Congress of Philadelphia , however , lasting some days , the party first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Party * See official report ( p. 2*1 ) of Herr von Fiirstenviirther , Stuttgart and Tiibingen , 1818. // GERMAN SO*IALISff IN AMERICA . of the United States . " Here a constitution was finally formulated and adopted amid excitement and exhortations to keep cool , and here the first appeal was made to the great working classes of the United States . In these seditious words did Messrs . Sorge and Gabriel , two German delegates to the Union Congress , make their appeal to the country : " Rise , then , ye sons and daughters of labor ! Rally round its flag , and carry it to the heights of humanity ! Alter and amend whatever we did wrong or may be impracticable , but join hands with us for the establishment of that fraternal union of the disinherited and down-trodden wages-laborer which will relieve us from the evils of capitalistic society . " These words strengthened the faithful , and the strikes grew with their growth and strengthened with their strength . At the National Congress of the workingmen held at Newark , New Jersey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year of the great labor strikes , the name of the party was changed to the " Socialistic Labor Party , " and most of the clauses of the platform and constitution adopted at Philadelphia were retained . Here , however , all the principles were duly discussed and adopted by an assembly considerably larger than the Union Congress . It comprised among its members representatives from the remotest States of the Union . In this large assembly , again , over one half of the representatives were German , and the elected chairman , as well as two thirds of the committees chosen , could boast a German origin . Indeed , at this meeting the inconvenience attending the presence of so many German agitators , but lately arrived from the mother country and totally ignorant of the English language , became so apparent that a resolution was passed recommending each section to send to future conventions of the party delegates familiar with the English tongue . The following platform was adopted . We give it as it appeared in the last election bulletins . To any reader familiar with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present but an abstract from their works : " The earth is man 's , and the fullness thereof . " THE NATIONAL PLATFORM AND PRINCIPLES OF THE SOCIAL ISTIC LABOR PARTY . " LABOR being the source of all wealth and civilization , and useful labor being possible only by and through the associated efforts of the people , the results of labor should , therefore , in all justice , belong to society . The system under which society is now organized is imperfect and hostile to the // general welfare , since through it the directors of labor , necessarily a small minority , are enabled in the competitive struggle to practically monopolize all the means of labor-all opportunities to produce for and supply the wants of the people  --  and the masses are therefore maintained in poverty and dependence . " The industrial emancipation of labor , which must be achieved by the working classes themselves , independent of all political parties but their own , is consequently the great end , to which every political movement should be subordinate as a means . " Since the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the dominant or wealthy classes , endeavored to uphold their industrial supremacy , and to perpetuate the present condition of society , it is now the duty of the working people to organize themselves into one great Labor party , using political power to achieve industrial independence . The material condition of the working people in all civilized countries being identical , and resulting from the same cause , the struggle for industrial emancipation is international , and must naturally be coOperative and mutual ; therefore the organization of National and International Trade and Labor Unions upon a socialistic basis is an absolute necessity . For these reasons the Socialistic Labor party has been founded . We demand that the resources of life-the means of production , public transportation and communication , land , machinery , railroads , telegraph lines , canals , etc. , become , as fast as practicable , the common property of the whole people through the Government-to abolish the wage system and substitute in its stead coOperative production , with a just distribution of its rewards . " The Socialistic Labor party presents the following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people under our present competitive system and to gradually aceompliek the entire removal of the same : " 1 . Eight hours for the present as a legal working day , and prompt punishment of all violators. " 2 . Sanitary inspection of all conditions of labor , means of subsistence and dwellings included . " 8 . Bureaus of Labor Statistics in all States as well as in the National Government . The officers of the same to be elected by the people . " 4 . Prohibition of the use of prison labor by private employers or corporations . " *5 . Prohibition of the employment of children under fourteen years of age in industrial establishments . " 6 . Compulsory education of all children under fourteen years of age . All materials , books , etc. , necessary in the public schools , to be furnished free of charge . " T. Prohibition of the employment of female labor in occupations detrimental to the health or morality , and equalization of women 's wages with those of men , where equal service is performed . " 8 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their negligence to the injury of their employees . // " 9 . All wages to be paid in the lawful money of the nation and at intervals of time not exceeding one week . Yiolations of this rule to be legally punished . " 10 . All conspiracy laws operating against the right of workingmen to strike or induce others to strike shall be repealed . " 11 . Gratuitous administration of justice in all courts of law . " 12 . All indirect taxation to be abolished , and a graded income tax collected in its stead . " 18 . All banking and insurance to be conducted by the Government . " 14 . The right of suffrage shall in no wise be abridged. " 15 . Direct popular legislation , enabling the people to propose or reject any law at their will , and introduction of minority representation in all legislative elections . " 16 . Every public officer shall be at all times subject to prompt recall by the election of a successor . " 17 . The importation of coolies under contract must be immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall be released from the same . " The ignorance of the workingman as to his rights and wrongs is the cause of his enslavement by the intelligent ruffians of the age . " Production belongs to the producer ; the tools belong to the toiler . " Economical , political , and religious liberty constitute the Holy Trinity of Human Freedom . " It was decided at Newark to conduct the affairs of the party by conventions , executive committees , and a board of supervision , the National Convention to assemble at least once in every two years , and the organization to be divided into sections embracing the whole of the United States . The following extracts from rules and regulations prescribed by the Newark Convention will give some conception of the care and minuteness with which the society is organized : " Ten persons may form a section , providing they acknowledge the platform and constitution and resolutions of the National and State Conventions , and belong to no other political party . They shall demand admission to the party by sending a list of members to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dues for the year to the State Executive Committee . Each section shall send each month a report of its numerical and financial condition , also its progress and prospects , to the National and also the State Executive Committee . It shall establish proper connections with the trades-unions , and endeavor to organize new ones upon the Socialistic basis . " Only one main section shall be established in each city or town . When necessary , however , additional sections may be formed by those unable to take part in business meetings conducted in the English language . But in // matters of local importance , especially in political campaigns , all the sections shall be as one body . " The section shall be the judge of its own members and responsible for their actions . " Sections of different localities may propose the calling of a special State Convention . Ten sections are necessary to form a State organization . All ward and district organizations , including all branches and suburbs , shall belong to the main section . No ward or district organization shall conduct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ section . Each section shall hold an agitation meeting at least once every two weeks , and a regular business meeting at least once a month . Three fourths of the members of a section must be wages-workers . The names of all persons applying for admission to the party must be voted upon at the regular business meeting of the main local section . Every section belonging to the party for three months prior to the National Convention , and which has fulfilled all its obligations , is entitled to representation therein by one delegate for each one hundred members or fraction thereof . " The National Convention frames the national platform , decides the form of organization , nominates the national candidates , and directs the national agitation , selects the place where the next National Convention will be held , and where the National Executive Committee and the Board of Supervision will be located . It fixes the salaries of party officers . It selects the corresponding and financial secretaries , and investigates and decides all difficulties within the party . " The State Conventions will assemble at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Each section is entitled to representation in the State Convention by one delegate for every fifty members or fraction thereof . " The State Convention frames the State platform , nominates the State candidates , and decides where the State Executive Committee shall be located . All State and local platforms must be based upon the national platform , and shall not conflict with the principles therein declared . There is a National Executive Committee , and in each State a State Executive Committee . It is the duty of the National Executive Committee to carry out the resolutions of the National Convention , to organize and centralize the movement , to conduct and manage the agitation generally , and to establish proper relations and communication with the trades-unions of our own country and with the Socialistic parties of Europe . It is further incumbent upon it to issue semi-annually a report of the party , stating definitely the condition of every section and of the party 's finances . " The State Executive Committees are required to send every three months a full report showing the condition of their sections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of supervision whose duty it is to watch over the acts of the National Executive Committee and of the whole party . // " In each State organization the sections pay five cents per month for each member of the State Executive Committee , from which funds the State Executive Committee pays to the National Executive Committee the sum of three cents per month . In case of need the National Executive Committee may with concurrence of the Board of Supervision call for the collection of voluntary contributions to the national funds . All members , in acknowledging the platform and constitution , take upon themselves the obligations to assist each other to the extent of their ability in case of need . Each section elects from its midst an organizer , agitator , or , in other words , " a drummer , " whose business it is to recruit as many members as can be enticed to join the ranks of the party . " It is incumbent upon every member to pay , as monthly dues , at least ten cents , of which sum five cents is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members are excused from these payments . " The emancipation of women is to be accomplished with the emancipation of men , and the so-called woman 's rights question to be solved with the labor question . " Every member is expected to subscribe for at least one of the party organs . " We now come to the measures adopted for the regulation of the press . These very clearly demonstrate not only the essentially German character of the Socialistic Labor party , but they offer the conclusion in one sense encouraging , that German Socialism is not initiative with the people of the United States , although their minds have proved singularly receptive to foreign influences . It has thus come to pass that we have to deal with a national movement led by German agitators . The regulations prescribe that the party shall maintain but one official organ in each language , namely , the " Arbeiterstimme " ( German ) of New York , the " Delnicke Listy " ( Bohemian ) of New York , and the " Socialist " ( American ) of Chicago . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall represent the interests of the working people , and spread among them a knowledge of social economy , or in other words a knowledge of the beneficent results accruing to all indigent people by the equal distribution of property . Although the " Arbeiterstimme " is declared the official German organ of the party , there is now published in New York the " Volks-Zeitung , " another German journal , which boasts a daily circulation of ten thousand copies ; yet a year has not elapsed since its foundation . All Socialistic newspapers espousing // the interests of the party are conducted on the co*5perative plan , and are said to be mostly self-sustaining  --  a significant fact when it is considered that enormous sums have been sunk in numerous efforts to establish party organs in this country , and that for the first time in the United States journals hostile to the law of the land have met with sufficient encouragement to prosper . It also is significant to note that , out of twenty-seven journals published in the interests of the party , fifteen are edited by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be seen how perfect is the organization of the Socialist Labor party in the United States , as reconstructed since the strikes . The following extract from a letter written in the month of May last by an influential American Socialist , and recently published in the " Revue des Deux Mondes , " will serve to indicate the opinions prevailing in the ranks of the party itself concerning the progress now making : " We are at work not only in the great cities but in many others , and are gaining ground with a rapidity at which even we are astonished . Since July last , in ten months , the number of our followers has quadrupled , and we have every reason to believe that the progress will continue in the same ratio . In Cincinnati the recruits are drilled every week , and from week to week the number of volunteers under arms increases from five to eight per cent . " We have given a somewhat elaborate account of the laws formulated for the Labor party in this country under the auspices of German agitators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it may be within the power of the reader to judge of the extent and ability of an organization which , if at any moment swelled by numbers and stimulated by industrial depression , might burst upo.n us as a mighty torrent , perhaps too powerful to stem at the outset , and calculated to threaten the best social and business interests of a country vast in extent of territory and fairly destitute of military protection . To the indigent and ignorant laborer , indeed , we must confess that the whole scheme of the new social order wears a most alluring aspect . It is easy to picture the Arcadian Utopia which rises in his ravished fancy . Universal brotherhood , comfort and plenty , free railways , free telegraphs , free theatres and amusements , gratuitous instruction , an end to imprisonment , an end to caste , materialism to replace religion , " the mere opinion of nations , " the state the universal , sole proprietor and administrator of the entire industry of the country ; state help in every direction , all men to // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an end to care and trouble , and an era of competency and contentment , such as distinguished the home of Evangeline , where " the richest was poor , and the poorest lived in abundance . " These hopes are indeed bright and alluring . They are often , no doubt , presented by sincere and good men , free from the blood of the Commune , and actuated by pure motives . But the obverse of the medal which reason forces upon thoughtful men offers barriers insurmountable in practice . It is not our purpose to show , save incidentally , that the programme of modern Socialism aims at the destruction of the best interests of society , or that it is devoid of those possibilities or enduring characteristics which mark every successful innovation . Able and dispassionate disquisitions to this effect are to be found in many current works of the day . In one light alone , however , the case must appear impracticable . Granted , argumenti causa , that the difference existing between the workingman 's knowledge and necessities is now greater than in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growing concentration of capital must finally bring the capitalist and the laborer to a deadlock ; that the majority of our States are bankrupt ; that the expenses of our complex Government , embracing State , municipal , and central administration , exceed those of England , France , or any other proportionate population , and that these combined evils must finally produce a crisis , placing in the hands of the laborer all the wealth and control of the country-granted all this , then , what would ensue ? According to all Socialist authorities in America , eight hours ' work will , with the present perfection of machinery , create a slight over-production . In this case the American Socialist would be driven in self-defense to establish a protective policy . This would exclude the product of the capital-ridden wretches of other lands , although the result would be that we should be enjoying our welfare at their expense , thus excluding from redemption the great majority of suffering humanity . For , where in former times we helped them with some of our custom , the increased cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ products of our " kin beyond sea . " For it must be manifest even to the dullest Socialist , in his moments of more sober reflection , that if the workmen of other nations work twelve hours a day , our own people working but eight , the foreign producer could manufacture for a price with which the American could not compete . On the other // hand , if the American producer should work much less than eight hours per day , American society becomes bankrupt , and if again he prolongs the working-day beyond eight hours , he abandons the very prize so long coveted and demanded , whereas to secure this prize he would have contributed to the upheaval of our present civilization . Could , therefore , the Socialists effect their aims in this country , the toiling and unredeemed millions in Germany , Russia , France , England , and other lands would , because of our own selfish motives , be reduced to the same plight in their relations to us as the laborer to-day stands to the proprietor . The reverse would of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which might first attain the great end . For no Socialist is surely so sanguine as to believe that his plans , by a single stroke of the magician 's wand , can be simultaneously put into practical and universal operation throughout the civilized world . Thus without united , universal , and simultaneous action , which is impossible , the plans of the Socialist become impracticable . ( It is possible that Socialism in a modified form will be tried in some of the older countries of Europe . There an already dense population , increasing in geometrical proportion and overloaded with vast and ever-growing debts , may demand some experiment to relieve the poor . In England , where an overcrowded population more than doubles itself in thirty years , despite an enormous emigration , the danger is especially great . But it is improbable that Socialism , even in an amended form , should , at an early date , meet with any permanent success in the United States , where the unimproved resources of nature offer an almost unlimited field for the restless energies of the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the activity of any class in the Union ; for he who enters the portals of the social El Dorado leaves behind him hope , that most human of human emotions , and with it all emulation , all ambition , and therefore all progress . Still , whatever might be the result of the second sober sense which would ultimately characterize our people , it must yet not be ignored that even a momentary craze of any extended nature would be fraught with incalculable mischief to the best interests of society . That in moments of distress and discontent the ultima ratio regum becomes the first resort of our people , has been abundantly revealed by the great civil war , the strikes of 1877 , and by the late troubles in California , where German agitators moved and incited the rioters to acts of violence . We are besides daily reminded of this fact by // events which pass almost unnoticed . Within a few weeks a gang of organized tramps have seized part of a railroad in Michigan , with the purpose of appropriating and administering the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point in the same direction . It is stated by Monsieur Charles de Varigny , a recent French observer of the Socialist movement in America , that there exists in almost every State of the Union a contingent of Socialist volunteers . In Pennsylvania alone he estimates the number at from sixty to ninety thousand men . The Western States are remarkable for the prosperous condition of their Socialist sections . Here , as in other parts of the Union , the leaders are German , while a good proportion of the rank and file of the party are recruited among native Americans . At the last general election a number of Socialists were elected to the Legislature of Illinois . Some of the towns of Ohio number Socialists even among their municipal officers . In Youngtown , for example , the recently elected mayor and corporation were all avowed members of the Socialist party , and many other instances of the growth and strength of the organization could be cited had we not already exceeded our limits . In conclusion , it may be well to say that no spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first directing his attention to Socialism in America the writer was moved by motives of pure curiosity . No one could have been more surprised at the discovery of so perfect an organization , the fanatic earnestness of its followers , and the strength of its numbers . Nor can we view without grave apprehension the fact that Prince Bismarck is at present secretly encouraging the emigration to the United States of proscribed German agitators , and defraying their expenses from the enormous secret service fund at the command of the Imperial Chancellor . For the present we must part with our subject , postponing for final consideration , in a succeeding paper , the protective measures necessary to shield American society from the schemes of the German Government and the menacing confederation which honeycombs the Union from sea to sea .
