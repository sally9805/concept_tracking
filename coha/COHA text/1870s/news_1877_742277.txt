txt It is one of the characteristic delusions of the small boy that he has a monopoly of all knowledge , and that grown-up people are , without exception , both ignorant and weak-minded . Naturally , that small boy of journalism  --  the Tfror/d ? shares this delusion , and daily expresses its conviction that grown-up newspapers , with a real circulation , are idiotic nuisances . Whenever any event ? no matter what it may betakes place , the World shrieks out , " I know all about it ! " and then falls to abusing the public because the latter ignores the World 's existence , and consults the grown-up papers for information and advice . This must , of course , be very trying to the temper , but when the World , bursting with a consciousness of its own knowledge , and filled with rage at the stupid people who smile contemptously upon its noisy pretensions , disturbs the neighborhood with its howls , even the most humane man feels that the conceited little journal ought to be taken out to the woodshed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. HALL disappeared , the World , as usual , knew all about it . Mr. HALL had not gone to Europe , but he had been murdered in the " shuns " of Brooklyn . Ho was engaged in a lawsuit , in which " Mrs. Ellen Davis Morgan " was concerned , and his diary contained an entry showing that ou the evening of the day of his disappearance he intended to go to Brooklyn in search of witnesses . Of course , he went , and took with him $500 , and , of course , he was murdered in the first eligible " slum " into which he ventured . This story the World told with so much apparent good faith that several incautious persons temporarily forgot the notorious character of the World , and began to ask if it were possible that by accident the conceited small ? bov of the press had actually told the truth . Of course , in a day or two this circumstantial story was shown to be a juvenile fib . There was no such entry in Mr. HALL 'S @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person as " Ellen Davis Morgan , " and Mr. HALL - did not have $500 in his pocket on the day alleged . Nevertheless , the World did not abandon its story even after the full exposure of its entire falsity . On the contrary , it reviled the Police for not discovering a variety of " shuns " in Brooklyn , with Mr. HALL 'S body distributed among them iu small fragments . As for the grownup newspapers , its contempt for them knew no bounds , and no small boy with a new tin " squawker " over displayed such a preposterous amount of noisy self-conceit . On Saturday morning last , the nrOrld , in its loftiest manner , summed up the Hall case , and forever exploded the theory that the ex-Mayor had gone to Europe . It began by remarking that " those of our contemporaries who have been perfectly convinced that Mr. OAKILY HALL had sailed for Europe - will probably abandon their conviction in two days at furthest . " Their conviction it characterized as " au unreasonable assumption without a particle of evidence to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and . so entirely incredible that the intelligent readers of the papers which have maintained it must have wondered how they came to do it ; " a " wild folly , " and the mere " nonsense of the newspapers . " Then the World proceeded to plume itself upon its Brooklyn romance , " which gave a clear and probable explanation of Mr. HALL 'S disappearance , " and which " was so clear and probable that after it was put forward , and the evidence for it given , there was really nothing to be done but to accept it . " The reason why " the newspapers declined to accent it " was " because it had first appeared in our the World 's columns , and not in theirs . " There is no doubt that in a measure this was the true reason . " The newspapers " ? which the World justly regards as something very different from itself ? as well as the public , have long since ceased to pay any attention to the inventions which the World substitutes for news . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " slums " of Brooklyn it might have been thought worth noticing ; but its apearance in the columns of the World was a warning to the public not to put any faith in it whatever . Finally , the World abused the Police authorities , whom , in its " superb English , " it styled " the louts of Mulberry-street , " for not having believed that it could toll the truth if it really tried to , and wound up with the sarcastic remark that " when it is finally ascertained , as it probably will be in a day or two , that Mr. HALL did not sail for Europe on the 17th. of March , the Police may conclude to do something . " ' Thus both the Police and the newspapers were con-. elusively shown to be shining idiots , and the fact of Mr. HALL 'S murder in the Brooklyn " slums " Was once more proved . It must be conceded . that the article from which the foregoing quotations have been made was absolutely withering in its denunciations of the general ignorance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and . although in the happy days when the World was the defender of the Tweed Ring Mr. HALL was excepted by it from the general mass of idiots , it did not hesitate to remark , in its Saturday issue , that if ho had been capable of secretly ' going to Europe he was a " cruel and unusual scoundrel . " A few hours after the Saturday issue of the World appeared , a telegram front Englaud announced Mr. HALL 's arrival at Liverpool . In spite of the imaginary entry in his diary ; in spite of the hypothetical " Ellen Davis Morgan ; " in spite of the " slums " provided by the World at a vast expense of fancy for his especial condemnation , and in spite of that paper 's conclusive demonstration that he was killed for the sake of $500 , ho actually went to Europe , and thereby , in the World 's opinion , proved himself a cruel and unusual scoundrel . What he also proved the World to be need . not be dwelt upon , since such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the effect of strengthening the universal feeling that the World ought not to ho allowed to delay that penitential visit to the woodshed , the painful and humiliating features of which it has richly earned . by its last display of silly selfconceit and noisy importance .
