txt The development of American manufactures must greatly depend upon their success in competing With those of Great Britain . In certain articles we have already succeeded in keeping out British competition from our home . market , and . this encourages us to think that the day is not far distant when we shall successfully compete with Great Britain and other European centres of manufacturing industry in the markets of the world . To estimate the difficulties which have to be overcome before the United States becomes a large exporter of machinery and textile fabrics , we must find out what is the cost of producing these articles among our own chief competitors . As a contribution toward this kind of knowledge , some interesting data are to be found in the address delivered by Mr. THOMAS BRASSET , M. P. , before the English Social Science Congress . Mr. BItASSEY is a son of the great contractor who died lately , and , who had amassed , in a lifetime devoted to groat industrial enterprises , one of the largest fortunes in the world . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of labor questions . His son treats them - with equal fairness , and has a power of marshaling a large number of &tails.; in brief compass which is exceedingly rare among the people who participate in the proceedings of that amiable but rather weak-minded body known as the Social Science Congress . It is in the iron trade that we are making most rapid advances on Great Britain , and Mr. BRASSEY 'S compendious statistics of that department of British industry have , therefore , a special interest . In 1867 567 , - 000 tons of British pig-iron were exported , .4,193,000 tons were converted into rolled iron , 1,317,000 tons of rolled iron were exported , and 28,331,000 tons of coal were consumed in the manufacture of iron . In 1872 the export items in these figures were nearly doubled , the amounts being as follows : Pig-iron exported , 1,333,000 tons ; pig-iron converted into rolled iron , 5,390,000 tons , and rolled iron exported , 2,055,000 tons . The total amount of coal used last year in the manufacture of British iron was 38,229,000 tons , being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the country during the year , and about as much as the quantity used in all other branches of manufacture put together . In connection with this branch of the subject , the statement may be quoted that , according to Mr. BESSEMER , the production of a ton of common iron rails requires two tons of coal ; of Sheffield caststeel rails , ten tons eight hundred weight , and of Bessemer 's steel rails , one ton . fivehundredths . As illustrating the immense rise in price of British pig-iron , which has so greatly stimulated our own iron trade , the following figures are given from the last report of the Commissioners of Customs : The average rate per ton of pig-ironea-ported was , in gold value , for 1870 , equal to $13 77 ; in 1371 , $15 40 , and in 1872 it had risen to $25 22 . The increase in the quantity exported last year over that of 1871 was twenty-eight per cent. , while the increase in price on certain qualities was as high as 108 per cent . Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still greater proportion than those of iron , because into each ascending stage of the product the element of wages enters more largely , and wages have advanced in pretty equal ratio among all classes of artisans . For example , the cost of building first-class iron steamers on the Clyde has risen from $120 , gold , per ton , in 1871 , to about $100 in 1872 . Again , a marine engine which in-1871. could be built for $200 per horse-power , cost last year $230 , and this year the price has advanced to from $255 to $300 per horse-power . An . ordinary passenger locomotive which in 1871 would cost $11,000 , would now be charged $13,000 . Yet in the face of this sharp advance in prices , the export value of stedin-engines of British manufacture has increased in six years about eighty per cent. , while the export of machinery of other descriptions has doubled .. It is extremely improbable that Great Britain will have cheaper coal for several years to come , and the present wages standard is very unlikely to be reduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , upon ( misting data , the strength of competition he is likely to meet from that quarter . If we are to show our ability to export wrought-iron and machinery against the European manufacturer , we should naturally expect to begin with the markets in the southern division of the continent . Already there are some indications that we are entering on this field . In the list of exports from New-York for the week ending yesterday there are the following items : For Chili , two steam-boilers , $40,000 , and forty-six railroad . cars , $75,000 . This is but a slender business to build any general conclusions upon , but it may fairly he accepted as an indication of a now movement in trade .
