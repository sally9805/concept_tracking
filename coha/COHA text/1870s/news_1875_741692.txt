txt They are watching the movements among the Republicans , and doing what they can to make a breach between the Prohibitionists and . the license men . Upon ail these movements the free and independent voter looks with interest , fled proposes to vote as last year for the best ticket presented . flattered themselves that they wore leaders before the , to them , surprising break up of last year , have been active for a month or more , and friends of candidates have been traveling through the State testing the strength of their favorites among the town and ward politicians , and quietly endeavoring to make combinations . " But nono of them move about with a very confident air , and they are painfully suspicious of each other . ' The tact is , the surprising turn-over of last Fall . upsetting all the calculations of the party leaders , has served to make them and their workers distrustful of their power and to render them exceptionally cautious . The path is not clear , and they hardly know just where to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with zealous working friends , and the present danger is of a splitting up into " cliques . " It is proposed to call some of the prominent men of the party together at an early day , and in secret meeting consider the situation , examine critically the prospect , and , if : possible , hit upon a course which will lead to the nomination of the best man available , on a platform satisfactory to the majority of the Republicans of the State . This would be very lovely , a union of all the factions , y it could be accomplished . But it is not very likely that it can . They are not of the uniting kind . The most prominent names at present before the State for the Republican nomination , not formally , of course , are Alexander H. Rice , Dr. George B. Loring , es-Gov . Talbot , whose nomination last year through the efforts of the Prolibitionists on the obnoxious prohibitory issue . Caused the Republican defeat ; Lieut . Gov . Knight , and Gen. Devens , who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bunker - 11ili orator . The greatest amount of quiet work thus tar has been done by the Rice men , but the first to establish head-quarters are the Talbot men . They present him , not as a Prohibitionist , being careful to avoid any reference to the liquor question , which they do not intend to bring into the canvass unless forced to by criticism of their candidate , but as " a man of large experience in public affairs , of Unsullied integrity , and of unqueetioned Republicanism , a man who commands the respect and confidence of the entire people . " Mr. Talbot has made a statement . not for publication , but in a private business letter to a friend from whom it has found its way into print , which his friends are confident will help him among those Republicans who voted against him last Fall on account of his declarations in his veto of the license bill ; and this statement is that he hopes to see the present law thoroughly tested , though he does not believe in the license principle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can throw obstacles in its way . All that his ardent friends say for Mr. Talbot is undoubtedly true . He is a man of public experience and integrity , and . has always been a consistent Republican ; but it does not appear to be generally felt , outside of the circle of his prohibitory friends , that he can be safely run into the convention as a candidate . Last Summer and Fall arc not far enough distant iu the past to be forgotten . He was the candidate forced on the convention by the Prohibitionists , and was defeated , all of which is greatly against him . His turn may come , and probably will come , it is contended , but not this year . It can be taut of 31. r . Talbot that he himself is not seeking the nomination , has not put himself in the hands of his friends ; " and that the CallWaSS is worked by his admirers and the Prohibitionisls generally " on their own hook . " Mr. Rice 's strength appears to bo lareely. and almost wholly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside of Boston he does not now have much of a following . It is remembered against him that though a pronounced license man , and . of those who were bitterly opposed to the tee*les of the Prohibitionists. he moved in the eonvention , after the declaration of the vote showing the majority for Talbot , the latter 's unanimous nomination , with a little sugar-and-water speech , which did not sound very well to those who so keenly felt the mortification of the yoke which had been put upon them by the action of the convention . Still his friends are working hard in his behalf , and the straight-out Republican organs in this city have been induced to " pronounce " for him . He is a gentleman of culture and experience ; has served long and well as a public officer here in the municipality and in Congress , and has long been available for the Governor 's chair . If elected he would , no doubt , make an excellent Governor , and would administer the affairs of State in a gentlemanly and altogether respectable manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thence this year than ever before , notwithstanding the fact that he has been so often presented as a candidate . His friends are of the sturdy order , and believe thoroughly in him . Those who scout the idea that ho has much strength are not aware of his pap . ularity in the country districts . He 1 stands well on the liquor question , being obnoxious to neither the Liberals nor the Prohibitionists , and his record as a cansistent Republican is clear . His friends believe that he is one of the strongest candidates . and express their determination to work diligently for him , though he himself stands in the background , determined in no way to seek the nomination . During the last year he has made many warm friends , and if an entirely new man is not to be taken , it is apparent that he is in the front rank . But the talk of a new man is quite freely indulged just at this moment . There is a inevoment , in which such men as Hoar and Dawes are said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not know ? in behalf of Doyens . But it is thought that he will think long before he will consent to give up a life position on the Bench for the uncertainties of political life . Other men are talked of , ani as the time for tb9 caucuses draws near , the most prominent will come to the front . It is understood that the convention will be held about the middle of September  --  earlier than last year .
