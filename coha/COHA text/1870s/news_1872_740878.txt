txt The latest theory of the " Liberal " Republicans is that the distrust of the Democrats by the people of this country is a dangerous element in our politics , and that its influence tends to carry the country toward the condition of France . We are exhorted to remember that the Democrats are not enemies , to be perpetually excluded from power , but fellow-citizens , honest but mistaken , who ought to be reasoned with and converted if possible , but not put under the ban . This is much more plausible than it is pertinent . Democrats have never been excluded from the Government because of popular hatred toward them as men , but because they showed an intention to do with the country what the country did not want done , and to leave undone that which the country wanted done . Twelve years ago they were resolved to extend and foster slavery , and the country having made up its mind that slavery should be restricted instead , turned the Democrats out of the National Government . They were resolved that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country , having concluded that it must so be put down , declined to give the Democrats a chance to prevent it . They were resolved that the bondmen of the South should be left to the mercy of State Governments , controlled by the former slaveholdors and the poor whites ; and the country , having decided that the freedmen should be protected , refused . to " permit the Democrats to carry out their policy . They were resolved that the financial pledges made by the country in time of war should be repudiated when peace had come , and the country . being firmly convinced that honor and interest alike required absolute good faith with the national creditors , refused to deliver the Treasury to the Democrats . There is in this uninterrupted expression of distrust of Democrats no element of proscription , uo jot of real partisan hatred , not a particle of the feeling that makes a French Red eager to shoot a French monarchist. or a French bourgeois willing to see French socialists mowed down in the streets . The " Liberal " Republicans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions on which the Democrats proved faithless are questions of the past . On that point tho people are not likely to be deceived . Those questions are no longer the only prominent ones , but they are not by any means settled . Until within six months . the Democrats of the South were engaged in the most cruel and extensive persecution of the negro for political purposes  --  not persecution of individuals by individuals on the promptiugs of personal passion , but in pursuance of a conspiracy , over wide areas , for a common purpose . This oppression ceased only when the National Government interposed . It would . not have ceased at all if the Democrats bad poseessed. the Government , because , while Northern Democrats do not all hate the negro , and none , ge hope , consciously approve of the Krarlux enormities , the sympathies of the party , which in any given case are sure to be stronger than general considerations of duty or policy , are with the oppressors and against the oppressed . This is a fact which the country , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give it to a party made up almost wholly of Democrats , can not and - will not forget . It is not a dead fact , but one of present and immediate importance , which it would be folly or worse to ignore . Again , the other subject concerning which the Democrats have earned the distrust of the people  --  the national credit ? is not beyond danger from them , should they attain power . They do not now make as much clamor as they did three or four years since ; but they are , as a party , disposed to treat the national credit with little respect . Their papers still harp on the gross injustice of paying at par , iu gold , a bond for which a depreciated currency was received , while the feature of the contract with the country 's creditors which exempts our bonds from taxation is almost uniformly regarded by Democrats as unjust . Give the party power , and . the facts we have mentioned would exert an influence which no corporal 's guard of " Liberal " Republicans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resist or modify .
