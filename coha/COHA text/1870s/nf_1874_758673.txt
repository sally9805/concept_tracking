" In a high order of ideas , what great facts serve as a foundation to our history and that of the modern world ! We have first royalty , which , weak and debased under the Merovingians , rises and establishes itself energetically under Pepin and Charlemagne , to degenerate under Louis le Debonnaire and Charles le Chauve . After having dared a second time to found the Empire of the Caesars , it quickly sees its sovereignty replaced by feudal rights , and all its rights usurped by the nobles , and has to struggle for many centuries to recover its rights one by one . Feudalism , evidently of Germanic origin , will also attract our attention , and we shall draw a rapid outline of this legislation , which , barbarian at the onset , becomes by degrees subject to the rules of moral progress . We shall ascertain that military service is the essence itself of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On our way we shall protest against civil wars , and shall welcome emancipation and the formation of the communes . Following the thousand details of the life of the people , we shall see the slave become serf , and the serf become peasant . We shall assist at the dispensation of justice by royalty and nobility , at the solemn sittings of parliaments , and we shall see the complicated details of a strict ceremonial , which formed an integral part of the law , develop themselves before us . The counters of dealers , fairs and markets , manufactures , commerce , and industry , also merit our attention ; we must search deeply into corporations of workmen and tradesmen , examining their statutes , and initiating ourselves into their business . Fashion and dress are also a manifestation of public and private customs ; for that reason we must give them particular attention . And to accomplish the work we have undertaken , we are lucky to have the conscientious studies of our old associates in the great work of the Middle Ages and the Renaissance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Elzear Blaze , Depping , Benjamin Guerard , Le Roux de Lincy , H.

The period known as the Middle Ages , says the learned Benjamin Guerard , is the produce of Pagan civilisation , of Germanic barbarism , and of Christianity . It began in 476 , on the fall of Agustulus , and ended in 1453 , at the taking of Constantinople by Mahomet II. , and consequently the fall of two empires , that of the West and that of the East , marks its duration . Its first act , which was due to the Germans , was the destruction of political unity , and this was destined to be afterwards replaced by religions unity . Then we find a multitude of scattered and disorderly influences growing on the ruins of central power . The yoke of imperial dominion was broken by the barbarians ; but the populace , far from acquiring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Instead of one despot , it found thousands of tyrants , and it was but slowly and with much trouble that it succeeded in freeing itself from feudalism . Nothing could be more strangely troubled than the West at the time of the dissolution of the Empire of the Caesars ; nothing more diverse or more discordant than the interests , the institutions , and the state of society , which were delivered to the Germans ( Figs. 1 and 2 ) . In fact , it would be impossible in the whole pages of history to find a society formed of more heterogeneous or incompatible elements . On the one side might be placed the Goths , Burgundians , Vandals , Germans , Franks , Saxons , and Lombards , nations , or more strictly hordes , accustomed to rough and successful warfare , and , on the other , the Romans , including those people who by long servitude to Roman dominion had become closely allied with their conquerors ( Fig. 3 ) . There were , on both sides , freemen , freedmen , colons , and slaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both in freedom and servitude . This hierarchical principle applied itself even to the land , which was divided into freeholds , tributary lands , lands of the nobility , and servile lands , thus constituting the freeholds , the benefices , the fiefs , and the tenures . It may be added that the customs , and to a certain degree the laws , varied according to the masters of the country , so that it can hardly be wondered at that everywhere diversity and inequality were to be found , and , as a consequence , that anarchy and confusion ruled supreme .

The Germans ( Fig. 4 ) had brought with them over the Rhine none of the heroic virtues attributed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the evident intention of making a satire on his countrymen . Amongst the degenerate Romans whom those ferocious Germans had subjugated , civilisation was reconstituted on the ruins of vices common in the early history of a new society by the adoption of a series of loose and dissolute habits , both by the conquerors and the conquered . Illustration : Fig. 5.  --  Costumes of Slaves or Serfs , from the Sixth to the Twelfth Centuries , collected by H. de Vielcastel , from original Documents in the great Libraries of Europe . In fact , the conquerors contributed the worse share ( Fig. 5 ) ; for , whilst exercising the low and debasing instincts of their former barbarism , they undertook the work of social reconstruction with a sort of natural and innate servitude . To them , liberty , the desire for which caused them to brave the greatest dangers , was simply the right of doing evil  --  of obeying their ardent thirst for plunder . Long ago , in the depths of their forests , they had adopted the curious institution of vassalage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of reducing personal power , every step in their social edifice , from the top to the bottom , was made to depend on individual superiority . To bow to a superior was their first political principle ; and on that principle feudalism was one day to find its base . Servitude was in fact to be found in all conditions and ranks , equally in the palace of the sovereign as in the dwellings of his subjects . The vassal who was waited on at his own table by a varlet , himself served at the table of his lord ; the nobles treated each other likewise , according to their rank ; and all the exactions which each submitted to from his superiors , and required to be paid to him by those below him , were looked upon not as onerous duties , but as rights and honours . The sentiment of dignity and of personal independence , which has become , so to say , the soul of modern society , did not exist at all , or at least but very slightly , amongst the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have but to remember that these men , so proud , so indifferent to suffering or death , would often think little of staking their liberty in gambling , in the hope that if successful their gain might afford them the means of gratifying some brutal passion . Illustration : Fig. 6.  --  King or Chief of Franks armed with the Seramasax , from a Miniature of the Ninth Century , drawn by H. de Vielcastel . When the Franks took root in Gaul , their dress and institutions were adopted by the Roman society ( Fig. 6 ) . This had the most disastrous influence in every point of view , and it is easy to prove that civilisation did not emerge from this chaos until by degrees the Teutonic spirit disappeared from the world . As long as this spirit reigned , neither private nor public liberty existed . Individual patriotism only extended as far as the border of a man 's family , and the nation became broken up into clans . Gaul soon found itself parcelled off into domains which were almost independent of one another . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Fig. 7.  --  The King of the Franks , in the midst of the Military Chiefs who formed his Treuste , or armed Court , dictates the Salic Law ( Code of the Barbaric Laws ) .  --  Fac-simile of a Miniature in the " Chronicles of St. Denis , " a Manuscript of the Fourteenth Century ( Library of the Arsenal ) . The advantages of acting together for mutual protection first established itself in families . If any one suffered from an act of violence , he laid the matter before his relatives for them jointly to seek reparation . The question was then settled between the families of the offended person and the offender , all of whom were equally associated in the object of vindicating a cause which interested them alone , without recognising any established authority , and without appealing to the law . If the parties had sought the protection or advice of men of power , the quarrel might at once take a wider scope , and tend to kindle a feud between two nobles . In any case the King only interfered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his dominions were threatened . Penalties and punishments were almost always to be averted by a money payment . A son , for instance , instead of avenging the death of his father , received from the murderer a certain indemnity in specie , according to legal tariff ; and the law was thus satisfied . The tariff of indemnities or compensations to be paid for each crime formed the basis of the code of laws amongst the principal tribes of Franks , a code essentially barbarian , and called the Salic law , or law of the Salians ( Fig. 7 ) . Such , however , was the spirit of inequality among the German races , that it became an established principle for justice to be subservient to the rank of individuals . The more powerful a man was , the more he was protected by the law ; the lower his rank , the less the law protected him . The life of a Frank , by right , was worth twice that of a Roman ; the life of a servant of the King was worth three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that protecting tie . On the other hand , punishment was the more prompt and rigorous according to the inferiority of position of the culprit . In case of theft , for instance , a person of importance was brought before the King 's tribunal , and as it respected the rank held by the accused in the social hierarchy , little or no punishment was awarded . In the case of the same crime by a poor man , on the contrary , the ordinary judge gave immediate sentence , and he was seized and hung on the spot . Inasmuch as no political institutions amongst the Germans were nobler or more just than those of the Franks and the other barbaric races , we can not accept the creed of certain historians who have represented the Germans as the true regenerators of society in Europe . The two sources of modern civilisation are indisputably Pagan antiquity and Christianity . After the fall of the Merovingian kings great progress was made in the political and social state of nations . These kings , who were but chiefs of undisciplined bands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so called . Their authority was more personal than territorial , for incessant changes were made in the boundaries of their conquered dominions . It was therefore with good reason that they styled themselves kings of the Franks , and not kings of France . Charlemagne was the first who recognised that social union , so admirable an example of which was furnished by Roman organization , and who was able , with the very elements of confusion and disorder to which he succeeded , to unite , direct , and consolidate diverging and opposite forces , to establish and regulate public administrations , to found and build towns , and to form and reconstruct almost a new world ( Fig. 8 ) . We hear of him assigning to each his place , creating for all a common interest , making of a crowd of small and scattered peoples a great and powerful nation ; in a word , rekindling the beacon of ancient civilisation . When he died , after a most active and glorious reign of forty-five years , he left an immense empire in the most perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magnificent inheritance was unfortunately destined to pass into unworthy or impotent hands , so that society soon fell back into anarchy and confusion . The nobles , in their turn invested with power , were continually at war , and gradually weakened the royal authority  --  the power of the kingdom  --  by their endless disputes with the Crown and with one another .

Its possession then formed the basis of social position , and , as a consequence , individual servitude became lessened , and society assumed a more stable condition . The ancient laws of wandering tribes fell into disuse ; and at the same time many distinctions of caste and race disappeared , as they were incompatible with the new order of things . As there were no more Salians , Ripuarians , nor Visigoths among the free men , so there were no more colons , laeti , nor slaves amongst those deprived of liberty . Illustrations : Figs. 10 and 11.  --  Present State of the Feudal Castle of Chateau-Gaillard aux Andelys , which was considered one of the strongest Castles of France in the Middle Ages , and was rebuilt in the Twelfth Century by Richard Coeur de Lion . Heads of families , on becoming attached to the soil , naturally had other wants and other customs than those which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wandering adventurers . The strength of their followers was not now so important to them as the security of their castles . Fortresses took the place of armed bodies ; and at this time , every one who wished to keep what he had , entrenched himself to the best of his ability at his own residence . The banks of rivers , elevated positions , and all inaccessible heights , were occupied by towers and castles , surrounded by ditches , which served as strongholds to the lords of the soil . ( Figs. 10 and 11 ) . These places of defence soon became points for attack . Out of danger at home , many of the nobles kept watch like birds of prey on the surrounding country , and were always ready to fall , not only upon their enemies , but also on their neighbours , in the hope either of robbing them when off their guard , or of obtaining a ransom for any unwary traveller who might fall into their hands . Everywhere society was in ambuscade , and waged civil war  --  individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reign of feudalism . It is unnecessary to point out how this system of perpetual petty warfare tended to reduce the power of centralisation , and how royalty itself was weakened towards the end of the second dynasty . When the descendants of Hugh Capet wished to restore their power by giving it a larger basis , they were obliged to attack , one after the other , all these strongholds , and practically to re-annex each fief , city , and province held by these petty monarchs , in order to force their owners to recognise the sovereignty of the King . Centuries of war and negotiations became necessary before the kingdom of France could be , as it were , reformed . Illustration : Fig. 12.  --  Knights and Men-at-arms , cased in Mail , in the Reign of Louis le Gros , from a Miniature in a Psalter written towards the End of the Twelfth Century .

Religious equality paved the way for political equality , and as all Christians were brothers before God , the tendency was for them to become , as citizens , equal also in law . This transformation , however , was but slow , and followed concurrently the progress made in the security of property . At the onset , the slave only possessed his life , and this was but imperfectly guaranteed to him by the laws of charity ; laws which , however , year by year became of greater power . He afterwards became colon , or labourer ( Figs. 13 and 14 ) , working for himself under certain conditions and tenures , paying fines , or services , which , it is true , were often very extortionate . At this time he was considered to belong to the domain on which he was born , and he was at least sure that that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in giving part of his time to his master , he was at liberty to enjoy the rest according to his fancy . The farmer afterwards became proprietor of the soil he cultivated , and master , not only of himself , but of his lands ; certain trivial obligations or fines being all that was required of him , and these daily grew less , and at last disappeared altogether . Having thus obtained a footing in society , he soon began to take a place in provincial assemblies ; and he made the last bound on the road of social progress , when the vote of his fellow-electors sent him to represent them in the parliament of the kingdom . Thus the people who had begun by excessive servitude , gradually climbed to power . Illustration : Fig. 13.  --  Labouring Colons ( Twelfth Century ) , after a Miniature in a Manuscript of the Ste. Chapelle , of the National Library of Paris . We will now describe more in detail the various conditions of persons of the Middle Ages . The King , who held his rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an absolute authority , proportioned according to the power of his abilities , to the extent of his dominions , and to the devotion of his vassals . Invested with a power which for a long time resembled the command of a general of an army , he had at first no other ministers than the officers to whom he gave full power to act in the provinces , and who decided arbitrarily in the name of , and representing , the King , on all questions of administration . One minister alone approached the King , and that was the chancellor , who verified , sealed , and dispatched all royal decrees and orders . As early , however , as the seventh century , a few officers of state appeared , who were specially attached to the King 's person or household ; a count of the palace , who examined and directed the suits brought before the throne ; a mayor of the palace , who at one time raised himself from the administration of the royal property to the supreme power ; an arch-chaplain , who presided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charged with the treasure of the chamber ; and a count of the stables , charged with the superintendence of the stables . Illustration : Fig. 14.  --  Labouring Colons ( Twelfth Century ) , after a Miniature in a Manuscript of the Ste. Chapelle , of the National Library of Paris . For all important affairs , the King generally consulted the grandees of his court ; but as in the five or six first centuries of monarchy in France the royal residence was not permanent , it is probable the Council of State was composed in part of the officers who followed the King , and in part of the noblemen who came to visit him , or resided near the place he happened to be inhabiting . It was only under the Capetians that the Royal Council took a permanent footing , or even assembled at stated periods . In ordinary times , that is to say , when he was not engaged in war , the King had few around him besides his family , his personal attendants , and the ministers charged with the dispatch of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to another he only held his court on the great festivals of the year . Illustration : Fig. 15.  --  The Lords and Barons prove their Nobility by hanging their Banners and exposing their Coats-of-arms at the Windows of the Lodge of the Heralds.  --  After a Miniature of the " Tournaments of King Rene " ( Fifteenth Century ) , MSS. of the National Library of Paris . Up to the thirteenth century , there was , strictly speaking , no taxation and no public treasury . The King received , through special officers appointed for the purpose , tributes either in money or in kind , which were most variable , but often very heavy , and drawn almost exclusively from his personal and private properties . In cases of emergency only , he appealed to his vassals for pecuniary aid . A great number of the grandees , who lived far from the court , either in state offices or on their own fiefs , had establishments similar to that of the King . Numerous and considerable privileges elevated them above other free men . The offices and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a consequence ; and it then became highly necessary for families to keep their genealogical histories , not only to gratify their pride , but also to give them the necessary titles for the feudal advantages they derived by birth . ( Fig. 15 ) . Without this right of inheritance , society , which was still unsettled in the Middle Ages , would soon have been dissolved . This great principle , sacred in the eyes both of great and small , maintained feudalism , and in so doing it maintained itself amidst all the chaos and confusion of repeated revolutions and social disturbances . We have already stated , and we can not sufficiently insist upon this important point , that from the day on which the adventurous habits of the chiefs of Germanic origin gave place to the desire for territorial possessions , the part played by the land increased insensibly towards defining the position of the persons holding it . Domains became small kingdoms , over which the lord assumed the most absolute and arbitrary rights . A rule was soon established , that the nobility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land ought to transmit to its possessors the rights of nobility . This privilege was so much accepted , that the long tenure of a fief ended by ennobling the commoner . Subsequently , by a sort of compensation which naturally followed , lands on which rent had hitherto been paid became free and noble on passing to the possession of a noble . At last , however , the contrary rule prevailed , which caused the lands not to change quality in changing owners : the noble could still possess the labourers 's lands without losing his nobility , but the labourer could be proprietor of a fief without thereby becoming a noble . To the comites , who , according to Tacitus , attached themselves to the fortunes of the Germanic chiefs , succeeded the Merovingian leudes , whose assembly formed the King 's Council . These leudes were persons of great importance owing to the number of their vassals , and although they composed his ordinary Council , they did not hesitate at times to declare themselves openly opposed to his will . Illustration : Fig. 16.  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written and illuminated under Louis le Gros . The name of leudes was abandoned under the second of the then French dynasties , and replaced by that of fideles , which , in truth soon became a common designation of both the vassals of the Crown and those of the nobility . Under the kings of the third dynasty , the kingdom was divided into about one hundred and fifty domains , which were called great fiefs of the crown , and which were possessed in hereditary right by the members of the highest nobility , placed immediately under the royal sovereignty and dependence . Illustration : Fig. 17.  --  King Charlemagne receiving the Oath of Fidelity and Homage from one of his great Feudatories or High Barons .  --  Fac-simile of a Miniature in Cameo , of the " Chronicles of St. Denis . " Manuscript of the Fourteenth Century ( Library of the Arsenal ) . Vassals emanating directly from the King , were then generally designated by the title of barons , and mostly possessed strongholds . The other nobles indiscriminately ranked as chevaliers or cnights , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , The fiefs of hauberk were bound to supply the sovereign with a certain number of knights covered with coats of mail , and completely armed . All knights were mounted in war ( Fig. 16 ) ; but knights who were made so in consequence of their high birth must not be confounded with those who became knights by some great feat in arms in the house of a prince or high noble , nor with the members of the different orders of chivalry which were successively instituted , such as the Knights of the Star , the Genet , the Golden Fleece , Saint-Esprit , St. John of Jerusalem , &c.; Originally , the possession of a benefice or fief meant no more than the privilege of enjoying the profits derived from the land , a concession which made the holder dependent upon the proprietor . He was in fact his " man , " to whom he owed homage ( Fig. 17 ) , service in case of war , and assistance in any suit the proprietor might have before the King 's tribunal . The chiefs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving them fiefs of parts of the territory which they had conquered ; but later on , everything was equally given to be held in fief , namely , dignities , offices , rights , and incomes or titles . It is important to remark ( and it is in this alone that feudalism shows its social bearing ) , that if the vassal owed obedience and devotion to his lord , the lord in exchange owed protection to the vassal . The rank of " free man " did not necessarily require the possession of land ; but the position of free men who did not hold fiefs was extremely delicate and often painful , for they were by natural right dependent upon those on whose domain they resided . In fact , the greater part of these nobles without lands became by choice the King 's men , and remained attached to his service . If this failed them , they took lands on lease , so as to support themselves and their families , and to avoid falling into absolute servitude . In the event of a change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands . Nevertheless , it was not uncommon for them to be so reduced as to sell their freedom ; but in such cases , they reserved the right , should better times come , of re-purchasing their liberty by paying one-fifth more than the sum for which they had sold it . We thus see that in olden times , as also later , freedom was more or less the natural consequence of the possession of wealth or power on the part of individuals or families who considered themselves free in the midst of general dependence . During the tenth century , indeed , if not impossible , it was at least difficult to find a single inhabitant of the kingdom of France who was not " the man " of some one , and who was either tied by rules of a liberal order , or else was under the most servile obligations . The property of the free men was originally the " aleu , " which was under the jurisdiction of the royal magistrates . The aleu gradually lost the greater part of its franchise , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not freehold . In ancient times , all landed property of a certain extent was composed of two distinct parts : one occupied by the owner , constituted the domain or manor ; the other , divided between persons who were more or less dependent , formed what were called tenures . These tenures were again divided according to the position of those who occupied them : if they were possessed by free men , who took the name of vassals , they were called benefices or fiefs ; if they were let to laeti , colons , or serfs , they were then called colonies or demesnes . Illustration : Fig. 18.  --  Ploughmen.  --  Fac-simile of a Miniature in a very ancient Anglo-Saxon Manuscript published by Shaw , with legend " God Spede ye Plough , and send us Korne enow . " The laeti occupied a rank between the colon and the serf . They had less liberty than the colon , over whom the proprietor only had an indirect and very limited power . The colon only served the land , whilst the laeti , whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owner ( Fig. 18 ) . They nevertheless enjoyed the right of possession , and of defending themselves , or prosecuting by law . The serf , on the contrary , had neither city , tribunal , nor family . The laeti had , besides , the power of purchasing their liberty when they had amassed sufficient for the purpose . Serfs occupied the lowest position in the social ladder ( Fig. 19 ) . They succeeded to slaves , thus making , thanks to Christianity , a step towards liberty . Although the civil laws barely protected them , those of the Church continually stepped in and defended them from arbitrary despotism . The time came when they had no direct masters , and when the almost absolute dependence of serfs was changed by the nobles requiring them to farm the land and pay tithes and fees . And lastly , they became farmers , and regular taxes took the place of tithes and fees . The colons , laeti , and serfs , all of whom were more or less tillers of the soil , were , so to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern times ; those who remained devoted to agriculture were the ancestors of our peasants ; and those who gave themselves up to trades and commerce in the towns , were the originators of the middle classes . Illustration : Fig. 19.  --  Serf or Vassal of Tenth Century , from Miniatures in the " Dialogues of St. Gregory , " Manuscript No. 9917 ( Royal Library of Brussels ) . As early as the commencement of the third royal dynasty we find in the rural districts , as well as in the towns , a great number of free men : and as the charters concerning the condition of lands and persons became more and more extended , the tyranny of the great was reduced , and servitude decreased . During the following centuries , the establishment of civic bodies and the springing up of the middle classes ( Fig. 20 ) made the acquisition of liberty more easy and more general . Nevertheless , this liberty was rather theoretical than practical ; for if the nobles granted it nominally , they gave it at the cost of excessive fines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price the right of self-administration , did not get rid of any of the feudal charges imposed upon it . Illustration : Fig. 20.  --  Bourgeois at the End of Thirteenth Century .  --  Fac-simile of Miniature in Manuscript No. 6820 , in the National Library of Paris . Fortunately for the progress of liberty , the civic bodies , as if they had been providentially warned of the future in store for them , never hesitated to accept from their lords , civil or ecclesiastical , conditions , onerous though they were , which enabled them to exist in the interior of the cities to which they belonged . They formed a sort of small state , almost independent for private affairs , subject to the absolute power of the King , and more or less tied by their customs or agreements with the local nobles . They held public assemblies and elected magistrates , whose powers embraced both the administration of civil and criminal justice , police , finance , and the militia . They generally had fixed and written laws . Protected by ramparts , each possessed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a treasury , and a watch-tower , and it could arm a certain number of men , either for its own defence or for the service of the noble or sovereign under whom it held its rights . In no case could a community such as this exist without the sanction of the King , who placed it under the safeguard of the Crown . At first the kings , blinded by a covetous policy , only seemed to see in the issue of these charters an excellent pretext for extorting money . If they consented to recognise them , and even to help them against their lords , it was on account of the enormous sacrifices made by the towns . Later on , however , they affected , on the contrary , the greatest generosity towards the vassals who wished to incorporate themselves , when they had understood that these institutions might become powerful auxiliaries against the great titulary feudalists ; but from the reign of Louis XI. , when the power of the nobles was much diminished , and no longer inspired any terror to royalty , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and deprived them successively of all the prerogatives which could prejudice the rights of the Crown . The middle classes , it is true , acquired considerable influence afterwards by participation in the general and provincial councils . After having victoriously struggled against the clergy and nobility , in the assemblies of the three states or orders , they ended by defeating royalty itself . Louis le Gros , in whose orders the style or title of bourgeois first appears ( 1134 ) , is generally looked upon as the founder of the franchise of communities in France ; but it is proved that a certain number of communities or corporations were already formally constituted , before his accession to the throne . The title of bourgeois was not , however , given exclusively to inhabitants of cities . It often happened that the nobles , with the intention of improving and enriching their domains , opened a kind of asylum , under the attractive title of Free Towns , or New Towns , where they offered , to all wishing to establish themselves , lands , houses , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and liberties . These congregations , or families , soon became boroughs , and the inhabitants , though agriculturists , took the name of bourgeois . Illustration : Fig. 21.  --  Costume of a Vilain or Peasant , Fifteenth Century , from a Miniature of " La Danse Macabre , " Manuscript 7310 of the National Library of Paris . There was also a third kind of bourgeois , whose influence on the extension of royal power was not less than that of the others . There were free men who , under the title of bourgeois of the King ( bourgeois du Roy ) , kept their liberty by virtue of letters of protection given them by the King , although they were established on lands of nobles whose inhabitants were deprived of liberty . Further , when a vilain  --  that is to say , the serf , of a noble  --  bought a lease of land in a royal borough , it was an established custom that after having lived there a year and a day without being reclaimed by his lord and master , he became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In consequence of this the serfs and vilains ( Fig. 21 ) emigrated from all parts , in order to profit by these advantages , to such a degree , that the lands of the nobles became deserted by all the serfs of different degrees , and were in danger of remaining uncultivated . The nobility , in the interests of their properties , and to arrest this increasing emigration , devoted themselves to improving the condition of persons placed under their dependence , and attempted to create on their domains boroughs analogous to those of royalty . But however liberal these ameliorations might appear to be , it was difficult for the nobles not only to concede privileges equal to those emanating from the throne , but also to ensure equal protection to those they thus enfranchised . In spite of this , however , the result was that a double current of enfranchisement was established , which resulted in the daily diminution of the miserable order of serfs , and which , whilst it emancipated the lower orders , had the immediate result of giving increased weight and power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those of the nobility and their vassals . These social revolutions did not , of course , operate suddenly , nor did they at once abolish former institutions , for we still find , that after the establishment of communities and corporations , several orders of servitude remained . At the close of the thirteenth century , on the authority of Philippe de Beaumanoir , the celebrated editor of " Coutumes de Beauvoisis , " there were three states or orders amongst the laity , namely , the nobleman ( Fig. 22 ) , the free man , and the serf . All noblemen were free , but all free men were not necessarily noblemen . Generally , nobility descended from the father and franchise from the mother . But according to many other customs of France , the child , as a general rule , succeeded to the lower rank of his parents . There were two orders of serfs : one rigorously held in the absolute dependence of his lord , to such a degree that the latter could appropriate during his life , or after death if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ill-treat him as he thought proper , without having to answer to any one but God ; the other , though held equally in bondage , was more liberally treated , for " unless he was guilty of some evil-doing , the lord could ask of him nothing during his life but the fees , rents , or fines which he owed on account of his servitude . " If one of the latter class of serfs married a free woman , everything which he possessed became the property of his lord . The same was the case when he died , for he could not transmit any of his goods to his children , and was only allowed to dispose by will of a sum of about five sous , or about twenty-five francs of modern money . As early as the fourteenth century , serfdom or servitude no longer existed except in " mortmain , " of which we still have to speak . Illustration : The Court of Mary of Anjou , Wife of Charles VII . Her chaplain the learned Robert Blondel presents her with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Which he composed for her ( 1455 ) . Fac-simile of a miniature from this work . Bibl. de l'Arsenal , Paris . Mortmain consisted of the privation of the right of freely disposing of one 's person or goods . He who had not the power of going where he would , of giving or selling , of leaving by will or transferring his property , fixed or movable , as he thought best , was called a man of mortmain . Illustration : Fig. 22.  --  Italian Nobleman of the Fifteenth Century . From a Playing-card engraved on Copper about 1460 ( Cabinet des Estampes , National Library of Paris ) . This name was apparently chosen because the hand , " considered the symbol of power and the instrument of donation , " was deprived of movement , paralysed , in fact struck as by death . It was also nearly in this sense , that men of the Church were also called men of mortmain , because they were equally forbidden to dispose , either in life , or by will after death , of anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : real and personal ; one concerning land , and the other concerning the person ; that is to say , land held in mortmain did not change quality , whatever might be the position of the person who occupied it , and a " man of mortmain " did not cease to suffer the inconveniences of his position on whatever land he went to establish himself . The mortmains were generally subject to the greater share of feudal obligations formerly imposed on serfs ; these were particularly to work for a certain time for their lord without receiving any wages , or else to pay him the tax when it was due , on certain definite occasions , as for example , when he married , when he gave a dower to his daughter , when he was taken prisoner of war , when he went to the Holy Land , &c.,; &c.; What particularly characterized the condition of mortmains was , that the lords had the right to take all their goods when they died without issue , or when the children held a separate household ; and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by will or gift , beyond a certain sum . The noble who franchised mortmains , imposed on them in almost all cases very heavy conditions , consisting of fees , labours , and fines of all sorts . In fact , a mortmain person , to be free , not only required to be franchised by his own lord , but also by all the nobles on whom he was dependent , as well as by the sovereign . If a noble franchised without the consent of his superiors , he incurred a fine , as it was considered a dismemberment or depreciation of the fief . As early as the end of the fourteenth century , the rigorous laws of mortmain began to fall into disuse in the provinces ; though if the name began to disappear , the condition itself continued to exist . The free men , whether they belonged to the middle class or to the peasantry , were nevertheless still subject to pay fines or obligations to their lords of such a nature that they must be considered to have been practically in the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been so deeply rooted into social habits by feudalism , that to make it disappear totally at the end of the eighteenth century , it required three decrees of the National Convention ( July 17 and October 2 , 1793 ; and 8 Ventose , year II .  --  that is , March 2 , 1794 ) . It is only just to state , that twelve or fourteen years earlier , Louis XVI . had done all in his power towards the same purpose , by suppressing mortmain , both real or personal , on the lands of the Crown , and personal mortmain ( i.e. the right of following mortmains out of their original districts ) all over the kingdom .

So as to understand the numerous charges , dues , and servitudes , often as quaint as iniquitous and vexations , which weighed on the lower orders during the Middle Ages , we must remember how the upper class , who assumed to itself the privilege of oppression on lands and persons under the feudal System , was constituted . The Roman nobles , heirs to their fathers ' agricultural dominions , succeeded for the most part in preserving through the successive invasions of the barbarians , the influence attached to the prestige of birth and wealth ; they still possessed the greater part of the land and owned as vassals the rural populations . The Grerman nobles , on the contrary , had not such extended landed properties , but they appropriated all the strongest positions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of German origin . The Roman race , mixed with the blood of the various nations it had subdued , was the first to infuse itself into ancient Society , and only furnished barons of a secondary order . These heterogeneous elements , brought together , with the object of common dominion , constituted a body who found life and motion only in the traditions of Rome and ancient Germany . From these two historical sources , as is very judiciously pointed out by M. Mary-Lafon , issued all the habits of the new society , and particularly the rights and privileges assumed by the nobility . These rights and privileges , which we are about to pass summarily in review , were numerous , and often curious : amongst them may be mentioned the rights of treasure-trove , the rights of wreck , the rights of establishing fairs or markets , rights of marque , of sporting , &c.; The rights of treasure-trove were those which gave full power to dukes and counts over all minerals found on their properties . It was in asserting this right that the famous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his death . Adhemar , Viscount of Limoges , had discovered in a field a treasure , of which , no doubt , public report exaggerated the value , for it was said to be large enough to model in pure gold , and life-size , a Roman emperor and the members of his family , at table . Adhemar was a vassal of the Duke of Guienne , and , as a matter of course , set aside what was considered the sovereign 's share in his discovery ; but Richard , refusing to concede any part of his privilege , claimed the whole treasure . On the refusal of the viscount to give it up he appeared under arms before the gates of the Castle of Chalus , where he supposed that the treasure was hidden . On seeing the royal standard , the garrison offered to open the gates . " No , " answered Richard , " since you have forced me to unfurl my banner , I shall only enter by the breach , and you shall all be hung on the battlements . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favour the English , for the besieged made a noble stand . One evening , as his troops were assaulting the place , in order to witness the scene , Richard was sitting at a short distance on a piece of rock , protected with a target  --  that is , a large shield covered with leather and blades of iron  --  which two archers held over him . Impatient to see the result of the assault , Richard pushed down the shield , and that moment decided his fate ( 1199 ) . An archer of Chalus , who had recognised him and was watching from the top of the rampart , sent a bolt from a crossbow , which hit him full in the chest . The wound , however , would perhaps not have been mortal , but , shortly after , having carried the place by storm , and in his delight at finding the treasure almost intact , he gave himself up madly to degrading orgies , during which he had already dissipated the greater part of his treasure , and died of his wound twelve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bowman who caused his death . The right of shipwrecks , which the nobles of seaboard countries rarely renounced , and of which they were the more jealous from the fact that they had continually to dispute them with their vassals and neighbours , was the pitiless and barbaric right of appropriating the contents of ships happening to be wrecked on their shores .

When the feudal nobles granted to their vassals the right of assembling on certain days , in order to hold fairs and markets , they never neglected to reserve to themselves some tax on each head of cattle , as well as on the various articles brought in and put up for sale . As these fairs and markets never failed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this formed a very lucrative tax for the noble ( Fig. 26 ) . Illustration : Fig. 26.  --  Flemish Peasants at the Cattle Market .  --  Miniature of the " Chroniques de Hainaut . " Manuscripts of the Fifteenth Century , vol. ii . fol. 204 ( Library of the Dukes of Burgundy , Brussels ) . The right of marque , or reprisal , was a most barbarous custom . A famous example is given of it . In 1022 , William the Pious , Count of Angouleme , before starting for a pilgrimage to Rome , made his three brothers , who were his vassals , swear to live in honourable peace and good friendship . But , notwithstanding their oath , two of the brothers , having invited the third to the Easter festivities , seized him at night in his bed , put out his eyes so that he might not find the way to his castle , and cut out his tongue so that he might not name the authors of this horrible treatment . The voice of God , however , denounced them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ referred the case to his sovereign , the Duke of Aquitaine , William IV. , who immediately came , and by fire and sword exercised his right of marque on the lands of the two brothers , leaving them nothing but their lives and limbs , after having first put out their eyes and cut out their tongues , so as to inflict on them the penalty of retaliation . The right of sporting or hunting was of all prerogatives that dearest to , and most valued by the nobles . Not only were the severest and even cruellest penalties imposed on " vilains " who dared to kill the smallest head of game , but quarrels frequently arose between nobles of different degrees on the subject , some pretending to have a feudal privilege of hunting on the lands of others ( Fig. 27 ) . From this tyrannical exercise of the right of hunting , which the least powerful of the nobles only submitted to with the most violent and bitter feelings , sprung those old and familiar ballads , which indicate the popular sentiment on the subject . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by the order of Fairies or of the Fates , either to follow a phantom stag for everlasting , or to hunt , like King Artus , in the clouds and to catch a fly every hundred years . The right of jurisdiction , which gave judicial power to the dukes and counts in cases arising in their domains , had no appeal save to the King himself , and this was even often contested by the nobles , as for instance , in the unhappy case of Enguerrand de Coucy . Enguerrand had ordered three young Flemish noblemen , who were scholars at the Abbey of " St. Nicholas des Bois , " to be seized and hung , because , not knowing that they were on the domain of the Lord of Coucy , they had killed a few rabbits with arrows . St. Louis called the case before him . Enguerrand answered to the call , but only to dispute the King 's right , and to claim the judgment of his peers . The King , without taking any notice of the remonstrance , ordered Enguerrand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Louvre , and was nearly applying the law of retaliation to his case . Eventually he granted him letters of pardon , after condemning him to build three chapels , where masses were continually to be said for the three victims ; to give the forest where the young scholars had been found hunting , to the Abbey of " St. Nicholas des Bois ; " to lose on all his estates the rights of jurisdiction and sporting ; to serve three years in the Holy Land ; and to pay to the King a fine of 12,500 pounds tournois . It must be remembered that Louis IX. , although most generous in cases relating simply to private interests , was one of the most stubborn defenders of royal prerogatives . A right which feudalists had the greatest interest in observing , and causing to be respected , because they themselves might with their wandering habits require it at any moment , was that of safe convoy , or guidance . This right was so powerful , that it even applied itself to the lower orders , and its violation was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirteenth century , the King of Aragon was severely abused by all persons and all classes , because in spite of this right he caused a Jew to be burned so as not to have to pay a debt which the man claimed of him .

The right of " the Crown " should also be mentioned , which consisted of a circle of gold ornamented in various fashions , according to the different degrees of feudal monarchy , which vassals had to present to their lord on the day of his investiture . The right of seal was a fee or fine they had to pay for the charters which their lord caused to be delivered to them . The duty of aubaine was the fine or due paid by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feudal chief , when they passed near his castle , landed in his ports , or exposed goods for sale in his markets . The nobles of second order possessed among their privileges that of wearing spurs of silver or gold according to their rank of knighthood ; the right of receiving double rations when prisoners of war ; the right of claiming a year 's delay when a creditor wished to seize their land ; and the right of never having to submit to torture after trial , unless they were condemned to death for the crime they had committed . If a great baron for serious offences confiscated the goods of a noble who was his vassal , the latter had a right to keep his palfrey , the horse of his squire , various pieces of his harness and armour , his bed , his silk robe , his wife 's bed , one of her dresses , her ring , her cloth stomacher , &c.; The nobles alone possessed the right of having seats of honour in churches and in chapels ( Fig. 28 ) , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they maintained this right so rigorously and with so much effrontery , that fatal quarrels at times arose on questions of precedence . The epitaphs , the placing of tombs , the position of a monument , were all subjects for conflicts or lawsuits . The nobles enjoyed also the right of disinheritance , that is to say , of claiming the goods of a person dying on their lands who had no direct heir ; the right of claiming a tax when a fief or domain changed hands ; the right of common oven , or requiring vassals to make use of the mill , the oven , or the press of the lord . At the time of the vintage , no peasant might sell his wine until the nobles had sold theirs . Everything was a source of privilege for the nobles . Kings and councils waived the necessity of their studying , in order to be received as bachelors of universities . If a noble was made a prisoner of war , his life was saved by his nobility , and his ransom had practically to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The nobles were also exempted from serving in the militia , nor were they obliged to lodge soldiers , &c.; They had a thousand pretexts for establishing taxes on their vassals , who were generally considered " taxable and to be worked at will . " Thus in the domain of Montignac , the Count of Perigord claimed among other things as follows : " for every case of censure or complaint brought before him , 10 deniers ; for a quarrel in which blood was shed , 60 sols ; if blood was not shed , 7 sols ; for use of ovens , the sixteenth loaf of each baking ; for the sale of corn in the domain , 43 setiers : besides these , 6 setiers of rye , 161 setiers of oats , 3 setiers of beans , 1 pound of wax , 8 capons , 17 hens , and 37 loads of wine . " There were a multitude of other rights due to him , including the provostship fees , the fees on deeds , the tolls and furnaces of towns , the taxes on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the right of fishing ; for the right of sporting , which last gave the lord a certain part or quarter of the game killed , and , in addition , the dime or tenth part of all the corn , wine , &c.,; &c.; Illustration : Fig. 28.  --  Jean Jouvenel des Ursins , Provost of the Merchants of Paris , and Michelle de Vitry , his Wife , in the Reign of Charles VI .  --  Fragment of a Picture of the Period , which was in the Chapel of the Ursinus , and is now in the Versailles Museum . This worthy noble gathered in besides all this , during the religious festivals of the year , certain tributes in money on the estate of Montignac alone , amounting to as much as 20,000 pounds tournois . One can judge by this rough sketch , of the income he must have had , both in good and bad years , from his other domains in the rich county of Perigord . It must not be imagined that this was an exceptional case ; all over the feudal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lord farmed both his lands and the persons whom feudal right had placed under his dependence . Illustration : Fig. 29.  --  Dues on Wines , granted to the Chapter of Tournai by King Chilperic.  --  From the Windows of the Cathedral of Tournai , Fifteenth Century . To add to these already excessive rates and taxes , there were endless dues , under all shapes and names , claimed by the ecclesiastical lords ( Figs. 29 and 30 ) . And not only did the nobility make without scruple these enormous exactions , but the Crown supported them in avenging any act , however opposed to all sense of justice ; so that the nobles were really placed above the great law of equality , without which the continuance of social order seemed normally impossible . The history of the city of Toulouse gives us a significant example on this subject . Illustration : Fig. 30.  --  The Bishop of Tournai receiving the Tithe of Beer granted by King Chilperic.  --  From the Windows of the Cathedral of Tournai , Fifteenth Century . On Easter Day , 1335 , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the anniversary of the resurrection of our Saviour in drinking , left the table half intoxicated , and ran about the town during the hours of service , beating pans and cauldrons , and making such a noise and disturbance , that the indignant preachers were obliged to stop in the middle of their discourses , and claimed the intervention of the municipal authorities of Toulouse . One of these , the lord of Gaure , went out of church with five sergeants , and tried himself to arrest the most turbulent of the band . But as he was seizing him by the body , one of his comrades gave the lord a blow with a dagger , which cut off his nose , lips , and part of his chin . This occurrence aroused the whole town . Toulouse had been insulted in the person of its first magistrate , and claimed vengeance . The author of the deed , named Aimeri de Berenger , was seized , judged , condemned , and beheaded , and his body was suspended on the spikes of the Chateau Narbonnais . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paris haranguing the Emperor Charles IV . in 1377.  --  From a Miniature of the Manuscript of the " Chroniques de St. Denis , " No. 8395 ( National Library of Paris ) . Toulouse had to pay dearly for the respect shown to its municipal dignity . The parents of the student presented a petition to the King against the city , for having dared to execute a noble and to hang his body on a gibbet , in opposition to the sacred right which this noble had of appealing to the judgment of his peers . The Parliament of Paris finally decided the matter with the inflexible partiality to the rights of rank , and confiscated all the goods of the inhabitants , forced the principal magistrates to go on their knees before the house of Aimeri de Berenger , and ask pardon ; themselves to take down the body of the victim , and to have it publicly and honourably buried in the burial-ground of the Daurade . Such was the sentence and humiliation to which one of the first towns of the south was subjected , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would certainly have suffered no vindication , if the culprit condemned to death had belonged to the middle or lower orders . We must nevertheless remember that heavy dues fell upon the privileged class themselves to a certain degree , and that if they taxed their poor vassals without mercy , they had in their turn often to reckon with their superiors in the feudal hierarchy . Albere , or right of shelter , was the principal charge imposed upon the noble . When a great baron visited his lands , his tenants were not only obliged to give him and his followers shelter , but also provisions and food , the nature and quality of which were all arranged beforehand with the most extraordinary minuteness . The lesser nobles took advantage sometimes of the power they possessed to repurchase this obligation ; but the rich , on the contrary , were most anxious to seize the occasion of proudly displaying before their sovereign all the pomp in their power , at the risk even of mortgaging their revenues for several years , and of ruining their vassals . History is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain nobles on such occasions . Payments in kind fell generally on the abbeys , up to 1158 . That of St. Denis , which was very rich in lands , was charged with supplying the house and table of the King . This tax , which became heavier and heavier , eventually fell on the Parisians , who only succeeded in ridding themselves of it in 1374 , when Charles V. made all the bourgeois of Paris noble . In the twelfth century , all furniture made of wood or iron which was found in the house of the Bishop at his death , became the property of the King . But in the fourteenth century , the abbots of St. Denis , St. Germain des Pres , St. Genevieve ( Fig. 32 ) , and a few priories in the neighbourhood of Paris , were only required to present the sovereign with two horse-loads of produce annually , so as to keep up the old system of fines . This system of rents and dues of all kinds was so much the basis of social organization in the Middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefited by it . Thus the bed of the Bishop of Paris belonged , after his death , to the poor invalids of the Hotel Dieu . The canons were also bound to leave theirs to that hospital , as an atonement for the sins which they had committed . The Bishops of Paris were required to give two very sumptuous repasts to their chapters at the feasts of St. Eloi and St. Paul . The holy men of St. Martin were obliged , annually , on the 10th of November , to offer to the first President of the Court of Parliament , two square caps , and to the first usher , a writing-desk and a pair of gloves . The executioner too received , from various monastic communities of the capital , bread , bottles of wine , and pigs ' heads ; and even criminals who were taken to Montfaucon to be hung had the right to claim bread and wine from the nuns of St. Catherine and the Filles Dieux , as they passed those establishments on their way to the gibbet .

Fines were levied everywhere , at all times , and for all sorts of reasons . Under the name of epices , the magistrates , judges , reporters , and counsel , who had at first only received sweetmeats and preserves as voluntary offerings , eventually exacted substantial tribute in current coin . Scholars who wished to take rank in the University sent some small pies , costing ten sols , to each examiner . Students in philosophy or theology gave two suppers to the president , eight to the other masters , besides presenting them with sweetmeats , &c.; It would be an endless task to relate all the fines due by apprentices and companions before they could reach mastership in their various crafts , nor have we yet mentioned certain fines , which , from their strange or ridiculous nature , prove to what a pitch of folly men may be led under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we read of vassals descending to the humiliating occupation of beating the water of the moat of the castle , in order to stop the noise of the frogs , during the illness of the mistress ; we elsewhere find that at times the lord required of them to hop on one leg , to kiss the latch of the castle-gate , or to go through some drunken play in his presence , or sing a somewhat broad song before the lady . At Tulle , all the rustics who had married during the year were bound to appear on the Puy or Mont St. Clair . At twelve o'clock precisely , three children came out of the hospital , one beating a drum violently , the other two carrying a pot full of dirt ; a herald called the names of the bride-grooms , and those who were absent or were unable to assist in breaking the pot by throwing stones at it , paid a fine . At Perigueux , the young couples had to give the consuls a pincushion of embossed leather or cloth of different colours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present them with an earthen pot containing twelve sticks of different woods ; a woman marrying for the third time , a barrel of cinders passed thirteen times through the sieve , and thirteen spoons made of wood of fruit-trees ; and , lastly , one coming to the altar for the fifth time was obliged to bring with her a small tub containing the excrement of a white hen ! " The people of the Middle Ages and the Renaissance period were literally tied down with taxes and dues of all sorts , " says M. Mary-Lafon . " If a few gleams of liberty reached them , it was only from a distance , and more in the hope of the future than as regarded the present . As an example of the way people were treated , a certain Lord of Laguene , spoken of in the old chronicles of the south , may be mentioned . Every year , this cunning baron assembled his tenants in the village square . A large maypole was planted , and on the top was attached a wren . The lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that if any ' vilain ' succeeded in piercing him with an arrow he should be exempt from that year 's dues .

One can easily understand how such a system , legalised by law , hampered the efforts for freedom , which a sense of human dignity was constantly raising in the bosoms of the oppressed . The struggle was long , often bloody , and at times it seemed almost hopeless , for on both sides it was felt that the contest was between two principles which were incompatible , and one of which must necessarily end by annihilating the other . Any compromise between the complete slavery and the personal freedom of the lower orders , could only be a respite to enable these implacable adversaries to reinforce themselves , so as to resume with more vigour than ever this desperate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remain doubtful .

These efforts to obtain individual liberty displayed themselves more particularly in towns ; but although they became almost universal in the west , they had not the same importance or character everywhere . The feudal system had not everywhere produced the same consequences . Thus , whilst in ancient Gaul it had absorbed all social vitality , we find that in Germany , the place of its origin , the Teutonic institutions of older date gave a comparative freedom to the labourers . In southern countries again we find the same beneficial effect from the Roman rule . On that long area of land reaching from the southern slope of the Cevennes to the Apennines , the hand of the barbarian had weighed much less heavily than on the rest of Europe . In those favoured provinces where Roman organization had outlived Roman patronage , it seems as if ancient splendour had never ceased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ruins . There , a sort of urban aristocracy always continued , as a balance against the nobles , and the counsel of elected prud'hommes , the syndics , jurors or capitouls , who in the towns replaced the Roman honorati and curiales , still were considered by kings and princes as holding some position in the state . The municipal body , larger , more open than the old " ward , " no longer formed a corporation of unwilling aristocrats enchained to privileges which ruined them . The principal cities on the Italian coast had already amassed enormous wealth by commerce , and displayed the most remarkable ardour , activity , and power . The Eternal City , which was disputed by emperors , popes , and barons of the Roman States , bestirred itself at times to snatch at the ancient phantom of republicanism ; and this phantom was destined soon to change into reality , and another Rome , or rather a new Carthage , the lovely Venice , arose free and independent from the waves of the Adriatic ( Fig. 34 ) . In Lombardy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the contrary , weighed heavily ; but there , too , the cities were populous and energetic , and the struggle for supremacy continued for centuries in an uncompromising manner between the people and the nobles , between the Guelphs and the Ghibellines . In the north and east of the Gallic territory , the instinct of resistance did not exist any the less , though perhaps it was more intermittent . In fact , in these regions we find ambitious nobles forestalling the action of the King , and in order to attach towns to themselves and their houses , suppressing the most obnoxious of the taxes , and at the same time granting legal guarantees . For this the Counts of Flanders became celebrated , and the famous Heribert de Vermandois was noted for being so exacting in his demands with the great , and yet so popular with the small . Illustration : Fig. 34.  --  View of St. Mark 's Place , Venice , Sixteenth Century , after Cesare Vecellio . The eleventh century , during which feudal power rose to its height , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ townspeople against the nobility . The spirit of the city revived with that of the bourgeois ( a name derived from the Teutonic word burg , habitation ) and infused a feeling of opposition to the system which followed the conquest of the Teutons . " But , " says M. Henri Martin , " what reappeared was not the Roman municipality of the Empire , stained by servitude , although surrounded with glittering pomp and gorgeous arts , but it was something coarse and almost semi-barbarous in form , though strong and generous at core , and which , as far as the difference of the times would allow , rather reminds us of the small republics which existed previous to the Roman Empire . " Two strong impulses , originating from two totally dissimilar centres of action , irresistibly propelled this great social revolution , with its various and endless aspects , affecting all central Europe , and being more or less felt in the west , the north , and the south . On one side , the Greek and Latin partiality for ancient corporations , modified by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characteristic of barbaric tribes ; and on the other , the free spirit and equality of the old Celtic tribes rising suddenly against the military hierarchy , which was the offspring of conquest . Europe was roused by the double current of ideas which simultaneously urged her on to a new state of civilisation , and more particularly to a new organization of city life . Italy was naturally destined to be the country where the new trials of social regeneration were to be made ; but she presented the greatest possible variety of customs , laws , and governments , including Emperor , Pope , bishops , and feudal princes . In Tuscany and Liguria , the march towards liberty was continued almost without effort ; whilst in Lombardy , on the contrary , the feudal resistance was very powerful . Everywhere , however , cities became more or less completely enfranchised , though some more rapidly than others . In Sicily , feudalism swayed over the countries ; but in the greater part of the peninsula , the democratic spirit of the cities influenced the enfranchisement of the rural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the barons were transformed into patricians of the noble towns which gave their republican magistrates the old title of consuls . The Teutonic Emperor in vain sought to seize and turn to his own interest the sovereignty of the people , who had shaken off the yokes of his vassals : the signal of war was immediately given by the newly enfranchised masses ; and the imperial eagle was obliged to fly before the banners of the besieged cities . Happy indeed might the cities of Italy have been had they not forgotten , in their prosperity , that union alone could give them the possibility of maintaining that liberty which they so freely risked in continual quarrels amongst one another ! Illustration : Fig. 35.  --  William , Duke of Normandy , accompanied by Eustatius , Count of Boulogne , and followed by his Knights in arms .  --  Military Dress of the Eleventh Century , from Bayeux Tapestry said to have been worked by Queen Matilda . The Italian movement was immediately felt on the other side of the Alps . In Provence , Septimanie , and Aquitaine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoyed considerable freedom . Under the name of communities and universities , which meant that all citizens were part of the one body , they jointly interfered in the general affairs of the kingdom to which they belonged . Their magistrates were treated on a footing of equality with the feudal nobility , and although the latter at first would only recognise them as " good men " or notables , the consuls knew how to make a position for themselves in the hierarchy . If the consulate , which was a powerful expression of the most prominent system of independence , did no succeed in suppressing feudalism in Provence as in Italy , it at least so transformed it , that it deprived it of its most unjust and insupportable elements . At Toulouse , for instance ( where the consuls were by exception called capitouls , that is to say , heads of the chapters or councils of the city ) , the lord of the country seemed less a feudal prince in his capital , than an honorary magistrate of the bourgeoisie . Avignon added to her consuls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At Marseilles , the University of the high city was ruled by a republic under the presidency of the Count of Provence , although the lower city was still under the sovereignty of a viscount . Perigueux , which was divided into two communities , " the great and the small fraternity , " took up arms to resist the authority of the Counts of Perigord ; and Arles under its podestats was governed for some time as a free and imperial town . Amongst the constitutions which were established by the cities , from the eleventh to the sixteenth centuries , we find admirable examples of administration and government , so that one is struck with admiration at the efforts of intelligence and patriotism , often uselessly lavished on such small political arenas . The consulate , which nominally at least found its origin in the ancient grandeur of southern regions , did not spread itself beyond Lyons . In the centre of France , at Poictiers , Tours , Moulin , &c.,; the urban progress only manifested itself in efforts which were feeble and easily suppressed ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provinces between the Seine and the Rhine , and even between the Seine and the Loire , the system of franchise took footing and became recognised . In some places , the revolution was effected without difficulty , but in others it gave rise to the most determined struggles . In Normandy , for instance , under the active and intelligent government of the dukes of the race of Roll or Rollon , the middle class was rich and even warlike . It had access to the councils of the duchy ; and when it was contemplated to invade England , the Duke William ( Fig. 35 ) found support from the middle class , both in money and men . The case was the same in Flanders , where the towns of Ghent ( Fig. 36 ) , of Bruges , of Ypres , after being enfranchised but a short time developed with great rapidity . But in the other counties of western France , the greater part of the towns were still much oppressed by the counts and bishops . If some obtained certain franchises , these privileges were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their nobles . A town between the Loire and the Seine gave the signal which caused the regeneration of the North . The inhabitants of Mans formed a community or association , and took an oath that they would obtain and maintain certain rights . They rebelled about 1070 , and forced the count and his noble vassals to grant them the freedom which they had sworn to obtain , though William of Normandy very soon restored the rebel city to order , and dissolved the presumptuous community . However , the example soon bore fruit . Cambrai rose in its turn and proclaimed the " Commune , " and although its bishop , aided by treason and by the Count of Hainault , reduced it to obedience , it only seemed to succumb for a time , to renew the struggle with greater success at a subsequent period . Illustration : Fig. 36.  --  Civic Guard of Ghent ( Brotherhood of St. Sebastian ) , from a painting on the Wall of the Chapel of St. John and St. Paul , Ghent , near the Gate of Bruges . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistake the true meaning of this word , which , under a Latin form ( communitas ) , expresses originally a Germanic idea , and in its new form a Christian mode of living . Societies of mutual defence , guilds , &c.,; had never disappeared from Germanic and Celtic countries ; and , indeed , knighthood itself was but a brotherhood of Christian warriors . The societies of the Paix de Dieu , and of the Treve de Dieu , were encouraged by the clergy in order to stop the bloody quarrels of the nobility , and formed in reality great religious guilds . This idea of a body of persons taking some common oath to one another , of which feudalism gave so striking an example , could not fail to influence the minds of the rustics and the lower classes , and they only wanted the opportunity which the idea of the Commune at once gave them of imitating their superiors . They too took oaths , and possessed their bodies and souls in " common ; " they seized , by force of strategy , the ramparts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and jurors , who were charged to watch over the interests of their association . They swore to spare neither their goods , their labour , nor their blood , in order to free themselves ; and not content with defending themselves behind barricades or chains which closed the streets , they boldly took the offensive against the proud feudal chiefs before whom their fathers had trembled , and they forced the nobles , who now saw themselves threatened by this armed multitude , to acknowledge their franchise by a solemn covenant . It does not follow that everywhere the Commune was established by means of insurrection , for it was obtained after all sorts of struggles ; and franchises were sold in some places for gold , and in others granted by a more or less voluntary liberality . Everywhere the object was the same ; everywhere they struggled or negotiated to upset , by a written constitution or charter , the violence and arbitrary rule under which they had so long suffered , and to replace by an annual and fixed rent , under the protection of an independent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so long made by the nobility and royalty . Circumstanced as they were , what other means had they to attain this end but ramparts and gates , a common treasury , a permanent military force , and magistrates who were both administrators , judges , and captains ? The hotel de ville , or mansion-house , immediately became a sort of civic temple , where the banner of the Commune , the emblems of unity , and the seal which sanctioned the municipal acts were preserved . Then arose the watch-towers , where the watchmen were unceasingly posted night and day , and whence the alarm signal was ever ready to issue its powerful sounds when danger threatened the city . These watch-towers , the monuments of liberty , became as necessary for the burghers as the clock-towers of their cathedrals , whose brilliant peals and joyous chimes gave zest to the popular feasts ( Fig. 37 ) .

We read of the Commune of Cambrai , four times created , four times destroyed , and which was continually at war with the Bishops ; the Commune of Beauvais , sustained on the contrary by the diocesan prelate against two nobles who possessed feudal rights over it ; Laon , a commune bought for money from the bishop , afterwards confirmed by the King , and then violated by fraud and treachery , and eventually buried in the blood of its defenders . We read also of St. Quentin , where the Count of Vermandois and his vassals voluntarily swore to maintain the right of the bourgeois , and scrupulously respected their oath . In many other localities the feudal dignitaries took alarm simply at the name of Commune , and whereas they would not agree to the very best arrangements under this terrible designation , they did not hesitate to adopt them when called either the " laws of friendship , " the " peace of God , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for instance , the bourgeois magistrates took the name of appeasers , or watchers over friendship .

The most terrible and sanguinary war was sustained by the bourgeois against their count and lord of the manor , assisted by King Louis le Gros , who had under similar circumstances just taken the part of the nobles of Laon . From Amiens , which , having been triumphant , became a perfect municipal republic , the example propagated itself throughout the rest of Picardy , the Isle of France , Normandy , Brittany , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shocks , reached the region of Lyons , where the consulate , a characteristic institution of southern Communes , ended . From Flanders , also , the movement spread in the direction of the German Empire ; and there , too , the struggle was animated , and victorious against the aristocracy , until at last the great system of enfranchisement prevailed ; and the cities of the west and south formed a confederation against the nobles , whilst those in the north formed the famous Teutonic Hanse , so celebrated for its maritime commerce . The centre of France slowly followed the movement ; but its progress was considerably delayed by the close influence of royalty , which sometimes conceded large franchises , and sometimes suppressed the least claims to independence . The kings , who willingly favoured Communes on the properties of their neighbours , did not so much care to see them forming on their own estates ; unless the exceptional position and importance of any town required a wise exercise of tolerance . Thus Orleans , situated in the heart of the royal domains , was roughly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was on the frontier of the Duchy of Normandy , and still under the King of England , had but to ask in order to receive its franchise from the King of France . It was particularly in the royal domains that cities were to be found , which , although they did not possess the complete independence of communes , had a certain amount of liberty and civil guarantees . They had neither the right of war , the watch-tower , nor the exclusive jurisdiction over their elected magistrates , for the bailiffs and the royal provosts represented the sovereign amongst them ( Fig. 39 ) . Illustration : Fig. 39.  --  Bailliage , or Tribunal of the King 's Bailiff .  --  Fac-simile of an Engraving on Wood in the Work of Josse Damhoudere , " Praxis Rerum Civilium . " ( Antwerp , 1557 , in 4to . ) . In Paris , less than anywhere , could the kings consent to the organization of an independent political System , although that city succeeded in creating for itself a municipal existence . The middle-class influence originated in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Corporation of the Water Trade , " formed a centre round which were successively attached various bodies of different trades . Gradually a strong concourse of civic powers was established , which succeeded in electing a municipal council , composed of a provost of merchants , four aldermen , and twenty-six councillors of the town . This council afterwards succeeded in overstepping the royal influence at difficult times , and was destined to play a prominent part in history . There also sprang up a lower order of towns or boroughs than these bourgeois cities , which were especially under the Crown . Not having sufficient strength to claim a great amount of liberty , they were obliged to be satisfied with a few privileges , conceded to them by the nobles , for the most part with a political end . These were the Free Towns or New Towns which we have already named . However it came about , it is certain that although during the tenth century feudal power was almost supreme in Europe , as early as the twelfth century the municipal system had gained great weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kingdom became developed on a more and more extended basis , so that it was then necessary for it to give up its primitive nature , and to participate in the great movement of consolidisation and national unity . In this way the position of the large towns in the state relatively lost their individual position , and became somewhat analogous , as compared with the kingdom at large , to that formerly held by bourgeois in the cities . Friendly ties arose between provinces ; and distinct and rival interests were effaced by the general aspiration towards common objects . The towns were admitted to the states general , and the citizens of various regions mixed as representatives of the Tiers Etat . Three orders thus met , who were destined to struggle for predominance in the future . We must call attention to the fact that , as M. Henri Martin says , by an apparent contradiction , the fall of the Communes declared itself in inverse ratio to the progress of the Tiers Etat . By degrees , as the government became more settled from the great fiefs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other courts of appeal which emanated from the middle class extended their high judiciary and military authority , so the central power , organized under monarchical form , must necessarily have been less disposed to tolerate the local independence of the Communes . The State replaced the Commune for everything concerning justice , war , and administration . No doubt some valuable privileges were lost ; but that was only an accidental circumstance , for a great social revolution was produced , which cleared off at once all the relics of the old age ; and when the work of reconstruction terminated , homage was rendered to the venerable name of " Commune , " which became uniformly applied to all towns , boroughs , or villages into which the new spirit of the same municipal system was infused .

Augustin Thierry , taking Gregory of Tours , the Merovingian Herodotus , as an authority , thus describes a royal domain under the first royal dynasty of France :  --  " This dwelling in no way possessed the military aspect of the chateau of the Middle Ages ; it was a large building surrounded with porticos of Roman architecture , sometimes built of carefully polished and sculptured wood , which in no way was wanting in elegance . Around the main body of the building were arranged the dwellings of the officers of the palace , either foreigners or Romans , and those of the chiefs of companies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their warriors under the King , that is to say , under a special engagement of vassalage and fidelity . Other houses , of less imposing appearance , were occupied by a great number of families , who worked at all sorts of trades , such as jewellery , the making of arms , weaving , currying , the embroidering of silk and gold , cotton , &c.; " Farm-buildings , paddocks , cow-houses , sheepfolds , barns , the houses of agriculturists , and the cabins of the serfs , completed the royal village , which perfectly resembled , although on a larger scale , the villages of ancient Germany . There was something too in the position of these dwellings which resembled the scenery beyond the Rhine ; the greater number of them were on the borders , and some few in the centre of great forests , which have since been partly destroyed , and the remains of which we so much admire .

Although historical documents are not very explicit respecting those remote times , it is only sufficient to study carefully a very small portion of the territory in order to form some idea of the manners and customs of the Franks ; for in the royal domain we find the existence of all classes , from the sovereign himself down to the humblest slave . As regards the private life , however , of the different classes in this elementary form of society , we have but approximate and very imperfect notions . It is clear , however , that as early as the beginning of the Merovingian race , there was much more luxury and comfort among the upper classes than is generally supposed . All the gold and silver furniture , all the jewels , and all the rich stuffs which the Gallo-Romans had amassed in their sumptuous dwellings , had not been destroyed by the barbarians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the rest had fallen into the hands of the chiefs of companies in the division of spoil . A well-known anecdote , namely , that concerning the Vase of Soissons ( Fig. 41 ) , which King Clovis wished to preserve , and which a soldier broke with an axe , proves that many gems of ancient art must have disappeared , owing to the ignorance and brutality of the conquerors ; although it is equally certain that the latter soon adopted the tastes and customs of the native population . At first , they appropriated everything that flattered their pride and sensuality . This is how the material remains of the civilisation of the Gauls were preserved in the royal and noble residences , the churches , and the monasteries . Gregory of Tours informs us , that when Fredegonde , wife of Chilperic , gave the hand of her daughter Rigouthe to the son of the Gothic king , fifty chariots were required to carry away all the valuable objects which composed the princess 's dower . A strange family scene , related by the same historian , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court of that terrible queen of the Franks . " The mother and daughter had frequent quarrels , which sometimes ended in the most violent encounters . Fredegonde said one day to Rigouthe , ' Why do you continually trouble me ? Here are the goods of your father , take them and do as you like with them . ' And conducting her to a room where she locked up her treasures , she opened a large box filled with valuables . After having pulled out a great number of jewels which she gave to her daughter , she said , ' I am tired ; put your own hands in the box , and take what you find . ' Rigouthe bent down to reach the objects placed at the bottom of the box ; upon which Fredegonde immediately lowered the lid on her daughter , and pressed upon it with so much force that the eyes began to start out of the princess 's head . A maid began screaming , ' Help ! my mistress is being murdered by her mother ! ' and Rigouthe was saved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this was only one of the minor crimes attributed by history to Fredegonde the Terrible , who always carried a dagger or poison about with her . Amongst the Franks , as amongst all barbaric populations , hunting was the pastime preferred when war was not being waged . The Merovingian nobles were therefore determined hunters , and it frequently happened that hunting occupied whole weeks , and took them far from their homes and families . But when the season or other circumstances prevented them from waging war against men or beasts , they only cared for feasting and gambling . To these occupations they gave themselves up , with a determination and wildness well worthy of those semi-civilised times . It was the custom for invited guests to appear armed at the feasts , which were the more frequent , inasmuch as they were necessarily accompanied with religious ceremonies . It often happened that these long repasts , followed by games of chance , were stained with blood , either in private quarrels or in a general melee . One can easily imagine the tumult which must have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other fermented drinks , such as beer , &c.,; had excited every one to the highest pitch of unchecked merriment . Illustration : Fig. 42.  --  Costumes of the Women of the Court from the Sixth to the Tenth Centuries , from Documents collected by H. de Vielcastel , in the great Libraries of Europe . Some of the Merovingian kings listened to the advice of the ministers of the Catholic religion , and tried to reform these noisy excesses , and themselves abandoned the evil custom . For this purpose they received at their tables bishops , who blessed the assembly at the commencement of the meal , and were charged besides to recite chapters of holy writ , or to sing hymns out of the divine service , so as to edify and occupy the minds of the guests . Gregory of Tours bears witness to the happy influence of the presence of bishops at the tables of the Frank kings and nobles ; he relates , too , that Chilperic , who was very proud of his theological and secular knowledge , liked , when dining , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions of grammar , before his companions in arms , who , for the most part , neither knew how to read nor write ; he even went as far as to order three ancient Greek letters to be added to the Latin alphabet . Illustration : Fig. 43.  --  Queen Fredegonde , seated on her Throne , gives orders to two young Men of Terouanne to assassinate Sigebert , King of Austrasia.  --  Window in the Cathedral of Tournai , Fifteenth Century . The private properties of the Frank kings were immense , and produced enormous revenues . These monarchs had palaces in almost all the large towns ; at Bourges , Chalons-sur-Saone , Chalons-sur-Marne , Dijon , Etampes , Metz , Langres , Mayence , Rheims , Soissons , Tours , Toulouse , Treves , Valenciennes , Worms , &c.; In Paris , they occupied the vast residence now known as the Thermes de Julien ( Hotel de Cluny ) , which then extended from the hill of St. Genevieve as far as the Seine ; but they frequently left it for their numerous villas in the neighbourhood , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All these residences were built on the same plan . High walls surrounded the palace . The Roman atrium , preserved under the name of proaulium ( preau , ante-court ) , was placed in front of the salutorium ( hall of reception ) , where visitors were received . The consistorium , or great circular hall surrounded with seats , served for legislation , councils , public assemblies , and other solemnities , at which the kings displayed their royal pomp . The trichorium , or dining-room , was generally the largest hall in the palace ; two rows of columns divided it into three parts ; one for the royal family , one for the officers of the household , and the third for the guests , who were always very numerous . No person of rank visiting the King could leave without sitting at his table , or at least draining a cup to his health . The King 's hospitality was magnificent , especially on great religious festivals such as Christmas and Easter . The royal apartments were divided into winter and summer rooms . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used , according to the season ; this circulated in the pipes of the hypocauste , or the subterranean furnace which warmed the baths . The rooms with chimneys were called epicaustoria ( stoves ) , and it was the custom hermetically to close these when any one wished to be anointed with ointments and aromatic essences . In the same manner as the Gallo-Roman houses , the palaces of the Frank kings and principal nobles of ecclesiastical or military order had thermes , or bath-rooms : to the thermes were attached a colymbum , or washhouse , a gymnasium for bodily exercise , and a hypodrome , or covered gallery for exercise , which must not be confounded with the hippodrome , a circus where horse-races took place . Sometimes after the repast , in the interval between two games of dice , the nobles listened to a bard , who sang the brilliant deeds of their ancestors in their native tongue . Under the government of Charlemagne , the private life of his subjects seems to have been less rough and coarse , although they did not entirely give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long time buried in monasteries , reappeared like beautiful exiles at the imperial court , and social life thereby gained a little charm and softness . Charlemagne had created in his palace , under the direction of Alcuin , a sort of academy called the " School of the Palace , " which followed him everywhere . The intellectual exercises of this school generally brought together all the members of the imperial family , as well as all the persons of the household . Charlemagne , in fact , was himself one of the most attentive followers of the lessons given by Alcuin . He was indeed the principal interlocutor and discourser at the discussions , which were on all subjects , religions , literary , and philosophical . Illustration : Fig. 44.  --  Costumes of the Nobility from the Seventh to the Ninth Centuries , from Documents gathered by H. de Vielcastel from the great Libraries of Europe . Charlemagne took as much pains with the administration of his palace as he did with that of his States . In his " Capitulaires , " a work he wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ details in that respect . For instance , he not only interested himself in his warlike and hunting equipages , but also in his kitchen and pleasure gardens . He insisted upon knowing every year the number of his oxen , horses , and goats ; he calculated the produce of the sale of fruits gathered in his orchards , which were not required for the use of his house ; he had a return of the number of fish caught in his ponds ; he pointed out the shrubs best calculated for ornamenting his garden , and the vegetables which were required for his table , &c.; The Emperor generally assumed the greatest simplicity in his dress . His daily attire consisted of a linen shirt and drawers , and a woollen tunic fastened with a silk belt . Over this tunic he threw a cloak of blue stuff , very long behind and before , but very short on each side , thus giving freedom to his arms to use his sword , which he always wore . On his feet he wore bands of stuffs of various colours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also . In winter , when he travelled or hunted on horseback , he threw over his shoulders a covering of otter or sheepskin . The changes in fashion which the custom of the times necessitated , but to which he would never submit personally , induced him to issue several strenuous orders , which , however , in reality had hardly any effect . He was most simple as regards his food and drink , and made a habit of having pious or historical works read to him during his repasts . He devoted the morning , which with him began in summer at sunrise , and in winter earlier , to the political administration of his empire . He dined at twelve with his family ; the dukes and chiefs of various nations first waited on him , and then took their places at the table , and were waited on in their turn by the counts , prefects , and superior officers of the court , who dined after them . When these had finished the different chiefs of the household sat down , and they were succeeded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not dine till midnight , and had to content themselves with what was left . When occasion required , however , this powerful Emperor knew how to maintain the pomp and dignity of his station ; but as soon as he had done what was necessary , either for some great religious festival or otherwise , he returned , as if by instinct , to his dear and native simplicity . It must be understood that the simple tastes of Charlemagne were not always shared by the princes and princesses of his family , nor by the magnates of his court ( Fig. 45 ) . Poets and historians have handed down to us descriptions of hunts , feasts , and ceremonies , at which a truly Asiatic splendour was displayed . Eginhard , however , assures us that the sons and daughters of the King were brought up under their father 's eye in liberal studios ; that , to save them from the vice of idleness , Charlemagne required his sons to devote themselves to all bodily exercises , such as horsemanship , handling of arms , &c.,; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From what is recorded , however , of the frivolous habits and irregular morals of these princesses , it is evident that they but imperfectly realised the end of their education . Illustration : Fig. 45.  --  Costumes of the Ladies of the Nobility in the Ninth Century , from a Miniature in the Bible of Charles the Bold ( National Library of Paris ) . Science and letters , which for a time were brought into prominence by Charlemagne and also by his son Louis , who was very learned and was considered skilful in translating and expounding Scripture , were , however , after the death of these two kings , for a long time banished to the seclusion of the cloisters , owing to the hostile rivalry of their successors , which favoured the attacks of the Norman pirates . All the monuments and relics of the Gallo-Roman civilisation , which the great Emperor had collected , disappeared in the civil wars , or were gradually destroyed by the devastations of the northerners . The vast empire which Charlemagne had formed became gradually split up , so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protect churches and monasteries , as well as castles and homesteads , from the attacks of internal as well as foreign enemies , towers and impregnable fortresses began to rise in all parts of Europe , and particularly in France . Illustration : Fig. 46.  --  Towers of the Castle of Semur , and of the Castle of Nogent-le-Rotrou ( Present Condition ) .  --  Specimens of Towers of the Thirteenth Century . During the first period of feudalism , that is to say from the middle of the ninth to the middle of the twelfth centuries , the inhabitants of castles had little time to devote to the pleasures of private life . They had not only to be continually under arms for the endless quarrels of the King and the great chiefs ; but they had also to oppose the Normans on one side , and the Saracens on the other , who , being masters of the Spanish peninsula , spread like the rising tide in the southern counties of Languedoc and Provence . It is true that the Carlovingian warriors obtained a handsome and rich reward for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seized upon the provinces and districts which had been originally entrusted to their charge , and the origin of their feudal possession was soon so far forgotten , that their descendants pretended that they held the lands , which they had really usurped regardless of their oath , from heaven and their swords . It is needless to say , that at that time the domestic life in these castles must have been dull and monotonous ; although , according to M. Guizot , the loneliness which was the resuit of this rough and laborious life , became by degrees the pioneer of civilisation . " When the owner of the fief left his castle , his wife remained there , though in a totally different position from that which women generally held . She remained as mistress , representing her husband , and was charged with the defence and honour of the fief . This high and exalted position , in the centre of domestic life , often gave to women an opportunity of displaying dignity , courage , virtue , and intelligence , which would otherwise have remained hidden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moral development , and to the general improvement of their condition . Illustration : Fig. 47.  --  Woman under the Safeguard of Knighthood , allegorical Scene .  --  Costume of the End of the Fifteenth Century , from a Miniature in a Latin Psalm Book ( Manuscript No. 175 , National Library of Paris ) . " The importance of children , and particularly of the eldest son , was greater in feudal houses than elsewhere .... The eldest son of the noble was , in the eyes of his father and of all his followers , a prince and heir-presumptive , and the hope and glory of the dynasty . These feelings , and the domestic pride and affection of the various members one to another , united to give families much energy and power ..... Add to this the influence of Christian ideas , and it will be understood how this lonely , dull , and hard castle life was , nevertheless , favourable to the development of domestic society , and to that improvement in the condition of women which plays such a great part in the history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Court of Love in Provence in the Fourteenth Century ( Manuscript of the National Library of Paris ) . Whatever opinion may be formed of chivalry , it is impossible to deny the influence which this institution exercised on private life in the Middle Ages . It considerably modified custom , by bringing the stronger sex to respect and defend the weaker . These warriors , who were both simple and externally rough and coarse , required association and intercourse with women to soften them ( Fig. 47 ) . In taking women and helpless widows under their protection , they were necessarily more and more thrown in contact with them . A deep feeling of veneration for woman , inspired by Christianity , and , above all , by the worship of the Virgin Mary , ran throughout the songs of the troubadours , and produced a sort of sentimental reverence for the gentle sex , which culminated in the authority which women had in the courts of love ( Fig. 48 ) . We have now reached the reign of Philip Augustus , that is to say , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not only for its political history , but also for its effect on civilisation . Christianity had then considerably influenced the world ; arts , sciences , and letters , animated by its influence , again began to appear , and to add charms to the leisure of private life . The castles were naturally the first to be affected by this poetical and intellectual regeneration , although it has been too much the custom to exaggerate the ignorance of those who inhabited them . We are too apt to consider the warriors of the Middle Ages as totally devoid of knowledge , and as hardly able to sign their names , as far as the kings and princes are concerned . This is quite an error ; for many of the knights composed poems which exhibit evidence of their high literary culture . It was , in fact , the epoch of troubadours , who might be called professional poets and actors , who went from country to country , and from castle to castle , relating stories of good King Artus of Brittany and of the Knights of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Emperor Charlemagne and his followers . These minstrels were always accompanied by jugglers and instrumentalists , who formed a travelling troop ( Fig. 49 ) , having no other mission than to amuse and instruct their feudal hosts . After singing a few fragments of epics , or after the lively recital of some ancient fable , the jugglers would display their art or skill in gymnastic feats or conjuring , which were the more appreciated by the spectators , in that the latter were more or less able to compete with them . These wandering troops acted small comedies , taken from incidents of the times . Sometimes , too , the instrumentalists formed an orchestra , and dancing commenced . It may be here remarked that dancing at this epoch consisted of a number of persons forming large circles , and turning to the time of the music or the rhythm of the song . At least the dances of the nobles are thus represented in the MSS. of the Middle Ages . To these amusements were added games of calculation and chance , the fashion for which had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draughts , and chess , to which certain knights devoted all their leisure . From the reign of Philip Augustus , a remarkable change seems to have taken place in the private life of kings , princes , and nobles . Although his domains and revenues had always been on the increase , this monarch never displayed , in ordinary circumstances at least , much magnificence . The accounts of his private expenses for the years 1202 and 1203 have been preserved , which enable us to discover some curious details bearing witness to the extreme simplicity of the court at that period . The household of the King or royal family was still very small : one chancellor , one chaplain , a squire , a butler , a few Knights of the Temple , and some sergeants-at-arms were the only officers of the palace . The king and princes of his household only changed apparel three times during the year . Illustration : Fig. 49.  --  King David playing on the Lyre , surrounded by four Musicians .  --  Costumes of the Thirteenth Century ( from a Miniature in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The children of the King slept in sheets of serge , and their nurses were dressed in gowns of dark-coloured woollen stuff , called brunette . The royal cloak , which was of scarlet , was jewelled , but the King only wore it on great ceremonies . At the same time enormous expenses were incurred for implements of war , arrows , helmets with visors , chariots , and for the men-at-arms whom the King kept in his pay . Louis IX . personally kept up almost similar habits . The Sire de Joinville tells us in his " Chronicles , " that the holy King on his return from his first crusade , in order to repair the damage done to his treasury by the failure of this expedition , would no longer wear costly furs nor robes of scarlet , and contented himself with common stuffs trimmed with hare-skin . He nevertheless did not diminish the officers of his household , which had already become numerous ; and being no doubt convinced that royalty required magnificence , he surrounded himself with as much pomp as the times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this magnificence increased , and descended to the great vassals , who were soon imitated by the knights " bannerets . " There seemed to be a danger of luxury becoming so great , and so general in all classes of feudal society , that in 1294 an order of the King was issued , regulating in the minutest details the expenses of each person according to his rank in the State , or the fortune which he could prove . But this law had the fate of all such enactments , and was either easily evaded , or was only partially enforced , and that with great difficulty . Another futile attempt to put it in practice was made in 1306 , when the splendour of dress , of equipages , and of table had become still greater and more ruinous , and had descended progressively to the bourgeois and merchants . It must be stated in praise of Philip le Bel ( Fig. 50 ) that , notwithstanding the failure of his attempts to arrest the progress of luxury , he was not satisfied with making laws against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studied a strict economy in his own household , which recalled the austere times of Philip Augustus . Thus , in the curious regulations relating to the domestic arrangements of the palace , the Queen , Jeanne de Navarre , was only allowed two ladies and three maids of honour in her suite , and she is said to have had only two four-horse carriages , one for herself and the other for these ladies . In another place these regulations require that a butler , specially appointed , " should buy all the cloth and furs for the king , take charge of the key of the cupboards where these are kept , know the quantity given to the tailors to make clothes , and check the accounts when the tailors send in their claims for the price of their work .

After the death of the pious Jeanne de Navarre , to whom perhaps we must attribute the wise measures of her husband , Philip le Bel , the expenses of the royal household materially increased , especially on the occasions of the marriages of the three young sons of the King , from 1305 to 1307 . Gold , diamonds , pearls , and precious stones were employed profusely , both for the King 's garments and for those of the members of the royal family . The accounts of 1307 mention considerable sums paid for carpets , counterpanes , robes , worked linen , &c.; A chariot of state , ornamented and covered with paintings , and gilded like the back of an altar , is also mentioned , and must have been a great change to the heavy vehicles used for travelling in those days . Down to the reign of St. Louis the furniture of castles had preserved a character of primitive simplicity which did not , however , lack grandeur . The stone remained uncovered in most of the halls , or else it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , coloured in distemper . Against the wall , and also against the pillars supporting the arches , arms and armour of all sorts were hung , arranged in suits , and interspersed with banners and pennants or emblazoned standards . In the great middle hall , or dining-room , there was a long massive oak table , with benches and stools of the same wood . At the end of this table , there was a large arm-chair , overhung with a canopy of golden or silken stuff , which was occupied by the owner of the castle , and only relinquished by him in favour of his superior or sovereign . Often the walls of the hall of state were hung with tapestry , representing groves with cattle , heroes of ancient history , or events in the romance of chivalry . The floor was generally paved with hard stone , or covered with enamelled tiles . It was carefully strewn with scented herbs in summer , and straw in winter . Philip Augustus ordered that the Hotel Dieu of Paris should receive the herbs and straw which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was only very much later that this troublesome system was replaced by mats and carpets . The bedrooms were generally at the top of the towers , and had little else by way of furniture , besides a very large bed , with or without curtains , a box in which clothes were kept , and which also served as a seat , and a priedieu chair , which sometimes contained prayer and other books of devotion . These lofty rooms , whose thick walls kept out the heat in summer , and the cold in winter , were only lighted by a small window or loophole , closed with a square of oiled paper or of thin horn . A great change took place in the abodes of the nobility in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries ( Fig. 51 ) . We find , for instance , in Sauval 's " History and Researches of the Antiquities of the City of Paris , " that the abodes of the kings of the first dynasty had been transformed into Palaces of Justice by Philip le Bel ; the same author also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the Hotel St. Paul , which the kings inhabited when their court was in the capital . But even without examining into all the royal abodes , it will suffice to give an account of the Hotel de Boheme , which , after having been the home of the Sires de Nesles , of Queen Blanche of Castille , and other great persons , was given by Charles VI. , in 1388 , to his brother , the famous Duke Louis of Orleans .

Each of these suites of rooms consisted of a great hall , a chamber of state , a large chamber , a wardrobe , some closets , and a chapel . The windows of the halls were thirteen and a half feetA high by four and a half wide . The state chambers were eight ' toises , ' that is , about fifty feet and a half long .

There were , besides , eight carpets of glossy texture , with gold flowers ; one representing " The Seven Virtues and the Seven Vices ; " another the history of Charlemagne ; another that of St. Louis .

" Illustration : Fig. 53.  --  Styli used in writing in the Fourteenth Century . Such were the habits in private life of the royal princes under Charles VI. ; and it can easily be shown that the example of royalty was followed not only by the court , but also in the remotest provinces . The great tenants or vassals of the crown each possessed several splendid mansions in their fiefs ; the Dukes of Burgundy , at Souvigny , at Moulins , and at Bourbon l'Archambault ; the Counts of Champagne , at Troyes ; the Dukes of Burgundy , at Dijon ; and all the smaller nobles made a point of imitating their superiors . From the fifteenth to the sixteenth centuries , the provinces which now compose France were studded with castles , which were as remarkable for their interior , architecture as for the richness of their furniture ; and it may be asserted that the luxury which was displayed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the resuit , of a great social revolution in the manners and customs of private life . At the end of the fourteenth century there lived a much-respected noble of Anjou , named Geoffroy de Latour-Landry , who had three daughters . In his old age , he resolved that , considering the dangers which might surround them in consequence of their inexperience and beauty , he would compose for their use a code of admonitions which might guide them in the various circumstances of life . Illustration : A Young Mother 's Retinue Representing the Parisian costumes at the end of the fourteenth century . Fac-simile of a miniature from the latin Terence of King Charles VI . From a manuscript in the Bibl. de l'Arsenal . This book of domestic maxims is most curious and instructive , from the details which it contains respecting the manners and customs , mode of conduct , and fashions of the nobility of the period ( Fig. 54 ) . The author mostly illustrates each of his precepts by examples from the life of contemporary personages . Illustration : Fig. 54.  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .  --  Miniature in the " Merveilles du Monde " ( Manuscript , National Library of Paris ) . The first advice the knight gives his daughters is , to begin the day with prayer ; and , in order to give greater weight to his counsel , he relates the following anecdote : " A noble had two daughters ; the one was pious , always saying her prayers with devotion , and regularly attending the services of the church ; she married an honest man , and was most happy . The other , on the contrary , was satisfied with hearing low mass , and hurrying once or twice through the Lord 's Prayer , after which she went off to indulge herself with sweetmeats . She complained of headaches , and required careful diet . She married a most excellent knight ; but , one evening , taking advantage of her husband being asleep , she shut herself up in one of the rooms of the palace , and in company with the people of the household began eating and drinking in the most riotous and excessive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find his wife by his side , got up , and , armed with a stick , betook himself to the scene of festivity . He struck one of the domestics with such force that he broke his stick in pieces , and one of the fragments flew into the lady 's eye and put it out . This caused her husband to take a dislike to her , and he soon placed his affections elsewhere . " " My pretty daughters , " the moralising parent proceeds , " be courteous and meek , for nothing is more beautiful , nothing so secures the favour of God and the love of others . Be then courteous to great and small ; speak gently with them .... I have seen a great lady take off her cap and bow to a simple ironmonger . One of her followers seemed astonished . ' I prefer , ' she said , ' to have been too courteous towards that man , than to have been guilty of the least incivility to a knight . ' " Illustration : Fig. 55.  --  Noble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hoods ( Fourteenth Century ) , from a Miniature in the " Merveilles du Monde " ( Manuscript in the Imperial Library of Paris ) . Latour-Landry also advised his daughters to avoid outrageous fashions in dress . " Do not be hasty in copying the dress of foreign women . I will relate a story on this subject respecting a bourgeoise of Guyenne and the Sire de Beaumanoir . The lady said to him , ' Cousin , I come from Brittany , where I saw my fine cousin , your wife , who was not so well dressed as the ladies of Guyenne and many other places . The borders of her dress and of her bonnet are not in fashion . ' The Sire answered , ' Since you find fault with the dress and cap of my wife , and as they do not suit you , I shall take care in future that they are changed ; but I shall be careful not to choose them similar to yours .... Understand , madam , that I wish her to be dressed according to the fashion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not like those of England . It was these last who first introduced into Brittany the large borders , the bodices opened on the hips , and the hanging sleeves . I remember the time , and saw it myself , and I have little respect for women who adopt these fashions . ' " Respecting the high head-dresses " which cause women to resemble stags who are obliged to lower their heads to enter a wood , " the knight relates what took place in 1392 at the fete of St. Marguerite . " There was a young and pretty woman there , quite differently dressed from the others ; every one stared at her as if she had been a wild beast . One respectable lady approached her and said , ' My friend , what do you call that fashion ? ' She answered , ' It is called the " gibbet dress . " ' ' Indeed ; but that is not a fine name ! ' answered the old lady . Very soon the name of ' gibbet dress ' got known all round the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was thus bedecked . " This head-dress did in fact owe its name to its summit , which resembled a gibbet . These extracts from the work of this honest knight , suffice to prove that the customs of French society had , as early as the end of the fourteenth century , taken a decided character which was to remain subject only to modifications introduced at various historical periods . Amongst the customs which contributed most to the softening and elegance of the feudal class , we must cite that of sending into the service of the sovereign for some years all the youths of both sexes , under the names of varlets , pages , squires , and maids of honour . No noble , of whatever wealth or power , ever thought of depriving his family of this apprenticeship and its accompanying chivalric education . Up to the end of the twelfth century , the number of domestic officers attached to a castle was very limited ; we have seen , for instance , that Philip Augustus contented himself with a few servants , and his queen with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . this household was much increased , and under Philippe le Bel and his sons the royal household had become so considerable as to constitute quite a large assemblage of young men and women . Under Charles VI. , the household of Queen Isabella of Bavaria alone amounted to forty-five persons , without counting the almoner , the chaplains , and clerks of the chapel , who must have been very numerous , since the sums paid to them amounted to the large amount of four hundred and sixty francs of gold per annum .

Under Charles VIII. , Louis XII. , and Francis I. , the service of the young nobility , which was called " apprenticeship of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ range ; for the first families of the French nobility were most eager to get their children admitted into the royal household , either to attend on the King or Queen , or at any rate on one of the princes of the royal blood . Anne of Brittany particularly gave special attention to her female attendants ( Fig. 56 ) . " She was the first , " says Brantome in his work on " Illustrious Women , " " who began to form the great court of ladies which has descended to our days ; for she had a considerable retinue both of adult ladies and young girls . She never refused to receive any one ; on the contrary , she inquired of the gentlemen of the court if they had any daughters , ascertained who they were , and asked for them . " It was thus that the Admiral de Graville ( Fig. 57 ) confided to the good Queen the education of his daughter Anne , who at this school of the Court of Ladies became one of the most distinguished women of her day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ created a company of one hundred Breton gentlemen , who accompanied her everywhere . " They never failed , " says the author of " Illustrious Women , " " when she went to mass or took a walk , to await her return on the little terrace of Blois , which is still called the Perche aux Bretons . She gave it this name herself ; for when she saw them she said , ' There are my Bretons on the perch waiting for me . ' " We must not forget that this queen , who became successively the wife of Charles VIII . and of Louis XII. , had taken care to establish a strict discipline amongst the young men and women who composed her court . She rightly considered herself the guardian of the honour of the former , and of the virtue of the latter ; therefore , as long as she lived , her court was renowned for purity and politeness , noble and refined gallantry , and was never allowed to degenerate into imprudent amusements or licentious and culpable intrigues . Unfortunately , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Although the court of France continued to gather around it almost every sort of elegance , and although it continued during the whole of the sixteenth century the most polished of European courts , notwithstanding the great external and civil wars , yet it afforded at the same time a sad example of laxity of morals , which had a most baneful influence on public habits ; so much so that vice and corruption descended from class to class , and contaminated all orders of society . If we wished to make investigations into the private life of the lower orders in those times , we should not succeed as we have been able to do with that of the upper classes ; for we have scarcely any data to throw light upon their sad and obscure history . Bourgeois and peasants were , as we have already shown , long included together with the miserable class of serfs , a herd of human beings without individuality , without significance , who from their birth to their death , whether isolated or collectively , were the " property " of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this degraded multitude , bowed down under the most tyrannical and humiliating dependence , we can scarcely imagine ; it was in fact but a purely material existence , which has left scarcely any trace in history . Illustration : Fig. 57.  --  Louis de Mallet , Lord of Graville , Admiral of France , 1487 , in Costume of War and Tournament , from an Engraving of the Sixteenth Century ( National Library of Paris , Cabinet des Estampes ) . Many centuries elapsed before the dawn of liberty could penetrate the social strata of this multitude , thus oppressed and denuded of all power of action . The development was slow , painful , and dearly bought , but at last it took place ; first of all towns sprang up , and with them , or rather by their influence , the inhabitants became possessed of social life . The agricultural population took its social position many generations later . As we have already seen , the great movement for the creation of communes and bourgeoisies only dates from the unsettled period ranging from the eleventh to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , already rich and luxurious , parading on all occasions their personal opulence . Their private life could only be an imitation of that in the chateaux ; by degrees as wealth strengthened and improved their condition , and rendered them independent , we find them trying to procure luxuries equal or analogous to those enjoyed by the upper classes , and which appeared to them the height of material happiness . In all times the small have imitated the great . It was in vain that the great obstinately threatened , by the exercise of their prerogatives , to try and crush this tendency to equality which alarmed them , by issuing pecuniary edicts , summary laws , coercive regulations , and penal ordinances ; by the force of circumstances the arbitrary restrictions which the nobility laid upon the lower classes gradually disappeared , and the power of wealth displayed itself in spite of all their efforts to suppress it . In fact , occasions were not wanting in which the bourgeois class was able to refute the charge of unworthiness with which the nobles sought to stamp it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or employed in the administration of the provinces , many of its members distinguished themselves by firmness and wisdom ; when called upon to assist in the national defence , they gave their blood and their gold with noble self-denial ; and lastly , they did not fail to prove themselves possessed of those high and delicate sentiments of which the nobility alone claimed the hereditary possession . Illustration : Fig. 58.  --  Burgess of Ghent and his Wife , in ceremonial Attire , kneeling in Church , from a painted Window belonging to a Chapel in that Town ( Fifteenth Century ) . " The bourgeois , " says Arnaud de Marveil , one of the most famous troubadours of the thirteenth century , " have divers sorts of merits : some distinguish themselves by deeds of honour , others are by nature noble and behave accordingly . There are others thoroughly brave , courteous , frank , and jovial , who , although poor , find means to please by graceful speech , frequenting courts , and making themselves agreeable there ; these , well versed in courtesy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conspicuously at the tournaments and military games , proving themselves good judges and good company . " Down to the thirteenth century , however rich their fathers or husbands might be , the women of the bourgeoisie were not permitted , without incurring a fine , to use the ornaments and stuffs exclusively reserved for the nobility . During the reigns of Philip Augustus and Louis IX. , although these arbitrary laws were not positively abolished , a heavy blow was inflicted on them by the marks of confidence , esteem , and honour which these monarchs found pleasure in bestowing on the bourgeoisie . We find the first of these kings , when on the point of starting for a crusade , choosing six from amongst the principal members of the parloir aux bourgeois ( it was thus that the first Hotel de Ville , situated in the corner of the Place de la Greve , was named ) to be attached to the Council of Regency , to whom he specially confided his will and the royal treasure . His grandson made a point of following his grandsire 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the new element which the Parisian bourgeoisie was about to establish in political life by making the bourgeois Etienne Boileau one of his principal ministers of police , and the bourgeois Jean Sarrazin his chamberlain . Under these circumstances , the whole bourgeoisie gloried in the marks of distinction conferred upon their representatives , and during the following reign , the ladies of this class , proud of their immense fortunes , but above all proud of the municipal powers held by their families , bedecked themselves , regardless of expense , with costly furs and rich stuffs , notwithstanding that they were forbidden by law to do so . Then came an outcry on the part of the nobles ; and we read as follows , in an edict of Philippe le Bel , who inclined less to the bourgeoisie than to the nobles , and who did not spare the former in matters of taxation :  --  " No bourgeois shall have a chariot nor wear gold , precious stones , or crowns of gold or silver . Bourgeois , not being either prelates nor dignitaries of state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possessing two thousand pounds ( tournois ) or more , may order for himself a dress of twelve sous six deniers , and for his wife one worth sixteen sous at the most . " The sou , which was but nominal money , may be reckoned as representing twenty francs , and the denier one franc , but allowance must be made for the enormous difference in the value of silver , which would make twenty francs in the thirteenth century represent upwards of two hundred francs of present currency . Illustration : Fig. 59.  --  The new-born Child , from a Miniature in the " Histoire de la Belle Helaine " ( Manuscript of the Fifteenth Century , National Library of Paris ) . But these regulations as to the mode of living were so little or so carelessly observed , that all the successors of Philippe le Bel thought it necessary to re-enact them , and , indeed , Charles VII. , one century later , was obliged to censure the excess of luxury in dress by an edict which was , however , no better enforced than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said lord " ( the King Charles VII. ) , " that of all nations of the habitable globe there are none so changeable , outrageous , and excessive in their manner of dress , as the French nation , and there is no possibility of discovering by their dress the state or calling of persons , be they princes , nobles , bourgeois , or working men , because all are allowed to dress as they think proper , whether in gold or silver , silk or wool , without any regard to their calling . " At the end of the thirteenth century , a rich merchant of Valenciennes went to the court of the King of France wearing a cloak of furs covered with gold and pearls ; seeing that no one offered him a cushion , he proudly sat on his cloak . On leaving he did not attempt to take up the cloak ; and on a servant calling his attention to the fact he remarked , " It is not the custom in my country for people to carry away their cushions with them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wife Jeanne de Navarre to the towns of Bruges and Ghent , the historian Jean Mayer relates that Jeanne , on seeing the costly array of the bourgeois of those two rich cities , exclaimed , " I thought I was the only queen here , but I see more than six hundred ! " In spite of the laws , the Parisian bourgeoisie soon rivalled the Flemish in the brilliancy of their dress . Thus , in the second half of the fourteenth century , the famous Christine de Pisan relates that , having gone to visit the wife of a merchant during her confinement , it was not without some amazement that she saw the sumptuous furniture of the apartment in which this woman lay in bed ( Fig. 59 ) . The walls were hung with precious tapestry of Cyprus , on which the initials and motto of the lady were embroidered ; the sheets were of fine linen of Rheims , and had cost more than three hundred pounds ; the quilt was a new invention of silk and silver tissue ; the carpet was like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silk , and rested her head and arms on pillows , ornamented with buttons of oriental pearls . It should be remarked that this lady was not the wife of a large merchant , such as those of Venice and Genoa , but of a simple retail dealer , who was not above selling articles for four sous ; such being the case , we need not be surprised that Christine should have considered the anecdote " worthy of being immortalised in a book . " It must not , however , be assumed that the sole aim of the bourgeoisie was that of making a haughty and pompous display . This is refuted by the testimony of the " Menagier de Paris , " a curious anonymous work , the author of which must have been an educated and enlightened bourgeois . The " Menagier , " which was first published by the Baron Jerome Pichon , is a collection of counsels addressed by a husband to his young wife , as to her conduct in society , in the world , and in the management of her household . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the young housewife ; and the second relates to the arrangements necessary for the welfare of her house . It must be remembered that the comparatively trifling duties relating to the comforts of private life , which devolved on the wife , were not so numerous in those days as they are now ; but on the other hand they required an amount of practical knowledge on the part of the housewife which she can nowadays dispense with . Under this head the " Menagier " is full of information . After having spoken of the prayers which a Christian woman should say morning and evening , the author discusses the great question of dress , which has ever been of supreme importance in the eyes of the female sex : " Know , dear sister , " ( the friendly name he gives his young wife ) , " that in the choice of your apparel you must always consider the rank of your parents and mine , as also the state of my fortune . Be respectably dressed , without devoting too much study to it , without too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , see that the collar of your gown be well adjusted and is not put on crooked . " Illustration : Fig. 60.  --  Sculptured Comb , in Ivory , of the Sixteenth Century ( Sauvageot Collection ) Then he dilates on the characters of women , which are too often wilful and unmanageable ; on this point , for he is not less profuse in examples than the Chevalier de Latour-Landry , he relates an amusing anecdote , worthy of being repeated and remembered . " I have heard the bailiff of Tournay relate , that he had found himself several times at table with men long married , and that he had wagered with them the price of a dinner under the following conditions : the company was to visit the abode of each of the husbands successively , and any one who had a wife obedient enough immediately , without contradicting or making any remark , to consent to count up to four , would win the bet ; but , on the other hand , those whose wives showed temper , laughed , or refused to obey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adjourned to the abode of Robin , whose wife , called Marie , had a high opinion of herself . The husband said before all , ' Marie , repeat after me what I shall say . ' ' Willingly , sire . ' ' Marie , say , " One , two , three ! " ' But by this time Marie was out of patience , and said , ' And seven , and twelve , and fourteen ! Why , you are making a fool of me ! ' So that husband lost his wager . " The company next went to the house of Maitre Jean , whose wife , Agnescat well knew how to play the lady . Jean said , ' Repeat after me , one ! ' ' And two ! ' answered Agnescat disdainfully ; so he lost his wager . Tassin then tried , and said to dame Tassin , ' Count one ! ' ' Go upstairs ! ' she answered , ' if you want to teach counting , I am not a child . ' Another said , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senses , ' or similar words , which made the husbands lose their wagers . Those , on the contrary , who had well-behaved wives gained their wager and went away joyful . " This amusing quotation suffices to show that the author of the " Menagier de Paris " wished to adopt a jocose style , with a view to enliven the seriousness of the subject he was advocating . The part of his work in which he discusses the administration of the house is not less worthy of attention . One of the most curious chapters of the work is that in which he points out the manner in which the young bourgeoise is to behave towards persons in her service . Rich people in those days , in whatever station of life , were obliged to keep a numerous retinue of servants . It is curious to find that so far back as the period to which we allude , there was in Paris a kind of servants ' registry office , where situations were found for servant-maids from the country . The bourgeois gave up the entire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on account of her extreme youth , the author of the work in question recommends his wife only to engage servants who shall have been chosen by Dame Agnes , the nun whom he had placed with her as a kind of governess or companion . " Before engaging them , " he says , " know whence they come ; in what houses they have been ; if they have acquaintances in town , and if they are steady . Discover what they are capable of doing ; and ascertain that they are not greedy , or inclined to drink . If they come from another country , try to find out why they left it ; for , generally , it is not without some serious reason that a woman decides upon a change of abode . When you have engaged a maid , do not permit her to take the slightest liberty with you , nor allow her to speak disrespectfully to you . If , on the contrary , she be quiet in her demeanour , honest , modest , and shows herself amenable to reproof , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Superintend the work to be done ; and choose among your servants those qualified for each special department .

" Illustration : Fig. 61.  --  Dress of Maidservants in the Thirteenth Century .  --  Miniature in a Manuscript of the National Library of Paris . To these severe instructions upon the management of servants , the bourgeois adds a few words respecting their morality . He recommends that they be not permitted to use coarse or indecent language , or to insult one another ( Fig. 61 ) . Although he is of opinion that necessary time should be given to servants at their meals , he does not approve of their remaining drinking and talking too long at table : concerning which practice he quotes a proverb in use at that time : " Quand varlet presche a table et cheval paist en gue , il @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; " which means , that when a servant talks at table and a horse feeds near a watering-place it is time he should be removed ; he has been there long enough . Illustration : Fig. 62.  --  Hotel des Ursins , Paris , built during the Fourteenth Century , restored in the Sixteenth , and now destroyed .  --  State of the North Front at the End of the last Century . The manner in which the author concludes his instruction proves his kindness of heart , as well as his benevolence : " If one of your servants fall sick , it is your duty , setting everything else aside , to see to his being cured . " It was thus that a bourgeois of the fifteenth century expressed himself ; and as it is clear that he could only have been inspired to dictate his theoretical teachings by the practical experience which he must have gained for the most part among the middle class to which he belonged , we must conclude that in those days the bourgeoisie possessed considerable knowledge of moral dignity and social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the merchant and working bourgeoisie  --  who , above all , owed their greatness to the high functions of the municipality  --  the parliamentary bourgeoisie had raised itself to power , and that from the fourteenth century it played a considerable part in the State , holding at several royal courts at different periods , and at last , almost hereditarily , the highest magisterial positions . The very character of these great offices of president , or of parliamentary counsel , barristers , &c.,; proves that the holders must have had no small amount of intellectual culture . In this way a refined taste was created among this class , which the protection of kings , princes , and lords had alone hitherto encouraged . We find , for example , the Grosliers at Lyons , the De Thous and Seguiers in Paris , regardless of their bourgeois origin , becoming judicious and zealous patrons of poets , scholars , and artists . A description of Paris , published in the middle of the fifteenth century , describes amongst the most splendid residences of the capital the hotels of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de Dampmartin , of Guillaume Seguin , of Mille Baillet , of Martin Double , and particularly that of Jacques Duchie , situated in the Rue des Prouvaires , in which were collected at great cost collections of all kinds of arms , musical instruments , rare birds , tapestry , and works of art . In each church in Paris , and there were upwards of a hundred , the principal chapels were founded by celebrated families of the ancient bourgeoisie , who had left money for one or more masses to be said daily for the repose of the souls of their deceased members . In the burial-grounds , and principally in that of the Innocents , the monuments of these families of Parisian bourgeoisie were of the most expensive character , and were inscribed with epitaphs in which the living vainly tried to immortalise the deeds of the deceased . Every one has heard of the celebrated tomb of Nicholas Flamel and Pernelle his wife ( Fig. 63 ) , the cross of Bureau , the epitaph of Yolande Bailly , who died in 1514 , at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have seen , two hundred and ninety-five children descended from her . " In fact , the religious institutions of Paris afford much curious and interesting information relative to the history of the bourgeoisie . For instance , Jean Alais , who levied a tax of one denier on each basket of fish brought to market , and thereby amassed an enormous fortune , left the whole of it at his death for the purpose of erecting a chapel called St. Agnes , which soon after became the church of St. Eustace . He further directed that , by way of expiation , his body should be thrown into the sewer which drained the offal from the market , and covered with a large stone ; this sewer up to the end of the last century was still called Pont Alais .

Very often when citizens made gifts during their lifetime to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ privileges which were calculated to cause the motives which had actuated them to be open to criticism . Thus , in 1304 , the daughters of Nicholas Arrode , formerly provost of the merchants , presented to the church of St. Jacques-la-Boucherie the house and grounds which they inhabited , but one of them reserved the right of having a key of the church that she might go in whenever she pleased . Guillaume Haussecuel , in 1405 , bought a similar right for the sum of eighteen sols parisis per annum ( equal to twenty-five francs ) ; and Alain and his wife , whose house was close to two chapels of the church , undertook not to build so as in any way to shut out the light from one of the chapels on condition that they might open a small window into the chapel , and so be enabled to hear the service without leaving their room .

We thus see that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prominent position in history , and became so grasping after power that it ventured , at a period which does not concern us here , to aspire to every sort of distinction , and to secure an important social standing . What had been the exception during the sixteenth century became the rule two centuries later . We will now take a glance at the agricultural population ( Fig. 64 ) , who , as we have already stated , were only emancipated from serfdom at the end of the eighteenth century . But whatever might have been formerly the civil condition of the rural population , everything leads us to suppose that there were no special changes in their private and domestic means of existence from a comparatively remote period down to almost the present time . A small poem of the thirteenth century , entitled , " De l'Oustillement au Vilain , " gives a clear though rough sketch of the domestic state of the peasantry . Strange as it may seem , it must be acknowledged that , with a few exceptions resulting from the progress of time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present day , to find the exact type maintained in the country districts farthest away from the capital and large towns ; at all events , they were faithfully represented at the time of the revolution of 1789 . Illustration : Fig. 65.  --  Sedentary Occupations of the Peasauts.  --  Fac-simile from an Engraving on Wood , attributed to Holbein , in the " Cosmographie " of Munster ( Basle , 1552 , folio ) . We gather from this poem , which must be considered an authentic and most interesting document , that the manse or dwelling of the villain comprised three distinct buildings ; the first for the corn , the second for the hay and straw , the third for the man and his family . In this rustic abode a fire of vine branches and faggots sparkled in a large chimney furnished with an iron pot-hanger , a tripod , a shovel , large fire-irons , a cauldron and a meat-hook . Next to the fireplace was an oven , and in close proximity to this an enormous bedstead , on which the villain , his wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for hospitality , could all be easily accommodated ; a kneading trough , a table , a bench , a cheese cupboard , a jug , and a few baskets made up the rest of the furniture . The villain also possessed other utensils , such as a ladder , a mortar , a hand-mill  --  for every one then was obliged to grind his own corn ; a mallet , some nails , some gimlets , fishing lines , hooks , and baskets , &c.; Illustration : Fig. 66.  --  Villains before going to Work receiving their Lord 's Orders .  --  Miniature in the " Proprietaire des Choses. "  --  Manuscript of the Fifteenth Century ( Library of the Arsenal , in Paris ) . His working implements were a plough , a scythe , a spade , a hoe , large shears , a knife and a sharpening stone ; he had also a waggon , with harness for several horses , so as to be able to accomplish the different tasks required of him under feudal rights , either by his proper lord , or by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon to undertake every kind of work of this sort . His dress consisted of a blouse of cloth or skin fastened by a leather belt round the waist , an overcoat or mantle of thick woollen stuff , which fell from his shoulders to half-way down his legs ; shoes or large boots , short woollen trousers , and from his belt there hung his wallet and a sheath for his knife ( Figs. 66 and 71 ) . He generally went bareheaded , but in cold weather or in rain he wore a sort of hat of similar stuff to his coat , or one of felt with a broad brim . He seldom wore mouffles , or padded gloves , except when engaged in hedging . A small kitchen-garden , which he cultivated himself , was usually attached to the cottage , which was guarded by a large watch-dog . There was also a shed for the cows , whose milk contributed to the sustenance of the establishment ; and on the thatched roof of this and his cottage the wild cats hunted the rats and mice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season , and the children were taught from infancy to work by the side of their parents ( Fig. 65 ) . If , then , we find so much resemblance between the abodes of the villains of the thirteenth century and those of the inhabitants of the poorest communes of France in the present day , we may fairly infer that there must be a great deal which is analogous between the inhabitants themselves of the two periods ; for in the chateaux as well as in the towns we find the material condition of the dwellings modifying itself conjointly with that of the moral condition of the inhabitants . Illustration : Fig. 67.  --  The egotistical and envious Villain .  --  From a Miniature in " Proverbes et Adages , &c.,"; Manuscript of the La Valliere Fund , in the National Library of Paris , with this legend : " Attrapez y sont les plus fins : Qui trop embrasse mal estraint . " ( " The cleverest burn their fingers at it , And those who grasp all may lose all . " ) Another little poem entitled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ composed about the same period as the one above referred to , gives us a graphic description of the varieties of character among the feudal peasants . One example is given of a man who will not tell a traveller the way , but merely in a surly way answers , " You know it better than I " ( Fig. 67 ) . Another , sitting at his door on a Sunday , laughs at those passing by , and says to himself when he sees a gentleman going hawking with a bird on his wrist , " Ah ! that bird will eat a hen to-day , and our children could all feast upon it ! " Another is described as a sort of madman who equally despises God , the saints , the Church , and the nobility . His neighbour is an honest simpleton , who , stopping in admiration before the doorway of Notre Dame in Paris in order to admire the statues of Pepin , Charlemagne , and their successors , has his pocket picked of his purse . Another villain is supposed to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ le Bailli ; " he is very eloquent in trying to show that in the time of their ancestors the cows had a free right of pasture in such and such a meadow , or the sheep on such and such a ridge ; then there is the miser , and the speculator , who converts all his possessions into ready money , so as to purchase grain against a bad season ; but of course the harvest turns out to be excellent , and he does not make a farthing , but runs away to conceal his ruin and rage . There is also the villain who leaves his plough to become a poacher . There are many other curious examples which altogether tend to prove that there has been but little change in the villager class since the first periods of History . Illustration : Fig. 68.  --  The covetous and avaricious Villain .  --  From a Miniature in " Proverbes et Adages , &c,"; Manuscript in the National Library of Paris , with this legend : " Je suis icy levant les yeulx Eu ce haut lieu des @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avec les dens . " ( " Even on this lofty height We yet look higher , As nothing will satisfy us But to clutch the moon . " ) Notwithstanding the miseries to which they were generally subject , the rural population had their days of rest and amusement , which were then much more numerous than at present . At that period the festivals of the Church were frequent and rigidly kept , and as each of them was the pretext for a forced holiday from manual labour , the peasants thought of nothing , after church , but of amusing themselves ; they drank , talked , sang , danced , and , above all , laughed , for the laugh of our forefathers quite rivalled the Homeric laugh , and burst forth with a noisy joviality ( Fig. 69 ) . The " wakes , " or evening parties , which are still the custom in most of the French provinces , and which are of very ancient origin , formed important events in the private lives of the peasants . It was at these that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the minds of the ignorant classes , were mostly created and propagated . It was there that those extraordinary and terrible fairy tales were related , as well as those of magicians , witches , spirits , &c.; It was there that the matrons , whose great age justified their experience , insisted on proving , by absurd tales , that they knew all the marvellous secrets for causing happiness or for curing sickness . Consequently , in those days the most enlightened rustic never for a moment doubted the truth of witchcraft . In fact , one of the first efforts at printing was applied to reproducing the most ridiculous stories under the title of the " Evangile des Conuilles ou Quenouilles , " and which had been previously circulated in manuscript , and had obtained implicit belief . The author of this remarkable collection asserts that the matrons in his neighbourhood had deputed him to put together in writing the sayings suitable for all conditions of rural life which were believed in by them and were announced at the wakes . The absurdities and childish follies which he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The " Evangile des Quenouilles , " which was as much believed in as Holy Writ , tells us , amongst other secrets which it contains for the advantage of the reader , that a girl wishing to know the Christian name of her future husband , has but to stretch the first thread she spins in the morning across the doorway ; and that the first man who passes and touches the thread will necessarily have the same name as the man she is destined to marry . Another of the stories in this book was , that if a woman , on leaving off work on Saturday night , left her distaff loaded , she might be sure that the thread she would obtain from it during the following week would only produce linen of bad quality , which could not be bleached ; this was considered to be proved by the fact that the Germans wore dark-brown coloured shirts , and it was known that the women never unloaded their distaffs from Saturday to Monday . Should a woman enter a cow-house to milk her cows without saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was thought to run the risk of the cows kicking and breaking the milk-pail and spilling the milk . Illustration : Fig. 69.  --  Village Feast .  --  Fac-simile of a Woodcut of the " Sandrin ou Verd Galant , " facetious Work of the End of the Sixteenth Century ( edition of 1609 ) . This silly nonsense , compiled like oracles , was printed as late as 1493 . Eighty years later a gentleman of Brittany , named Noel du Fail , Lord of Herissaye , councillor in the Parliament of Rennes , published , under the title of " Rustic and Amusing Discourses , " a work intended to counteract the influence of the famous " Evangile des Quenouilles . " This new work was a simple and true sketch of country habits , and proved the elegance and artless simplicity of the author , as well as his accuracy of observation . He begins thus : " Occasionally , having to retire into the country more conveniently and uninterruptedly to finish some business , on a particular holiday , as I was walking I came to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and young men were assembled , in groups of separate ages , for , according to the proverb , ' Each seeks his like . ' The young were practising the bow , jumping , wrestling , running races , and playing other games . The old were looking on , some sitting under an oak , with their legs crossed , and their hats lowered over their eyes , others leaning on their elbows criticizing every performance , and refreshing the memory of their own youth , and taking a lively interest in seeing the gambols of the young people . " The author states that on questioning one of the peasants to ascertain who was the cleverest person present , the following dialogue took place : " The one you see leaning on his elbow , hitting his boots , which have white strings , with a hazel stick , is called Anselme ; he is one of the rich ones of the village , he is a good workman , and not a bad writer for the flat country ; and the one you see by his side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is a large game bag , containing spectacles and an old prayer book , is called Pasquier , one of the greatest wits within a day 's journey  --  nay , were I to say two I should not be lying . Anyhow , he is certainly the readiest of the whole company to open his purse to give drink to his companions . " " And that one , " I asked , " with the large Milanese cap on his head , who holds an old book ? " " That one , " he answered , " who is scratching the end of his nose with one hand and his beard with the other ? " " That one , " I replied , " and who has turned towards us ? " " Why , " said he , " that is Roger Bontemps , a merry careless fellow , who up to the age of fifty kept the parish school ; but changing his first trade he has become a wine-grower . However , he can not resist the feast days , when he brings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long as we choose , such works as the ' Calondrier des Bergers , ' ' Fables d'Esope , ' ' Le Roman de la Rose , ' ' Matheolus , ' ' Alain Chartier , ' ' Les Vigiles du feu Roy Charles , ' ' Les deux Grebans , ' and others . Neither , with his old habit of warbling , can he help singing on Sundays in the choir ; and he is called Huguet . The other sitting near him , looking over his shoulder into his book , and wearing a sealskin belt with a yellow buckle , is another rich peasant of the village , not a bad villain , named Lubin , who also lives at home , and is called the little old man of the neighbourhood . " After this artistic sketch , the author dilates on the goodman Anselme . He says : " This good man possessed a moderate amount of knowledge , was a goodish grammarian , a musician , somewhat of a sophist , and rather given to picking holes in others . " Some of Anselme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ describing in glowing terms the bygone days which he and his contemporaries had seen , and which he stated to be very different to the present , he goes on to say , " I must own , my good old friends , that I look back with pleasure on our young days ; at all events the mode of doing things in those days was very superior and better in every way to that of the present .... O happy days ! O fortunate times when our fathers and grandfathers , whom may God absolve , were still among us ! " As he said this , he would raise the rim of his hat . He contented himself as to dress with a good coat of thick wool , well lined according to the fashion ; and for feast days and other important occasions , one of thick cloth , lined with some old gabardine . Illustration : Fig. 70.  --  The Shepherds celebrating the Birth of the Messiah by Songs and Dances .  --  Fifteenth Century .  --  Fac-simile of an Engraving on Wood , from a Book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we see , " says M. Le Roux de Lincy , " at the end of the fifteenth century that the old peasants complained of the changes in the village customs , and of the luxury which every one wished to display in his furniture or apparel . On this point it seems that there has been little or no change . We read that , from the time of Homer down to that of the excellent author of ' Rustic Discourses , ' and even later , the old people found fault with the manners of the present generation and extolled those of their forefathers , which they themselves had criticized in their own youth .

" The private life of a people , " says Legrand d'Aussy , who had studied that of the French from a gastronomic point of view only , " from the foundation of monarchy down to the eighteenth century , must , like that of mankind generally , commence with obtaining the first and most pressing of its requirements . Not satisfied with providing food for his support , man has endeavoured to add to his food something which pleased his taste . He does not wait to be hungry , but he anticipates that feeling , and aggravates it by condiments and seasonings . In a word his greediness has created on this score a very complicated and wide-spread science , which , amongst nations which are considered civilised , has become most important , and is designated the culinary art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have strained the nature of the soil on which they lived by forcing it to produce that which it seemed destined ever to refuse them . Such food as human industry was unable to obtain from any particular soil or from any particular climate , commerce undertook to bring from the country which produced it . This caused Rabelais to say that the stomach was the father and master of industry . We will rapidly glance over the alimentary matters which our forefathers obtained from the animal and vegetable kingdom , and then trace the progress of culinary art , and examine the rules of feasts and such matters as belong to the epicurean customs of the Middle Ages . Aliments . Bread .  --  The Gauls , who principally inhabited deep and thick forests , fed on herbs and fruits , and particularly on acorns . It is even possible that the veneration in which they held the oak had no other origin . This primitive food continued in use , at least in times of famine , up to the eighth century , and we find in the regulations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad year , the acorn or beech-nut became scarce , it was the bishop 's duty to provide something to make up for it . Eight centuries later , when Rene du Bellay , Bishop of Mans , came to report to Francis I. the fearful poverty of his diocese , he informed the king that the inhabitants in many places were reduced to subsisting on acorn bread . Illustration : Figs. 72 and 73.  --  Corn-threshing and Bread-making.  --  Miniatures from the Calendar of a Book of Hours .  --  Manuscript of the Sixteenth Century . In the earliest times bread was cooked under the embers . The use of ovens was introduced into Europe by the Romans , who had found them in Egypt . But , notwithstanding this importation , the old system of cooking was long after employed , for in the tenth century Raimbold , abbot of the monastery of St. Thierry , near Rheims , ordered in his will that on the day of his death bread cooked under the embers  --  panes subcinericios  --  should be given to his monks . By feudal law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vassals , for which they were taxed , but the latter often preferred to cook their flour at home in the embers of their own hearths , rather than to carry it to the public oven . Illustration : Fig. 74.  --  The Miller .  --  From an Engraving of the Sixteenth Century , by J. Amman . It must be stated that the custom of leavening the dough by the addition of a ferment was not universally adopted amongst the ancients . For this reason , as the dough without leaven could only produce a heavy and indigestible bread , they were careful , in order to secure their loaves being thoroughly cooked , to make them very thin . These loaves served as plates for cutting up the other food upon , and when they thus became saturated with the sauce and gravy they were eaten as cakes . The use of the tourteaux ( small crusty loaves ) , which were at first called tranchoirs and subsequently tailloirs , remained long in fashion even at the most splendid banquets . Thus , in 1336 , the Dauphin of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white bread , four small loaves to serve as tranchoirs at table . The " Menagier de Paris " mentions " des pains de tranchouers half a foot in diameter , and four fingers deep , " and Froissart the historian also speaks of tailloirs . It would be difficult to point out the exact period at which leavening bread was adopted in Europe , but we can assert that in the Middle Ages it was anything but general . Yeast , which , according to Pliny , was already known to the Gauls , was reserved for pastry , and it was only at the end of the sixteenth century that the bakers of Paris used it for bread . At first the trades of miller and baker were carried on by the same person ( Figs. 74 and 75 ) . The man who undertook the grinding of the grain had ovens near his mill , which he let to his lord to bake bread , when he did not confine his business to persons who sent him their corn to grind . Illustration : Fig. 75.  --  The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by J. Amman . At a later period public bakers established themselves , who not only baked the loaves which were brought to them already kneaded , but also made bread which they sold by weight ; and this system was in existence until very recently in the provinces . Charlemagne , in his " Capitulaires " ( statutes ) , fixed the number of bakers in each city according to the population , and St. Louis relieved them , as well as the millers , from taking their turn at the watch , so that they might have no pretext for stopping or neglecting their work , which he considered of public utility . Nevertheless bakers as a body never became rich or powerful ( Figs. 76 and 77 ) . It is pretty generally believed that the name of boulanger ( baker ) originated from the fact that the shape of the loaves made at one time was very like that of a round ball . But loaves varied so much in form , quality , and consequently in name , that in his " Dictionary of Obscure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorts made during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries , and amongst them may be mentioned the court loaf , the pope 's loaf , the knight 's loaf , the squire 's loaf , the peer 's loaf , the varlet 's loaf , &c.; Illustration : Fig. 76.  --  Banner of the Corporation of Bakers of Paris . Illustration : Fig. 77.  --  Banner of the Corporation , of Bakers of Arras . The most celebrated bread was the white bread of Chailly or Chilly , a village four leagues ( ten miles ) south of Paris , which necessarily appeared at all the tables of the elite of the fourteenth century . The pain mollet , or soft bread made with milk and butter , although much in use before this , only became fashionable on the arrival of Marie de Medicis in France ( 1600 ) , on account of this Tuscan princess finding it so much to her taste that she would eat no other . The ordinary market bread of Paris comprised the rousset bread , made of meslin , and employed for soup ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which last was a general name given to all descriptions which were sent daily from the neighbouring villages to the capital . Amongst the best known varieties we will only mention the Corbeil bread , the dog bread , the bread of two colours , which last was composed of alternate layers of wheat and rye , and was used by persons of small means ; there was also the Gonesse bread , which has maintained its reputation to this day . The " table loaves , " which in the provinces were served at the tables of the rich , were of such a convenient size that one of them would suffice for a man of ordinary appetite , even after the crust was cut off , which it was considered polite to offer to the ladies , who soaked it in their soup . For the servants an inferior bread was baked , called " common bread . " In many counties they sprinkled the bread , before putting it into the oven , with powdered linseed , a custom which still exists . They usually added salt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Paris , where , on account of its price , they only mixed it with the expensive qualities . The wheats which were long most esteemed for baking purposes , were those of Brie , Champagne , and Bassigny ; while those of the Dauphine were held of little value , because they were said to contain so many tares and worthless grains , that the bread made from them produced headache and other ailments . An ancient chronicle of the time of Charlemagne makes mention of a bread twice baked , or biscuit . This bread was very hard , and easier to keep than any other description . It was also used , as now , for provisioning ships , or towns threatened with a siege , as well as in religious houses . At a later period , delicate biscuits were made of a sort of dry and crumbling pastry which retained the original name . As early as the sixteenth century , Rheims had earned a great renown for these articles of food . Bread made with barley , oats , or millet was always ranked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recourse in years of want ( Fig. 78 ) . Barley bread was , besides , used as a kind of punishment , and monks who had committed any serious offence against discipline were condemned to live on it for a certain period . Rye bread was held of very little value , although in certain provinces , such as Lyonnais , Forez , and Auvergne , it was very generally used among the country people , and contributed , says Bruyerin Champier in his treatise " De re Cibaria , " to " preserve beauty and freshness amongst women . " At a later period , the doctors of Paris frequently ordered the use of bread made half of wheat and half of rye as a means " of preserving the health . " Black wheat , or buck wheat , which was introduced into Europe by the Moors and Saracens when they conquered Spain , quickly spread to the northern provinces , especially to Flanders , where , by its easy culture and almost certain yield , it averted much suffering from the inhabitants , who were continually being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or Turkey wheat , was cultivated in the south , and that rice came into use ; but these two kinds of grain , both equally useless for bread , were employed the one for fattening poultry , and the other for making cakes , which , however , were little appreciated . Illustration : Fig. 78.  --  Cultivation of Grain in use amongst the Peasants , and the Manufacture of Barley and Oat Bread .  --  Fac-simile of a Woodcut in an edition of Virgil published at Lyons in 1517 . Vegetables and Plants Used in Cooking .  --  From the most ancient historical documents we find that at the very earliest period of the French monarchy , fresh and dried vegetables were the ordinary food of the population . Pliny and Columella attribute a Gallic origin to certain roots , and among them onions and parsnips , which the Romans cultivated in their gardens for use at their tables . It is evident , however , that vegetables were never considered as being capable of forming solid nutriment , since they were almost exclusively used by monastic communities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charlemagne , in which the useful plants which the emperor desired should be cultivated in his domains are detailed , shows us that at that period the greater part of our cooking vegetables were in use , for we find mentioned in it , fennel , garlic , parsley , shallot , onions , watercress , endive , lettuce , beetroot , cabbage , leeks , carrots , artichokes ; besides long-beans , broad-beans , peas or Italian vetches , and lentils . In the thirteenth century , the plants fit for cooking went under the general appellation of aigrun , and amongst them , at a later date , were ranked oranges , lemons , and other acid fruits . St. Louis added to this category even fruits with hard rinds , such as walnuts , filberts , and chestnuts ; and when the guild of the fruiterers of Paris received its statutes in 1608 , they were still called " vendors of fruits and aigrun . " The vegetables and cooking-plants noticed in the " Menagier de Paris , " which dates from the fourteenth century , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the name adopted by the Italian Bartholomew Sacchi ) , which dates from the fifteenth century , do not lead us to suppose that alimentary horticulture had made much progress since the time of Charlemagne . Moreover , we are astonished to find the thistle placed amongst choice dishes ; though it can not be the common thistle that is meant , but probably this somewhat general appellation refers to the vegetable-marrow , which is still found on the tables of the higher classes , or perhaps the artichoke , which we know to be only a kind of thistle developed by cultivation , and which at that period had been recently imported . About the same date melons begin to appear ; but the management of this vegetable fruit was not much known . It was so imperfectly cultivated in the northern provinces , that , in the middle of the sixteenth century , Bruyerin Champier speaks of the Languedocians as alone knowing how to produce excellent sucrins  --  " thus called , " say both Charles Estienne and Liebault in the " Maison Rustique , " " because gardeners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water-melons have never been cultivated but in the south . Cabbages , the alimentary reputation of which dates from the remotest times , were already of several kinds , most of which have descended to us ; amongst them may be mentioned the apple-headed , the Roman , the white , the common white head , the Easter cabbage , &c.; but the one held in the highest estimation was the famous cabbage of Senlis , whose leaves , says an ancient author , when opened , exhaled a smell more agreeable than musk or amber . This species no doubt fell into disuse when the plan of employing aromatic herbs in cooking , which was so much in repute by our ancestors , was abandoned . Illustration : Fig. 79.  --  Coat-of-arms of the Grain-measurers of Ghent , on their Ceremonial Banner , dated 1568 . By a strange coincidence , at the same period as marjoram , carraway seed , sweet basil , coriander , lavender , and rosemary were used to add their pungent flavour to sauces and hashes , on the same tables might be found herbs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mallows , some kinds of mosses , &c.; Cucumber , though rather in request , was supposed to be an unwholesome vegetable , because it was said that the inhabitants of Forez , who ate much of it , were subject to periodical fevers , which might really have been caused by noxious emanation from the ponds with which that country abounded . Lentils , now considered so wholesome , were also long looked upon as a doubtful vegetable ; according to Liebault , they were difficult to digest and otherwise injurious ; they inflamed the inside , affected the sight , and brought on the nightmare , &c.; On the other hand , small fresh beans , especially those sold at Landit fair , were used in the most delicate repasts ; peas passed as a royal dish in the sixteenth century , when the custom was to eat them with salt pork . Turnips were also most esteemed by the Parisians . " This vegetable is to them , " says Charles Estienne , " what large radishes are to the Limousins . " The best were supposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there were four kinds of lettuces grown in France , according to Liebault , in 1574 : the small , the common , the curled , and the Roman : the seed of the last-named was sent to France by Francois Rabelais when he was in Rome with Cardinal du Bellay in 1537 ; and the salad made from it consequently received the name of Roman salad , which it has ever since retained . In fact , our ancestors much appreciated salads , for there was not a banquet without at least three or four different kinds . Fruits .  --  Western Europe was originally very poor in fruits , and it only improved by foreign importations , mostly from Asia by the Romans . The apricot came from Armenia , the pistachio-nuts and plums from Syria , the peach and nut from Persia , the cherry from Cerasus , the lemon from Media , the filbert from the Hellespont , and chestnuts from Castana , a town of Magnesia . We are also indebted to Asia for almonds ; the pomegranate , according to some , came from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cydon in Crete ; the olive , fig , pear , and apple , from Greece . The statutes of Charlemagne show us that almost all these fruits were reared in his gardens , and that some of them were of several kinds or varieties . A considerable period , however , elapsed before the finest and more luscious productions of the garden became as it were almost forced on nature by artificial means . Thus in the sixteenth century we find Rabelais , Charles Estienne , and La Framboisiere , physician to Henry IV. , praising the Corbeil peach , which was only an inferior and almost wild sort , and describing it as having " dry and solid flesh , not adhering to the stone . " The culture of this fruit , which was not larger than a damask plum , had then , according to Champier , only just been introduced into France . It must be remarked here that Jacques Coythier , physician to Louis XI. , in order to curry favour with his master , who was very fond of new fruits , took as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called Abri-Coythier . Illustration : Fig. 80.  --  Cultivation of Fruit , from a Miniature of the " Proprietaire de Choses " ( Manuscript of the Fifteenth Century , in the Library of the Arsenal of Paris ) . It must be owned that great progress has been made in the culture of the plum , the pear , and the apple . Champier says that the best plums are the royale , the perdrigon , and the damas of Tours ; Olivier de Serres mentions eighteen kinds  --  amongst which , however , we do not find the celebrated Reine Claude ( greengage ) , which owes its name to the daughter of Louis XII. , first wife of Francis I. Of pears , the most esteemed in the thirteenth century were the hastiveau , which was an early sort , and no doubt the golden pear now called St. Jean , the caillou or chaillou , a hard pear , which came from Cailloux in Burgundy and l'angoisse ( agony ) , so called on account of its bitterness  --  which , however , totally disappeared in cooking . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cuisse dame , or madame ; the bon chretien , brought , it is said , by St. Francois de Paule to Louis XI. ; the bergamote , which came from Bergamo , in Lombardy ; the tant-bonne , so named from its aroma ; and the caillou rosat , our rosewater pear . Amongst apples , the blandureau ( hard white ) of Auvergne , the rouveau , and the paradis of Provence , are of oldest repute . This reminds us of the couplet by the author of the " Street Cries of Paris , " thirteenth century :  --  " Primes ai pommes de rouviau , Et d'Auvergne le blanc duriau . " ( " Give me first the russet apple , And the hard white fruit of Auvergne . " ) The quince , which was so generally cultivated in the Middle Ages , was looked upon as the most useful of all fruits . Not only did it form the basis of the farmers ' dried preserves of Orleans , called cotignac , a sort of marmalade , but it was also used for seasoning meat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cotignac of Orleans had such a reputation , that boxes of this fruit were always given to kings , queens , and princes on entering the towns of France . It was the first offering made to Joan of Arc on her bringing reinforcements into Orleans during the English siege . Several sorts of cherries were known , but these did not prevent the small wild or wood cherry from being appreciated at the tables of the citizens ; whilst the cornouille , or wild cornelian cherry , was hardly touched , excepting by the peasants ; thence came the proverbial expression , more particularly in use at Orleans , when a person made a silly remark , " He has eaten cornelians , " i.e. , he speaks like a rustic . In the thirteenth century , chestnuts from Lombardy were hawked in the streets ; but , in the sixteenth century , the chestnuts of the Lyonnais and Auvergne were substituted , and were to be found on the royal table . Four different sorts of figs , in equal estimation , were brought from Marseilles , Nismes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , filberts were to be had in such profusion that they supplied from there all the tables of the kingdom . The Portuguese claim the honour of having introduced oranges from China ; however , in an account of the house of Humbert , Dauphin of Viennois , in 1333 , that is , long before the expeditions of the Portuguese to India , mention is made of a sum of money being paid for transplanting orange-trees .

In the time of Bruyerin Champier , physician to Henry II. , raspberries were still completely wild ; the same author states that wood strawberries had only just at that time been introduced into gardens , " by which , " he says , " they had attained a larger size , though they at the same time lost their quality . " The vine , acclimatised and propagated by the Gauls , ever since the followers of Brennus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Christian era , never ceased to be productive , and even to constitute the natural wealth of the country ( Fig. 81 and 82 ) . In the sixteenth century , Liebault enumerated nineteen sorts of grapes , and Olivier de Serres twenty-four , amongst which , notwithstanding the eccentricities of the ancient names , we believe that we can trace the greater part of those plants which are now cultivated in France . For instance , it is known that the excellent vines of Thomery , near Fontainebleau , which yield in abundance the most beautiful table grape which art and care can produce , were already in use in the reign of Henry IV . ( Fig. 83 ) . Illustration : Fig. 83.  --  The Winegrower , drawn and engraved in the Sixteenth Century , by J. Amman . In the time of the Gauls the custom of drying grapes by exposing them to the sun , or to a certain amount of artificial heat , was already known ; and very soon after , the same means were adopted for preserving plums , an industry in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Rheims excelled . Drying apples in an oven was also the custom , and formed a delicacy which was reserved for winter and spring banquets . Dried fruits were also brought from abroad , as mentioned in the " Book of Street Cries in Paris : "  --  " Figues de Melites sans fin , J'ai roisin d'outre mer , roisin . " ( " Figs from Malta without end , And grapes from over the sea . " ) Butchers ' Meat .  --  According to Strabo , the Gauls were great eaters of meat , especially of pork , whether fresh or salted . " Gaul , " says he , " feeds so many flocks , and , above all , so many pigs , that it supplies not only Rome , but all Italy , with grease and salt meat . " The second chapter of the Salic law , comprising nineteen articles , relates entirely to penalties for pig-stealing ; and in the laws of the Visigoths we find four articles on the same subject . Illustration : Fig. 84.  --  Swineherd . Illustration : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Calendar of a Book of Hours .  --  Manuscript of the Sixteenth Century . In those remote days , in which the land was still covered with enormous forests of oak , great facilities were offered for breeding pigs , whose special liking for acorns is well known . Thus the bishops , princes , and lords caused numerous droves of pigs to be fed on their domains , both for the purpose of supplying their own tables as well as for the fairs and markets . At a subsequent period , it became the custom for each household , whether in town or country , to rear and fatten a pig , which was killed and salted at a stated period of the year ; and this custom still exists in many provinces . In Paris , for instance , there was scarcely a bourgeois who had not two or three young pigs . During the day these unsightly up the refuse of all sorts which was thrown out of the houses . One of the sons of Louis le Gros , while passing , on the 2nd of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the Hotel de Ville and the church of St. Gervais , fractured his skull by a fall from his horse , caused by a pig running between that animal 's legs . This accident led to the first order being issued by the provosts , to the effect that breeding pigs within the town was forbidden . Custom , however , deep-rooted for centuries , resisted this order , and many others on the same subject which followed it : for we find , under Francis I. , a license was issued to the executioner , empowering him to capture all the stray pigs which he could find in Paris , and to take them to the Hotel Dieu , when he should receive either five sous in silver or the head of the animal . It is said that the holy men of St. Antoine , in virtue of the privilege attached to the popular legend of their patron , who was generally represented with a pig , objected to this order , and long after maintained the exclusive right of allowing their pigs to roam in the streets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one tried to evade the administrative laws on this subject , is explained , in fact , by the general taste of the French nation for pork . This taste appears somewhat strange at a time when this kind of food was supposed to engender leprosy , a disease with which France was at that time overrun . Illustration : Fig. 86.  --  Stall of Carved Wood ( Fifteenth Century ) , representing the Proverb , " Margaritas ante Porcos , " " Throwing Pearls before Swine , " from Rouen Cathedral . Pigs ' meat made up generally the greater part of the domestic banquets . There was no great feast at which hams , sausages , and black puddings were not served in profusion on all the tables ; and as Easter Day , which brought to a close the prolonged fastings of Lent , was one of the great feasts , this food formed the most important dish on that occasion . It is possible that the necessity for providing for the consumption of that day originated the celebrated ham fair , which was and is still held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Notre-Dame , where the dealers from all parts of France , and especially from Normandy and Lower Brittany , assembled with their swine . Sanitary measures were taken in Paris and in the various towns in order to prevent the evil effects likely to arise from the enormous consumption of pork ; public officers , called languayeurs , were ordered to examine the animals to ensure that they had not white ulcers under the tongue , these being considered the signs that their flesh was in a condition to communicate leprosy to those who partook of it . For a long time the retail sale of pork was confined to the butchers , like that of other meat . Salt or fresh pork was at one time always sold raw , though at a later period some retailers , who carried on business principally among the lowest orders of the people , took to selling cooked pork and sausages . They were named charcuitiers or saucissiers . This new trade , which was most lucrative , was adopted by so many people that parliament was forced to limit the number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received their statutes , which were confirmed by the King in 1475 . Amongst the privileges attached to their calling was that of selling red herrings and sea-fish in Lent , during which time the sale of pork was strictly forbidden . Although they had the exclusive monopoly of selling cooked pork , they were at first forbidden to buy their meat of any one but of the butchers , who alone had the right of killing pigs ; and it was only in 1513 that the charcuitiers were allowed to purchase at market and sell the meat raw , in opposition to the butchers , who in consequence gradually gave up killing and selling pork ( Fig. 87 ) . Although the consumption of butchers ' meat was not so great in the Middle Ages as it is now , the trade of a butcher , to which extraordinary privileges were attached , was nevertheless one of the industries which realised the greatest profits . We know what an important part the butchers played in the municipal history of France , as also of Belgium ; and we also know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifteenth century . Illustration : Fig. 87.  --  The Pork-butcher ( Charcutier ) .  --  Fac-simile of a Miniature in a Charter of the Abbey of Solignac ( Fourteenth Century ) . The existence of the great slaughter-house of Paris dates back to the most remote period of monarchy . The parish church of the corporation of butchers , namely , that of St. Pierre aux Boeufs in the city , on the front of which were two sculptured oxen , existed before the tenth century . A Celtic monument was discovered on the site of the ancient part of Paris , with a bas-relief representing a wild bull carrying three cranes standing among oak branches . Archaeology has chosen to recognise in this sculpture a Druidical allegory , which has descended to us in the shape of the triumphal car of the Prize Ox ( Fig. 88 ) . The butchers who , for centuries at least in France , only killed sheep and pigs , proved themselves most jealous of their privileges , and admitted no strangers into their corporation . The proprietorship of stalls at the markets , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the age of seven years and a day , belonged exclusively to the male descendants of a few rich and powerful families . The Kings of France alone , on their accession , could create a new master butcher . Since the middle of the fourteenth century the " Grande Boucherie " was the seat of an important jurisdiction , composed of a mayor , a master , a proctor , and an attorney ; it also had a judicial council before which the butchers could bring up all their cases , and an appeal from which could only be considered by Parliament . Besides this court , which had to decide cases of misbehaviour on the part of the apprentices , and all their appeals against their masters , the corporation had a counsel in Parliament , as also one at the Chatelet , who were specially attached to the interests of the butchers , and were in their pay . Illustration : Fig. 88.  --  The Holy Ox .  --  Celtic Monument found in Paris under the Choir of Notre-Dame in 1711 , and preserved in the Musee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all events with their money , to follow the calling of their fathers , we find many descendants of ancient butchers ' families of Paris , in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries , abandoning their stalls to fill high places in the state , and even at court . It must not be concluded that the rich butchers in those days occupied themselves with the minor details of their trade ; the greater number employed servants who cut up and retailed the meat , and they themselves simply kept the accounts , and were engaged in dealing through factors or foremen for the purchase of beasts for their stalls ( Fig. 89 ) . One can form an opinion of the wealth of some of these tradesmen by reading the enumeration made by an old chronicler of the property and income of Guillaume de Saint-Yon , one of the principal master butchers in 1370 . " He was proprietor of three stalls , in which meat was weekly sold to the amount of 200 livres parisis ( the livre being equivalent to 24 francs at least ) , with an average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an income of 600 livres parisis ; he possessed besides his family house in Paris , four country-houses , well supplied with furniture and agricultural implements , drinking-cups , vases , cups of silver , and cups of onyx with silver feet , valued at 100 francs or more each . His wife had jewels , belts , purses , and trinkets , to the value of upwards of 1,000 gold francs ( the gold franc was worth 24 livres ) ; long and short gowns trimmed with fur ; and three mantles of grey fur . Guillaume de Saint-Yon had generally in his storehouses 300 ox-hides , worth 24 francs each at least ; 800 measures of fat , worth 3-1/2 sols each ; in his sheds , he had 800 sheep worth 100 sols each ; in his safes 500 or 600 silver florins of ready money ( the florin was worth 12 francs , which must be multiplied five times to estimate its value in present currency ) , and his household furniture was valued at 12,000 florins . He gave a dowry of 2,000 florins to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paris house ; and lastly , as if he had been a noble , he used a silver seal . " Illustration : Fig. 89.  --  The Butcher and his Servant , drawn and engraved by J. Amman ( Sixteenth Century ) . We find in the " Menagier de Paris " curious statistics respecting the various butchers ' shops of the capital , and the daily sale in each at the period referred to . This sale , without counting the households of the King , the Queen , and the royal family , which were specially provisioned , amounted to 26,624 oxen , 162,760 sheep , 27,456 pigs , and 15,912 calves per annum ; to which must be added not only the smoked and salted flesh of 200 or 300 pigs , which were sold at the fair in Holy Week , but also 6,420 sheep , 823 oxen , 832 calves , and 624 pigs , which , according to the " Menagier , " were used in the royal and princely households . Sometimes the meat was sent to market already cut up , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' shops in the town ; for they only killed from day to day , according to the demand . Besides the butchers ' there were tripe shops , where the feet , kidneys , &c.,; were sold . Illustration : Figs. 90 and 91.  --  Seal and Counter-Seal of the Butchers of Bruges in 1356 , from an impression on green wax , preserved in the archives of that town . According to Bruyerin Champier , during the sixteenth century the most celebrated sheep in France were those of Berri and Limousin ; and of all butchers ' meat , veal was reckoned the best . In fact , calves intended for the tables of the upper classes were fed in a special manner : they were allowed for six months , or even for a year , nothing but milk , which made their flesh most tender and delicate . Contrary to the present taste , kid was more appreciated than lamb , which caused the rotisseurs frequently to attach the tail of a kid to a lamb , so as to deceive the customer and sell him a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the origin of the proverb which described a cheat as " a dealer in goat by halves . " In other places butchers were far from acquiring the same importance which they did in France and Belgium ( Figs. 90 and 91 ) , where much more meat was consumed than in Spain , Italy , or even in Germany . Nevertheless , in almost all countries there were certain regulations , sometimes eccentric , but almost always rigidly enforced , to ensure a supply of meat of the best quality and in a healthy state . In England , for instance , butchers were only allowed to kill bulls after they had been baited with dogs , no doubt with the view of making the flesh more tender . At Mans , it was laid down in the trade regulations , that " no butcher shall be so bold as to sell meat unless it shall have been previously seen alive by two or three persons , who will testify to it on oath ; and , anyhow , they shall not sell it until the persons shall have declared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the interests of the public must be added that forbidding butchers to sell meat on days when abstinence from animal food was ordered by the Church . These regulations applied less to the vendors than to the consumers , who , by disobeying them , were liable to fine or imprisonment , or to severe corporal punishment by the whip or in the pillory . We find that Clement Marot was imprisoned and nearly burned alive for having eaten pork in Lent . In 1534 , Guillaume des Moulins , Count of Brie , asked permission for his mother , who was then eighty years of age , to cease fasting ; the Bishop of Paris only granted dispensation on condition that the old lady should take her meals in secret and out of sight of every one , and should still fast on Fridays . " In a certain town , " says Brantome , " there had been a procession in Lent . A woman , who had assisted at it barefooted , went home to dine off a quarter of lamb and a ham . The smell got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact being established , the woman was taken , and condemned to walk through the town with her quarter of lamb on the spit over her shoulder , and the ham hung round her neck . " This species of severity increased during the times of religious dissensions . Erasmus says , " He who has eaten pork instead of fish is taken to the torture like a parricide . " An edict of Henry II , 1549 , forbade the sale of meat in Lent to persons who should not be furnished with a doctor 's certificate . Charles IX forbade the sale of meat to the Huguenots ; and it was ordered that the privilege of selling meat during the time of abstinence should belong exclusively to the hospitals . Orders were given to those who retailed meat to take the address of every purchaser , although he had presented a medical certificate , so that the necessity for his eating meat might be verified . Subsequently , the medical certificate required to be endorsed by the priest , specifying what quantity of meat was required . Even in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ granted , pork , poultry , and game being strictly forbidden . Poultry .  --  A monk of the Abbey of Cluny once went on a visit to his relations . On arriving he asked for food ; but as it was a fast day he was told there was nothing in the house but fish . Perceiving some chickens in the yard , he took a stick and killed one , and brought it to his relations , saying , " This is the fish which I shall eat to-day . " " Eh , but , my son , " they said , " have you dispensation from fasting on a Friday ? " " No , " he answered ; " but poultry is not flesh ; fish and fowls were created at the same time ; they have a common origin , as the hymn which I sing in the service teaches me . " This simple legend belongs to the tenth century ; and notwithstanding that the opinion of this Benedictine monk may appear strange nowadays , yet it must be acknowledged that he was only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In 817 , the Council of Aix-la-Chapelle decided that such delicate nourishment could scarcely be called mortification as understood by the teaching of the Church . In consequence of this an order was issued forbidding the monks to eat poultry , except during four days at Easter and four at Christmas . But this prohibition in no way changed the established custom of certain parts of Christendom , and the faithful persisted in believing that poultry and fish were identical in the eyes of the Church , and accordingly continued to eat them indiscriminately . We also see , in the middle of the thirteenth century , St. Thomas Aquinas , who was considered an authority in questions of dogma and of faith , ranking poultry amongst species of aquatic origin . Eventually , this palpable error was abandoned ; but when the Church forbade Christians the use of poultry on fast days , it made an exception , out of consideration for the ancient prejudice , in favour of teal , widgeon , moor-hens , and also two or three kinds of small amphibious quadrupeds . Hence probably arose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which some said sprung from the rotten wood of old ships , others from the fruits of a tree , or the gum on fir-trees , whilst others thought they came from a fresh-water shell analogous to that of the oyster and mussel . As far back as modern history can be traced , we find that a similar mode of fattening poultry was employed then as now , and was one which the Gauls must have learnt from the Romans . Amongst the charges in the households of the kings of France one item was that which concerned the poultry-house , and which , according to an edict of St. Louis in 1261 , bears the name of poulaillier . At a subsequent period this name was given to breeders and dealers in poultry ( Fig. 92 ) . The " Menagier " tells as that , as is the present practice , chickens were fattened by depriving them of light and liberty , and gorging them with succulent food . Amongst the poultry yards in repute at that time , the author mentions that of Hesdin , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of the King , at the Hotel Saint-Pol , Rue Saint-Antoine , Paris ; that of Master Hugues Aubriot , provost of Paris ; and that of Charlot , no doubt a bourgeois of that name , who also gave his name to an ancient street in that quarter called the Marais . Illustration : Fig. 92.  --  The Poulterer , drawn and engraved in the Sixteenth Century , by J. Amman . Capons are frequently mentioned in poems of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries ; but the name of the poularde does not occur until the sixteenth . We know that under the Roman rule , the Gauls carried on a considerable trade in fattened geese . This trade ceased when Gaul passed to new masters ; but the breeding of geese continued to be carefully attended to . For many centuries geese were more highly prized than any other description of poultry , and Charlemagne ordered that his domains should be well stocked with flocks of geese , which were driven to feed in the fields , like flocks of sheep . There was an old proverb , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a hundred years . " This bird was considered a great delicacy by the working classes and bourgeoisie . The rotisseurs ( Fig. 94 ) had hardly anything in their shops but geese , and , therefore , when they were united in a company , they received the name of oyers , or oyeurs . The street in which they were established , with their spits always loaded with juicy roasts , was called Rue des Oues ( geese ) , and this street , when it ceased to be frequented by the oyers , became by corruption Rue Auxours . Illustration : Fig. 93.  --  Barnacle Geese .  --  Fac-simile of an Engraving on Wood , from the " Cosmographie Universelle " of Munster , folio , Basle , 1552 . There is every reason for believing that the domestication of the wild duck is of quite recent date . The attempt having succeeded , it was wished to follow it up by the naturalisation in the poultry-yard of two other sorts of aquatic birds , namely , the sheldrake ( tadorna ) and the moorhen , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ France and Europe to Jacques Coeur , treasurer to Charles VII. , whose commercial connections with the East were very extensive ; others assert that it is due to King Rene , Count of Provence ; but according to the best authorities these birds were first brought into France in the time of Francis I. by Admiral Philippe de Chabot , and Bruyerin Champier asserts that they were not known until even later . It was at about the same period that guinea-fowls were brought from the coast of Africa by Portuguese merchants ; and the travelling naturalist , Pierre Belon , who wrote in the year 1555 , asserts that in his time " they had already so multiplied in the houses of the nobles that they had become quite common . " Illustration : Fig. 94.  --  The Poultry-dealer.  --  Fac-simile of an Engraving on Wood , after Cesare Vecellio . The pea-fowl played an important part in the chivalric banquets of the Middle Ages ( Fig. 95 ) . According to old poets the flesh of this noble bird is " food for the brave . " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have as much taste for falsehood as a hungry man has for the flesh of the peacock . " In the fourteenth century poultry-yards were still stocked with these birds ; but the turkey and the pheasant gradually replaced them , as their flesh was considered somewhat hard and stringy . This is proved by the fact that in 1581 , " La Nouvelle Coutume du Bourbonnois " only reckons the value of these beautiful birds at two sous and a half , or about three francs of present currency . Illustration : Fig. 95.  --  State Banquet .  --  Serving the Peacock .  --  Fac-simile of a Woodcut in an edition of Virgil , folio , published at Lyons in 1517 . Game .  --  Our forefathers included among the birds which now constitute feathered game the heron , the crane , the crow , the swan , the stork , the cormorant , and the bittern . These supplied the best tables , especially the first three , which were looked upon as exquisite food , fit even for royalty , and were reckoned as thorough French delicacies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later period there were pheasantries . People also ate birds of prey , and only rejected those which fed on carrion . Swans , which were much appreciated , were very common on all the principal rivers of France , especially in the north ; a small island below Paris had taken its name from these birds , and has maintained it ever since . It was proverbially said that the Charente was bordered with swans , and for this same reason Valenciennes was called Val des Cygnes , or the Swan Valley . Some authors make it appear that for a long time young game was avoided owing to the little nourishment it contained and its indigestibility , and assert that it was only when some French ambassadors returned from Venice that the French learnt that young partridges and leverets were exquisite , and quite fit to appear at the most sumptuous banquets . The " Menagier " gives not only various receipts for cooking them , but also for dressing chickens , when game was out of season , so as to make them taste like young partridges . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did capons ; it was a secret , says Liebault , only known to the poultry dealers ; but although they were much appreciated , the pullet was more so , and realised as much as two crowns each ( this does not mean the gold crown , but a current coin worth three livres ) . Plovers , which sometimes came from Beauce in cart-loads , were much relished ; they were roasted without being drawn , as also were turtle-doves and larks ; " for , " says an ancient author , " larks only eat small pebbles and sand , doves grains of juniper and scented herbs , and plovers feed on air . " At a later period the same honour was conferred on woodcocks . Thrushes , starlings , blackbirds , quail , and partridges were in equal repute according to the season . The bec-figue , a small bird like a nightingale , was so much esteemed in Provence that there were feasts at which that bird alone was served , prepared in various ways ; but of all birds used for the table none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was full fledged . As far as we can ascertain , the Gauls had a dislike to the flesh of rabbits , and they did not even hunt them , for according to Strabo , Southern Gaul was infested with these mischievous animals , which destroyed the growing crops , and even the barks of the trees . There was considerable change in this respect a few centuries later , for every one in town or country reared domesticated rabbits , and the wild ones formed an article of food which was much in request . In order to ascertain whether a rabbit is young , Strabo tells us we should feel the first joint of the fore-leg , when we shall find a small bone free and movable . This method is adopted in all kitchens in the present day . Hares were preferred to rabbits , provided they were young ; for an old French proverb says , " An old hare and an old goose are food for the devil . " Illustration : Fig. 96.  --  " The way to skin and cut up a Stag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and his Staff for hunting Wild Animals " ( Manuscript of the Fifteenth Century , National Library of Paris ) . The hedgehog and squirrel were also eaten . As for roe and red deer , they were , according to Dr. Bruyerin Ohampier , morsels fit for kings and rich people ( Fig. 96 ) . The doctor speaks of " fried slices of the young horn of the stag " as the daintiest of food , and the " Menagier de Paris " shows how , as early as the fourteenth century , beef was dished up like bear's-flesh venison , for the use of kitchens in countries where the black bear did not exist . This proves that bear 's flesh was in those days considered good food . Milk , Butter , Eggs , and Cheese .  --  These articles of food , the first which nature gave to man , were not always and everywhere uniformly permitted or prohibited by the Church on fast days . The faithful were for several centuries left to their own judgment on the subject . In fact , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scruple , considering that some theologians maintained that the hens which laid them were animals of aquatic extraction . It appears , however , that butter , either from prejudice or mere custom , was only used on fast days in its fresh state , and was not allowed to be used for cooking purposes . At first , and especially amongst the monks , the dishes were prepared with oil ; but as in some countries oil was apt to become very expensive , and the supply even to fail totally , animal fat or lard had to be substituted . At a subsequent period the Church authorised the use of butter and milk ; but on this point , the discipline varied much . In the fourteenth century , Charles V. , King of France , having asked Pope Gregory XI . for a dispensation to use milk and butter on fast days , in consequence of the bad state of his health , brought on owing to an attempt having been made to poison him , the supreme Pontiff required a certificate from a physician and from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dispensation after imposing on that Christian king the repetition of a certain number of prayers and the performance of certain pious deeds . In defiance of the severity of ecclesiastical authority , we find , in the " Journal of a Bourgeois of Paris , " that in the unhappy reign of Charles VI . ( 1420 ) , " for want of oil , butter was eaten in Lent the same as on ordinary non-fast days . " In 1491 , Queen Anne , Duchess of Brittany , in order to obtain permission from the Pope to eat butter in Lent , represented that Brittany did not produce oil , neither did it import it from southern countries . Many northern provinces adopted necessity as the law , and , having no oil , used butter ; and thence originated that famous toast with slices of bread and butter , which formed such an important part of Flemish food . These papal dispensations were , however , only earned at the price of prayers and alms , and this was the origin of the troncs pour le beurre , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still to be seen in some of the Flemish churches . Illustration : Fig. 97.  --  The Manufacture of Oil , drawn and engraved by J. Amman in the Sixteenth Century . It is not known when butter was first salted in order to preserve it or to send it to distant places ; but this process , which is so simple and so natural , dates , no doubt , from very ancient times ; it was particularly practised by the Normans and Bretons , who enclosed the butter in large earthenware jars , for in the statutes which were given to the fruiterers of Paris in 1412 , mention is made of salt butter in earthenware jars . Lorraine only exported butter in such jars . The fresh butter most in request for the table in Paris , was that made at Vanvres , which in the month of May the people ate every morning mixed with garlic . The consumption of butter was greatest in Flanders . " I am surprised , " says Bruyerin Champier , speaking of that country , " that they have not yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is mockingly called beurriere ; and when any one has to travel in that country , he is advised to take a knife with him if he wishes to taste the good rolls of butter . " Illustration : Fig. 98.  --  A Dealer in Eggs .  --  Fac-simile of a Woodcut , after Cesare Vecellio , Sixteenth Century . It is not necessary to state that milk and cheese followed the fortunes of butter in the Catholic world , the same as eggs followed those of poultry . But butter having been declared lawful by the Church , a claim was put in for eggs ( Fig. 98 ) , and Pope Julius III . granted this dispensation to all Christendom , although certain private churches did not at once choose to profit by this favour . The Greeks had always been more rigid on these points of discipline than the people of the West . It is to the prohibition of eggs in Lent that the origin of " Easter eggs " must be traced . These were hardened by boiling them in a madder bath , and were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Friday , and were then eaten on the following Sunday as a sign of rejoicing . Ancient Gaul was celebrated for some of its home-made cheeses . Pliny praises those of Nismes , and of Mount Lozere , in Gevaudau ; Martial mentions those of Toulouse , &c.; A simple anecdote , handed down by the monk of St. Gall , who wrote in the ninth century , proves to us that the traditions with regard to cheeses were not lost in the time of Charlemagne : " The Emperor , in one of his travels , alighted suddenly , and without being expected , at the house of a bishop . It was on a Friday . The prelate had no fish , and did not dare to set meat before the prince . He therefore offered him what he had got , some boiled corn and green cheese . Charles ate of the cheese ; but taking the green part to be bad , he took care to remove it with his knife . The Bishop , seeing this , took the liberty of telling his guest that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , found that the bishop was right ; and consequently ordered him to send him annually two cases of similar cheese to Aix-la-Chapelle . The Bishop answered , that he could easily send cheeses , but he could not be sure of sending them in proper condition , because it was only by opening them that you could be sure of the dealer not having deceived you in the quality of the cheese . ' Well , ' said the Emperor , ' before sending them , cut them through the middle , so as to see if they are what I want ; you will only have to join the two halves again by means of a wooden peg , and you can then put the whole into a case . ' " Under the kings of the third French dynasty , a cheese was made at the village of Chaillot , near Paris , which was much appreciated in the capital . In the twelfth and thirteenth centuries , the cheeses of Champagne and of Brie , which are still manufactured , were equally popular , and were hawked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Street-Cries in Paris , "  --  " J'ai bon fromage de Champaigne ; Or i a fromage de Brie ! " ( " Buy my cheese from Champagne , And my cheese from Brie ! " ) Eustache Deschamps went so far as to say that cheese was the only good thing which could possibly come from Brie . The " Menagier de Paris " praises several kinds of cheeses , the names of which it would now be difficult to trace , owing to their frequent changes during four hundred years ; but , according to the Gallic author of this collection , a cheese to be presentable at table , was required to possess certain qualities ( in proverbial Latin , " Non Argus , nee Helena , nee Maria Magdalena , " &c.),; thus expressed in French rhyme :  --  " Non mie ( pas ) blanc comme Helaine , Non mie ( pas ) plourant comme Magdelaine , Non Argus ( a cent yeux ) , mais du tout avugle ( aveugle ) Et aussi pesant comme un bugle ( boeuf ) , Contre le pouce soit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Sans yeux , sans plourer , non pas blanc , Tigneulx , rebelle , bien pesant . " ( " Neither-white like Helena , Nor weeping as Magdelena , Neither Argus , nor yet quite blind , And having too a thickish rind , Resisting somewhat to the touch , And as a bull should weigh as much ; Not eyeless , weeping , nor quite white , But firm , resisting , not too light . " ) In 1509 , Platina , although an Italian , in speaking of good cheeses , mentions those of Chauny , in Picardy , and of Brehemont , in Touraine ; Charles Estienne praises those of Craponne , in Auvergne , the angelots of Normandy , and the cheeses made from fresh cream which the peasant-women of Montreuil and Vincennes brought to Paris in small wickerwork baskets , and which were eaten sprinkled with sugar . The same author names also the rougerets of Lyons , which were always much esteemed ; but , above all the cheeses of Europe , he places the round or cylindrical ones of Auvergne , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fourteen years of age . Olivier de Serres advises those who wish to have good cheeses to boil the milk before churning it , a plan which is in use at Lodi and Parma , " where cheeses are made which are acknowledged by all the world to be excellent . " The parmesan , which this celebrated agriculturist cites as an example , only became the fashion in France on the return of Charles VIII . from his expedition to Naples . Much was thought at that time of a cheese brought from Turkey in bladders , and of different varieties produced in Holland and Zetland . A few of these foreign products were eaten in stews and in pastry , others were toasted and sprinkled with sugar and powdered cinnamon . " Le Roman de Claris , " a manuscript which belongs to the commencement of the fourteenth century , says that in a town winch was taken by storm the following stores were found :  --  : " Maint bon tonnel de vin , Maint bon bacon ( cochon ) , maint fromage a rostir . " ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of good bacon , plenty of good roasted cheese . " ) Illustration : Table Service of a Lady of Quality Fac-simile of a miniature from the Romance of Renaud de Montauban , a ms. of fifteenth century Bibl. de l'Arsenal Illustration : Ladies Hunting Costumes of the fifteenth century . From a miniature in a ms. copy of Ovid 's Epistles . No 7231 bis . Bibl. nat'le de Paris . Besides cheese and butter , the Normans , who had a great many cows in their rich pastures , made a sort of fermenting liquor from the butter-milk , which they called serat , by boiling the milk with onions and garlic , and letting it cool in closed vessels . Illustration : Fig. 99.  --  Manufacture of Cheeses in Switzerland .  --  Fac-simile of a Woodcut in the " Cosmographie Universelle " of Munster , folio , Basle , 1549 .

" Fish and Shellfish .  --  Freshwater fish , which was much more abundant in former days than now , was the ordinary food of those who lived on the borders of lakes , ponds , or rivers , or who , at all events , were not so far distant but that they could procure it fresh . There was of course much diversity at different periods and in different countries as regards the estimation in which the various kinds of fish were held . Thus Ausone , who was a native @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perch , and asserted that shad , pike , and tench should be left to the lower orders ; an opinion which was subsequently contradicted by the inhabitants of other parts of Gaul , and even by the countrymen of the Latin poet Gregory of Tours , who loudly praised the Geneva trout . But a time arrived when the higher classes preferred the freshwater fish of Orchies in Flanders , and even those of the Lyonnais . Thus we see in the thirteenth century the barbel of Saint-Florentin held in great estimation , whereas two hundred years later a man who was of no use , or a nonentity , was said to resemble a barbel , " which is neither good for roasting nor boiling . " Illustration : Fig. 100.  --  The Pond Fisherman .  --  Fac-simile of a Woodcut of the " Cosmographie Universelle " of Munster , folio , Basle , 1549 . In a collection of vulgar proverbs of the twelfth century mention is made , amongst the fish most in demand , besides the barbel of Saint-Florentin above referred to , of the eels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Nantes , the trout of Andeli , and the dace of Aise . The " Menagier " adds several others to the above list , including blay , shad , roach , and gudgeon , but , above all , the carp , which was supposed to be a native of Southern Europe , and which must have been naturalised at a much later period in the northern waters ( Figs. 100 , 101 , and 102 ) . Illustration : Fig. 101.  --  The River Fisherman , designed and engraved , in the Sixteenth Century , by J. Amman . Illustration : Fig. 102.  --  Conveyance of Fish by Water and Land .  --  Fac-simile of an Engraving in the Royal Statutes of the Provostship of Merchants , 1528 . The most ancient documents bear witness that the natives of the sea-coasts of Europe , and particularly of the Mediterranean , fed on the same fish as at present : there were , however , a few other sea-fish , which were also used for food , but which have since been abandoned . Our ancestors were , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their palates , having become accustomed to the flesh of the cormorant , heron , and crane , without difficulty appreciated the delicacy of the nauseous sea-dog , the porpoise , and even the whale , which , when salted , furnished to a great extent all the markets of Europe . The trade in salted sea-fish only began in Paris in the twelfth century , when a company of merchants was instituted , or rather re-established , on the principle of the ancient association of Nantes . This association had existed from the period of the foundation under the Gauls of Lutetia , the city of fluvial commerce ( Fig. 103 ) , and it is mentioned in the letters patent of Louis VII . ( 1170 ) . One of the first cargoes which this company brought in its boats was that of salted herrings from the coast of Normandy . These herrings became a necessary food during Lent , and " Sor et blanc harene fres pouldre ( couvert de sel ) ! " ( " Herrings smoked , fresh , and salted ! " ) was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where this fish became a permanent article of consumption to an extent which can be appreciated from the fact that Saint Louis gave annually nearly seventy thousand herrings to the hospitals , plague-houses , and monasteries . Illustration : Fig. 103.  --  A Votive Altar of the Nantes Parisiens , or the Company for the Commercial Navigation of the Seine , erected in Lutelia during the reign of Tiberius.  --  Fragments of this Altar , which were discovered in 1711 under the Choir of the Church of Notre-Dame , are preserved in the Museums of Cluny and the Palais des Thermes . The profit derived from the sale of herrings at that time was so great that it soon became a special trade ; it was , in fact , the regular practice of the Middle Ages for persons engaged in any branch of industry to unite together and form themselves into a corporation . Other speculators conceived the idea of bringing fresh fish to Paris by means of relays of posting conveyances placed along the road , and they called themselves forains . Laws were made to distinguish the rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarrel in the competition . In these laws , all sea-fish were comprised under three names , the fresh , the salted , and the smoked ( sor ) . Louis IX . in an edict divides the dealers into two classes , namely , the sellers of fresh fish , and the sellers of salt or smoked fish . Besides salt and fresh herrings , an enormous amount of salted mackerel , which was almost as much used , was brought from the sea-coast , in addition to flat-fish , gurnets , skate , fresh and salted whiting and codfish . In an old document of the thirteenth century about fifty kinds of fish are enumerated which were retailed in the markets of the kingdom ; and a century later the " Menagier " gives receipts for cooking forty kinds , amongst which appears , under the name of craspois , the salted flesh of the whale , which was also called le lard de careme . This coarse food , which was sent from the northern seas in enormous slices , was only eaten by the lower orders , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " were it cooked even for twenty-four hours it would still be very hard and indigestible . " The " Proverbes " of the thirteenth century , which mention the freshwater fish then in vogue , also names the sea-fish most preferred , and whence they came , namely , the shad from Bordeaux , the congers from La Rochelle , the sturgeon from Blaye , the fresh herrings from Fecamp , and the cuttle-fish from Coutances . At a later period the conger was not eaten from its being supposed to produce the plague . The turbot , John-dory , skate and sole , which were very dear , were reserved for the rich . The fishermen fed on the sea-dragon . A great quantity of the small sea crayfish were brought into market ; and in certain countries these were called sante , because the doctors recommended them to invalids or those in consumption ; on the other hand , freshwater crayfish were not much esteemed in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries , excepting for their eggs , which were prepared with spice . It is well known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Franks ; they were never out of fashion in the rural districts , and were served at the best tables , dressed with green sauce ; at the same period , and especially during Lent , snails , which were served in pyramid-shaped dishes , were much appreciated ; so much so that nobles and bourgeois cultivated snail beds , somewhat resembling our oyster beds of the present day . The inhabitants of the coast at all periods ate various kinds of shell-fish , which were called in Italy sea-fruit ; but it was only towards the twelfth century that the idea was entertained of bringing oysters to Paris , and mussels were not known there until much later . It is notorious that Henry IV . was a great oyster-eater . Sully relates that when he was created a duke " the king came , without being expected , to take his seat at the reception banquet , but as there was much delay in going to dinner , he began by eating some huitres de chasse , which he found very fresh . " By huitres de chasse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , carriers who brought the fresh fish from the coast to Paris at great speed . Beverages.  --  Beer is not only one of the oldest fermenting beverages used by man , but it is also the one which was most in vogue in the Middle Ages . If we refer to the tales of the Greek historians , we find that the Gauls  --  who , like the Egyptians , attributed the discovery of this refreshing drink to their god Osiris  --  had two sorts of beer : one called zythus , made with honey and intended for the rich ; the other called corma , in which there was no honey , and which was made for the poor . But Pliny asserts that beer in Gallie was called cerevisia , and the grain employed for making it brasce . This testimony seems true , as from brasce or brasse comes the name brasseur ( brewer ) , and from cerevisia , cervoise , the generic name by which beer was known for centuries , and which only lately fell into disuse . Illustration : Fig. 104.  --  The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Woodcut of the " Histoires des Pays Septentrionaux , " by Olaus Magnus , 16mo. , Antwerp , 1560 . After a great famine , Domitian ordered all the vines in Gaul to be uprooted so as to make room for corn . This rigorous measure must have caused beer to become even more general , and , although two centuries later Probus allowed vines to be replanted , the use of beverages made from grain became an established custom ; but in time , whilst the people still only drank cervoise , those who were able to afford it bought wine and drank it alternately with beer . However , as by degrees the vineyards increased in all places having a suitable soil and climate , the use of beer was almost entirely given up , so that in central Gaul wine became so common and cheap that all could drink it . In the northern provinces , where the vine would not grow , beer naturally continued to be the national beverage ( Fig. 104 ) . In the time of Charlemagne , for instance , we find the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be attached to each of his farms . Everywhere the monastic houses possessed breweries ; but as early as the reign of St. Louis there were only a very few breweries in Paris itself , and , in spite of all the privileges granted to their corporation , even these were soon obliged to leave the capital , where there ceased to be any demand for the produce of their industry . They reappeared in 1428 , probably in consequence of the political and commercial relations which had become established between Paris and the rich towns of the Flemish bourgeoisie ; and then , either on account of the dearness of wine , or the caprice of fashion , the consumption of beer again became so general in France that , according to the " Journal d'un Bourgeois de Paris , " it produced to the revenue two-thirds more than wine . It must be understood , however , that in times of scarcity , as in the years 1415 and 1482 , brewing was temporarily stopped , and even forbidden altogether , on account of the quantity of grain which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Fig. 105 ) . Illustration : Fig. 105.  --  The Brewer , designed and engraved , in the Sixteenth . Century , by J. Amman . Under the Romans , the real cervoise , or beer , was made with barley ; but , at a later period , all sorts of grain was indiscriminately used ; and it was only towards the end of the sixteenth century that adding the flower or seed of hops to the oats or barley , which formed the basis of this beverage , was thought of . Estienne Boileau 's " Book of Trades , " edited in the thirteenth century , shows us that , besides the cervoise , another sort of beer was known , which was called godale . This name , we should imagine , was derived from the two German words god ael , which mean " good beer , " and was of a stronger description than the ordinary cervoise ; this idea is proved by the Picards and Flemish people calling it " double beer . " In any case , it is from the word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) is derived . In fact , there is hardly any sort of mixture or ingredient which has not been used in the making of beer , according to the fashions of the different periods . When , on the return from the Crusades , the use of spice had become the fashion , beverages as well as the food were loaded with it . Allspice , juniper , resin , apples , bread-crumbs , sage , lavender , gentian , cinnamon , and laurel were each thrown into it . The English sugared it , and the Germans salted it , and at times they even went so far as to put darnel into it , at the risk of rendering the mixture poisonous . The object of these various mixtures was naturally to obtain high-flavoured beers , which became so much in fashion , that to describe the want of merit of persons , or the lack of value in anything , no simile was more common than to compare them to " small beer . " Nevertheless , more delicate and less blunted palates were to be found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scented with ambergris or raspberries . It is possible , however , that these compositions refer to mixtures in which beer , the produce of fermented grain , was confounded with hydromel , or fermented honey . Both these primitive drinks claim an origin equally remote , which is buried in the most distant periods of history , and they have been used in all parts of the world , being mentioned in the oldest historical records , in the Bible , the Edda , and in the sacred books of India . In the thirteenth century , hydromel , which then bore the name of borgerafre , borgeraste , or bochet , was composed of one part of honey to twelve parts of water , scented with herbs , and allowed to ferment for a month or six weeks . This beverage , which in the customs and statutes of the order of Cluny is termed potus dulcissimus ( the sweetest beverage ) , and which must have been both agreeable in taste and smell , was specially appreciated by the monks , who feasted on it on the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality of bochet was made for the consumption of the lower orders and peasants , out of the honeycomb after the honey had been drained away , or with the scum which rose during the fermentation of the better qualities . Illustration : Fig. 106.  --  The Vintagers , after a Miniature of the " Dialogues de Saint Gregoire " ( Thirteenth Century ) .  --  Manuscript of the Royal Library of Brussels . Cider ( in Latin sicera ) and perry can also both claim a very ancient origin , since they are mentioned by Pliny . It does not appear , however , that the Gauls were acquainted with them . The first historical mention of them is made with reference to a repast which Thierry II. , King of Burgundy and Orleans ( 596-613 ) , son of Childebert , and grandson of Queen Brunehaut , gave to St. Colomban , in which both cider and wine were used . In the thirteenth century , a Latin poet ( Guillaume le Breton ) says that the inhabitants of the Auge and of Normandy made cider their daily drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent away from the localities where it was made ; for , besides the fact that the " Menagier " only very curtly mentions a drink made of apples , we know that in the fifteenth century the Parisians were satisfied with pouring water on apples , and steeping them , so as to extract a sort of half-sour , half-sweet drink called depense . Besides this , Paulmier de Grandmesnil , a Norman by birth , a famous doctor , and the author of a Latin treatise on wine and cider ( 1588 ) , asserts that half a century before , cider was very scarce at Rouen , and that in all the districts of Caux the people only drank beer . Duperron adds that the Normans brought cider from Biscay , when their crops of apples failed . By whom and at what period the vine was naturalised in Gaul has been a long-disputed question , which , in spite of the most careful research , remains unsolved . The most plausible opinion is that which attributes the honour of having imported the vine to the Phoenician colony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Gauls as being highly esteemed . He nevertheless reproaches the vine-growers of Marseilles , Beziers , and Narbonne with doctoring their wines , and with infusing various drugs into them , which rendered them disagreeable and even unwholesome ( Fig. 106 ) . Dioscorides , however , approved of the custom in use among the Allobroges , of mixing resin with their wines to preserve them and prevent them from turning sour , as the temperature of their country was not warm enough thoroughly to ripen the grape . Rooted up by order of Domitian in 92 , as stated above , the vine only reappeared in Gaul under Protus , who revoked , in 282 , the imperial edict of his predecessor ; after which period the Gallic wines soon recovered their ancient celebrity . Under the dominion of the Franks , who held wine in great favour , vineyard property was one of those which the barbaric laws protected with the greatest care . We find in the code of the Salians and in that of the Visigoths very severe penalties for uprooting a vine or stealing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became general , and kings themselves planted them , even in the gardens of their city palaces . In 1160 , there was still in Paris , near the Louvre , a vineyard of such an extent , that Louis VII . could annually present six hogsheads of wine made from it to the rector of St. Nicholas . Philip Augustus possessed about twenty vineyards of excellent quality in various parts of his kingdom . The culture of the vine having thus developed , the wine trade acquired an enormous importance in France . Gascony , Aunis , and Saintonge sent their wines to Flanders ; Guyenne sent hers to England . Froissart writes that , in 1372 , a merchant fleet of quite two hundred sail came from London to Bordeaux for wine . This flourishing trade received a severe blow in the sixteenth century ; for an awful famine having invaded France in 1566 , Charles IX . did not hesitate to repeat the acts of Domitian , and to order all the vines to be uprooted and their place to be sown with corn ; fortunately Henry III @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governors of the provinces to see that " the ploughs were not being neglected in their districts on account of the excessive cultivation of the vine . " Illustration : Fig. 107.  --  Interior of an Hostelry .  --  Fac-simile of a Woodcut in a folio edition of Virgil , published at Lyons in 1517 . Although the trade of a wine-merchant is one of the oldest established in Paris , it does not follow that the retail sale of wine was exclusively carried on by special tradesmen . On the contrary , for a long time the owner of the vineyard retailed the wine which he had not been able to sell in the cask . A broom , a laurel-wreath , or some other sign of the sort hung over a door , denoted that any one passing could purchase or drink wine within . When the wine-growers did not have the quality and price of their wine announced in the village or town by the public crier , they placed a man before the door of their cellar , who enticed the public to enter and taste the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people to take away in their own vessels , established a tavern in some room of their house , where they retailed drink ( Fig. 107 ) . The monks , who made wine extensively , also opened these taverns in the monasteries , as they only consumed part of their wine themselves ; and this system was universally adopted by wine-growers , and even by the king and the nobles . The latter , however , had this advantage , that , whilst they were retailing their wines , no one in the district was allowed to enter into competition with them . This prescriptive right , which was called droit de ban-vin , was still in force in the seventeenth century . Saint Louis granted special statutes to the wine-merchants in 1264 ; but it was only three centuries later that they formed a society , which was divided into four classes , namely , hotel-keepers , publichouse-keepers , tavern proprietors , and dealers in wine a pot , that is , sold to people to take away with them . Hotel-keepers , also called aubergistes , accommodated travellers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dealers a pot sold wine which could not be drunk on their premises . There was generally a sort of window in their door through which the empty pot was passed , to be returned filled : hence the expression , still in use in the eighteenth century , vente a huis coupe ( sale through a cut door ) . Publichouse-keepers supplied drink as well as nappe et assiette ( tablecloth and plate ) , which meant that refreshments were also served . And lastly , the taverniers sold wine to be drunk on the premises , but without the right of supplying bread or meat to their customers ( Figs 108 and 109 ) . Illustration : Fig. 108.  --  Banner of the Corporation of the Publichouse-keepers of Montmedy . Illustration : Fig. 109.  --  Banner of the Corporation of the Publichouse-keepers of Tonnerre . The wines of France in most request from the ninth to the thirteenth centuries were those of Macon , Cahors , Rheims , Choisy , Montargis , Marne , Meulan , and Orleanais . Amongst the latter there was one which was much appreciated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ store , to stimulate his courage when he joined his army . The little fable of the Battle of Wines , composed in the thirteenth century by Henri d'Andelys , mentions a number of wines which have to this day maintained their reputation : for instance , the Beaune , in Burgundy ; the Saint-Emilion , in Gruyenne ; the Chablis , Epernay , Sezanne , in Champagne , &c.; But he places above all , with good reason , according to the taste of those days , the Saint-Pourcain of Auvergne , which was then most expensive and in great request . Another French poet , in describing the luxurious habits of a young man of fashion , says that he drank nothing but Saint-Pourcain ; and in a poem composed by Jean Bruyant , secretary of the Chatelet of Paris , in 1332 , we find " Du saint-pourcain Que l'on met en son sein pour sain . " ( " Saint-Pourcain wine , which you imbibe for the good of your health . " ) Illustration : Fig. 110.  --  Banner of the Coopers of Bayonne . Illustration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rochelle . Towards 1400 , the vineyards of Ai became celebrated for Champagne as those of Beaune were for Burgundy ; and it is then that we find , according to the testimony of the learned Paulmier de Grandmesnil , kings and queens making champagne their favourite beverage . Tradition has it that Francis I. , Charles Quint , Henry VIII. , and Pope Leon X. all possessed vineyards in Champagne at the same time . Burgundy , that pure and pleasant wine , was not despised , and it was in its honour that Erasmus said , " Happy province ! she may well call herself the mother of men , since she produces such milk . " Nevertheless , the above-mentioned physician , Paulmier , preferred to burgundy , " if not perhaps for their flavour , yet for their wholesomeness , the vines of the Ile de France or vins francais , which agree , he says , with scholars , invalids , the bourgeois , and all other persons who do not devote themselves to manual labour ; for they do not parch the blood , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like those of Orleans and Chateau-Thierry ; nor do they cause obstructions like those of Bordeaux . " This is also the opinion of Baccius , who in his Latin treatise on the natural history of wines ( 1596 ) asserts that the wines of Paris " are in no way inferior to those of any other district of the kingdom . " These thin and sour wines , so much esteemed in the first periods of monarchy and so long abandoned , first lost favour in the reign of Francis I. , who preferred the strong and stimulating productions of the South . Notwithstanding the great number of excellent wines made in their own country , the French imported from other lands . In the thirteenth century , in the " Battle of Wines " we find those of Aquila , Spain , and , above all , those of Cyprus , spoken of in high terms . A century later , Eustace Deschamps praised the Rhine wines , and those of Greece , Malmsey , and Grenache . In an edict of Charles VI . mention is also made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lieppe . Generally , the Malmsey which was drunk in France was an artificial preparation , which had neither the colour nor taste of the Cyprian wine . Olivier de Serres tells us that in his time it was made with water , honey , clary juice , beer grounds , and brandy . At first the same name was used for the natural wine , mulled and spiced , which was produced in the island of Madeira from the grapes which the Portuguese brought there from Cyprus in 1420 . The reputation which this wine acquired in Europe induced Francis I. to import some vines from Greece , and he planted fifty acres with them near Fontainebleau . It was at first considered that this plant was succeeding so well , that " there were hopes , " says Olivier de Serres , " that France would soon be able to furnish her own Malmsey and Greek wines , instead of having to import them from abroad . " It is evident , however , that they soon gave up this delusion , and that for want of the genuine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cuit , or cooked wine , which had at all times been cleverly prepared by boiling down new wine and adding various aromatic herbs to it . Many wines were made under the name of herbes , which were merely infusions of wormwood , myrtle , hyssop , rosemary , &c.,; mixed with sweetened wine and flavoured with honey . The most celebrated of these beverages bore the pretentious name of " nectar ; " those composed of spices , Asiatic aromatics , and honey , were generally called " white wine , " a name indiscriminately applied to liquors having for their bases some slightly coloured wine , as well as to the hypocras , which was often composed of a mixture of foreign liqueurs . This hypocras plays a prominent part in the romances of chivalry , and was considered a drink of honour , being always offered to kings , princes , and nobles on their solemn entry into a town . Illustration : Fig. 112.  --  Butler at his Duties .  --  Fac-simile from a Woodcut in the " Cosmographie Universelle , " of Munster , folio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also given to drinks composed of the juices of certain fruits , and in which grapes were in no way used . These were the cherry , the currant , the raspberry , and the pomegranate wines ; also the more , made with the mulberry , which was so extolled by the poets of the thirteenth century . We must also mention the sour wines , which were made by pouring water on the refuse grapes after the wine had been extracted ; also the drinks made from filberts , milk of almonds , the syrups of apricots and strawberries , and cherry and raspberry waters , all of which were refreshing , and were principally used in summer ; and , lastly , tisane , sold by the confectioners of Paris , and made hot or cold , with prepared barley , dried grapes , plums , dates , gum , or liquorice . This tisane may be considered as the origin of that drink which is now sold to the poor at a sous a glass , and which most assuredly has not much improved since olden times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became known in France ; but it does not appear that it was recognised as a liqueur before the sixteenth . The celebrated physician Arnauld de Villeneuve , who wrote at the end of the thirteenth century , to whom credit has wrongly been given for inventing brandy , employed it as one of his remedies , and thus expresses himself about it : " Who would have believed that we could have derived from wine a liquor which neither resembles it in nature , colour , or effect ? .... This eau de vin is called by some eau de vie , and justly so , since it prolongs life .... It prolongs health , dissipates superfluous matters , revives the spirits , and preserves youth . Alone , or added to some other proper remedy , it cures colic , dropsy , paralysis , ague , gravel , &c."; At a period when so many doctors , alchemists , and other learned men made it their principal occupation to try to discover that marvellous golden fluid which was to free the human race of all its original infirmities , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attract the attention of all such manufacturers of panaceas . It was , therefore , under the name of eau d'or ( aqua auri ) that brandy first became known to the world ; a name improperly given to it , implying as it did that it was of mineral origin , whereas its beautiful golden colour was caused by the addition of spices . At a later period , when it lost its repute as a medicine , they actually sprinkled it with pure gold leaves , and at the same time that it ceased to be exclusively considered as a remedy , it became a favourite beverage . It was also employed in distilleries , especially as the basis of various strengthening and exciting liqueurs , most of which have descended to us , some coming from monasteries and others from chateaux , where they had been manufactured . The Kitchen . Soups , broths , and stews , &c.;  --  The French word potage must originally have signified a soup composed of vegetables and herbs from the kitchen garden , but from the remotest times it was applied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Athenaeus , generally ate their meat boiled , we must presume that they made soup with the water in which it was cooked . It is related that one day Gregory of Tours was sitting at the table of King Chilperic , when the latter offered him a soup specially made in his honour from chicken . The poems of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries mention soups made of peas , of bacon , of vegetables , and of groats . In the southern provinces there were soups made of almonds , and of olive oil . When Du Gueselin went out to fight the English knight William of Blancbourg in single combat , he first ate three sorts of soup made with wine , " in honour of the three persons in the Holy Trinity .

We find in the " Menagier , " amongst a long list of the common soups the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dried peas and the water in which bacon has been boiled , " and , in Lent , " salted-whale water ; " watercress soup , cabbage soup , cheese soup , and gramose soup , which was prepared by adding stewed meat to the water in which meat had already been boiled , and adding beaten eggs and verjuice ; and , lastly , the souppe despourvue , which was rapidly made at the hotels , for unexpected travellers , and was a sort of soup made from the odds and ends of the larder . In those days there is no doubt but that hot soup formed an indispensable part of the daily meals , and that each person took it at least twice a day , according to the old proverb :  --  " Soupe la soir , soupe le matin , C'est l'ordinaire du bon chretien . " ( " Soup in the evening , and soup in the morning , Is the everyday food of a good Christian . " ) The cooking apparatus of that period consisted of a whole glittering array of cauldrons , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copper , which hardly sufficed for all the rich soups for which France was so famous . Thence the old proverb , " En France sont les grands soupiers . " But besides these soups , which were in fact looked upon as " common , and without spice , " a number of dishes were served under the generic name of soup , which constituted the principal luxuries at the great tables in the fourteenth century , but which do not altogether bear out the names under which we find them . For instance , there was haricot mutton , a sort of stew ; thin chicken broth ; veal broth with herbs ; soup made of veal , roe , stag , wild boar , pork , hare and rabbit soup flavoured with green peas , &c.; The greater number of these soups were very rich , very expensive , several being served at the same time ; and in order to please the eye as well as the taste they were generally made of various colours , sweetened with sugar , and sprinkled with pomegranate seeds and aromatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweet basil , savoury , &c.; Illustration : Fig. 114.  --  Coppersmith , designed and engraved in the Sixteenth Century by J. Amman . These descriptions of soups were perfect luxuries , and were taken instead of sweets . As a proof of this we must refer to the famous soupe doree , the description of which is given by Taillevent , head cook of Charles VII. , in the following words , " Toast slices of bread , throw them into a jelly made of sugar , white wine , yolk of egg , and rosewater ; when they are well soaked fry them , then throw them again into the rosewater and sprinkle them with sugar and saffron .

It is possible that even now this kind of soup might find some favour ; but we can not say the same for those made with mustard , hemp-seed , millet , verjuice , and a number of others much in repute at that period ; for we see in Rabelais that the French were the greatest soup eaters in the world , and boasted to be the inventors of seventy sorts . We have already remarked that broths were in use at the remotest periods , for , from the time that the practice of boiling various meats was first adopted , it must have been discovered that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nourishing . " In the time of the great King Francis I. , " says Noel du Fail , in his " Contes d'Eutrapel , " " in many places the saucepan was put on to the table , on which there was only one other large dish , of beef , mutton , veal , and bacon , garnished with a large bunch of cooked herbs , the whole of which mixture composed a porridge , and a real restorer and elixir of life . From this came the adage , ' The soup in the great pot and the dainties in the hotch-potch . ' " At one time they made what they imagined to be strengthening broths for invalids , though their virtue must have been somewhat delusive , for , after having boiled down various materials in a close kettle and at a slow fire , they then distilled from this , and the water thus obtained was administered as a sovereign remedy . The common sense of Bernard Palissy did not fail to make him see this absurdity , and to protest against this ridiculous custom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " a partridge , or anything else , cook it well , and then if you smell the broth you will find it very good , and if you taste it you will find it has plenty of flavour ; so much so that you will feel that it contains something to invigorate you . Distil this , on the contrary , and take the water then collected and taste it , and you will find it insipid , and without smell except that of burning . This should convince you that your restorer does not give that nourishment to the weak body for which you recommend it as a means of making good blood , and restoring and strengthening the spirits . " The taste for broths made of flour was formerly almost universal in France and over the whole of Europe ; it is spoken of repeatedly in the histories and annals of monasteries ; and we know that the Normans , who made it their principal nutriment , were surnamed bouilleux . They were indeed almost like the Romans who in olden times , before their wars with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their corn simply boiled in water . In the fourteenth century the broths and soups were made with millet-flour and mixed wheats . The pure wheat flour was steeped in milk seasoned with sugar , saffron , honey , sweet wine or aromatic herbs , and sometimes butter , fat , and yolks of eggs were added . It was on account of this that the bread of the ancients so much resembled cakes , and it was also from this fact that the art of the pastrycook took its rise . Wheat made into gruel for a long time was an important ingredient in cooking , being the basis of a famous preparation called fromentee , which was a bouillie of milk , made creamy by the addition of yolks of eggs , and which served as a liquor in which to roast meats and fish . There were , besides , several sorts of fromentee , all equally esteemed , and Taillevent recommended the following receipt , which differs from the one above given :  --  " First boil your wheat in water , then put into it the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you like it better , milk of almonds , and by this means you will make a soup fit for fasts , because it dissolves slowly , is of slow digestion and nourishes much . In this way , too , you can make ordiat , or barley soup , which is more generally approved than the said fromentee . " Illustration : Fig. 116.  --  Interior of a Kitchen .  --  Fac-simile from a Woodcut in the " Calendarium Romanum " of J. Staeffler , folio , Tubingen , 1518 . Semolina , vermicelli , macaroni , &c.,; which were called Italian because they originally came from that country , have been in use in France longer than is generally supposed . They were first introduced after the expedition of Charles VIII . into Italy , and the conquest of the kingdom of Naples ; that is , in the reign of Louis XII. , or the first years of the sixteenth century . Pies , Stews , Roasts , Salads , &c.;  --  Pastry made with fat , which might be supposed to have been the invention of modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The manufacture of sweet and savoury pastry was intrusted to the care of the good menagiers of all ranks and conditions , and to the corporation of pastrycooks , who obtained their statutes only in the middle of the sixteenth century ; the united skill of these , both in Paris and in the provinces , multiplied the different sorts of tarts and meat pies to a very great extent . So much was this the case that these ingenious productions became a special art , worthy of rivalling even cookery itself ( Figs. 117 , 118 , and 130 ) . One of the earliest known receipts for making pies is that of Gaces de la Bigne , first chaplain of Kings John , Charles V. , and Charles VI . We find it in a sporting poem , and it deserves to be quoted verbatim as a record of the royal kitchen of the fourteenth century . It will be observed on perusing it that nothing was spared either in pastry or in cookery , and that expense was not considered when it was a question of satisfying the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ du pate me mets ; Mais gardes bien que tu ne failles A moi prendre six grosses cailles , De quoi tu les apuyeras .

" ) From this period all treatises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for making " pies of young chickens , of fresh venison , of veal , of eels , of bream and salmon , of young rabbits , of pigeons , of small birds , of geese , and of narrois " ( a mixture of cod 's liver and hashed fish ) . We may mention also the small pies , which were made of minced beef and raisins , similar to our mince pies , and which were hawked in the streets of Paris , until their sale was forbidden , because the trade encouraged greediness on the one hand and laziness on the other . Ancient pastries , owing to their shapes , received the name of tourte or tarte , from the Latin torta , a large hunch of bread . This name was afterwards exclusively used for hot pies , whether they contained vegetables , meat , or fish . But towards the end of the fourteenth century tourte and tarte was applied to pastry containing , herbs , fruits , or preserves , and pate to those containing any kind of meat , game , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Corporation of Pastrycooks of Caen . Illustration : Fig. 118.  --  Banner of the Corporation of Pastrycooks of Bordeaux . It was only in the course of the sixteenth century that the name of potage ceased to be applied to stews , whose number equalled their variety , for on a bill of fare of a banquet of that period we find more than fifty different sorts of potages mentioned . The greater number of these dishes have disappeared from our books on cookery , having gone out of fashion ; but there are two stews which were popular during many centuries , and which have maintained their reputation , although they do not now exactly represent what they formerly did . The pot-pourri , which was composed of veal , beef , mutton , bacon , and vegetables , and the galimafree , a fricassee of poultry , sprinkled with verjuice , flavoured with spices , and surrounded by a sauce composed of vinegar , bread crumbs , cinnamon , ginger , &c.; ( Fig. 119 ) . The highest aim of the cooks of the Taillevent school was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eye . These masters in the art of cooking might be said to be both sculptors and painters , so much did they decorate their works , their object being to surprise or amuse the guests by concealing the real nature of the disbes . Froissart , speaking of a repast given in his time , says that there were a number of " dishes so curious and disguised that it was impossible to guess what they were . " For instance , the bill of fare above referred to mentions a lion and a sun made of white chicken , a pink jelly , with diamond-shaped points ; and , as if the object of cookery was to disguise food and deceive epicures , Taillevent facetiously gives us a receipt for making fried or roast butter and for cooking eggs on the spit . Illustration : Fig. 119.  --  Interior of Italian Kitchen .  --  Fac-simile of a Woodcut in the Book on Cookery of Christoforo di Messisburgo , " Banchetti compositioni di Vivende , " 4to. , Ferrara , 1549 . The roasts were as numerous as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty , beginning with a sirloin of beef , which must have been one of the most common , and ending with a swan , which appeared on table in full plumage . This last was the triumph of cookery , inasmuch as it presented this magnificent bird to the eyes of the astonished guests just as if he were living and swimming . His beak was gilt , his body silvered , resting ' on a mass of brown pastry , painted green in order to represent a grass field . Eight banners of silk were placed round , and a cloth of the same material served as a carpet for the whole dish , which towered above the other appointments of the table . Illustration : Fig. 120.  --  Hunting-Meal.  --  Fac-simile of a Miniature in the Manuscript of the " Livre du Roy Modus " ( National Library of Paris ) . The peacock , which was as much thought of then as it is little valued now , was similarly arrayed , and was brought to table amidst a flourish of trumpets and the applause of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the present system in their simplicity , with this difference , that strong meats were first boiled to render them tender , and no roast was ever handed over to the skill of the carver without first being thoroughly basted with orange juice and rose water , and covered with sugar and powdered spices . We must not forget to mention the broiled dishes , the invention of which is attributed to hunters , and which Rabelais continually refers to as acting as stimulants and irresistibly exciting the thirst for wine at the sumptuous feasts of those voracious heroes ( Fig. 120 ) . The custom of introducing salads after roasts was already established in the fifteenth century . However , a salad , of whatever sort , was never brought to table in its natural state ; for , besides the raw herbs , dressed in the same manner as in our days , it contained several mixtures , such as cooked vegetables , and the crests , livers , or brains of poultry . After the salads fish was served ; sometimes fried , sometimes sliced with eggs or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carpee or charpie , and sometimes it was boiled in water or wine , with strong seasoning . Near the salads , in the course of the dinner , dishes of eggs prepared in various ways were generally served . Many of these are now in use , such as the poached egg , the hard-boiled egg , egg sauce , &c.; Illustration : Fig. 121.  --  Shop of a Grocer and Druggist , from a Stamp of Vriese ( Seventeenth Century ) . Seasonings.  --  We have already stated that the taste for spices much increased in Europe after the Crusades ; and in this rapid historical sketch of the food of the French people in the Middle Ages it must have been observed to what an extent this taste had become developed in France ( Fig. 121 ) . This was the origin of sauces , all , or almost all , of which were highly spiced , and were generally used with boiled , roast , or grilled meats . A few of these sauces , such as the yellow , the green , and the cameline , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manufacturing them by wholesale , and they were hawked in the streets of Paris . These sauce-criers were first called saulciers , then vinaigriers-moustardiers , and when Louis XII . united them in a body , as their business had considerably increased , they were termed **32;648;TOOLONG , distillers of brandy and spirits of wine , and buffetiers ( from buffet , a sideboard ) . Illustration : Fig. 122.  --  The Cook , drawn and engraved , in the Sixteenth Century , by J. Amman . But very soon the corporation became divided , no doubt from the force of circumstances ; and on one side we find the distillers , and on the other the master-cooks and cooks , or porte-chapes , as they were called , because , when they carried on their business of cooking , they covered their dishes with a chape , that is , a cope or tin cover ( Fig. 122 ) , so as to keep them warm . The list of sauces of the fourteenth century , given by the " Menagier de Paris , " is most complicated ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the variety of those preparations , intended to sharpen the appetite , resulted principally from the spicy ingredients with which they were flavoured ; and it is here worthy of remark that pepper , in these days exclusively obtained from America , was known and generally used long before the time of Columbus . It is mentioned in a document , of the time of Clotaire III . ( 660 ) ; and it is clear , therefore , that before the discovery of the New World pepper and spices were imported into Europe from the East . Mustard , which was an ingredient in so many dishes , was cultivated and manufactured in the thirteenth century in the neighbourhood of Dijon and Angers . According to a popular adage , garlic was the medicine ( theriaque ) of peasants ; town-people for a long time greatly appreciated aillee , which was a sauce made of garlic , and sold ready prepared in the streets of Paris . The custom of using anchovies as a flavouring is also very ancient . This was also done with botargue and cavial , two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , chiefly mullet and sturgeon , properly salted or dried , and mixed with fresh or pickled olives . The olives for the use of the lower orders were brought from Languedoc and Provence , whereas those for the rich were imported from Spain and some from Syria . It was also from the south of France that the rest of the kingdom was supplied with olive oil , for which , to this day , those provinces have preserved their renown ; but as early as the twelfth and thirteenth centuries oil of walnuts was brought from the centre of France to Paris , and this , although cheaper , was superseded by oil extracted from the poppy . Truffles , though known and esteemed by the ancients , disappeared from the gastronomie collection of our forefathers . It was only in the fourteenth century that they were again introduced , but evidently without a knowledge of their culinary qualities , since , after being preserved in vinegar , they were soaked in hot water , and afterwards served up in butter . We may also here mention sorrel and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Middle Ages . On the strength of the old proverb , " Sugar has never spoiled sauce , " sugar was put into all sauces which were not piquantes , and generally some perfumed water was added to them , such as rose-water . This was made in great quantities by exposing to the sun a basin full of water , covered over by another basin of glass , under which was a little vase containing rose-leaves . This rose-water was added to all stews , pastries , and beverages . It is very doubtful as to the period at which white lump sugar became known in the West . However , in an account of the house of the Dauphin Viennois ( 1333 ) mention is made of " white sugar ; " and the author of the " Menagier de Paris " frequently speaks of this white sugar , which , before the discovery , or rather colonisation , of America , was brought , ready refined , from the Grecian islands , and especially from Candia . Illustration : Fig. 123.  --  The Issue de Table . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ di Messisburgo , " Banchetti compositioni di Vivende , " 4to. , Ferrara , 1549 . Verjuice , or green juice , which , with vinegar , formed the essential basis of sauces , and is now extracted from a species of green grape , which never ripens , was originally the juice of sorrel ; another sort was extracted by pounding the green blades of wheat . Vinegar was originally merely soured wine , as the word vin-aigre denotes . The mode of manufacturing it by artificial means , in order to render the taste more pungent and the quality better , is very ancient . It is needless to state that it was scented by the infusion of herbs or flowers  --  roses , elder , cloves , &c.; but it was not much before the sixteenth century that it was used for pickling herbs or fruits and vegetables , such as gherkins , onions , cucumber , purslain , &c.; Salt , which from the remotest periods was the condiment par excellence , and the trade in which had been free up to the fourteenth century , became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The levying of these taxes was a frequent cause of tumult amongst the people , who saw with marked displeasure the exigencies of the excise gradually raising the price of an article of primary necessity . We have already mentioned times during which the price of salt was so exorbitant that the rich alone could put it in their bread . Thus , in the reign of Francis I. , it was almost as dear as Indian spices . Sweet Dishes , Desserts , &c.;  --  In the fourteenth century , the first courses of a repast were called mets or assiettes ; the last , " entremets , dorures , issue de table , desserte , and boule-hors . " The dessert consisted generally of baked pears , medlars , pealed walnuts , figs , dates , peaches , grapes , filberts , spices , and white or red sugar-plums . At the issue de table wafers or some other light pastry were introduced , which were eaten with the hypocras wine . The boute-hors , which was served when the guests , after having washed their hands and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of spices , different from those which had appeared at dessert , and intended specially to assist the digestion ; and for this object they must have been much needed , considering that a repast lasted several hours . Whilst eating these spices they drank Grenache , Malmsey , or aromatic wines ( Fig. 123 ) . It was only at the banquets and great repeats that sweet dishes and dorures appeared , and they seem to have been introduced for the purpose of exhibiting the power of the imagination and the talent in execution of the master-cook . The dorures consisted of jellies of all sorts and colours ; swans , peacocks , bitterns , and herons , on gala feasts , were served in full feather on a raised platform in the middle of the table , and hence the name of " raised dishes . " As for the side-dishes , properly so called , the long list collected in the " Menagier " shows us that they were served at table indiscriminately , for stuffed chickens at times followed hashed porpoise in sauce , lark pies succeeded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At a later period the luxury of side-dishes consisted in the quantity and in the variety of the pastry ; Rabelais names sixteen different sorts at one repast ; Taillevent mentions pastry called covered pastry , Bourbonnaise pastry , double-faced pastry , pear pastry , and apple pastry ; Platina speaks of the white pastry with quince , elder flowers , rice , roses , chestnuts , &c.; The fashion of having pastry is , however , of very ancient date , for in the book of the " Proverbs " of the thirteenth century , we find that the pies of Dourlens and the pastry of Chartres were then in great celebrity . Illustration : Fig. 124.  --  The Table of a Baron , as laid out in the Thirteenth Century .  --  Miniature from the " Histoire de St. Graal " ( Manuscript from the Imperial Library , Paris ) . In a charter of Robert le Bouillon , Bishop of Amiens , in 1311 , mention is made of a cake composed of puff flaky paste ; these cakes , however , are less ancient than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which , from the earliest days of monarchy , appeared on all the tables , not only at the feast of the Epiphany , but also on every festive occasion . Amongst the dry and sweet pastries from the small oven which appeared at the issue de table , the first to be noticed were those made of almonds , nuts , &c.,; and such choice morsels , which were very expensive ; then came the cream or cheesecakes , the petits choux , made of butter and eggs ; the echaudes , of which the people were very fond , and St. Louis even allowed the bakers to cook them on Sundays and feast days for the poor ; wafers , which are older than the thirteenth century ; and lastly the oublies , which , under the names of nieules , esterets , and supplications , gave rise to such an extensive trade that a corporation was established in Paris , called the oublayeurs , oublayers , or oublieux , whose statutes directed that none should be admitted to exercise the trade unless he was able to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 200 esterets . Repasts and Feasts . We have had to treat elsewhere of the rules and regulations of the repasts under the Merovingian and Carlovingian kings . We have also spoken of the table service of the thirteenth century ( see chapter on " Private Life " ) . The earliest author who has left us any documents on this curious subject is that excellent bourgeois to whom we owe the " Menagier de Paris . " He describes , for instance , in its fullest details , a repast which was given in the fourteenth century by the Abbe de Lagny , to the Bishop of Paris , the President of the Parliament , the King 's attorney and advocate , and other members of his council , in all sixteen guests . We find from this account that " my lord of Paris , occupying the place of honour , was , in consequence of his rank , served on covered dishes by three of his squires , as was the custom for the King , the royal princes , the dukes , and peers ; that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bishop , was also served by one of his own servants , but on uncovered dishes , and the other guests were seated at table according to the order indicated by their titles or charges . " The bill of fare of this feast , which was given on a fast-day , is the more worthy of attention , in that it proves to us what numerous resources cookery already possessed . This was especially the case as regards fish , notwithstanding that the transport of fresh sea-fish was so difficult , owing to the bad state of the roads . First , a quarter of a pint of Grenache was given to each guest on sitting down , then " hot eschaudes , roast apples with white sugar-plums upon them , roasted figs , sorrel and watercress , and rosemary . " " Soups .  --  A rich soup , composed of six trout , six tenches , white herring , freshwater eels , salted twenty-four hours , and three whiting , soaked twelve hours ; almonds , ginger , saffron , cinnamon powder and sweetmeats .

" The clever editor of the " Menagier de Paris , " M. le Baron Jerome Pichon , after giving us this curious account of the mode of living of the citizens of that day , thus sums up the whole arrangements for the table in the fourteenth century : " The different provisions necessary for food are usually entrusted to the squires of the kitchen , and were chosen , purchased , and paid for by one or more of these officials , assisted by the cooks . The dishes prepared by the cooks were placed , by the help of the esquires , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thence they were carried to the tables . Let us imagine a vast hall hung with tapestries and other brilliant stuffs . The tables are covered with fringed table-cloths , and strewn with odoriferous herbs ; one of them , called the Great Table , is reserved for the persons of distinction . The guests are taken to their seats by two butlers , who bring them water to wash . The Great Table is laid out by a butler , with silver salt-cellars ( Figs. 126 and 127 ) , golden goblets with lids for the high personages , spoons and silver drinking cups . The guests eat at least certain dishes on tranchoirs , or large slices of thick bread , afterwards thrown into vases called couloueres ( drainers ) . For the other tables the salt is placed on pieces of bread , scooped out for that purpose by the intendants , who are called porte-chappes . In the hall is a dresser covered with plate and various kinds of wine . Two squires standing near this dresser give the guests clean spoons , pour out what wine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; two other squires superintend the conveyance of wine to the dresser ; a varlet placed under their orders is occupied with nothing but drawing wine from the casks . " At that time wine was not bottled , and they drew directly from the cask the amount necessary for the day 's consumption . " The dishes , consisting of three , four , five , and even six courses , called mets or assiettes , are brought in by varlets and two of the principal squires , and in certain wedding-feasts the bridegroom walked in front of them . The dishes are placed on the table by an asseeur ( placer ) , assisted by two servants . The latter take away the remains at the conclusion of the course , and hand them over to the squires of the kitchen who have charge of them . After the mets or assiettes the table-cloths are changed , and the entremets are then brought in . This course is the most brilliant of the repast , and at some of the princely banquets the dishes are made to imitate a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dishes , of coloured jellies of swans , of peacocks , or of pheasants adorned with their feathers , having the beak and feet gilt , and placed on the middle of the table on a sort of pedestal . To the entremets , a course which does not appear on all bills of fare , succeeds the dessert . The issue , or exit from table , is mostly composed of hypocras and a sort of oublie called mestier ; or , in summer , when hypocras is out of season on account of its strength , of apples , cheeses , and sometimes of pastries and sweetmeats . The boute-hors ( wines and spices ) end the repast . The guests then wash their hands , say grace , and pass into the chambre de parement or drawing-room . The servants then sit down and dine after their masters . They subsequently bring the guests wine and epices de chambre , after which each retires home .

But all the pomp and magnificence of the feasts of this period would have appeared paltry a century later , when royal banquets were managed by Taillevent , head cook to Charles VII . The historian of French cookery , Legrand d'Aussy , thus desoribes a great feast given in 1455 by the Count of Anjou , third son of Louis II. , King of Sicily :  --  " On the table was placed a centre-piece , which represented a green lawn , surrounded with large peacocks ' feathers and green branches , to which were tied violets and other sweet-smelling flowers . In the middle of this lawn a fortress was placed , covered with silver . This was hollow , and formed a sort of cage , in which several live birds were shut up , their tufts and feet being gilt . On its tower , which was gilt , three banners were placed , one bearing the arms of the count , the two others those of Mesdemoiselles de Chateaubrun and de Villequier , in whose honour the feast was given . " The first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of stag which had been a night in salt , a stuffed chicken , and a loin of veal . The two last dishes were covered with a German sauce , with gilt sugar-plums , and pomegranate seeds .... At each end , outside the green lawn , was an enormous pie , surmounted with smaller pies , which formed a crown . The crust of the large ones was silvered all round and gilt at the top ; each contained a whole roe-deer , a gosling , three capons , six chickens , ten pigeons , one young rabbit , and , no doubt to serve as seasoning or stuffing , a minced loin of veal , two pounds of fat , and twenty-six hard-boiled eggs , covered with saffron and flavoured with cloves . For the three following courses , there was a roe-deer , a pig , a sturgeon cooked in parsley and vinegar , and covered with powdered ginger ; a kid , two goslings , twelve chickens , as many pigeons , six young rabbits , two herons , a leveret , a fat capon stuffed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with powder de Duc ( spice ) , a wild boar , some wafers ( darioles ) , and stars ; a jelly , part white and part red , representing the crests of the three above-mentioned persons ; cream with Duc powder , covered with fennel seeds preserved in sugar ; a white cream , cheese in slices , and strawberries ; and , lastly , plums stewed in rose-water . Besides these four courses , there was a fifth , entirely composed of the prepared wines then in vogue , and of preserves . These consisted of fruits and various sweet pastries . The pastries represented stags and swans , to the necks of which were suspended the arms of the Count of Anjou and those of the two young ladies . " In great houses , dinner was announced by the sound of the hunting-horn ; this is what Froissard calls corner l'assiette , but which was at an earlier period called corner l'eau , because it was the custom to wash the hands before sitting down to table as well as on leaving the dining-room .

Achille Jubinal ) . For these ablutions scented water , and especially rose-water , was used , brought in ewers of precious and delicately wrought metals , by pages or squires , who handed them to the ladies in silver basins . It was at about this period , that is , in the times of chivalry , that the custom of placing the guests by couples was introduced , generally a gentleman and lady , each couple having but one cup and one plate ; hence the expression , to eat from the same plate . Historians relate that in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries , at certain gala feasts , the dishes were brought in by servants in full armour , mounted on caparisoned horses ; but this is a custom exclusively attached to chivalry . As early as those days , powerful and ingenious machines were in use , which lowered from the story above , or raised from that below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use as if by enchantment . At that period the table service of the wealthy required a considerable staff of retainers and varlets ; and , at a later period , this number was much increased . Thus , for instance , when Louis of Orleans went on a diplomatic mission to Germany from his brother Charles VI. , this prince , in order that France might be worthily represented abroad , raised the number of his household to more than two hundred and fifty persons , of whom about one hundred were retainers and table attendants . Olivier de la Marche , who , in his " Memoires , " gives the most minute details of the ceremonial of the court of Charles the Bold , Duke of Burgundy , tells us that the table service was as extensive as in the other great princely houses . This extravagant and ruinous pomp fell into disuse during the reigns of Louis XI. , Charles VIII. , and Louis XII. , but reappeared in that of Francis I. This prince , after his first wars in Italy , imported the cookery and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of good living , especially in Venice , Florence , and Rome , had reached the highest degree of refinement and magnificence . Henry II . and Francis II . maintained the magnificence of their royal tables ; but after them , notwithstanding the soft effeminacy of the manners at court , the continued wars which Henry III . and Charles IX . had to sustain in their own states against the Protestants and the League necessitated a considerable economy in the households and tables of those kings . " It was only by fits and starts , " says Brantome , " that one was well fed during this reign , for very often circumstances prevented the proper preparation of the repasts ; a thing much disliked by the courtiers , who prefer open table to be kept at both court and with the army , because it then costs them nothing . " Henry IV . was neither fastidious nor greedy ; we must therefore come down to the reign of Louis XIII . to find a vestige of the splendour of the banquets of Francis I.

In the sixteenth century they put back dinner one hour and supper three hours , to which many people objected . Hence the old proverb :  --  " Lever a six , diner a dix , Souper a six , coucher a dix , Fait vivre l'homme dix fois dix .

By the general term hunting is included the three distinct branches of an art , or it may be called a science , which dates its origin from the earliest times , but which was particularly esteemed in the Middle Ages , and was especially cultivated in the glorious days of chivalry . Venery , which is the earliest , is defined by M. Elzear Blaze as " the science of snaring , taking , or killing one particular animal from amongst a herd . " Hawking came next . This was not only the art of hunting with the falcon , but that of training birds of prey to hunt feathered game . Lastly , l'oisellerie ( fowling ) , which , according to the author of several well-known works on the subject we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protecting the crops and fruits from birds and other animals whose nature it was to feed on them . Venery will be first considered . Sportsmen always pride themselves in placing Xenophon , the general , philosopher , and historian , at the head of sporting writers , although his treatise on the chase ( translated from the Greek into Latin under the title of " De Venatione " ) , which gives excellent advice respecting the training of dogs , only speaks of traps and nets for capturing wild animals . Amongst the Greeks Arrian and Oppian , and amongst the Romans , Gratius Faliscus and Nemesianus , wrote on the same subject . Their works , however , except in a few isolated or scattered passages , do not contain anything about venery properly so called , and the first historical information on the subject is to be found in the records of the seventh century . Long after that period , however , they still hunted , as it were , at random , attacking the first animal they met . The sports of Charlemagne , for instance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasions they killed animals of all sorts by thousands , after having tracked and driven them into an enclosure composed of cloths or nets . This illustrious Emperor , although usually at war in all parts of Europe , never missed an opportunity of hunting : so much so that it might be said that he rested himself by galloping through the forests . He was on these occasions not only followed by a large number of huntsmen and attendants of his household , but he was accompanied by his wife and daughters , mounted on magnificent coursers , and surrounded by a numerous and elegant court , who vied with each other in displaying their skill and courage in attacking the fiercest animals . It is even stated that Aix-la-Chapelle owes its origin to a hunting adventure of Charlemagne . The Emperor one day while chasing a stag required to cross a brook which came in his path , but immediately his horse had set his foot in the water he pulled it out again and began to limp as if it were hurt . His noble rider dismounted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This induced him to put his hand into the water , which he found to be almost boiling . On that very spot therefore he caused a chapel to be erected , in the shape of a horse 's hoof . The town was afterwards built , and to this day the spring of hot mineral water is enclosed under a rotunda , the shape of which reminds one of the old legend of Charlemagne and his horse . The sons of Charlemagne also held hunting in much esteem , and by degrees the art of venery was introduced and carried to great perfection . It was not , however , until the end of the thirteenth century that an anonymous author conceived the idea of writing its principal precepts in an instructive poem , called " Le Dict de la Chace du Cerf . " In 1328 another anonymous writer composed the " Livre du Roy Modus , " which contains the rules for hunting all furred animals , from the stag to the hare . Then followed other poets and writers of French prose , such as Gace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1387 ) , and Hardouin , lord of Fontaine-Guerin ( 1394 ) . None of these , however , wrote exclusively on venery , but described the different sports known in their day . Towards 1340 , Alphonse XI. , king of Castile , caused a book on hunting to be compiled for his use ; but it was not so popular as the instruction of Gaston Phoebus ( Fig. 132 ) . If hunting with hounds is known everywhere by the French name of the chase , it is because the honour of having organized it into a system , if not of having originated it , is due to the early French sporting authors , who were able to form a code of rules for it . This also accounts for so many of the technical terms now in use in venery being of French origin , as they are no others than those adopted by these ancient authors , whose works , so to speak , have perpetuated them . Illustration : Fig. 132.  --  Gaston Phoebus teaching the Art of Venery.  --  Fac-simile of a Miniature of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Birds of Prey " ( Manuscript , Fifteenth Century , National Library of Paris ) Illustration : Fig. 133.  --  " How to carry a Cloth to approach Beasts . "  --  Fac-simile of a Miniature in the Manuscript of Phoebus ( Fifteenth Century ) . The curious miniatures which accompany the text in the original manuscript of Gaston Phoebus , and which have been reproduced in nearly all the ancient copies of this celebrated manuscript , give most distinct and graphic ideas of the various modes of hunting . We find , for instance , that the use of an artificial cow for approaching wild-fowl was understood at that time , the only difference being that a model was used more like a horse than a cow ( Fig. 133 ) ; we also see sportsmen shooting at bears , wild boars , stags , and such live animals with arrows having sharp iron points , intended to enter deep into the flesh , notwithstanding the thickness of the fur and the creature 's hard skin . In the case of the hare , however , the missile had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which stunned him without piercing his body ( Fig. 134 ) . In other cases the sportsman is represented with a crossbow seated in a cart , all covered up with boughs , by which plan he was supposed to approach the prey without alarming it any more than a swinging branch would do ( Fig. 135 ) . Gaston Phoebus is known to have been one of the bravest knights of his time ; and , after fighting , he considered hunting as his greatest delight . Somewhat ingenuously he writes of himself as a hunter , " that he doubts having any superior . " Like all his contemporaries , he is eloquent as to the moral effect of his favourite pastime . " By hunting , " he says , " one avoids the sin of indolence ; and , according to our faith , he who avoids the seven mortal sins will be saved ; therefore the good sportsman will be saved . " Illustration : Fig. 134.  --  " How to allure the Hare . "  --  Fac-simile of a Miniature in the Manuscript of Phoebus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placed themselves under the protection of some special deity . Among the Greeks and Romans it was Diana and Phoebe . The Gauls , who had adopted the greater number of the gods and goddesses of Rome , invoked the moon when they sallied forth to war or to the chase ; but , as soon as they penetrated the sacred obscurity of the forests , they appealed more particularly to the goddess Ardhuina , whose name , of unknown origin , has probably since been applied to the immense well-stocked forests of Ardenne or Ardennes . They erected in the depths of the woods monstrous stone figures in honour of this goddess , such as the heads of stags on the bodies of men or women ; and , to propitiate her during the chase , they hung round these idols the feet , the skins , and the horns of the beasts they killed . Cernunnos , who was always represented with a human head surmounted by stags ' horns , had an altar even in Lutetia , which was , no doubt , in consequence of the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Fig. 135.  --  " How to take a Cart to allure Beasts . "  --  Fac-simile of a Miniature in the Manuscript of Phoebus ( Fifteenth Century ) . The Gallic Cernunnos , which we also find among the Romans , since Ovid mentions the votary stags ' horns , continued to be worshipped to a certain extent after the establishment of the Christian religion . In the fifth century , Germain , an intrepid hunter , who afterwards became Bishop of Auxerre , possessed not far from his residence an oak of enormous diameter , a thorough Cernunnos , which he hung with the skins and other portions of animals he had killed in the chase . In some countries , where the Cernunnos remained an object of veneration , everybody bedecked it in the same way . The largest oak to be found in the district was chosen on which to suspend the trophies both of warriors and of hunters ; and , at a more recent period , sportsmen used to hang outside their doors stags ' heads , boars ' feet , birds of prey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relic of the one referred to . On pagan idolatry being abandoned , hunters used to have a presiding genius or protector , whom they selected from amongst the saints most in renown . Some chose St. Germain d'Auxerre , who had himself been a sportsman ; others St. Martin , who had been a soldier before he became Bishop of Tours . Eventually they all agreed to place themselves under the patronage of St. Hubert , Bishop of Liege , a renowned hunter of the eighth century . This saint devoted himself to a religious life , after one day haying encountered a miraculous stag whilst hunting in the woods , which appeared to him as bearing between his horns a luminous image of our Saviour . At first the feast of St. Hubert was celebrated four times a year , namely , at the anniversaries of his conversion and death , and on the two occasions on which his relics were exhibited . At the celebration of each of these feasts a large number of sportsmen in " fine apparel " came from great distances with their horses and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or pomp deemed too imposing to be displayed , both by the kings and nobles , in honour of the patron-saint of hunting ( Fig. 136 ) .

Illustration : Fig. 137.  --  German Sportsman , drawn and engraved by J. Amman in the Sixteenth Century . Hunters and sportsmen in those days formed brotherhoods , which had their rank defined at public ceremonials , and especially in processions . In 1455 , Gerard , Duke of Cleves and Burgrave of Ravensberg , created the order of the Knights of St. Hubert , into which those of noble blood only were admitted . The insignia consisted of a gold or silver chain formed of hunting horns , to which was hung a small likeness of the patron-saint in the act of doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the head of a stag . It was popularly believed that the Knights of St. Hubert had the power of curing madness , which , for some unknown reason , never showed itself in a pack of hounds . This , however , was not the only superstitious belief attached to the noble and adventurous occupations of the followers of St. Hubert . Amongst a number of old legends , which mostly belong to Germany ( Fig. 137 ) , mention is made of hunters who sold their souls to the devil in exchange for some enchanted arrow which never missed its aim , and which reached game at extraordinary distances . Mention is also made in these legends of various animals which , on being pursued by the hunters , were miraculously saved by throwing themselves into the arms of some saint , or by running into some holy sanctuary . There were besides knights who , having hunted all their lives , believed that they were to continue the same occupation in another world . An account is given in history of the apparition of a fiery phantom to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also the ominous meeting of Henry IV . with the terrible grand-veneur in the forest of Fontainebleau . We may account for these strange tales from the fact that hunting formerly constituted a sort of freemasonry , with its mysterious rites and its secret language . The initiated used particular signs of recognition amongst themselves , and they also had lucky and unlucky numbers , emblematical colours , &c.; The more dangerous the sport the more it was indulged in by military men . The Chronicles of the Monk of Saint-Gall describe an adventure which befell Charlemagne on the occasion of his setting out with his huntsmen and hounds in order to chase an enormous bear which was the terror of the Vosges . The bear , after having disabled numerous dogs and hunters , found himself face to face with the Emperor , who alone dared to stand up before him . A fierce combat ensued on the summit of a rock , in which both were locked together in a fatal embrace . The contest ended by the death of the bear , Charles striking him with his dagger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hills resounded with the cry of " Vive Charles le Grand ! " from the numerous huntsmen and others who had assembled ; and it is said that this was the first occasion on which the companions of the intrepid monarch gave him the title of Grand ( Magnus ) , so from that time King Charles became King Charlemagne . This prince was most jealous of his rights of hunting , which he would waive to no one . For a long time he refused permission to the monks of the Abbey of St. Denis , whom he nevertheless held in great esteem , to have some stags killed which were destroying their forests . It was only on condition that the flesh of these animals would serve as food to the monks of inferior order , and that their hides should be used for binding the missals , that he eventually granted them permission to kill the offending animals ( Fig. 138 ) . If we pass from the ninth to the thirteenth century , we find that Louis IX. , king of France , was as keen a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancestors . He was , indeed , as fond of hunting as of war , and during his first crusade an opportunity occurred to him of hunting the lion . " As soon as he began to know the country of Cesarea , " says Joinville , " the King set to work with his people to hunt lions , so that they captured many ; but in doing so they incurred great bodily danger . The mode of taking them was this : They pursued them on the swiftest horses . When they came near one they shot a bolt or arrow at him , and the animal , feeling himself wounded , ran at the first person he could see , who immediately turned his horse 's head and fled as fast as he could . During his flight he dropped a portion of his clothing , which the lion caught up and tore , thinking it was the person who had injured him ; and whilst the lion was thus engaged the hunters again approached the infuriated animal and shot more bolts and arrows at him . Soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other hunter , who adopted the same strategy as before . This was repeated until the animal succumbed , becoming exhausted by the wounds he had received . " Illustration : Fig. 138.  --  " Nature and Appearance of Deer , and how they can be hunted with Dogs . "  --  Fac-simile of a Miniature in the " Livre du Roy Modus "  --  Manuscript of the Fourteenth Century ( National Library of Paris ) Notwithstanding the passion which this king had for hunting , he was the first to grant leave to the bourgeoisie to enjoy the sport . The condition he made with them was that they should always give a haunch of any animal killed to the lord of the soil . It is to this that we must trace the origin of giving the animal 's foot to the huntsman or to the person who has the lead of the hunting party . Louis XI. , however , did not at all act in this liberal manner , and although it might have been supposed that the incessant wars and political intrigues in which he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this kind , yet he was , nevertheless , the keenest sportsman of his day . This tyrant of the Castle of Plessis-les-Tours , who was always miserly , except in matters of hunting , in which he was most lavish , forbade even the higher classes to hunt under penalty of hanging . To ensure the execution of his severe orders , he had all the castles as well as the cottages searched , and any net , engine , or sporting arm found was immediately destroyed . His only son , the heir to the throne , was not exempted from these laws . Shut up in the Castle of Amboise , he had no permission to leave it , for it was the will of the King that the young prince should remain ignorant of the noble exercises of chivalry . One day the Dauphin prayed his governor , M. du Bouchage , with so much earnestness to give him an idea of hunting , that this noble consented to make an excursion into the neighbouring wood with him . The King , however , managed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in keeping his head on his shoulders . One of the best ways of pleasing Louis XI . was to offer him some present relating to his favourite pastime , either pointers , hounds , falcons , or varlets who were adepts in the art of venery or hawking ( Figs. 139 and 140 ) . When the cunning monarch became old and infirm , in order to make his enemies believe that he was still young and vigorous , he sent messengers everywhere , even to the most remote countries , to purchase horses , dogs , and falcons , for which , according to Comines , he paid large sums ( Fig. 141 ) . On his death , the young prince , Charles VIII. , succeeded him , and he seems to have had an innate taste for hunting , and soon made up for lost time and the privation to which his father had subjected him . He hunted daily , and generously allowed the nobles to do the same . It is scarcely necessary to say that these were not slow in indulging in the privilege @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their most ancient pastimes and occupations ; for it must be remembered that , in those days of small intellectual culture , hunting must have been a great , if not at times the only , resource against idleness and the monotony of country life . Everything which related to sport again became the fashion amongst the youth of the nobility , and their chief occupation when not engaged in war . They continued as formerly to invent every sort of sporting device . For example , they obtained from other countries traps , engines , and hunting-weapons ; they introduced into France at great expense foreign animals , which they took great pains in naturalising as game or in training as auxiliaries in hunting . After having imported the reindeer from Lapland , which did not succeed in their temperate climate , and the pheasant from Tartary , with which they stocked the woods , they imported with greater success the panther and the leopard from Africa , which were used for furred game as the hawk was for feathered game . The mode of hunting with these animals was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rode across country , each with a leopard sitting behind him on his saddle . When the dogs had started the game the leopard jumped off the saddle and sprang after it , and as soon as it was caught the hunters threw the leopard a piece of raw flesh , for which he gave up the prey and remounted behind his master ( Fig. 142 ) Louis XI. , Charles VIII. , and Louis XII . often hunted thus . The leopards , which formed a part of the royal venery , were kept in an enclosure of the Castle of Amboise , which still exists near the gate des Lions , so called , no doubt , on account of these sporting and carnivorous animals being mistaken for lions by the common people . There , were , however , always lions in the menageries of the kings of France .

His innate taste for sport was increased during his travels in Italy , where he lived with princes who displayed great splendour in their hunting equipages . He even acquired the name of the Father of Sportsmen . His netting establishment alone , consisted of one captain , one lieutenant , twelve mounted huntsmen , six varlets to attend the bloodhounds ; six whips , who had under their charge sixty hounds ; and one hundred bowmen on foot , carrying large stakes for fixing the nets and tents , which were carried by fifty six-horsed chariots . He was much pleased when ladies followed the chase ; and amongst those who were most inclined to share its pleasures , its toils , and even its perils , was Catherine de Medicis , then Dauphine , who was distinguished for her agility and her graceful appearance on horseback , and who became a thorough sportswoman .

" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the art being considered as the most noble occupation to which persons could devote themselves , it is not surprising to find sporting works composed by writers of the greatest renown and of the highest rank . The learned William Bude , whom Erasmus called the wonder of France , dedicated to the children of Francis I. the second book of his " Philologie , " which contains a treatise on stag-hunting . This treatise , originally written in Latin , was afterwards translated into French by order of Charles IX. , who was acknowledged to be one of the boldest and most scientific hunters of his time . An extraordinary feat , which has never been imitated by any one , is recorded of him , and that was , that alone , on horseback and without dogs , he hunted down a stag . The " Chasse Royale , " the authorship of which is attributed to him , is replete with scientific information . " Wolf-hunting , " a work by the celebrated Clamorgan , and " Yenery , " by Du Fouilloux , were dedicated to Charles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such subjects appeared in his reign . Illustration : Fig. 141.  --  " Kennel in which Dogs should live , and how they should be kept . "  --  Fac-simile of a Miniature in Manuscript of Phoebus ( Fifteenth Century ) . His brother , the effeminate Henry III. , disliked hunting , as he considered it too fatiguing and too dangerous . On the other hand , according to Sully , Henry IV. , le Bearnais , who learned hunting in early youth in the Pyrenees , " loved all kinds of sport , and , above all , the most fatiguing and adventurous pursuits , such as those after wolves , bears , and boars . " He never missed a chance of hunting , " even when in face of an enemy . If he knew a stag to be near , he found time to hunt it , " and we find in the " Memoirs of Sully " that the King hunted the day after the famous battle of Ivry . One day , when he was only King of Navarre , he invited the ladies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they refused , for on that occasion their nerves would have been put to a serious test . Two bears killed two of the horses , and several bowmen were hugged to death by the ferocious animals . Another bear , although pierced in several places , and having six or seven pike-heads in his body , charged eight men who were stationed on the top of a rock , and the whole of them with the bear were all dashed to pieces down the precipice . The only point in which Louis XIII . resembled his father was his love of the chase , for during his reign hunting continued in France , as well as in other countries , to be a favourite royal pastime . We have remarked that St. Germain d'Auxerre , who at a certain period was the patron of sportsmen , made hunting his habitual relaxation . He devoted himself to it with great keenness in his youth , before he became bishop , that is , when he was Duke of Auxerre and general of the troops of the provinces . Subsequently , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not only did he give up all pleasures , but he devoted himself to the strictest religious life . Unfortunately , in those days , all church-men did not understand , as he did , that the duties of their holy vocation were not consistent with these pastimes , for , in the year 507 , we find that councils and synods forbade priests to hunt . In spite of this , however , the ancient historians relate that several noble prelates , yielding to the customs of the times , indulged in hunting the stag and flying the falcon . Illustration : Fig. 142.  --  Hunting with the Leopard , from a Stamp of Jean Stradan ( Sixteenth Century ) . It is related in history that some of the most illustrious popes were also great lovers of the chase , namely , Julius II , Leo X. , and , previously to them , Pius II , who , before becoming Pope , amongst other literary and scientific works , wrote a Latin treatise on venery under his Christian names , AEneas Silvius . It is easy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for ecclesiastical dignitaries . In early life they acquired the tastes and habits of people of their rank , and they were accordingly extremely jealous of the rights of chase in their domains . Although Pope Clement V. , in his celebrated " Institutions , " called " Clementines , " had formally forbidden the monks to hunt , there were few who did not evade the canonical prohibition by pursuing furred game , and that without considering that they were violating the laws of the Church . The papal edict permitted the monks and priests to hunt under certain circumstances , and especially where rabbits or beasts of prey increased so much as to damage the crops . It can easily be imagined that such would always be the case at a period when the people were so strictly forbidden to destroy game ; and therefore hunting was practised at all seasons in the woods and fields in the vicinity of each abbey . The jealous peasants , not themselves having the right of hunting , and who continually saw Master Abbot passing on his hunting excursions , said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pray for the success of the litters and nests ( pro pullis et nidis ) , in order that game might always be abundant . " Illustration : Fig. 143.  --  " How Wolves may be caught with a Snare . "  --  Fac-simile of a Miniature in the Manuscript of Phoebus ( Fifteenth Century ) . If venery , as a regular science , dates from a comparatively recent period , it is not so with falconry , the first traces of which are lost in obscure antiquity . This kind of sport , which had become a most learned and complicated art , was the delight of the nobles of the Middle Ages and during the Renaissance period . It was in such esteem that a nobleman or his lady never appeared in public without a hawk on the wrist as a mark of dignity ( Fig. 147 ) . Even bishops and abbots entered the churches with their hunting birds , which they placed on the steps of the altar itself during the service . Illustration : Fig. 144.  --  " How Bears and other Beasts may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miniature in the Manuscript of Phoebus ( Fifteenth Century ) . The bird , like the sword , was a distinctive mark which was inseparable from the person of gentle birth , who frequently even went to war with the falcon on his wrist . During the battle he would make his squire hold the bird , which he replaced on his gauntlet when the fight was over . In fact , it was forbidden by the laws of chivalry for persons to give up their birds , even as a ransom , should they be made prisoners ; in which case they had to let the noble birds fly , in order that they might not share their captivity . The falcon to a certain degree partook of his owner 's nobility ; he was , moreover , considered a noble bird by the laws of falconry , as were all birds of prey which could be trained for purposes of sport . All other birds , without distinction , were declared ignoble , and no exception was made to this rule by the naturalists of the Middle Ages , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as the eagle and vulture . According to this capricious classification , they considered the sparrow-hawk , which was the smallest of the hunting-birds , to rank higher than the eagle . The nickname of this diminutive sporting bird was often applied to a country-gentleman , who , not being able to afford to keep falcons , used the sparrow-hawk to capture partridges and quail . Illustration : Fig. 145.  --  Olifant , or Hunting-horn , in Ivory ( Fourteenth Century ) .  --  From an Original existing in England . It was customary for gentlemen of all classes , whether sportsmen or not , to possess birds of some kind , " to keep up their rank , " as the saying then was . Only the richest nobles , however , were expected to keep a regular falconry , that is , a collection of birds suited for taking all kinds of game , such as the hare , the kite , the heron , &c.,; as each sport not only required special birds , but a particular and distinctive retinue and establishment .

Besides the cost of falcons , which was often very great ( for they were brought from the most distant countries , such as Sweden , Iceland , Turkey , and Morocco ) , their rearing and training involved considerable outlay , as may be more readily understood from the illustrations ( Figs. 148 to 155 ) , showing some of the principal details of the long and difficult education which had to be given them . To succeed in making the falcon obey the whistle , the voice , and the signs of the falconer was the highest aim of the art , and it was only by the exercise of much patience that the desired resuit was obtained . All birds of prey , when used for sport , received the generic name of falcon ; and amongst them were to be found the gerfalcon , the saker-hawk , the lanner , the merlin , and the sparrow-hawk . The male birds were smaller than the females , and were called tiercelet  --  this name , however , more particularly applied to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whereas the males of the above mentioned were called laneret , sacret , emouchet . Generally the male birds were used for partridges and quail , and the female birds for the hare , the heron , and crane . Oiseaux de poing , or hand-birds , was the name given to the gosshawk , common hawk , the gerfalcon , and the merlin , because they returned to the hand of their master after having pursued game . The lanner , sparrow-hawk , and saker-hawk were called oiseaux de leure , from the fact that it was always necessary to entice them back again . Illustration : Fig. 147.  --  A Noble of Provence ( Fifteenth Century ) .  --  Bonnart 's " Costumes from the Tenth to the Sixteenth Century . " The lure was an imitation of a bird , made of red cloth , that it might be more easily seen from a distance . It was stuffed so that the falcon could settle easily on it , and furnished with the wings of a partridge , duck , or heron , according to circumstances . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whistled as he did so , and the falcon , accustomed to find a piece of flesh attached to the lure , flew down in order to obtain it , and was thus secured . Illustration : Fig. 148.  --  King Modus teaching the Art of Falconry.  --  Fac-simile of a Miniature in the Manuscript of " Livre du Roy Modus " ( Fourteenth Century ) . The trainers of birds divided them into two kinds , namely , the niais or simple bird , which had been taken from the nest , and the wild bird ( hagard ) captured when full-grown . The education of the former was naturally very much the easier , but they succeeded in taming both classes , and even the most rebellious were at last subdued by depriving them of sleep , by keeping away the light from them , by coaxing them with the voice , by patting them , by giving them choice food , &c.; Regardless of his original habits , the bird was first accustomed to have no fear of men , horses , and dogs . He was afterwards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being allowed to fly a short distance , was recalled to the lure , where he always found a dainty bit of food . After he had been thus exercised for several months , a wounded partridge was let loose that he might catch it near the falconer , who immediately took it from him before he could tear it to pieces . When he appeared sufficiently tame , a quail or partridge , previously stripped of a few feathers so as to prevent it flying properly , was put in his way as before . If he was wanted for hunting hares , a stuffed hare was dragged before him , inside of which was a live chicken , whose head and liver was his reward if he did his work well . Then they tried him with a hare whose fore-leg was broken in order to ensure his being quickly caught . For the kite , they placed two hawks together on the same perch , so as to accustom them peaceably to live and hunt together , for if they fought with one another , as strange birds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the sport would of course have failed . At first a hen of the colour of a kite was given them to fight with . When they had mastered this , a real kite was used , which was tied to a string and his claws and beak were filed so as to prevent him from wounding the young untrained falcons . The moment they had secured their prey , they were called off it and given chickens ' flesh to eat on the lure . The same System was adopted for hunting the heron or crane ( Fig. 159 ) . Illustration : Fig. 149.  --  Falconers dressing their Birds .  --  Fac-simile of a Miniature in the Manuscript of " Livre du Roy Modus " ( Fourteenth Century ) . It will be seen that , in order to train birds , it was necessary for a large number of the various kinds of game to be kept on the premises , and for each branch of sport a regular establishment was required . In falconry , as in venery , great care was taken to secure that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had secured it , that is to say , it was most essential to teach it not to leave the game he was after in order to pursue another which might come in his way . To establish a falconry , therefore , not only was a very large poultry-yard required , but also a considerable staff of huntsmen , falconers , and whips , besides a number of horses and dogs of all sorts , which were either used for starting the game for the hawks , or for running it down when it was forced to ground by the birds . Illustration : Fig. 150.  --  Varlets of Falconry.  --  Fac-simile of a Miniature in the Manuscript of " Livre du Roy Modus " ( Fourteenth Century ) . A well-trained falcon was a bird of great value , and was the finest present that could be made to a lady , to a nobleman , or to the King himself , by any one who had received a favour . For instance , the King of France received six birds from the Abbot of St. Hubert as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the abbey . The King of Denmark sent him several as a gracious offering in the month of April ; the Grand Master of Malta in the month of May . At court , in those days , the reception of falcons either in public or in private was a great business , and the first trial of any new birds formed a topic of conversation among the courtiers for some time after . The arrival at court of a hawk-dealer from some distant country was also a great event . It is said that Louis XI . gave orders that watch should be kept night and day to seize any falcons consigned to the Duke of Brittany from Turkey . The plan succeeded , and the birds thus stolen were brought to the King , who exclaimed , " By our holy Lady of Clery ! what will the Duke Francis and his Bretons do ? They will be very angry at the good trick I have played them . " European princes vied with each other in extravagance as regards falconry ; but this was nothing in comparison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de Nevers , son of Philip the Bold , Duke of Burgundy , having been made prisoner at the battle of Nicopolis , was presented to the Sultan Bajazet , who showed him his hunting establishment consisting of seven thousand falconers and as many huntsmen . The Duke of Burgundy , on hearing this , sent twelve white hawks , which were very scarce birds , as a present to Bajazet . The Sultan was so pleased with them that he sent him back his son in exchange . Illustration : Fig. 151.  --  " How to train a New Falcon . "  --  Fac-simile of a Miniature in the Manuscript of " Livre du Roy Modus " ( Fourteenth Century ) . The " Livre du Roy Modus " gives the most minute and curious details on the noble science of hawking . For instance , it tells us that the nobility of the falcon was held in such respect that their utensils , trappings , or feeding-dishes were never used for other birds . The glove on which they were accustomed to alight was frequently elaborately embroidered in gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own species . In the private establishments the leather hoods , which were put on their heads to prevent them seeing , were embroidered with gold and pearls and surmounted with the feathers of birds of paradise . Each bird wore on his legs two little bells with his owner 's crest upon them ; the noise made by these was very distinct , and could be heard even when the bird was too high in the air to be seen , for they were not made to sound in unison ; they generally came from Italy , Milan especially being celebrated for their manufacture . Straps were also fastened to the falcon 's legs , by means of which he was attached to the perch ; at the end of this strap was a brass or gold ring with the owner 's name engraved upon it . In the royal establishments each ring bore on one side , " I belong to the king , " and on the other the name of the Grand Falconer . This was a necessary precaution , for the birds frequently strayed , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned . The ownership of a falcon was considered sacred , and , by an ancient barbaric law , the stealer of a falcon was condemned to a very curious punishment . The unfortunate thief was obliged to allow the falcon to eat six ounces of the flesh of his breast , unless he could pay a heavy fine to the owner and another to the king . Illustration : Fig. 152.  --  Falconers.  --  Fac-simile from a Miniature in Manuscript of the Thirteenth Century , which treats of the " Cour de Jaime , Roi de Maiorque . " A man thoroughly acquainted with the mode of training hawks was in high esteem everywhere . If he was a freeman , the nobles outbid each other as to who should secure his services ; if he was a serf , his master kept him as a rare treasure , only parted with him as a most magnificent present , or sold him for a considerable sum . Like the clever huntsman , a good falconer ( Fig. 156 ) was bound to be a man of varied information on natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the profession generally ran in families , and the son added his own experience to the lessons of his father . There were also special schools of venery and falconry , the most renowned being of course in the royal household . The office of Grand Falconer of France , the origin of which dates from 1250 , was one of the highest in the kingdom . The Marechal de Fleuranges says , in his curious " Memoirs "  --  " The Grand Falconer , whose salary is four thousand florins " ( the golden florin was worth then twelve or fifteen francs , and this amount must represent upwards of eighty thousand francs of present currency ) , " has fifty gentlemen under him , the salary of each being from five to six thousand livres . He has also fifty assistant falconers at two hundred livres each , all chosen by himself . His establishment consists of three hundred birds ; he has the right to hunt wherever he pleases in the kingdom ; he levies a tax on all bird-dealers , who are forbidden , under penalty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single bird in any town or at court without his sanction . " The Grand Falconer was chief at all the hunts or hawking meetings ; in public ceremonies he always appeared with the bird on his wrist , as an emblem of his rank ; and the King , whilst hawking , could not let loose his bird until after the Grand Falconer had slipped his . Illustration : Fig. 153.  --  " How to bathe a New Falcon . "  --  Fac-simile of a Miniature in the Manuscript of " Livre du Roy Modus " ( Fourteenth Century ) . Falconry , like venery , had a distinctive and professional vocabulary , which it was necessary for every one who joined in hawking to understand , unless he wished to be looked upon as an ignorant yeoman . " Flying the hawk is a royal pastime , " says the Jesuit Claude Binet , " and it is to talk royally to talk of the flight of birds . Every one speaks of it , but few speak well . Many speak so ignorantly as to excite pity among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bird instead of saying the talon , sometimes the talon instead of the claw , sometimes the claw instead of the nail " &c.; The fourteenth century was the great epoch of falconry . There were then so many nobles who hawked , that in the rooms of inns there were perches made under the large mantel-pieces on which to place the birds while the sportsmen were at dinner . Histories of the period are full of characteristic anecdotes , which prove the enthusiasm which was created by hawking in those who devoted themselves to it . Illustration : Fig. 154.  --  " How to make Young Hawks fly . "  --  Fac-simile of a Miniature in the Manuscript of " Livre du Roy Modus " ( Fourteenth Century ) . Emperors and kings were as keen as others for this kind of sport . As early as the tenth century the Emperor Henry I. had acquired the soubriquet of " the Bird-catcher , " from the fact of his giving much more attention to his birds than to his subjects . His example was followed by one of his successors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first falconer of his time . When his father , the Emperor Frederick Barbarossa ( Red-beard ) , died in the Holy Land , in 1189 , the Archdukes , Electors of the Empire , went out to meet the prince so as to proclaim him Emperor of Germany . They found him , surrounded by dogs , horses , and birds , ready to go hunting . " The day is fine , " he said ; " allow us to put off serious affairs until to-morrow . " Two centuries later we find at the court of France the same ardour for hawking and the same admiration for the performances of falcons . The Constable Bertrand du Guesclin gave two hawks to King Charles VI. ; and the Count de Tancarville , whilst witnessing a combat between these noble birds and a crane which had been powerful enough to keep two greyhounds at bay , exclaimed , " I would not give up the pleasure which I feel for a thousand florins ! " The court-poet , William Cretin , although he was Canon of the holy chapel of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good master Louis XII . He thus describes the pleasure he felt in seeing a heron succumb to the vigorous attack of the falcons :  --  " Qui auroit la mort aux dents , Il revivroit d'avour un tel passe-temps ! " ( " He who is about to die Would live again with such amusement . " ) Illustration : Fig. 155.  --  Lady setting out Hawking.  --  Fac-simile of a Miniature in the Manuscript of " Livre du Roy Modus " ( Fourteenth . Century ) . At a hunting party given by Louis XII . to the Archduke Maximilian , Mary of Burgundy , the Archduke 's wife , was killed by a fall from her horse . The King presented his best falcons to the Archduke with a view to divert his mind and to turn his attention from the sad event , and one of the historians tells us that the bereaved husband was soon consoled : " The partridges , herons , wild ducks , and quails which he was enabled to take on his journey home by means of the King 's present , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been in much esteem for centuries , at last became amenable to the same law which affects all great institutions , and , having reached the height of its glory , it was destined to decay . Although the art disappeared completely under Louis the Great , who only liked stag-kunting , and who , by drawing all the nobility to court , disorganized country life , no greater adept had ever been known than King Louis XIII . His first favourite and Grand Falconer was Albert de Luynes , whom he made prime minister and constable . Even in the Tuileries gardens , on his way to mass at the convent of the Feuillants , this prince amused himself by catching linnets and wrens with noisy magpies trained to pursue small birds . It was during this reign that some ingenious person discovered that the words LOUIS TREIZIEME , ROY DE FRANCE ET DE NAVARRE , exactly gave this anagram , ROY TRES-RARE , ESTIME DIEU DE LA FAUCONNERIE . It was also at this time that Charles d'Arcussia , the last author who wrote a technical work on falconry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the divine sport , compared the King 's birds to domestic angels , and the carnivorous birds which they destroyed he likened to the devil . From this he argued that the sport was like the angel Gabriel destroying the demon Asmodeus . He also added , in his dedication to the King , " As the nature of angels is above that of men , so is that of these birds above all other animals . " Illustration : Fig. 156.  --  Dress of the Falconer ( Thirteenth Century ) .  --  Sculpture of the Cathedral of Rouen . At that time certain religious or rather superstitious ceremonies were in use for blessing the water with which the falcons were sprinkled before hunting , and supplications were addressed to the eagles that they might not molest them . The following words were used : " I adjure you , O eagles ! by the true God , by the holy God , by the most blessed Virgin Mary , by the nine orders of angels , by the holy prophets , by the twelve apostles , &c....; to leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ molest them : in the name of the Father , and of the Son , and of the Holy Ghost . " It was at this time that , in order to recover a lost bird , the Sire de la Brizardiere , a professional necromancer , proposed beating the owner of the bird with birch-rods until he bled , and of making a charm with the blood , which was reckoned infallible . Illustration : Fig. 157.  --  Diseases of Dogs and their Cure .  --  Fac-simile of a Miniature in the Manuscript of Phoebus ( Fourteenth Century ) . Elzear Blaze expressed his astonishment that the ladies should not have used their influence to prevent falconry from falling into disuse . The chase , he considered , gave them an active part in an interesting and animated scene , which only required easy and graceful movements on their part , and to which no danger was attached . " The ladies knowing , " he says , " how to fly a bird , how to call him back , and how to encourage him with their voice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their wrist , and often even from having broken him in themselves , the honour of hunting belongs to them by right . Besides , it brings out to advantage their grace and dexterity as they gallop amongst the sportsmen , followed by their pages and varlets and a whole herd of horses and dogs . " The question of precedence and of superiority had , at every period , been pretty evenly balanced between venery and falconry , each having its own staunch supporters . Thus , in the " Livre du Roy Modus , " two ladies contend in verse ( for the subject was considered too exalted to be treated of in simple prose ) , the one for the superiority of the birds , the other for the superiority of dogs . Their controversy is at length terminated by a celebrated huntsman and falconer , who decides in favour of venery , for the somewhat remarkable reason that those who pursue it enjoy oral and ocular pleasure at the same time . In an ancient Treatise by Gace de la Vigne , in which the same question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( unnamed ) ends the dispute by ordering that in future they shall be termed pleasures of dogs and pleasures of birds , so that there may be no superiority on one side or the other ( Fig. 160 ) . The court-poet , William Cretin , who was in great renown during the reigns of Louis XII . and Francis I. , having asked two ladies to discuss the same subject in verse , does not hesitate , on the contrary , to place falconry above venery . Illustration : Fig. 158.  --  German Falconer , designed and engraved , in the Sixteenth Century , by J. Amman . It may fairly be asserted that venery and falconry have taken a position of some importance in history ; and in support of this theory it will suffice to mention a few facts borrowed from the annals of the chase . The King of Navarre , Charles the Bad , had sworn to be faithful to the alliance made between himself and King Edward III . of England ; but the English troops having been beaten by Du Guesclin , Charles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the side of the King of France . In order not to appear to break his oath , he managed to be taken prisoner by the French whilst out hunting , and thus he sacrificed his honour to his personal interests . It was also due to a hunting party that Henry III. , another King of Navarre , who was afterwards Henry IV. , escaped from Paris , on the 3rd February , 1576 , and fled to Senlis , where his friends of the Reformed religion came to join him . Illustration : Fig. 159.  --  Heron-hawking.  --  Fac-simile of a Miniature in the Manuscript of the " Livre du Roy Modus " ( Fourteenth Century ) . Hunting formed a principal entertainment when public festivals were celebrated , and it was frequently accompanied with great magnificence . At the entry of Isabel of Bavaria into Paris , a sort of stag hunt was performed , when " the streets , " according to a popular story of the time , " were full to profusion of hares , rabbits , and goslings . " Again , at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ representation of a doe hunt took place near the fountain St. Innocent ; " after which the queen received a present of a magnificent stag , made of confectionery , and having the royal arms hung round its neck . " At the memorable festival given at Lille , in 1453 , by the Duke of Burgundy , a very curious performance took place . " At one end of the table , " says the historian Mathieu de Coucy , " a heron was started , which was hunted as if by falconers and sportsmen ; and presently from the other end of the table a falcon was slipped , which hovered over the heron . In a few minutes another falcon was started from the other side of the table , which attacked the heron so fiercely that he brought him down in the middle of the hall . After the performance was over and the heron was killed , it was served up at the dinner-table . " Illustration : Fig. 160.  --  Sport with Dogs .  --  " How the Wild Boar is hunted by means of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manuscript of the " Livre du Roy Modus " ( Fourteenth Century ) . We shall conclude this chapter with a few words on bird-fowling , a kind of sport which was almost disdained in the Middle Ages . The anonymous author of the " Livre du Roy Modus " called it , in the fourteenth century , the pastime of the poor , " because the poor , who can neither keep hounds nor falcons to hunt or to fly , take much pleasure in it , particularly as it serves at the same time as a means of subsistence to many of them . " In this book , which was for a long time the authority in matters of sport generally , we find that nearly all the methods and contrivances now employed for bird-fowling were known and in use in the Middle Ages , in addition to some which have since fallen into disuse . We accordingly read in the " Roy Modus " a description of the drag-net , the mirror , the screech-owl , the bird-pipe ( Fig. 161 ) , the traps , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now well understood . At that time , when falcons were so much required , it was necessary that people should be employed to catch them when young ; and the author of this book speaks of nets of various sorts , and the pronged piece of wood in the middle of which a screech-owl or some other bird was placed in order to attract the falcons ( Fig. 162 ) . Illustration : Fig. 161.  --  Bird-piping.  --  " The Manner of Catching Birds by piping . "  --  Fac-simile of Miniature in the Manuscript of the " Livre du Roy Modus " ( Fourteenth Century ) . Two methods were in use in those days for catching the woodcook and pheasant , which deserve to be mentioned . " The pheasants , " says " King Modus , " " are of such a nature that the male bird can not bear the company of another . " Taking advantage of this weakness , the plan of placing a mirror , which balanced a sort of wicker cage or coop , was adopted . The pheasant , thinking he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass and brought down the coop , in which he had leisure to reflect on his jealousy ( Fig. 163 ) . Woodcocks , which are , says the author , " the most silly birds , " were caught in this way . The bird-fowler was covered from head to foot with clothes of the colour of dead leaves , only having two little holes for his eyes . When he saw one he knelt down noiselessly , and supported his arms on two sticks , so as to keep perfectly still . When the bird was not looking towards him he cautiously approached it on his knees , holding in his hands two little dry sticks covered with red cloth , which he gently waved so as to divert the bird 's attention from himself . In this way he gradually got near enough to pass a noose , which he kept ready at the end of a stick , round the bird 's neck ( Fig. 164 ) . However ingenious these tricks may appear , they are eclipsed by one we find recorded in the " Ixeuticon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de Barga , written two centuries later . In order to catch a large number of starlings , this author assures us , it is only necessary to have two or three in a cage , and , when a flight of these birds is seen passing , to liberate them with a very long twine attached to their claws . The twine must be covered with bird-lime , and , as the released birds instantly join their friends , all those they come near get glued to the twine and fall together to the ground . Illustration : Fig. 162.  --  Bird-catching with a Machine like a Long Arm .  --  Fac-simile of Miniature in the Manuscript of the " Livre du Roy Modus " ( Fourteenth Century ) . As at the present time , the object of bird-fowling was twofold , namely , to procure game for food and to capture birds to be kept either for their voice or for fancy as pets . The trade in the latter was so important , at least in Paris , that the bird-catchers formed a numerous corporation having its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covered on each side with houses and shops occupied by goldsmiths and money-changers ) was the place where these people carried on their trade ; and they had the privilege of hanging their cages against the houses , even without the sanction of the proprietors . This curious right was granted to them by Charles VI . in 1402 , in return for which they were bound to " provide four hundred birds " whenever a king was crowned , " and an equal number when the queen made her first entry into her good town of Paris . " The goldsmiths and money-changers , however , finding that this became a nuisance , and that it injured their trade , tried to get it abolished . They applied to the authorities to protect their rights , urging that the approaches to their shops , the rents of which they paid regularly , were continually obstructed by a crowd of purchasers and dealers in birds . The case was brought several times before parliament , which only confirmed the orders of the kings of France and the ancient privileges of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarrel became so bitter that the goldsmiths and changers took to " throwing down the cages and birds and trampling them under foot , " and even assaulted and openly ill-treated the poor bird-dealers . But a degree of parliament again justified the sale of birds on the Pont an Change , by condemning the ring-leader , Illustration : Fig. 163.  --  Pheasant Fowling.  --  " Showing how to catch Pheasants. "  --  Fac-simile of a Miniature in the Manuscript of the " Livre du Roy Modus " ( Fourteenth Century ) . Pierre Filacier , the master goldsmith who had commenced the proceedings against the bird-catchers , to pay a double fine , namely , twenty crowns to the plaintiffs and ten to the King . Illustration : Fig. 164.  --  The Mode of catching a Woodcock.  --  Fac-simile of a Miniature in the Manuscript of the " Livre du Roy Modus " ( Fourteenth Century ) . It is satisfactory to observe that at that period measures were taken to preserve nests and to prevent bird-fowling from the 15th of March to the 15th of August . Besides this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the King himself to give persons the right of catching birds on the King 's domains . Before any one could sell birds it was required for him to have been received as a master bird-catcher . The recognised bird-catchers , therefore , had no opponents except dealers from other countries , who brought canary-birds , parrots , and other foreign specimens into Paris . These dealers were , however , obliged to conform to strict rules . They were required on their arrival to exhibit their birds from ten to twelve o'clock on the marble stone in the palace yard on the days when parliament sat , in order that the masters and governors of the King 's aviary , and , after them , the presidents and councillors , might have the first choice before other people of anything they wished to buy . They were , besides , bound to part the male and female birds in separate cages with tickets on them , so that purchasers might not be deceived ; and , in case of dispute on this point , some sworn inspectors were appointed as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had achieved over the goldsmiths of the Pont an Change , the bird-dealers of Paris attempted to forbid any bourgeois of the town from breeding canaries or any sort of cage birds . The bourgeois resented this , and brought their case before the Marshals of France . They urged that it was easy for them to breed canaries , and it was also a pleasure for their wives and daughters to teach them , whereas those bought on the Pont an Change were old and difficult to educate . This appeal was favourably received , and an order from the tribunal of the Marshals of France permitted the bourgeois to breed canaries , but it forbade the sale of them , which it was considered would interfere with the trade of the master-fowlers of the town , faubourgs , and suburbs of Paris .

People of all countries and at all periods have been fond of public amusements , and have indulged in games and pastimes with a view to make time pass agreeably . These amusements have continually varied , according to the character of each nation , and according to the capricious changes of fashion . Since the learned antiquarian , J. Meursius , has devoted a large volume to describing the games of the ancient Greeks ( " De Ludis Graecorum " ) , and Rabelais has collected a list of two hundred and twenty games which were in fashion at different times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be easily understood that a description of all the games and pastimes which have ever been in use by different nations , and particularly by the French , would form an encyclopaedia of some size . We shall give a rapid sketch of the different kinds of games and pastimes which were most in fashion during the Middle Ages and to the end of the sixteenth century  --  omitting , however , the religious festivals , which belong to a different category ; the public festivals , which will come under the chapter on Ceremonials ; the tournaments and tilting matches and other sports of warriors , which belong to Chivalry ; and , lastly , the scenic and literary representations , which specially belong to the history of the stage . We shall , therefore , limit ourselves here to giving in a condensed form a few historical details of certain court amusements , and a short description of the games of skill and of chance , and also of dancing . The Romans , especially during the times of the emperors , had a passionate love for performances in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ races , horse races , foot races , combats of animals , and feats of strength and agility . The daily life of the Roman people may be summed up as consisting of taking their food and enjoying games in the circus ( panem et circenses ) . A taste for similar amusements was common to the Gauls as well as to the whole Roman Empire ; and , were historians silent on the subject , we need no further information than that which is to be gathered from the ruins of the numerous amphitheatres , which are to be found at every centre of Roman occupation . The circus disappeared on the establishment of the Christian religion , for the bishops condemned it as a profane and sanguinary vestige of Paganism , and , no doubt , this led to the cessation of combats between man and beast . They continued , however , to pit wild or savage animals against one another , and to train dogs to fight with lions , tigers , bears , and bulls ; otherwise it would be difficult to explain the restoration by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arenas at Paris and Soissons . The remains of one of these circuses was not long ago discovered in Paris whilst they were engaged in laying the foundations for a new street , on the west side of the hill of St. Genevieve , a short distance from the old palace of the Caesars , known by the name of the Thermes of Julian . Gregory of Tours states that Chilperic revived the ancient games of the circus , but that Gaul had ceased to be famous for good athletes and race-horses , although animal combats continued to take place for the amusement of the kings . One day King Pepin halted , with the principal officers of his army , at the Abbey of Ferrieres , and witnessed a fight between a lion and a bull . The bull was of enormous size and extraordinary strength , but nevertheless the lion overcame him ; whereupon Pepin , who was surnamed the Short , turned to his officers , who used to joke him about his short stature , and said to them , " Make the lion loose his hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one dared to undertake so perilous a task , and some said aloud that the man who would measure his strength with a lion must be mad . Upon this , Pepin sprang into the arena sword in hand , and with two blows cut off the heads of the lion and the bull . " What do you think of that ? " he said to his astonished officers . " Am I not fit to be your master ? Size can not compare with courage . Remember what little David did to the Giant Goliath . " Eight hundred years later there were occasional animal combats at the court of Francis I. " A fine lady , " says Brantome , " went to see the King 's lions , in company with a gentleman who much admired her . She suddenly let her glove drop , and it fell into the lions ' den . ' I beg of you , ' she said , in the calmest way , to her admirer , ' to go amongst the lions and bring me back my glove . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawing his sword , went into the den and gave himself up silently to death to please the lady . The lions did not move , and he was able to leave their den without a scratch and return the lady her missing glove . ' Here is your glove , madam , ' he coldly said to her who evidently valued his life at so small a price ; ' see if you can find any one else who would do the same as I have done for you . ' So saying he left her , and never afterwards looked at or even spoke to her . " It has been imagined that the kings of France only kept lions as living symbols of royalty . In 1333 Philippe de Valois bought a barn in the Rue Froidmantel , near the Chateau du Louvre , where he established a menagerie for his lions , bears , leopards , and other wild beasts . This royal menagerie still existed in the reigns of Charles VIII . and Francis I. Charles V. and his successors had an establishment of lions in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the very spot which was subsequently the site of the Rue des Lions St. Paul . These wild beasts were sometimes employed in the combats , and were pitted against bulls and dogs in the presence of the King and his court . It was after one of these combats that Charles IX. , excited by the sanguinary spectacle , wished to enter the arena alone in order to attack a lion which had torn some of his best dogs to pieces , and it was only with great difficulty that the audacious sovereign was dissuaded from his foolish purpose . Henry III . had no disposition to imitate his brother 's example ; for dreaming one night that his lions were devouring him , he had them all killed the next day . The love for hunting wild animals , such as the wolf , bear , and boar ( see chapter on Hunting ) , from an early date took the place of the animal combats as far as the court and the nobles were concerned . The people were therefore deprived of the spectacle of the combats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they could not resort to the alternative of the chase , they treated themselves to a feeble imitation of the games of the circus in such amusements as setting dogs to worry old horses or donkeys , &c.; ( Fig. 166 ) . Bull-fights , nevertheless , continued in the southern provinces of France , as also in Spain . At village feasts not only did wrestling matches take place , but also queer kinds of combats with sticks or birch boughs . Two men , blindfolded , each armed with a stick , and holding in his hand a rope fastened to a stake , entered the arena , and went round and round trying to strike at a fat goose or a pig which was also let loose with them . It can easily be imagined that the greater number of the blows fell like hail on one or other of the principal actors in this blind combat , amidst shouts of laughter from the spectators . Illustration : Fig. 166.  --  Fight between a Horse and Dogs .  --  Fac-simile of a Manuscript in the British Museum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than these blind encounters ; even kings took part at these burlesque representations . At Mid-Lent annually they attended with their court at the Quinze-Vingts , in Paris , in order to see blindfold persons , armed from head to foot , fighting with a lance or stick . This amusement was quite sufficient to attract all Paris . In 1425 , on the last day of August , the inhabitants of the capital crowded their windows to witness the procession of four blind men , clothed in full armour , like knights going to a tournament , and preceded by two men , one playing the hautbois and the other bearing a banner on which a pig was painted . These four champions on the next day attacked a pig , which was to become the property of the one who killed it . The lists were situated in the court of the Hotel d'Armagnac , the present site of the Palais Royal . A great crowd attended the encounter . The blind men , armed with all sorts of weapons , belaboured each other so furiously that the game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had they not been separated and made to divide the pig which they had all so well earned .

The people of the Middle Ages had an insatiable love of sight-seeing ; they came great distances , from all parts , to witness any amusing exhibition . They would suffer any amount of privation or fatigue to indulge this feeling , and they gave themselves up to it so heartily that it became a solace to them in their greatest sorrows , and they laughed with that hearty laugh which may be said to be one of their natural characteristics . In all public processions in the open air the crowd ( or rather , as we might say , the Cockneys of Paris ) , in their anxiety to see everything that was to be seen , would frequently obstruct all the public avenues , and so prevent the procession from passing along . In consequence of this the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sticks amongst the sergeants , who used them freely on the shoulders of the most obstinate sight-seers ( see chapter on Ceremonials ) . There was no religious procession , no parish fair , no municipal feast , and no parade or review of troops , which did not bring together crowds of people , whose ears and eyes were wide open , if only to hear the sound of the trumpet , or to see a " dog rush past with a frying-pan tied to his tail . " Illustration : Fig. 168.  --  Free Distribution of Bread , Meat , and Wine to the People .  --  Reduced Copy of a Woodcut of the Solemn Entry of Charles V and Pope Clement VII into Bologna , in 1530 . This curiosity of the French was particularly exhibited when the kings of the first royal dynasty held their Champs de Mars , the kings of the second dynasty their Cours Plenieres , and the kings of the third dynasty their Cours Couronnees . In these assemblies , where the King gathered together all his principal vassals once or twice a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to strengthen his power by ensuring their feudal services , large quantities of food and fermented liquors were publicly distributed among the people ( Fig. 168 ) . The populace were always most enthusiastic spectators of military displays , of court ceremonies , and , above all , of the various amusements which royalty provided for them at great cost in those days : and it was on these state occasions that jugglers , tumblers , and minstrels displayed their talents . The Champ de Mars was one of the principal fetes of the year , and was held sometimes in the centre of some large town , sometimes in a royal domain , and sometimes in the open country . Bishop Gregory of Tours describes one which was given in his diocese during the reign of Chilperic , at the Easter festivals , at which we may be sure that the games of the circus , re-established by Chilperic , excited the greatest interest . Charlemagne also held Champs de Mars , but called them Cours Royales , at which he appeared dressed in cloth of gold studded all over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ King Robert celebrated court days with the same magnificence , and the people were admitted to the palace during the royal banquet to witness the King sitting amongst his great officers of state . The Cours Plenieres , which were always held at Christmas , Twelfth-day , Easter , and on the day of Pentecost , were not less brilliant during the reigns of Robert 's successors . Louis IX . himself , notwithstanding his natural shyness and his taste for simplicity , was noted for the display he made on state occasions . In 1350 , Philippe de Valois wore his crown at the Cours Plenieres , and from that time they were called Cours Couronnees . The kings of jugglers were the privileged performers , and their feats and the other amusements , which continued on each occasion for several days , were provided for at the sovereign 's sole expense . Illustration : Fig. 169.  --  Feats in Balancing .  --  Fac-simile of a Miniature in a Manuscript in the Bodleian Library at Oxford ( Thirteenth Century ) . These kings of jugglers exercised a supreme authority over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this jovial fraternity . It must not be imagined that these jugglers merely recited snatches from tales and fables in rhyme ; this was the least of their talents . The cleverest of them played all sorts of musical instruments , sung songs , and repeated by heart a multitude of stories , after the example of their reputed forefather , King Borgabed , or Bedabie , who , according to these troubadours , was King of Great Britain at the time that Alexander the Great was King of Macedonia . The jugglers of a lower order especially excelled in tumbling and in tricks of legerdemain ( Figs. 169 and 170 ) . They threw wonderful somersaults , they leaped through hoops placed at certain distances from one another , they played with knives , slings , baskets , brass balls , and earthenware plates , and they walked on their hands with their feet in the air or with their heads turned downwards so as to look through their legs backwards . These acrobatic feats were even practised by women . According to a legend , the daughter of Herodias @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Cathedral of Rouen we find this Jewish dancer turning somersaults before Herod , so as to fascinate him , and thus obtain the decapitation of John the Baptist . Illustration : Fig. 170.  --  Sword-dance to the sound of the Bagpipe .  --  Fac-simile of a Manuscript in the British Museum ( Fourteenth Century ) . " The jugglers , " adds M. de Labedolliere , in his clever work on " The Private Life of the French , " " often led about bears , monkeys , and other animals , which they taught to dance or to fight ( Figs. 171 and 172 ) . A manuscript in the National Library represents a banquet , and around the table , so as to amuse the guests , performances of animals are going on , such as monkeys riding on horseback , a bear feigning to be dead , a goat playing the harp , and dogs walking on their hind legs . " We find the same grotesque figures on sculptures , on the capitals of churches , on the illuminated margins of manuscripts of theology , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the associates of painters and illuminators , even if they themselves were not the writers and illuminators of the manuscripts . " Jugglery , " M. de Labedolliere goes on to say , " at that time embraced poetry , music , dancing , sleight of hand , conjuring , wrestling , boxing , and the training of animals . Its humblest practitioners were the mimics or grimacers , in many-coloured garments , and brazen-faced mountebanks , who provoked laughter at the expense of decency . " Illustration : Fig. 171.  --  Jugglers exhibiting Monkeys and Bears .  --  Fac-simile of a Manuscript in the British Museum ( Thirteenth Century ) . At first , and down to the thirteenth century , the profession of a juggler was a most lucrative one . There was no public or private feast of any importance without the profession being represented . Their mimicry and acrobatic feats were less thought of than their long poems or lays of wars and adventures , which they recited in doggerel rhyme to the accompaniment of a stringed instrument . The doors of the chateaux were always open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them at all feasts . They were the principal attraction at the Cours Plenieres , and , according to the testimony of one of their poets , they frequently retired from business loaded with presents , such as riding-horses , carriage-horses , jewels , cloaks , fur robes , clothing of violet or scarlet cloth , and , above all , with large sums of money . They loved to recall with pride the heroic memory of one of their own calling , the brave Norman , Taillefer , who , before the battle of Hastings , advanced alone on horseback between the two armies about to commence the engagement , and drew off the attention of the English by singing them the song of Roland . He then began juggling , and taking his lance by the hilt , he threw it into the air and caught it by the point as it fell ; then , drawing his sword , he spun it several times over his head , and caught it in a similar way as it fell . After these skilful exercises , during which the enemy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the English ranks , and caused great havoc before he fell , positively riddled with wounds . Notwithstanding this noble instance , not to belie the old proverb , jugglers were never received into the order of knighthood . They were , after a time , as much abused as they had before been extolled . Their licentious lives reflected itself in their obscene language . Their pantomimes , like their songs , showed that they were the votaries of the lowest vices . The lower orders laughed at their coarseness , and were amused at their juggleries ; but the nobility were disgusted with them , and they were absolutely excluded from the presence of ladies and girls in the chateaux and houses of the bourgeoisie . We see in the tale of " Le Jugleor " that they acquired ill fame everywhere , inasmuch as they were addicted to every sort of vice . The clergy , and St. Bernard especially , denounced them and held them up to public contempt . St. Bernard spoke thus of them in one of his sermons written in the middle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will soon enough possess a wife whose name is Poverty . If it happens that the tricks of jugglers are forced upon your notice , endeavour to avoid them , and think of other things . The tricks of jugglers never please God . " Illustration : Fig. 172.  --  Equestrian Performances .  --  Fac-simile of a Miniature in an English Manuscript of the Thirteenth Century . From this remark we may understand their fall as well as the disrepute in which they were held at that time , and we are not surprised to find in an old edition of the " Memoires du Sire de Joinville " this passage , which is , perhaps , an interpolation from a contemporary document : " St. Louis drove from his kingdom all tumblers and players of sleight of hand , through whom many evil habits and tastes had become engendered in the people . " A troubadour 's story of this period shows that the jugglers wandered about the country with their trained animals nearly starved ; they were half naked , and were often without anything on their heads , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The lower orders welcomed them , and continued to admire and idolize them for their clever tricks ( Fig. 173 ) , but the bourgeois class , following the example of the nobility , turned their backs upon them . In 1345 Guillaume de Gourmont , Provost of Paris , forbad their singing or relating obscene stories , under penalty of fine and imprisonment .

Having been associated together as a confraternity since 1331 , they lived huddled together in one street of Paris , which took the name of Rue des Jougleurs . It was at this period that the Church and Hospital of St. Julian were founded through the exertions of Jacques Goure , a native of Pistoia , and of Huet le Lorrain , who were both jugglers . The newly formed brotherhood at once undertook to subscribe to this good work , and each member did so according to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildings was sixty livres , and they were both erected in the Rue St. Martin , and placed under the protection of St. Julian the Martyr . The chapel was consecrated on the last Sunday in September , 1335 , and on the front of it there were three figures , one representing a troubadour , one a minstrel , and one a juggler , each with his various instruments . The bad repute into which jugglers had fallen did not prevent the kings of France from attaching buffoons , or fools , as they were generally called , to their households , who were often more or less deformed dwarfs , and who , to all intents and purposes , were jugglers . They were allowed to indulge in every sort of impertinence and waggery in order to excite the risibility of their masters ( Figs. 174 and 175 ) . These buffoons or fools were an institution at court until the time of Louis XIV. , and several , such as Caillette , Triboulet , and Brusquet , are better known in history than many of the statesmen and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Dance of Fools .  --  Fac-simile of a Miniature in Manuscript of the Thirteenth Century in the Bodleian Library of Oxford . At the end of the fourteenth century the brotherhood of jugglers divided itself into two distinct classes , the jugglers proper and the tumblers . The former continued to recite serious or amusing poetry , to sing love-songs , to play comic interludes , either singly or in concert , in the streets or in the houses , accompanying themselves or being accompanied by all sorts of musical instruments . The tumblers , on the other hand , devoted themselves exclusively to feats of agility or of skill , the exhibition of trained animals , the making of comic grimaces , and tight-rope dancing . Illustration : A Court-Fool , of the 15th Century . Fac-simile of a miniature from a ms. in the Bibl. de l'Arsenal , Th. lat. , no 125 . The art of rope dancing is very ancient ; it was patronised by the Franks , who looked upon it as a marvellous effort of human genius . The most remarkable rope-dancers of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art came originally from the East , although they afterwards trained pupils in the countries through which they passed , recruiting themselves chiefly from the mixed tribe of jugglers . According to a document quoted by the learned Foncemagne , rope-dancers appeared as early as 1327 at the entertainments given at state banquets by the kings of France . But long before that time they are mentioned in the poems of troubadours as the necessary auxiliaries of any feast given by the nobility , or even by the monasteries . From the fourteenth to the end of the sixteenth century they were never absent from any public ceremonial , and it was at the state entries of kings and queens , princes and princesses , that they were especially called upon to display their talents . Illustration : Fig. 175.  --  Court Fool .  --  Fac-simile of a Woodcut in the " Cosmographie Universelle " of Munster : folio ( Basle , 1552 ) . One of the most extraordinary examples of the daring of these tumblers is to be found in the records of the entry of Queen Isabel of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ceremonials ) ; and , indeed , all the chronicles of the fifteenth century are full of anecdotes of their doings . Mathieu de Coucy , who wrote a history of the time of Charles VII. , relates some very curious details respecting a show which took place at Milan , and which astonished the whole of Europe :  --  " The Duke of Milan ordered a rope to be stretched across his palace , about one hundred and fifty feet from the ground , and of equal length . On to this a Portuguese mounted , walked straight along , going backwards and forwards , and dancing to the sound of the tambourine . He also hung from the rope with his head downwards , and went through all sorts of tricks . The ladies who were looking on could not help hiding their eyes in their handkerchiefs , from fear lest they should see him overbalance and fall and kill himself . " The chronicler of Charles XII. , Jean d'Arton , tells us of a not less remarkable feat , performed on the occasion of the obsequies of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the month of October , 1503 , in the presence of the king and the court . " Amongst other performances was that of a German tight-rope dancer , named Georges Menustre , a very young man , who had a thick rope stretched across from the highest part of the tower of the Castle of Macon to the windows of the steeple of the Church of the Jacobites . The height of this from the ground was twenty-five fathoms , and the distance from the castle to the steeple some two hundred and fifty paces . On two evenings in succession he walked along this rope , and on the second occasion when he started from the tower of the castle his feat was witnessed by the king and upwards of thirty thousand persons . He performed all sorts of graceful tricks , such as dancing grotesque dances to music and hanging to the rope by his feet and by his teeth . Although so strange and marvellous , these feats were nevertheless actually performed , unless human sight had been deceived by magic . A female dancer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throwing somersaults , and performing graceful Moorish and other remarkable and peculiar dances . " Such was their manner of celebrating a funeral . In the sixteenth century these dancers and tumblers became so numerous that they were to be met with everywhere , in the provinces as well as in the towns . Many of them were Bohemians or Zingari . They travelled in companies , sometimes on foot , sometimes on horseback , and sometimes with some sort of a conveyance containing the accessories of their craft and a travelling theatre . But people began to tire of these sorts of entertainments , the more so as they were required to pay for them , and they naturally preferred the public rejoicings , which cost them nothing . They were particularly fond of illuminations and fireworks , which are of much later origin than the invention of gunpowder ; although the Saracens , at the time of the Crusades , used a Greek fire for illuminations , which considerably alarmed the Crusaders when they first witnessed its effects . Regular fireworks appear to have been invented in Italy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , and where the inhabitants are as enthusiastic as ever for this sort of amusement , and consider it , in fact , inseparable from every religious , private , or public festival . This Italian invention was first introduced into the Low Countries by the Spaniards , where it found many admirers , and it made its appearance in France with the Italian artists who established themselves in that country in the reigns of Charles VIII. , Louis XII. , and Francis I. Fireworks could not fail to be attractive at the Court of the Valois , to which Catherine de Medicis had introduced the manners and customs of Italy . The French , who up to that time had only been accustomed to the illuminations of St. John 's Day and of the first Sunday in Lent , received those fireworks with great enthusiasm , and they soon became a regular part of the programme for public festivals ( Fig. 176 ) .

We have hitherto only described the sports engaged in for the amusement of the spectators ; we have still to describe those in which the actors took greater pleasure than even the spectators themselves . These were specially the games of strength and skill as well as dancing , with a notice of which we shall conclude this chapter . There were , besides , the various games of chance and the games of fun and humour . Most of the bourgeois and the villagers played a variety of games of agility , many of which have descended to our times , and are still to be found at our schools and colleges . Wrestling , running races , the game of bars , high and wide jumping , leap-frog , blind-man 's buff , games of ball of all sorts , gymnastics , and all exercises which strengthened the body or added to the suppleness of the limbs , were long in use among the youth of the nobility ( Figs. 177 and 178 ) . The Lord of Fleuranges , in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numerous exercises to which he devoted himself during his childhood and youth , and which were then looked upon as a necessary part of the education of chivalry . The nobles in this way acquired a taste for physical exercises , and took naturally to combats , tournaments , and hunting , and subsequently their services in the battle-field gave them plenty of opportunities to gratify the taste thus developed in them . These were not , however , sufficient for their insatiable activity ; when they could not do anything else , they played at tennis and such games at all hours of the day ; and these pastimes had so much attraction for nobles of all ages that they not unfrequently sacrificed their health in consequence of overtaxing their strength . In 1506 the King of Castile , Philippe le Beau , died of pleurisy , from a severe cold which he caught while playing tennis .

Tennis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towns , and tennis-courts were built in all parts , of such spacious proportions and so well adapted for spectators , that they were often converted into theatres . Their game of billiards resembled the modern one only in name , for it was played on a level piece of ground with wooden balls which were struck with hooked sticks and mallets . It was in great repute in the fourteenth century , for in 1396 Marshal de Boucicault , who was considered one of the best players of his time , won at it six hundred francs ( or more than twenty-eight thousand francs of present currency ) . At the beginning of the following century the Duke Louis d'Orleans ordered billes et billars to be bought for the sum of eleven sols six deniers tournois ( about fifteen francs of our money ) , that he might amuse himself with them . There were several games of the same sort , which were not less popular . Skittles ; la Soule or Soulette , which consisted of a large ball of hay covered over with leather , the possession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ players ; Football ; open Tennis ; Shuttlecock , &c.; It was Charles V. who first thought of giving a more serious and useful character to the games of the people , and who , in a celebrated edict forbidding games of chance , encouraged the establishment of companies of archers and bowmen . These companies , to which was subsequently added that of the arquebusiers , outlived political revolutions , and are still extant , especially in the northern provinces of France . Illustration : Fig. 178.  --  The Spring-board.  --  Fac-simile of a Woodcut in " Exercises in Leaping and Vaulting , " by A. Tuccaro : 4to ( Paris , 1599 ) . At all times and in all countries the games of chance were the most popular , although they were forbidden both by ecclesiastical and royal authority . New laws were continually being enacted against them , and especially against those in which dice were used , though with little avail . " Dice shall not be made in the kingdom , " says the law of 1256 ; and " those who are discovered using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be looked upon as suspicions characters . " A law of 1291 repeats , " That games with dice be forbidden . " Nevertheless , though these prohibitions were frequently renewed , people continued to disregard them and to lose much money at such games . The law of 1396 is aimed particularly against loaded dice , which must have been contemporary with the origin of dice themselves , for no games ever gave rise to a greater amount of roguery than those of this description . They were , however , publicly sold in spite of all the laws to the contrary ; for , in the " Dit du Mercier , " the dealer offers his merchandise thus :  --  " J'ay dez de plus , j'ay dez de moins , De Paris , de Chartres , de Rains . " ( " I have heavy dice , I have light dice , From Paris , from Chartres , and from Rains . " ) It has been said that the game of dice was at first called the game of God , because the regulation of lottery was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purely imaginary . What appears more likely is , that dice were first forbidden by the Church , and then by the civil authorities , on account of the fearful oaths which were so apt to be uttered by those players who had a run of ill luck . Nothing was commoner than for people to ruin themselves at this game . The poems of troubadours are full of imprecations against the fatal chance of dice ; many troubadours , such as Guillaume Magret and Gaucelm Faydit , lost their fortunes at it , and their lives in consequence . Rutebeuf exclaims , in one of his satires , " Dice rob me of all my clothes , dice kill me , dice watch me , dice track me , dice attack me , and dice defy me . " The blasphemies of the gamblers did not always remain unpunished . " Philip Augustus , " says Bigord , in his Latin history of this king , " carried his aversion for oaths to such an extent , that if any one , whether knight or of any other rank , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sovereign , even by mistake , he was ordered to be immediately thrown into the river . " Louis XII. , who was somewhat less severe , contented himself with having a hole bored with a hot iron through the blasphemer 's tongue .

The work " On the Manner of playing with Dice , " has handed down to us the technical terms used in these games , which varied as much in practice as in name . They sometimes played with three dice , sometimes with six ; different games were //
