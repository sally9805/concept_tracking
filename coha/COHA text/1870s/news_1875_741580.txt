txt Bonanza , " reaches San Francisco , the people of that lively city will be better able than ever to appreciate its ups and downs , and its strange mutations of fortune , as shown on the mimic stage . The collapse in mining stocks is unmistakable . The bonanza excitement calminated about the beginning of the year . On the 4th of January , the three leading mines in the region of the bonanza sold as follows : California at $780 per share , Consolidated Virginia at $715 , and Ophir at $315 . From these dizzy altitudes , which had been reached by rapid flights , the stocks fell slowly until Feb. 25 , when they sold as follows : California at $53 , Consolidated . Virginia at $430 , and Ophir at $75 . There is a world of trouble bidden behind these dry figures . Men who were reveling in wealth with California at $780 are beggars when it touches $53 . There is a strong probability that many did not wait for the stock to fall upon them ; they were sold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether any of these stocks hare touched bottom ; but it does scorn as if a property which commanded such a wide range of prices in a few weeks as that represented in this stock list , ought to have its lower limit somewhere in the region of the small figures above quoted , unless the bottom of things is to drop out altogether . A tuintle like this is so like a catastrophe that it would not seem worth while for the hapless owners to bother about the nominal prices at the foot of the precipice . Men who bought in when things were at their highest , and held on with borrowed motley , are as poor as that speculator who declared that if steam-boats were selling at a dollar and a half apiece he could not buy a belaying-pin . Of course , there are some shrewd people who sold early , and thereafter kept their hands out of the business . The newspapers talk of one self-distrustful man who , having " made his pile , " put his profits into hard cash , and actually fled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be tempted to go into the whirlpool again and lose what he had gained . When this wise person , slow voyaging up the Nile , reads under the African sun the story of the misfortunes of his neighbors , he will hug himself because he knew himself so well and . got safely away with the spoils of fortune . Others there were , probably , who did not feel obliged to run from the gambling board , but stood and looked at the wreck of other men 's fortunes with the calm fortitude of a Christian who holds nothing less fleeting in value than golden double-eagles and Government bonds . But the mass of buyers bought bonanza stocks " on a margin " ? that is to say , they borrowed money on the stocks which nominally stood in their names . When the fall began they borrowed more to keep their " margin " good . Still the decline kept on , and they were sold out at ruinous figures . Their fancied wealth disappeared like a castle of mist before the sun . The very small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few thousands from a few hundreds  --  were not so likely to be included in the crash . They were less able to borrow and more likely to sell early . Unless they were smitten of some wild folly , they were out of the way when the collapse came . But the heavier gamblers  --  the men of small means , great expectations , and lucky beginnings  --  came to swift destruction . To these , life just now seems very empty ; their enterprises of pith and moment are arrested ; their plate , jewelry , houses , equipages , fine clothing , and good cheer have vanished like a dream . Yesterday , they were rolling in imaginary wealth ; to-day , they are , to use a local - phrase , " sparring for a square meal . " Their riches have exhaled ; at a touch of the magician 's wand their certificates of value , founded on the precious deposits of the firmset earth , turn into worthless scraps . The palace is left unbuilt . The wisdow in Aladdin 's tower unfinished must remain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was over , people thought the eccentric inhabitants of that State would settle down to what are called " regular " pursuits . So they did ; but many of them made a regular occupation of gambling in stocks . The same spirit that iu 1852 depopulated a mining camp in a single night , and sent its lodgers flying over the country in search of a reported " rich strike , " animates to this day the shoemaker who drops his lapstone , or the merchant who quits his counter , for the stock market . Rich finds are reported in mines worked by vast and . complicated me.chinery , nowadays , just as in earlier times , they were spread abroad on the wings of rumor from Gold . Bluff , Murderer 's Bar , and . Barbaeoas . The times have not much changed ; the men have only changed in appearance . The poor fellows who left their weary bones in the gold-accursed gulches and canons of earlier California are replaced by those who spend their lives in similar pursuits . The man of California has an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often that he takes the freaks of fortune as a matter of course . If , resolving to squeeze his orange no more , lie " doth his quietus make , " he utters no lamentation , but having eaten a good dinner-=for which he does not pay ? he blows himself out of the world at the pistol 's month with as much heathen philosophy as if he were a new SOCRATES drinking his hemlock . But the darker part of the picture never meets the public eye . We hear of widows ' savings and orphans ' patrimony swallowed up in the vortex . This must happen in any great gambling excitement . It is especially frequent in one which , like the bonanza fever , reaches all classes of society . Theirs is a case ofireal distress . It would be worse in a country less generous than that where they live . But , as the beautiful bubble vanishes , leaving a few shining fragments and a great waste of disappointment , we must - wonder what new game of fortune will.next engage the attention of the Dennis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will seek it yet again .
