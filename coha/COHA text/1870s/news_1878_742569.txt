txt The Constitution of this State , adopted in 1868 , ordained that there should be exempted from sale for the payment of debts , except for taxes , $500 worth of personal property and $1,000 worth of real estate . It was contended that this exemption did not apply to debts created before the adoption of the Constitution . A case involving this point was carried up to the Supreme Court of this State , and it was decided that the exemption ' applied to all debts , no matter When incurred , whether before or after the adoption of the Constitution . By virtue of this decision debts to an enormous amount , made before and during the war , a large amount having been made on the basis of slave property , were rendered uncollectable . Great distress and privation was prevented by the decision making the exemption retrospective . This decision has been denounced as contrary to well settled law ; but so popular has this feature of the Constitution become with the people that it has been with great difficulty that a litigant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ error to the Supreme Court of the United States , and thus take the question up to the court of last resort . At last this has been done and the question is to he argued before the Supreme Court at Wash ? ington on the first day of next month . It is contended that the case of Gunn against Barry , from Georgia , involving this question as contained in the Georgia Constitution , was decided absolutely by the United States Supreme Court in the case above mentioned . On the contrary , itis contended that this exemption is to be found in the Constitution of almost every State , and that public policy and the interest of humanity ' in protecting women and children demand that the retrospective feature should be maintained . A powerful opinion in support of this view is quoted from the New York Court of Appeals . What will be the effect of an opinion overruling the decision of the Supreme Court of this State is difficult to tell . The public are about equally divided in opinion . It is thought . that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , it is thought that nearly all old debts nave been compromised and settled , and that little harm will be done .
