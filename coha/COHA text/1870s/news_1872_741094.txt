Experience having shown that a disaster of this kind is inseparable from au alarm of fire in a public school , it woula seem that care would be taken to make buildings to be used for such purposes as nearly fireproof as possible . Yet the cause of this Pittsburg fire was found to be in the fact that wooden wedges laid in the chimney flue had been ignited by the heat , and flames had thus been communicated to the flooring on the second story .
