ARTICLE VIII - CHRISTIAN MISSIONS AND SOME OF THEIR OBSTACLES* IT was a bitter thing , as the Apostle Paul traveled from city to city , that the race to which he belonged , to which were given the promises , which was made God 's instrument for upholding the true religion in the world , should oppose and persecute their fellow-believers in the old covenant , when they made known how it had come to its perfect form in Christ Jesus . But his consolation was that the gospel was for mankind . To save the Gentiles was more glorious for Christ than to raise up the depressed Jewish people . It was this feeling which was in his mind when the Jews , in their synagogue , at Antioch , in Pisidia , rejected him and his message . In his address to them , he quoted the latter part of the grand passage in Isaiah : " It is a light thing that thou shouldest be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob , and to restore the preserved of Israel ; I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that thou mayest be my salvation unto the end of the earth . " This enlargement of the plan of the Mosaic religion , this promise , that instead of the field of Palestine it should have for its field the world , was in a manner necessary . The whole strain of the old Scriptures showed a preparation for a universal religion , and called the devout Israelite to wait in hope for something nobler in the future . His was eminently a system of promises , pointing he knew not just whither , but to something great ; and especially was it the way with the prophets at the darkest moment of national depression to keep hope alive by new , more heavenly food . At the opening of the dreadful Assyrian period came the inspiring message that told of the " wonderful Counsellor , the mighty God , the everlasting Father , the Prince of Peace . " Just before the captivity at Babylon , the new covenant or dispensation of the future was made known , under which God 's law should be written on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more . Just as the time for closing the record of the old Scriptures had arrived , the last promise told of the messenger who was to prepare God 's way , and how the messenger of the covenant , the Lord whom they all sought , should suddenly come to his temple . Nor did promises and hopes alone point forward to something brighter than either past or present would justify ; there was an inward and spiritual preparation for a higher form of religion . The narrow rites of the law excited a sense of sin and of obligation , without unfolding character into the perfection of the filial spirit . Sinai with its thunderings kept sounding through all the history of the Jewish people . Nor , again , were the great questionings of the mind and heart in regard to the eternal future at all met or answered . Promises there were enough to sustain national life , but what a marked silence respecting the eternal life of the souL We have thus in the old economy the strange spectacle of a nation living on God from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in immediate rewards , but receiving little more than dark hints respecting a future world ; waiting , as it were , until another trumpet , louder than Sinai 's , should proclaim a new law that told of immortality . While thus the godly Jew was fed on great hope and on dissatisfaction with the imperfect things around him , Providence , by disappointing his hopes and ending his dream of national greatness , paved the way for the revival of hope , and the fulfillment of all and more than the substance of his dreams . The king of Babylon overthrew the civil state , but idolatry received its death blow at the same time ; the restored Jews were no longer proud , lonely dwellers in the old home , but revolution after revolution scattered them over the world , and thus they served to transmit the religious ideas , the precious treasure of the nation from land to land , and to prepare the soil for Christ and his missionaries even to the far west of Europe . Thus the plan of God in its beginnings and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to something , not different from the old religion , but nobler , and better , of the same kind , How much of all this which is open to the eye of history , as it compares epochs and discovers results , entered into the reflections // of Paul , we can not say . He has not thought it worth his while to speak of himself or of his development of opinions , except so far as it bore upon that object of preaching and explaining the pure gospel to which his life was given . But there is one aspect of the gospel , as a universal religion of God , under which we may be sure that he viewed it with the liveliest interest . It manifested its adaptation for all mankind by its power within his own soul . He knew by experience what faith was , what its power was , what had made him a new creature , what had caused him to consecrate himself to the service of Christ , what had filled him with joy and hope . He made the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the gospel was true at all ,  --  of which he never doubted from the moment of his conversion-it was for mankind , and a general provision for the sins of all men . That which saved him by faith was able to save other Jews by faith as well . That which was God 's power unto salvation for the Jew was such fur the Gentile . Christ 's coming had to his thoughtful mind a necessary bearing on mankind , so that if prophecy had not foretold a union of mankind in one kingdom of God on earth , the gospel would in the end of necessity have spread by , preaching among the Gentiles . And these convictions of the universal character of the gospel are potentially in every mind . The most ignorant disciple feels that the remedy for his sin is a remedy for all sin , that he was saved by the gospel , not because he had sinned less than others , or is in a better condition for being saved , but because the gospel had in it a saving efficacy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twelve years was healed by the touch of Christ 's garment , she could tell any other with perfect assurance , that by approaching the Master with the same faith they could find a like cure . By one such cure Christ showed forth his moral glory before the eyes of all ,  --  that " He is rich unto all that call upon Hun . " With this persuasion the Christian believer has a faith in missions . The missionary spirit lives essentially in every Chris . tian , and can not but be in him , if he believes that Christ is the Saviour of the world . There was no absolute need of the command " Go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature : " the spirit of a Christian is of itself and essentially // propagating . It seeks to communicate to all the blessings fitted for alL In any church , at any age , a principal criterion of the power of the gospel as a living force in the world , is the desire and sense of obligation to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " Thy kingdom come , " is as essential a part of the shortest prayer as " thy will be done . " If long ages elapsed after the first triumphs of Christianity , when it was paralyzed , unable to make conquests , forced to yield up large regions of the world to Mohammedanism , the cause lay in the corruptions of external institutional Christianity itself . This indeed is the great marvel , the mystery of mysteries attending the spread of the world-religion , that it stopped for ages on its course ; but as we look on this dark chapter of Christian history we ought to remember that Christ foresaw and foretold this , that it was distinctly predicted by the prophetic spirit in his apostles . But in spite of this long , sad record of stagnation in the Church , we go on to say that not only experience in the Christian mind , but experiment in the world has proved that Christianity is for all and able to reach all . The first experiment of a few men in a despised i-ace going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was crucified and rose againhow small were its means , how great its result ! Who in the apostolic age that looked on , as a cool spectator , calculating human probabilities , dreamed of anything but failui-e . So , again , after the apostolic age had past , and the leaven of falsehood had corrupted the Church in a measure , the conversion of the Goths , the Franks , the Saxons , with the rest of Britain and Ireland , of interior Germany , of Scandinavia , of the Slavonic nations , showed that the old life was not extiict , that the gospel could root out religions and idolatries of various forms , that it could begin that new civilization in Europe which has continued its progress until now . And as for the modern movement , what shall we say of this latest missionary experiment ? To say nothing of Catholic missions , where worldly policy and reliance on outward forms spread little more than an outward conformity to the ordinances of the Church , we can point with confidence to what the Protestant churches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been , as // showing that this last trial of the diffusive power of Christianity has shown the universal character of the gospel . In some respects the illustration in this ci*se is better and more satisfactory than in those which preceded , for the fields have been scattered among all races , all kinds of religion , all forms of culture or want of culture . The Danes in Southern India ,  --  and since the beginning made by them , others , especially the Church Missionary Society ,  --  the Moravians in Greenland , Eliot among the Natick Indians , the London Missionary Society and the American Board in Polynesia and elsewhere , the Baptists among the Karens , many Christian sects through Africa , to say nothing of missions in China and among the Mohammedan nationsthese , by way of examples , show a degree of success which is greater than we should have expected . But what is more , these varied experiments , pursued on different plans by members of the Christian body , differing among themselves in their system of policy and modes of presenting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the most refined , as well as among the least refined heathen tribes and races , do show most conclusively that it is not worn out ; that the human soul is receptive of it and can be made to feel a need of it ; that the same effects follow modern missions which followed apostolic preaching-in short , it is proved that the gospel and only the gospel is the world-religion . But the world is not yet converted to Christ As was said to Joshua after the tribes had for years had a foothold in Caan an , " there remaineth yet very much land to be possessed . " China and the neighborhood lands , ilindostan , the Mohammedan world , with large masses of uncivilized men , are almost untouched by the religion which we fondly call the world-religion . And meanwhile the gospel is losing its hold on great multitudes in lands nominally Christian : There have been free-thinking and sceptical periods before , but never since the days of Christ have so many , on philosophical , or historical , or scientific grounds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rejected his authority . Just as the conquest of the world seemed to be in the hands of the Church of Christ , came this new dark cloud of unbelieg to dishearten many minds and to fill with apprehension the most thoughtful . // Here we have started up two doubts in regard to the universal power of the gospeL The one last mentioned will lead many to inquire , how our religion , if it is losing and is going to lose ground at home , can spread itself abroad . If at this high point of civilization the foundations of Christianity are shaking , does not this fact show that , while it could maintain itself against the imperfect science and methods of investigation of past generations , it will not stand its ground against the thorough research of the nineteenth century . It may have been a temporary necessity , a benefactor when there was no other for oppressed and ignorant man , but it can not bear inspection under the calcium light of our day . It must give up its place and its claim of saving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against it that was aimed at its Founder , " Ah , thou that destroyest the temple and buildest it in three days , save thyself and come down from the cross . " In regard to this suspicion of some and boast of others that Christianity can not save itself from extinction , that it was good for a time but not for all time , and therefore not universal , we have but one word to say . Christ 's errand was for this-to save men from their sins , to bring about a state of reconciliation and peace between God and a race of fallen beings . His meaning and importance is not measured by sacraments , and churches , and forms of order , and the welLbeing of society and public morality , but by the endless life of the soul , by his power of bringing men out of their sins into the love and holiness of God . If he can not do that , he and his religion must fall . If man needs no such salvation , he and his religion must fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done it , heretofore , he can do it now ; if he can deliver me from my sins , I know that he can save my neighbor , can save the Chinese or Hindoo , can save the world . Therefore I care not how many stars in their courses fight against him , how many ilegels or La Places deny him ,  --  this is nothing to me so long as I have this inner light in my soul . And I know that if men are sinners like me , whoever they are , they can be made to feel the same . Of course there may be philosophies that teach that there is no such thing as sin , and if they could be universal , all sense of sin would die out from the minds of their adherents or be // buried under the ashes of false dogmas . But there is no great fear of this , for civilization itself as it produces refinement and raises the standard of life , creates a sense of imperfection , so that men must come back again to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gospel will become themselves schoolmasters to bring men to the gospel . But another and a very practical part of our subject remains . If Christianity be universal in its design , what are we to say of the prospect of converting to Christ those more civilized races that yet remain outside of the pale of his religion ? We say the more civilized races-for vast as is the area which the yet unconverted heathen occupy , their numbers are too few , and the possibility of acting on them too apparent , to affect our argument . If China or Hindostan were seen coming to Christ , it would show him to be a Saviour for all the ends of the earth , with far more convincing power than it would show the contrary , if all the savages in the world should refuse to open to him their hearts . Let us look then at the great centres of non-Christian though*t in the world , and see whether they are impenetrable and inaccessible to the gospel . And , first , as it respects Mohammedanism , it may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lain in a certain rigid monotheism , which did honor to the sovereignty and majesty of God , which acknowledged in a degree the reality of the divine revelations made to Moses and to Christ , and brought the devout Mussulman under the influence of many religious feelings that elevated the individual and were the safety of society . Add to this that the fanaticism of the early faith was long kept up by the rancor which strife between the Mohammedan and the Christian had generated . But a new time has come . With the exception of certain outbreaks of zeal among the believers in the prophet in Hindostan and Arabia , and of slow conquests in Africa among the negro tribes , this religion is in great measure dead and without heart . Politically it has little force or weight in the world . It seems to be aware of an approaching downfall ; and certainly that nation which has been its bulwark in modern times is the weakest , the sickliest of all political powers . Modern ideas , also ; new modes of intercourse ; // the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a reviving spirit ; the necessity gradually growing up of allowing free thought and even free profession of faith to all classes of subjects ; the purifying process now going on among the Armenian , Nestorian , Syrian Christians , ma king them models of life , as well as new centers of thought ,  --  all this is ground for strong hope that the next age will see a new order of things , a sway of Christianity in Turkey . Or if that power should be overthrown , we may hope that the general awe which would pervade a large part of the east on account of its fall would make access to the Mussulmen in the various countries which they have ruled easier than it is now . The obstacles among the Mohammedans in the way of the spiritual reception of the gospel lie chiefly in the cardinal facts of Christianity , in the incarnation of Christ , his atonement , and the offense to their stiff monotheistic idea presented by the doctrine of the Trinity . Here is a citadel which no political or social forces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it embraces half the truth , and because the other half requires a deeper sense of sin , greater energy of will , and less self-satisfaction than they possess . In one respect they are like the Jews to whom Paul preached with so little success : " they go about to establish their own righteousness . " Is there , however , any reason why we should not hope that , as there was a select body of Jewish Christians , through whom the gospel in its written and its preached form came to us , so among the Mohammedans earnest believers will arise , to become the founders again of the gospel at Iconium , at Edessa , and through all the lands . They are now religious , and , if converted , will be among the most devout believers in Christ . In the next place we ask whether China is accessible or inaccessible to the gospel ? We include in what we have to say of this vast empire the countries to the west and south of it , Cochin-China , Cambodia , Laos , Tonquin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Corea and Japan , to which also Thibet may be added . For whatever great social or spiritual change shall affect China , we may be sure that all these other nations will feel the same movement . And in addition to this the vast // emigration out of China in Malay countries and islands will be still more susceptible to influences acting upon the mother country . In some respects China seems to be more hopeless , to be a more dead , inert mass for the gospel to act upon , than any other part of the world . The causes for this lie in its isolation , in the national character , and in the political institutions . It is a world within itself . Possibly with some help from western mechanical and engineering skill it might reach a point of still more absolute independence , and defy foreign ideas to touch it in any vital part . The government , again , reflects and will continue to reflect the national jealousy of foreigners . Although bound by the treaties of 1856 to grant residence and liberty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a party eager to return to the old policy of seclusion . But the national character , fixed by the habits of ages , and keeping its rigidity through the sway of various dynasties ,  --  some of them native , some foreign ,  --  presents the most serious obstacle to everything from abroad . One of the national traits is extreme attachment to old usages , that veneration of the received and the traditional that resists all innovation . The worship of deceased ancestors is nowhere else in the world carried to such an excess . Another trait is self-conceit , under-valuation of everything foreign , the unwillingness to learn from strangers . Another still , a certain earthliness which contents itself with living on the motives of a prudential morality , with the smallest regard to considerations drawn from another life . In fact the Chinese , with the Mongolian race , seem to have less religious capacity , a feebler development of those feelings which are necessary to bind man to some object of worship than any other nation the whole world over . Good sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filial piety , are the foundations of their character , which thus is well fitted for this life , but does not at all incline them to seek for , or to enter into , the kingdom of heaven . The forms under which unworldliness elsewhere appears , asceticism , idealism , devoutness and reverence , gratitude for salvation , consecration to the divine service , all these seem to have scarcely entered the Chinese mind . The old national religion has contented itself with the worship of // heaven ; and whether you decide that by Shang-ti an impersonal or a personal object is denoted , you must admit that , to a very great extent , the feelings belonging to the worship of a personal God are wanting . The Chinese literati for ages have fallen , as they naturally would , into pantheism . The sect of Tao , founded by Lao-tse a far back as the time when Confucius was young , has indeed a mystical philosophy and a doctrine of the absorption of the individual into the great unity of things , out of which conceivably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tao has had no such history , it has been rejected on the whole by the Chinese mind , and now seems to exert the smallest religious influence either upon philosopher or people . The introduction , however , of Buddhism , or the Fo religion , as it is called , is a fact of great significance , if we would estimate the capacity of foreign religions to penetrate into China . Buddhism , after long struggle at home , was rooted out of India by the Brahminical system ,  --  the most thorough and wholesale instance of a faith driven totally away from its birthplace by persistent efforts of persecution , that the world affords . But it had a vitality within itself which would not let it die . It sought new abodes , among others Ceylon and Thibet ; and in the first century of our era , when the Apostles were preaching Christ and his resurrection , it entered into China . Its spread has been immense ; by some it is estimated that more than a third of the population are addicted to this religion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its propagators been owing ? If we were to stop with secondary causes , we should say , to the mildness of its moral precepts , to its religious forms and ceremonial , and to the accommodating way in which it has united some elements of the old Chinese religion with its own . But a deeper cause must be found for its spread in the intense dullness of the old Confucianism , its want of warmth , its earthliness . And yet the Fo religion itself in the course of centuries has lost its own first vitality to a great extent ; it has no favor with the educated classes , and being thrown upon the ignorant as its adherents , it plays such a part as to suit their formality , and . their superstition . It even stoops to the practice of magic arts , in order to retain its influence . // We must say , I think , as we look at these things , that the success of Buddhism in China is a proof that a foreign religion , proceeding from a race as unlike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that empire . Nor , in the nature of the case , is it likely that foreign ideas should not more and more mix themselves with the thinking of the educated in that country . On the other hand , the religious soil is as barren , as unpropitious , as any in the world . It seems as if the gospel of Christ was untranslatable , as if the Chinaman would need to have his mind made over in order to apprehend the first principles of Christ . But the difficulties , I apprehend , are greater in appearance than in reality . Numbers of Christian converts have shown that same sense of sin , conscientiousness , devoutness , heavenly-mindedness , which appears in old Christian lands ; so that the question whether China will enter into the ranks of Christian nations is one of time . It is hard to penetrate , still harder to leaven such a mass , but we have no reason for despair . Let us turn , in the last place , to India , and enquire whether there is any permanent obstacle to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I must confess that in the conversion of India the gospel would appear to me to win its highest triumph . This is , in one sense , the oldest branch of the gifted Indo-European family , the first to form a religion of nature , and to develop a philosophy . It is a race religious beyond all others , and endowed with an imagination to which vastness of space and of time , and monstrous exaggerations in mythological fiction , were no obstacles . In fact it has no historic landmarks , t knows less of its own past than any thoughtful race , because religious reverie , a sacred scorn of everything visible , tangible and actual , an asceticism which has aimed at absorption in the divine existence , made it regardless of the passing events of time . Its philosophy , growing out of its early religion , explored the same problems that occupy modern philosophy . The religion of Brahminical India proceeded from the conviction that individual existence is an evil and an illusion , from which prayer and offering , and still more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deliverance could not be reached until , by way of retribution for past misdeeds , // new forms of existence were passed through . The goal lay in being swallowed up in the universal soul or Brahma . The philosophies were either orthodox or heterodox . The principal orthodox philosophy carried out the leading ideas of the religion ,  --  that Brahma was the only real existence , that the world is unreality or illusion , that all evil for man arises out of his mistaking this world of finite things for reality , and his own personal self for something separate from and independent of the great world-soul ; and that therefore salvation can come only through the discovery of the unity of things . The principal heterodox philosophy seems to declare the reality of the soul , and of material substance : it denies the existence of a supreme soul , and affirms the gods of the Indian pantheon ( Brahma included ) to be souls like those of men or to have no reality . The aim of this philosophy is to purify men by speculative knowledge . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that the Indian people have had an immense burden on their souls , an unspeakable sense of want , if not a sense of sin . The old moral feeling has been perverted by the pantheistic religion , and yet the religion has not been able to drive sin away . Certainly a llindoo ascetic , swinging on hooks that run into his flesh , killing his body by self-torment , is terribly in earnest , although he may be as self-righteous as Simon Stylites . Here then is a point at which the religion can be assailed . Whatever callousness of conscience philosophers in India may have attained to , the people who believe in long transmigrations , the ascetic who believes in expelling self by self-infliction , must be alive to the righteousness which is by faith in Christ , for it points them to an end , where the soul , still keeping its personal existence , can be forever at rest . There is another great feature of Indian life which we must take into account . At the very first entrance of the race into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system of caste began , which thus has proved more lasting than any other institution in the history of the world . It has been more burdensome , in some respects , than any domestic or praedial slavery . It was , together with trausmigration , the moving cause of the rise of Buddhism , and the reason for its great success . It was strong enough , as we have seen , to overcome and // to expel Buddhism : when the Mohammedans of Persia invaded and reconstituted large tracts of Hindostan , it still kept its ground , so that when the first Christian missionaries from the west came into the country , it was about as strong as ever . And , now , see how this almost primeval system of caste , which has withstood such blows without seeming to be weakened , is approaching to its falL Perhaps nowhere has iDivine Providence ever showed its guiding hand more manifestly than in giving the control over Indian society to a western nation , a quarter of the earth 's surface removed from the governed country . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while it gave birth to all religions and sent them westward , repelled all shocks from the western nations by a kind of stolid inertia . Thus Alexander 's conquests after centuries left only legends in the lands overrun by the 0-reeks ; thus the iRomans were practically kept back from passing beyond the Euphrates by the Parthian kings ; thus the crusades , after nearly two centuries of struggle , left the Saracens in possession of all the Holy Land . But here we have the strange spectacle of a voluntary commercial company , planted on the other side of the world , with no political , no religious purposes whatever , forced into the position of a military power ; swallowing up in the course of time all other companies of the same sort ; and by degrees reducing or controlling a large part of the Indian peninsula . So irreligious , so purely and selfishly money-making was this company , that it dreaded and sought to drive out Christian missions ; and one of its friends in the House of Commons said , in 1793 , " that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be sternly resisted , as likely to bring Christianity and idolatry into deadly conflict , imminently dangerous to the peace and safety of the country and the East India Company . " But the gospel went , because religion was revived in England and in the United States ; opinions grew more enlightened and more Christian ; many of the civil servants of the company and of the military officers were Godfearing men ; at length the dominion passed over to the British government All this while conversions were increasing in number , until several hundred thousand , who were formerly heathen , have professed to believe in Christianity . The government , being administered on the principles of righteousness , // rests on strong foundations . It is binding India together by railroads , and enlightening it by systems of education . Caste shows signs of giving way in various quarters . This exposition of the historical progress of British power in India , while it helps us to see the hand held out by God to his Church in the work of spreading the gospel , shows also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is insurmountable . ( aste , like slavery , must fall before social ideas and enlightenment . A religion built on keeping the mass of society down , on degrading men and holding them in degradation , will give way before changes of thought and institutions which circulate among the lower classes . The popular religions , grossly obscene as some of them are , are no greater obstacle than the beautiful Greek religion was in the days of Paul and Apollos . Disgusting sin does not enthral the soul more than polished sin . The philosophies , so far as they uphold Brahminism , are a strong weapon of defence ; they tax the mind of the western missionaries to no slight extent , many of whom go into their Indian fields , it is believed , unaware of the acuteness as well as the depth of Indian thought . But these systems depend for their strength mainly on the turn the religion of India has given to thought , on the underlying principle of the old faith . If this gives way , the philosophies can not sustain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the pantheistic character of the religion , although it prevents the reception of Christianity by weakening the sense of personal ill-desert , is no such obstacle as to call for our dread . For , as we have seen , the sense of want , of imperfection , is not extinguished even in the Yogis or ascetics , and the popular faith acknowledges sin abundantly-sin in the present life , sin in some past existence . From all that has been said it appears that our missionaries can go forth in full hope that nothing that is most strong in the world , whether old , fixed social habit and institutions , or old religions , or old philosophies , cau effectually resist the gospel ; that it has the same power now that it had when preached by the apostles ; and that heathenism must inevitably fall before the light which will sooner or later shine into its darkness . Whether it is to be superseded by Christianity , or to leave a religious vacuum in the lands where it reigned so many ages , must be decided by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people .
