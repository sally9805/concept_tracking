Miss MARTINEAU ' 5 **Autobiography , " * which comprises two-thirds of this voluminous publication , is an interesting specimen of an interesting sort of book . It appeals much more to the general reader than most of the multitudinous volumes which she gave to the world during her lifetime , and we shall not be surprised if it takes its place among the limited number of excellent personal memoirs in the language . ( For this purpose , however , we must add , it would need to be disembarrassed of the biographical appendage affixed to it by the editor , which , though carefully and agreeably prepared , we can not but regard as rather a dead weight upon the book . It repeats much of what the author has related , and envelopes her narrative in a diffuse , eulogistic commentary which strikes the reader sometimes as superfluous and sometimes as directly at variance with the impression made upon him by Miss Martineau 's text . ) Miss Martineau was indeed , intellectually , one of the most remarkable women who have exhibited themselves to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not graceful , or imaginative , or aesthetic , or some of the other pretty things that literary ladies are expected to be ; but she was extraordinarily vigorous ; she had a great understanding  --  a great reason . She gives , intellectually , a great impression of force . She was a really heroic worker , a genuine philosopher , and she made her mark upon her time . Her reader 's last feeling about her is that she was thoroughly respectable . He will have had incidental feellugs of a less genial kind ; he will have been irritated at the coarseness of some of her judgments and the complacency of some of her claims ; at her evident want of tact and repose ; at a disposition to which he will even permit himself , perhaps , to apply the epithet of meddlesome . But he will have a strong sense of Miss Martinean 's care for great things-her sustained desire , prompting her always to production * " Harriet 3lartirseau 's Auto ? ioqraphy . " With Memorials by MARIA WESTON CHAPMAN . In 3 vole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some kind , to help along and enlighten the human race . She was a combatant , and the whole force of . her nature prompted her to discussion . Such natures can not afford to be delicate  --  to be easily bruised and scratched ; neither can they afford to have that speculative cast of fancy which wastes valuable time in scruples that are possibly superfluous and questions that are possibly vain . In spite of any such apologetic view of her disposition as may be put forth , however , it is probable that Miss Martineau 's autobiography will give offence enough . She speaks out her mind with complete frankness upon most of the persons that she has known , subject to the single condition of her book being published after her death . Of its being postponed until the death of the objects of her criticism we hear nothing , though this would have been more to the point . Miss Martineau deals out disapproval with so liberal a hand , that among those persons concerned who are still living much resentment and disgust must inevitably ensue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is no mistaking the degree of her censure , and as ( whatever else she may be ) she is not a flippant writer , it has every appearance of being deliberate and premeditated . We do not pretend to decide upon the propriety of her hard knocks , or to point out the particular cases in which they might have been a little softer ; but we can not help saying that there is something in Miss Martinean 's general attitude toward individuals which inspires one with a certain mistrust . She was evidently always judging and always uttering judgments . Her business in life was to have opinions and to promulgate them , and as objects of opinion she seems to have regarded persons very much as she regarded abstract ideas-attributing to them an equal unconsciousness of denunciation . This eagerness to qualify her fellow members of society would have been perhaps a great virtue if Miss Martineau 's powers of observation had been of extraordinary fineness ; but in spite of an occasional very happy hit , we // hardly think this to have been the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point , and often , independently of the justice of her appreciation , this is expressed with an extremely vigorous neatness . But frequently her descriptions of people strike us as both harsh and superfIcial , and more especially as heated , even after the lapse of years . She goes out of her way to pronounce very unflattering verdicts upon men and women who have apparently had little more connection with her life than that they have been her contemporaries . This is apart from the rightful spirit of an autobiography , which , it seems to us , should deal only with people who have been real factors in the writer 's life . The latter pages of Miss Martineau 's first volume contain a series of portraits , some brief , some more extended , of which it must be said that their very incisive lines make them extremely entertaining . Miss Martiueau 's style is always excellent for strength and fulness of meaning , and at times ? he has a real genius for terseness . Lord Campbell " was wonderfully like the present Lord ; was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flattering to an insulting degree , and prone to moralizing in so trite a way as to be almost as insulting . " That has almost the condensation of Saint-Simon . There is a very vivid , satirical portrait in this same chapter of a certain Lady Stepucy , who wrote silly novels of the " fashionabb " type which Thackeray burlesqued , and boasted that she received ? 700 a piece for them ; and there are sketches of Campbell , Bulwer , Laudseer , and various other persons , which if they are wanting in graciousness , are not wanting in spirit . Miss Martineau gives is extenBo her opinion of Macaulay , and a very low opinion it seems to be . It is , however , very much the verdict of timesave in regard to the " dreary indolence " of which the author accuses him , and which will excite surprise in the readers of Mr. Trevylyan 's " Life . " Of Lockhart and Croker and their insolent treatment of herself and her fame in the early part of her career , she gives a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the underhandedness and truculence of these discreditable founders of the modern art of " reviewing " are by this time old stories . There is also a story about poor Mr. N. P. Willis , which , 45 though it consorts equally with the impression which this litt6rateur contrived to diffuse with regard to himself , it was less decent to relate . When Miss Martineau left England for America , Mr. Willis gave her a bundle of letters of introduction to various people here ; and on arriving in this country and proceeding to present Mr. Willis 's passports , she found that the gentleman was unknown to most of the persons to whom they were addressed . A fastidious delicacy might have suggested to Miss Martinean that her lips were sealed by the fact that , of slight value as these documents were , she had at least accepted and made use of them . We suppose there was no case in which , even when repudiated , they did not practically serve as an introduction . But Miss Martineau was not faa. tidiously delicate . This copious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when the author had ceased to labor ; having earned a highly honorable repose , and being moreover incapacitated by serious ill health . She appears then , at fifty-three years of age , to have thought her death very near ; but she lived to be a much older woman-for upward of twenty years . Her motive in writing her memoirs is affirmed to be a desire to take her good name into her own hands , and anticipate the possible publication of her letters , an event which , very properly , she sternly deprecates . As to these letters , however , Mrs. Chapman publishes several , and makes liberal use of others . The reader wonders what her correspondence would have been , since what she destined to pub .. licity is occasionally so invidious . Another motive with Miss Martinean appears to have been a desire to set forth , in particular , the history of her religious opinions  --  the history being sufficiently remarkable . Born among the primitive Unitarians ( the city of Norwich , her paternal home , was , we believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dissent ) , she passed , with her advance in life , from a precocious and morbid youthful piety to the furthest limits of skepticism . The story is an interesting one , and it forms both the first and the last note that she strikes ; but we doubt whether ( even among persons as little " theological * as herself ) her refiec. tions on this subject will serve to cx- // emplify her judgment at its best . Her skepticism is too dogmatic and her whole attitude toward the " superstition " she has cast off too much marked by a small eagerness for formulas in the opposite direction , and a narrow complacency in the act of ventilating her negations . She can not keep her hands off affirmations about a future state , and she lacks that imaginative feeling ( so indispensable in all this matter ) which suggests that the completest form of the liberty which she claims as against her theological education is tacit suspension of judgment . in general Miss Martineau is certainly not superficial , but here , in feeling , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrowly theological in one 's earlier years ; it always leaves a bad trace somewhere , especially in reaction . The chapters in which Miss Martinean describes these early years are admirable ; they place before us most vividly the hard conditions of her childish life , and they describe with singular psychological minuteness the unfolding of her character and the growth of her impressions . They have a remarkable candor , and it certainly can not be said that the author 's portrait of her youthful self is a flattered one . We doubt whether , except Rousseau , any autobiographer ever had the courage to accuse himself of so ungraceful a fault as infant miserliness . " I certainly was very close , " says Miss Martineau , " all my childhood and youth . " Her account of the circumstances which led to and accompanied her first steps in literature , of the first money she earned ( she was in sore need of it ) , and of the growth of her form and development of her powers , and her confidence in them-all this is extremely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the first , but her success was the result of an amount of unaided exertion which excites our wonder . What fairly launched her was the pnblication of her " Tales in Illustration of Political Economy , " and there was something really heroic in the way that as a poor young woman with " views " of her own and without helpful companionship , she explored and mastered this tough science . Her views prevailed , and floated her into distinction . We have no space to allude to the details of the rest of her career , one of the principal events of which was her visit to America in 1884 . It lasted more than two years , and was commemorated by Miss Martineau , on her return , in no less than six volumes . Mrs. Chapman deals with it largely in her supplementary memoir , treating chiefly , however , of the visitor 's relations with the Abolition party . Miss Martineau evidently exaggerates both the odium which she incurred and the danger to which she exposed herself by these relations . They were natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Abolitionists , to foreign eyes , must at that time have represented the only eminent feeling , the only sense of an ideal , visible amid the commonplace prosperity of American life . In her last pages Miss Martinean indulges some gloomy forebodings as to the future of the United States , which offers , she says , the only instance on record " of a nation being inferior to its institutions . " This was written in 1855 ; we abstain from hazarding a conjecture as to whether she would think better or worse of us now . WE have two good novels , one very foreign and the other very domestic . The first is by Auerbach , * whose high purpose and truly ideal treatment of the narrative all who have read " On the Heights ' will remember with pleasure . He preserves the same style essentially in this story , although it is of an entirely different character .

He falls in love with her , attracted no less by her unconcealed love for him than by her beauty . He takes her to town with him , a town where there is a little German court , very refined esthetilc , and very high-dried old manners . The poor girl drives him almost mad with her awkwardness , her ignorance of polished life , and her independence . It does not help the matter that in the latter respect she wins the favor of others , even of the Prince himself . After a while he avoids her , takes to wine-drinking , and comes home drunk . She sees her position , and from what he is suffering , and * " LorleyandRe*Mard . " By BERTHOLD AuERRACH Translated by Charles T. Brooks . lOmo , pp. 377 . New York : Henry Holt . // she goes back to her parents , leaving behind her an unreproachful , fond , and most touching letter of farewell . Poor girl ! sad as it was for her , what else could she do ? It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her heart broke over it , she at least kept her love for him , and that by remaining she might have lost . After a while she dies , and he after a long time betrothes himself to another woman , who loves him , and to whose love he responds with such a feeling as beauty and sweetness and devotion might raise in the breast of a man whose heart is really in the grave of his dead wife . He dies before a second marriage from injuries received in a dispute with his brother-in-law . It will be seen that this simple story of humble life presented temptations to treatment in the most literal and realistic way . But in Auerbach 's hands it is ideal . Its likeness in certain respects to the story of " A Princess of Thule " will strike all the readers of William Black 's most charming novel . But the treatment is as unlike as the incidents and the localities . Auerbach 's little novel is essentially German in thought , in feeling , in purpose , in treatment . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character is given to it , and its idea-ity is very much enhanced by the character of the collaborator , who is constantly looking upon every incident of life from a lofty philosophic point of view ; serious generally , sometimes humorous , often serio-comic . " Wilhelm Meister " itself is not a more thoroughly characteristic production of the German mind . But it is nevertheless a sweet , simple , touching story , the sentiment diffused through which has a peculiar charm . It forms one of Mr. Henry ilolt 's well selected " Leisure Hour Series . " The translation is marked by idiomatic vigor and a very skilful adaptation of the rustic phraseology of one language to that of the other . - As unlike to this as can be is a novel by an author whose name is entirely new to us , but whose work bears the traces of some literary experience. * Its double title is very well chosen . In it a number of people , young and middle-aged , are gathered together for the summer in the * " Love in ld ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Otv*v. 8vo ( papery , pp. 131 . I'hiladeiphia : J. B. Lippincott &amp; Co. beautiful Connecticut country house of one of them  --  a wealthy young bachelor . There they all fall in love . We can hardly say that everybody falls in love with everybody else ; but it is pretty nearly that . Everybody is in love with some one else ; and the consequence is , after a good deal of cross-purposing and some suffering , half a dozen marriages . The change that has taken place in the purpose of the novel and in the manner of treatment of character by the novel writer could not be more clearly exampled than by " Love in Idleness . " It is absolutely without plot , has hardly enough coherence to be called a story , is entirely without incident . And yet it is very interesting from the first page to the last , although its interest is not of the highest kind even in the novel range . To give our readers any notion of it is quite impossible without telling them almost all that happens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the various personages . The book is strongly American ; but its Americans are of the most cultivated classes ; and it is guiltless of hardfisted farmers , Southern slave-drivers , and California gold-diggers . It is entirely free from that irritating intellectual eruption sometimes called American humor . In fact , its personages are taken both from the Old England and the New ; and side by side , one set can hardly be distinguished from the other as in real life . He who must perforce be called the hero is a Senator forty-eight years old , who is engaged to marry a rather cool , reserved , and stately woman of thirty , but is loved almost at first sight by Felise Clairmont , a girl of nineteen , half French , half American , of enchanting beauty , and still more captivating ways . She is loved by almost every other man in the book ; but her avowed lover is the Senator 's younger brother , who is the host of the assembled company , exclusive of Felise , who lives near by with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young girl as fondly as she loves him , and still more deeply , and what the result is we shall leave our readers to find out from the book itself , which will richly repay the novel reader . It is exceedingly well written , and its social machinery is managed with skill ; but it is a little too much elaborated in the conversations , which are rather excessively epigram- // matic at times . The author of such a novel , if not an old hand , should give us something better and stronger ere long . - " The Man Who Was Not a Colonel " i ' is an amusing story of that kind that may be denominated " light " even in fiction . The author rattles on through a variety of incidents , and adventures , and true-love tangles , without trying the reader 's intellect with any particularly severe infliction of character study . It is a model of that literature which has received the distinctive title of railwcsy , because in travelling we do not care to be bothered with thinking on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done well in selecting the comprehensive title " Russia " j for his book . It is no mere record of a journey , or description of a country or people as a traveller sees them . The author spent six years in the land of the Tsars , studied the language , and llved with the people , and now he endeavors to show the origin and composition of the nation , its past history and present struggles , besides making minute studies of the serf system , the communes , einancipation in its methods and results , the peculiar conjunction of autocracy and demooracy in the principles and practice of government , the agriculture , the religion , politics , population , and other important factors of a great empire . The book is sufficiently praised when we say that all these subjects are well treated . The author is careful to point out , as an analyst should , where his studies are incomplete , and he modestly tells us that his work is not presented as an unassailable summation of truth , but as the conclusion to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We could not ask for better evidence of his sincerity than in the defence which he , an Englishman , makes of the Tsar 's policy of foreign annexation ! He tells us that this is not the result of autocratic choice , but is the only available one of three modes of restraint against marauding tribes . These three are a great wall , a military cordon , and annexation . The first is impossible in a country that for hundreds * " The Man Who Was Not a Colonel . " By a High Private . Loring , publisher . $0.50. t " Russia . " By D. MACKENZIE WALLACE . New Yotk : Henry bit &amp; Co. of miles has no durable building material , the second has been tried and found impracticable . As to the last , there is a choice between an armed frontier and occupation of the marauder 's country , and the latter course is followed because it is cheaper in a pecuniary sense . To the question so often asked in England , How far is Russian " aggrandization " to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not stop until they reach the frontier of some stable power . In short , to those Russophobists in England who look with such alarm upon the approach of the Russians toward India , he calmly replies that this approach is both inevitable and desirable ! No wonder he tells his countrymen that it is their duty to know Russia better . It is plainly impossible to even review in the most concise manner the numerous important discussions in this remarkable book , without producing another book in doing so . Mr. Wallace 's work is one of the most valuable studies in social and governmental economy ever written , and several causes , aside from his personal fidelity and fitness , combine to make it so . In general , Russian society exhibits , so far as the peasantry arc concerned , a simplicity of life and thought that carries the imagination irresistibly back to prehistoric times . No civilized race , no eulturvolA , , presents such aboriginal relations in its family and commonwealth . The nobles , on the other hand , and all the cultured class , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The ideas that made such havoc in the early days of the French revolution have again swept within human vision , but this time they were caught up by a practical-minded Emperor and crystallized into the greatest premeditated political reform of this century ! The wonderful feat of quietly emancipating forty million bonded servitors , at one stroke , the institution on a tremendous scale of what the dreamers have declared to be the classic relation of social man-communism , the division of land , taking about one-half from the rich and giving it to the poor-such marvels as these throw a halo of Arabian magic about the history of this simple people since 1861 . When to these attractions is added the fact that this land of social classicityand political ideals is entirelyaccessible to study , as no other nation of like simple culture is , we think that reasons // enough have been given for saying that our author has chosen the ripest field in the world for his harvest labors . He has shown himself a most conscientious and able worker in it , and our own country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place in its Southern States ever finds so unprejudiced and painstaking a historian as he . To Americans Mr. Wallace 's book should be more interesting and valuable than to any other readers , for many of these questions which he discusses so thoroughly have been settled in precisely the opposite way in this country I For instance , emancipation here was violent , the severance of master-and-slave - relations complete , the future 8tatlt8 of the two interested parties was not previously fixed , and no compensation was given to either . Here land is held solely by individual tenure ; no person has enforced local bonds , but is free to move everywhere-that is , with the sole exception of Indians . We reject the colonization plan of dealing with marauding enemies , and adopt the armed frontier system . In short , we are diametrically opposite in our conclusions , and yet we have a national problem that is in two important respects essentially the same as Russia 's . The settlement of a continent and the amalgamation of races is the double task imposed on us as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see going on about us ; its precise opposite is well exhibited in Mr. Wallace 's " Russia . " MR . ANDERSOx can not be considered a model traveller . His " Six Weeks in Norway " * gives hardly anything but the starting out on each morning , the names of places passed , and the arrival at night . But the traveller in that country needs something of just this kind , and this book will therefore do very well for a guide . Indeed , it is well filled with facts suitable to such a service . Norway is a hard country to travel in . The frequent rains and steady fish diet are d*pressing to dry foreigners with a previous suffi. ciency of phosphorus , and like our own country there is little besides the scenery to engage attention . Nor is the interior the best part of the country . It looks best in a profile view seen from the wa * " Sir W in Norwa'j . " By E. * * sor . Robert Clarke &amp; Co. ter . Whoever would see Norway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trouble the land much . Tmi discussion of the mutual attitude of religion and science , particularly in regard to what is known as the theory of development , goes ceaselessly on . Books upon the subject follow each other so rapidly that it would seem that they must long since have ceased to find any considerable number of readers , much more of buyers . We confess that we are somewhat weary of the controversy ; particularly as it is kept up chiefly on the side of those who call themselves religionists , who mostly seem to be unable to bring forward any new arguments , and no less to fail to appreciate the attitude and the purpose of those whom they have made their antagonists . Science , as we believe , did not seek this controversy , but was forced into it by the attacks of the champions of religion , and is now necessarily kept somewhat on the defence . It would seem that nearly all that can be said , and all that need be said , has already been brought forward . But each new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be convinced that he is the man of men who is to protect religion against what he believes to be the danger in which it is placed by the observation of nature and the speculation upon discovered facts which now occupies so many physicists , including some of first.rate ability . We may as well say , if we have not already said in our previous remarks upon the books upon this question which have been reviewed in the pages of " The Galaxy , " that we do not regard the theory of evolution as established. * Facts of great interest bearing upon it have been discovered , and deductions from those facts have been made and set forth with great ingenuity and plausibility , so that it demands serious attention from the scieat ific po'iat of view . But this seems to us all that has been done . Our feelings and our convictions , not to say our creed , are all against it . It isadegrading and a hopeless view of the universe , and particularly of man . Him it places in the attitude of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last and a golden one , in a chain of events the beginning and the future of which are alike unknown . All our instincts revolt against it . We // do n't believe it ; and we candidly confess that we are in the position , abhorrent and ridiculous to the scientific mind , of not wishing to believe it . We believe , and we desire to believe , that man was made , however and when , as man ; and that however inferior he may have been in his first condition to what he is now , he was never anything less than human . Feeling thus and believing thus , we nevertheless can not see that those who are resisting science on the ground that its assumed discoveries are at war with the assumed teachings of revealed religion are doing wisely , or that they , even the best of them , have written one word which in the least impairs the value or the significance of the facts and the deductions which science has set forth . Science is only to be met by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a fish cann9t fight : one must stay on land and the other must stay in the water . Religionists , on the one hand , say that if science has discovered , or professes to have discovered , anything at variance with the Mosaic cosmogony , it is not to be believed . Scientific observers say on the other that if theology teaches anything at variance with fact and logic , so much the worse for theology . This attitude of the two will be maintained . It is natural , and in a certain sense right , that it should be maintained . Each will hold its position . Neither can accept the conclusions of the other or its methods without both ceasing to be what they are . Notwithstanding this difficulty , which is radical , the controversy will go on , until it is decided , not by argument , but by time , experience , and the moral and intellectual development of mankind . A laborious contribution to the controversy has been made by Clark Braden , * who announces himself as president of Abingdon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably , that we have never heard before of the president or of the college . Neither he , however , nor his publishers will fail through lack of confidence to make themselves known , or because they have any misgivings as to the sufficiency of their work . The author , in a prefatory note addressed * " The Question of the Hour , and Its Various Solutions , Atheism , Darwinum , nd Theism . " By CLARK BuAnux. 8vo , pp. 480 . Cincinnati : Cb*ase &amp; Hall . " to reviewers and critics , " invites the most searching criticism of his book , but earnestly requests that it shall be carefully read , and asks to have ali criticisms , particularly those which are adverse , sent to him , that they may , as he says , " aid him in his search for truth . " But plainly he has little doubt that he . has settled " the question of the hour , " and what he wishes is to enjoy the spectacle of science vainly struggling in his giant grasp . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Darwin , Tyndall , Huxley , Spencer , Carpenter , and the rest are to be snuffed out by the president of Abingdon college , Illinois ; nay , their very methods of research and modes of reasoning are to be swept into the intellectual dust-bin of that institution by his besom . And in a long address which accompanies his book , in which the publishers speak , but the style of which bears a remarkable resemblance to that of Mr. Braden , it is pointed out with unction thatwhile much has been written by the advocates of the theory of creation by intelligence , in refutation of the evolution hypothesis , yet " no thoughtful reader has ever felt satisfied with any one book " ; " no one has attempted to present , in all its infinity , mystery , and unfathomable depth , the problem for which evolution is offered as a solution . This is a fundamental failure . " Of course this great need is to be supplied , this fundamental failure made good , by Mr. Clark Braden 's book . And then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genuine utterances of their own feeling : " The book is a compactly printed volume of four hundred and eighty pages , printed on the best quality of paper , and printed and bound in the best style of art . It contains as much matter as most three-dollar books , and more than many of them . Every preacher and believer of the Bible should have a copy . All who profess to believe these theories of evolution should , above all others , have a copy . We want to place a copy in the hands of all parties . " Doubtless . This is delicious . Every one who believes the Bible should " have a copy , " and every one who do n't believe it should " have a copy . " In a word , to " have a copy " of this book is the chief end of man , the first requisite to reasonable existence for every human being . And then the pub* // lishers wind up with a request for copies of the reviews of the book , as " we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in selecting papers in which we will advertise . " Innocent creatures ! , that last touch shows how guileless they are ; how they would n't think of such a thing as offering a bribe to editors and publishers of newspapers ; and how purely disinterested they are in their desire to place " a copy " in the hands of " all parties . " We fear that our pages will not be selected for the advertising of this book ; which , by the way , is commonly printed and meanly bound . Candidly we do not think that it is the end of all things . Possibly there may be some controversy hereafter ; some men may go on investigating nature and believing in facts alone . The book reminds us of a social sketch in " Punch , " which shows two dilapidated field preachers , evidently among the most ignorant and feeble-minded of their class , meeting on the edge of a heath from which people are going away . One says to the other , " Been on the eath ? What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the reply , " I give it to Darwin an Uxley to rights . " Not that Mi . Braden is in any sense ignorant , or in any way to be compared to " Punch 's " fieldpreachcr except in his evident belief that he has " give it to Darwin an ' Uxley to rights , " and in the perfect indifference with which Darwin and Huxley will regard his performance . Briefly , nothing worthy of particular remark in Mr. Braden 's book . Those who wish to find the whole question between science and revealed religion set forth as it appears to Mr. Braden , and the facts and arguments of science met by the usual stock-in-trade *veapons of the theologian and the metaphysician , may find all this in Mr. Braden 's book , in which the author certainly does go pretty well over the whole ground . What is really his theme is found in this passage of one of his appendices ( p. 882 ) : " The issue between theist and atheist is : What is the necessary , absolute , uncaused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the self-existent , independent , self-sustaining and eternal ? What is the ground , source , origin , or cause of all existences and phenomena ? This is the problem of problems , that determines all systems of science , philosophy , and thought . " Well , to these questions science answers , We do n't know ; we do n't pre tend to know , and we probably never shall know . We have discovered by patient observation certain facts , and , according to the laws of right reason , we think that between these facts there are such and such relations . In this we may be mistaken . If we are , very well ; we shall be glad to correct our error . In either case we shall go on observing , considering , and reasoning , but confining ourselves strictly to fact . If any dogma ortranscendental notion that you know of is at variance with fact or with reason , we may be sorry or we may not ; but in either case we ca n't help it . Dogmas and notions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unconditioned , eternal intelligence that you talk about , pray tell us what you know about it . We shall be glad to learn . Do n't tell us what you think , believe , or have an inward conviction of , but what you know . What do you know about it ? Give us at least a solid basis of absolute knowledge to stand upon and to start from , and we are ready to listen to you . If you can not do this , good morning ; look you after your dogmas , and we will keep to our facts . The truth is that not Paul and Barnabas werc more driven to part company than the disputant who sets up as of any authority a theological dogma , no matter what , or a metaphysical abstraction , no matter what , and the man who studies nature scientifically . One believes because he believes , and really at bottom from no other reason ; the other is in a chronic state of inquiry ; he believes nothing in regard to any subject of inquiry but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Braden 's book , although it is filled with evidences of wide reading and high education , reads like a book of metaphysical and theological commonplace . It . reminds us of our college days in the lecture room of the professor of moral philosophy . It is well enough in its way , but it will attract little attention in the pending controversy . Of its style we must say that , considering the position of its author , we wish it were better , and that in the use of language it were an example more worthy to be followed .

" Dr. Bellows , in his introduction , expresses the feeling with which religious minds will read these papers when he says , " it is refreshing in the midst of the crude replies which alarmed religionists are hastily hurling at the scientific assailants of faith in a living God , to hear one thoroughly furnished scholar , profound metaphysician , and earnest Christian entering his thoughtful and deeply considered protest against the tendencies or conclusions of modern materialism . " Mr. Martinean may now be justly regarded as the leading champion of faith .

They will not acknowledge themselves vanquished ; and perhaps from the very nature of the case , as we have already remarked , they can not be vanquished by any argument in which revelation or metaphysics enters as a premise ; but they will not refuse their admfration nt the union of subtlety and strength , of ability and courtesy with which they are treated . We find many admirable passages in this book marked for reference , as we went through it ; but we must pass them by .

We content ourselves with recommending this little , thoughtful , strongly written book to the attention of our readers . They will find the best array of arguments with which to meet scientific materialism. - From the same publishers , who seem very catholic in their reception of authors , we have a volume which , the more because of its ability and its calmness of tone , Mr. Martineau would regard with sadness , and with horror , and perhaps with dread. * Mr. Frothingham has undertaken the task of studying the records of the foundation of Christianity from a purely literary point of view and with all the aids that can be derived from criticism . The result of his studies may be said to be the satisfaction of his own mind that Jesus of Nazareth was not and did not intend to be the founder of a new religion ; that he believed himself to be and set himself up as the Mossins , the temporal Messias , expected by the Jews ; and that Christianity was founded by Paul , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may fail in establishing his position in regard to him , it certainly must be admitted that he has made of him avery interesting and energetic figure , and one which is consistent with itself and with all that we are told of the great apostle to the Gentiles . He calls him both Jew and Greek - Jew by parentage , nurture , training , and genius , Greek by birthplace , residence , and association , an enthusiast , even to fanaticism , by temperament , and yet freed from extreme narrowness of mind by intercourse with the people and the literature of other nations . He was a Jew whose feeling upon the Christ question was always intense , so much so that he worried and tormented the people who did not believe as he did . He was a Messianic believer of the school of the Pharisees , or strict Jews ; but all at once , as such things do happen to such men , another aspect of the Messianic expectation burst upon him with the splendor of a revelation , * " The ( 4'adle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " By OcTAvIus BROOXS FROTHINOHAM. 12m0 , pp. 233 .

To the conception of the Messias and of Jesu&amp;s conformity to it which suddenly took possession of Paul , Mr. Frothiugham assigns the origin of the Christian reli-. religion as it was known in the second century . With a cool and almost humorons adaptation of a political phrase of the day , he calls this Paul 's " new departure . " That Mr. Frothingham 's book is clear in thought , interesting in substance , agreeable and good in style every one acquainted with his writings will readily believe . As to the points that he has undertaken to establish , we are pretty sure that after reading his book few will think with him who were not ready to do so before they began it . DR . WATSON F.

His belief is that population tends to become homogeneous , but this is not an averaging process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ product does not exhibit the balanced characteristics of both , but the traits of the higher race are absorbed and hid in those of the lower . Asia , he says , " was formerly powerful , with white peoples all along its northern and eastern borders , and far into the interior . But they first enslaved the black race , then mingled their blood , and have finally become merged in them . " The resulting mongrel people always lacks the intellectual force necessary to maintain the civilization of the higher . Arts decline and national decay sets in . In this way is explained the existence of noble ruins among inefficient and barbarous nations , who practise a much ruder style of a*-chitecture . The Mexicans are the type of this retrogression . Dr. Quinby preclicts for them an increasing decline until Aztec civilization is restored . If the Doctor 's theories could be established , there are enthusiastic ethuologists who would not hesitate to say that the Mexicans could not be put to a better use than this .

Some of his work reads as if Mark Twain had turned philologist . For instance : Eighty miles from the month of the Indus was a place called Hlngliz . The people of this part celebrate the festival of Bhavani on the first day of May , when their custom Is to erect a pole in the field and adorn it with pendants and garlands . They also celebrate another festival on the last day of March , called Huh ( Phulee ) , when they amuse themselves by sending one another on foolish errands . All this has a very Hinglish look ( ! ) . This is probably the place where the Hinglish people came from , for though the itomans called themselves angles , they call themselves English . " To explore libraries , to sift out from masses of irrelevant matter what alone is of value to the naval student , to subject the poetical descriptions of great battles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give the results in a condensed , well written , and interesting form , is the task Commodore Parker has assumed , and so far as the volume under consideration is concerned** the first of a series  --  the task has bcen well and faithfully performed . The amount of labor involved is immense I The author passes rapidly over the navies of antiquity for the reason , probably , that we are more familiar with that history than with the naval history of a period nearer to us both in time and relationship . What schoolboy has not read of Xerxes sitting in his golden chair overlooking the Pirmus and the galleys of his immense fleet strung along the coast of Attica as far as the eye could reach ? He counted them at break of day , But when the sun set where were they ? Such was Salamis . When his narrative reaches the navies of the Italian republics of the middle ages , however , our author seems all aglow with love of his theme , and well he may be ! Venice , in hei- day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

There is so much of romance and poetry , indeed , in connection with the naval his * " The Fleets of the World . " By Commodore FOXHALL A. PARKER , United States Navy . New York : D.

Very similar is the history of the sister repub. lie of Genoa . Unfortunately these lovely sisters were great rivals , and during wars which covered a period of about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and resources without achieving a particle of good to either . As a judg - ment , it would almost seem , for such stupendous and long-continued folly , the seeds of destruction were planted without their own bosoms . Both attained the pinnacle of earthiy glory , but from both issued forth a wanderer who was destined in time to set his seal upon the fate of his native city . The Genoese Columbus , followed by the Venetian Cabot , led the way to the great western continent which , by diverting the course of trade and commerce from its old channels , caused the loss of wealth and the final decay of the Italian republic . The spirit of discovery once aroused , other navigators followed , and Vasco da Gama , by opening the road to the East Indies by the way of the Cape of Good Hope , so injured the trade of Venice with the cast as to render her downfall inevitable . But the history of the old sea kings of the north , and the tracing of their line of descent through old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still more interesting to our naval students . The Vikings- " sons of the fords " - were undoubtedly the most arrant pirates of all history . They were the dread of all Europe . " A furore Normanorum librera nos Domine , " prayed the Church throughout Christendom . Many of these piratical princes became , through habitual success , so devoted to their calling that they never extinguished it , but rather gloried in passing their liyes on board their ships . It was their fond boast that they never reposed under an immovable roof , nor drank their beer in peace by their fireside , and the ships in which they had led their wild and adventurous lives formed in death their sepulchre . Passing over the discovery of North America by Eric the Red ( about 700 B. C. ) , we may come at once to Harold Harfagra-Harold the Fairhaired , or Harold Fairfax , a name so well represented to-day in our own navy . Having made himself master of all Norway , the restless young spirits of the realm took themselves off on one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rollo , son of the celebrated sea-rover Jarl Ragnvald , they ascended the Seine and laid siege to Paris . So successful were these Normans that Charles the Simple ceded to Bollo that part of Neustria since called Normandy . By the terms of the treaty , Charles was to give his daughter Gisele in marriage to Rollo , together with the province of Normandy , provided he would do homage , and embrace the Christian religion . To do homage was to kiss the feet of the king . All that the sturdy Rollo could be prevailed upon to do , however , was to place his hand in that of the king , and to depute one of his followers to do homage for him . The gentleman to whom this duty was assigned raised the king 's foot so high that his majesty was thrown upon his back ; whereupon the rude Normans burst out laughing , so little respect for royalty had these wild rovers of the sea . Two hundred years later the descendants of these same Normans achieved the Conquest of England . They became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gradually fused , with the Angles and the Saxons , already inhabitants of the island , into the modern Englishman and his representative on the shores of New England . This volume not only shows the reader  --  the general as well as professional reader  --  the large scope embraced in a proper study of history , but it also demonstrates that naval archaeology is not a mere idle amusement , suited to the elegant leisure of the scholar . It has a great and practical value , enabling an officer to understand his own profession the more thoroughly in all its branches . Commodore Parker has conferred a material benefit on his profession by the valuable contribution he has made to its literature . He has , moreover , by his straightforward narration , pleasant style , and copious illustrations from standard authorities , rendered agreeable and entertaining to the general reader what otherwise might have proved technical , and of too special a character . // MR . PERKINS 'S book almost disarms criticism by its very character , for it is impossible to make a selection of books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adapted to diverse and contrary necessities . Private libraries want the best books , public libraries the books most called for by the general and often Undiscriminating public . " The Best Reading " contains the titles of about ten thousand books , and as that is less than half the number printed every year , the work is confessedly incomplete from whatever point of view we look at it . Still it is useful to librarians , of whom there are several hundred inexperienced ones in the country , and to professional essayists , or magazine writers , a class that must contain thousands of persons . With every allowance for unavoidable imperfections , we think Mr. Perkins can revise the list with advantage , taking out some obsolete writers and putting in some new ones in their place-Herbert Spencer for example . BOTH Mr. Loftie 's " Plea for Art in the House " and the Misses Garrett 's advice on " House Decoration " t belong to the best kind of works on the very important subject of cultivating good taste in the furniture of the home . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are entirely competent to instruct us all on this subject . Especially are they free from what we consider to be the worst fault a book of this kind can show , an obtrusive pretension to superior taste . It is a great mistake to suppose that we can elevate people by showing them that we consider ourselves far above them in taste and judgment ; but this mistake is not unfrequently made .

Both these books are free from that error , and Mr. Loftie especially takes his readers into a survey of a good many branches of decorative art , exhibiting a familiar acquaintance with them all , talking alternately of the blunders and successes of collectors , real and would-be , and all with a natural enthusiasm and freedom from superciliousness . The Garrett sisters also give a great number of valuable suggestions and some very taking illustrations of tasteful decoration . We wish they had given less of their work to criticism of the conventional London house and more to the description of what is good . So far as we are acquainted with books of this class , they abound in two faults , discursiveness and inordinate discussion of bad models . Artistic house decoration is a technical art , and must be taught like all other arts-by the exhibition of good precedents . Strictly speaking , there can be no theories in matters of taste . All the so-called laws or canons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done . From that we may learn what is well doing , and the educated taste produces good work . There is nothing in art so implicit as the surveyor 's dependence upon the law of magnetic attraction . The notes of a survey well made to-day can be given to a surveyor a century hence , and he will bring the lines out to within half an inch , and put his hand upon each boundary mark that has been made . But it is not so in art . In all the reconstructions of ancient Grecian buildings not one has been rebuilt . Neither the Madeleine nor the Valhalla repeat the art of the Parthenon , however faithfully they repeat its form and measurements . Good taste is a thing that no French surveyor can secure with any refinement whatever of the metric system . But still there is a soil in which this plant can be grown , and that soil is the collective evidences of good taste in the past .
