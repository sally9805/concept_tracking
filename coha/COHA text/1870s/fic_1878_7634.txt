Thaxter , Celia , 1835-1894 : AWAKENING . from Awakening ( 1878 ) Well  --  I said , it is all too true The story told to my childish ears , That tears were many and joys were few , And hopeless the weight of gathering years . I never believed a word of the tale , And turned to the sun and rejoiced in the day , But a blow struck home and the light grew pale Till bitter darkness beset the way . Oh , what is it all ? ( I pondered ) ,  --  what This terrible life wherein we are set Defenceless , whether we will or not ; Where the swift years weave us a golden net Of joys so sweet and of hopes so bright , Only to rob us day by day , Slowly to take from the eyes their sight , Steal all the body 's senses away , And deal to the soul such blows of loss Through the hand of Death ?  --  and there I ceased , For a wave too bitter rolled across , And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond all thought . Outside I heard the spring wind sigh , As if the pathos of life it caught , And strove to utter it , wandering by . When , in a moment , the door swung wide , Sunshine and flowers and songs of birds Swept in with you like a golden tide , Sweetness and rapture too deep for words . O Love , you brought to me youth and spring , Took me by storm with a glad surprise ; And set my whole soul worshipping , And saved my life with the look in your eyes ! And while you are left to me , no more Can my heart be dull as a senseless clod , While you hold me fast with those eyes so sure , Humbly I reach for the hand of God .
