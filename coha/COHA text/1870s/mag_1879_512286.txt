RECOLLECTIONS OF AGASSIZ . IN the commerce of nations it is important that there should be an interchange of minds as well as of merchandise . In the annual reports of our Secretaries of the Treasury the imports and exports are correctly given in the current coin or currency of the land , and the balance of trade , either for or against us , is correctly estimated ; but in stating the value of our imports there is an unavoidable omission of our annual importations of skilled laborers , of inventors , of engineers , and of men of genius generally in the various departments of art , literature , and science . The worth of such men can not be gleaned from the records of the Custom-house ; yet it is plain that they must add enormously to the wealth of the country by simply diffusing their exceptional knowledge or exercising their exceptional talents . Indeed , there can be no imported wealth which exceeds in value the importation of the creators of wealth . The body which contains an ingenious and inventive mind may not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which comes over in the same ship with him ; but if the mind lodged in the body be that of a Watt , an Arkwright , or a Bessemer , it is impossible to compute the number of the fleets that may be needed to export the products of his brain . Even in the matter of pure science , it is difficult to compute the value in dollars and cents of an imVOL . LIx. - No. 349. -7 ported man of science of the first class . He may seem to scorn all applications of his discoveries to useful ends ; but it is certain that a crowd of bright practical minds will follow in the path of his discoveries , and convert all his additions to the knowledge of nature into additional means for the conquest of nature . At any rate , there can be no doubt that the vessel which brought Louis Agassiz to our shores brought a scientific intelligence and scientific force which outvalued not only all the rest of the cargo , but of a thousand ordinary cargoes . In getting thorough possession of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in resolutely refusing , with his hearty concurrence , to deliver him up to the country which afterward claimed his services , the United States must be considered to have made a good bargain . He was too poor when he arrived here to pay any " duties " into the Treasury ; but the impulse he gave to science in this country enriched us in a degree that can not be measured by any money standard . Indeed , the American opponents of his scientific theories were and are among the foremost to acknowledge the marvellous effects of his scientific inspiration ; for he popularized pure science , and lifted high in public esteem the whole body of investigators who were loyally engaged in its service . From him came the most notable of all the maxims which illustrate the disinterestedness of the true devotee of science . At the time he was absorbed in some minute investigations in a difficult department of zoology , he received a letter from the president of a lyceum at the West , offering him a large sum for a course of popular lectures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CAN NOT AFFORD TO WASTE MY TIME IN MAKING MONEY . " The words deserve to be printed in capitals ; but Agassiz was innocently surprised that a sentiment very natural to him should have excited so much comment . He knew that scores of his brother scientists , American and European , would have used the words " afford " and " waste " in the same sense had they been similarly interrupted in an investigation which promised to yield them a new fact or principle . Still , the announcement from such an authority that there was a body of men in the United States who could not afford to waste time in making money had an immense effect . It convinced thousands of intelligent and // opulent men of business , who had never before thought a moment of time devoted to the making of money could be wasted , that science meant something ; and it made them liberal of their money when it was asked for scientific purposes . It did even more than this-it made them honor the men who were placed above the motives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impression of the genius of Agassiz was gained when he was in the full vigor of his mental and physical powers . Some thirty-five years ago , at a meeting of a literary and scientific club of which I happened to be a member , a discussion sprang up concerning Dr. Hitchcock 's book on " bird tracks , " and plates were exhibited representing his geological discoveries . After much time had been consumed in describing the bird tracks as isolated phenomena , and in lavishing compliments on Dr. Hitchcock , a man suddenly rose who in five minutes dominated the whole assembly . He was , he said , much interested in the specimens before them , and he would add that he thought highly of Dr. Hitchcock 's book as far as it accurately described the curious and interesting facts he had unearthed ; but , he added , the defect in Dr. Hitchcock 's volume is this , that " it is deescreep-teeve , and not com-par-a-tcevc . " It was evident throughout that the native language of the critic was French , and that he found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I never can forget the intense emphasis he put on the words " descriptive " and " comparative , " and by this emphasis flashing into the minds of the whole company the difference between an enumeration of strange , unexplained facts and the same facts as interpreted and put into relation with other facts more generally known . The moment he contrasted " dees-creepteeve " with " com-par-a-teeve " one felt the vast gulf that yawned between mere scientific observation and scientific intelligence , between eyesight and insight , between minds that doggedly perceive and describe and minds that instinctively compare and combine . The speaker vehemently expressed his astonishment that a scientist could observe such phenomena yet feel no impulse to bring them into relation to other facts and laws scientifically established . The critic was , of course Agassiz , then in the full possession of all his exceptional powers of body and mind . You could not look at him without feeling that you were in the presence of a magnificent specimen of physical , mental , and moral manhood ; that in him was realized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sage in the body of an athlete . " At that time he was one of the comeliest of men . His full and ruddy face , glowing with health and animation , was crowned by a brow which seemed to be the fit home for such a comprehensive intelligence and the slight difficulty he overcartie in enunciating English words only lent to them increased significance . He gave the impression that every word he uttered embodied a fact or a principle . Afterward he so adapted his organs of speech to the English language that he ended in speaking and writing it as though it were his mother-tongue . If there was any exception to be made , it was in one of his favorite terms , " development . " He never completely overcame his tendency to pronounce it devil-ope-ment . It was my good fortune to meet him often during the last twenty-five years of his life ; but my first impression , the impression of the comprehensiveness of his mind , was more and more confirmed as I came to know him more intimately . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his vast and joyous memory , so that he was ever ready to reply to any unexpected question concerning the most obscure nooks and corners of natural history ; but in replying he ever indicated that his immense grasp of the details of his science was free from any disposition to exaggerate any detail out of its connections . No isolated fact could exist in his mind . The moment it was apprehended it fell easily into relationship to the throng of other facts quietly stored in his broad intelligence , and became one of a group which illustrated a principle . His knowledge of particulars was extensive , minute , and accurate . Every separate fact was vividly present to the eye of his imagination , and yet all his knowledge was generalized knowledge . In thinking , therefore , on his accumulated , his multitudinous materials , it maybe said that details were never in his way or out of his gay : those that he needed crowded at once upon his mind ; those he did not need kept at a respectful distance . I often watched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawn into a discussion , but I never could detect any sign of that confusion of mind which results from a disturbance of the proper relations of memory to understanding . The facts he needed , as I have said , came at once to do his bidding ; and the thousands of irrelative facts which were also at his command never obtruded on his attention to obstruct the rapid course of his lucid argument . It would seem as if there never was among naturalists an intellect more thoroughly disciplined than his , or which was less hampered by the abundance of the material on which it worked . But the marvel of Agassiz , and a neverceasing source of wonder and delight to his friends and companions , was the union in his individuality of this solidity , breadth , and depth of mind with a joyousness of spirit , an immense overwhelming geniality of disposition , which flooded every company he entered with the wealth of his own opulent nature . Placed at the head of a table , with a shoulder of mutton before him , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the belief that the host had given him the best piece . His social power exceeded that of the most brilliant conversationists and of the most delicate epicures ; for he was not only fertile in thoughts , but wise in wines and infallible in matters of fish and game . It was impossible to place him in any company where he was out of place . The human nature in him fell into instinctive relations with every kind and variety of human nature outside of him . His wide experience of life had brought him into familiar contact with emperors , kings , and nobles , with scientists and men of letters , with mechanics , farmers , and daylaborers-in short , with men divided by race , rank , wealth , and every other distinction from other men ; and by the felicity of his cosmopolitan nature he placed himself on an easy equality with them all , never cringing to those conventionally above him , never " condescending " to those intellectually below him , but cordially welcoming every body he met on the common ground of human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manhood was entirely independent of conventional rules . When he discovered a real man , it was indifferent to him whether he occupied a palace or a hovel ; and certainly no man of science ever equalled him in captivating the representatives of all grades of rank and intelligence by sheer force of humane sympathy . The French , or Austrian , or Brazilian emperor , the peasant of the Alps , the " rough " of our Western plains , agreed at least in one opinion-that Agassiz was a grand specimen of manhood . His scientific contemporaries , though brought into occasional antagonism with his opinions , admitted that he possessed the one exceptional charm which they lacked ; for this wonderful creature could , by his social qualities , make pure science popular among a large class of voters who had hardly risen to an appreciation of the immense advantages which had followed the many practical applications of pure science to their own welfare and advancement . Indeed , the impulse that Agassiz gave to the cause of science in the United States is universally admitted to have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scientist , who was entirely uninfluenced by the geological and zoological theories of Agassiz , once confided to me his judgment as to the value of the great naturalist 's work as a scientific force . " I look upon him , N he said , " as a prophet , as an apostle of science ; he has made every honest investigator his debtor ; he has not only elevated in public esteem the intellectual class to which he belongs , but he has induced the moneyed class and the political class to give science the means of carrying out its purposes . Since Agassiz came into the country you can not but have noticed that private capitalists , State Legislatures , and the Congress of the country have been liberal of aid to every good scientific enterprise . We owe a great part of this liberality to Agassiz . He it was who magnetized the people with his own scientific enthusiasm . He made sc4ence popular , because in him science was individualized in the most fascinating and persuasive of human beings . All the rest of us are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigation , or so infirm in physical health , or so unsympathetic with ignorant people , or so supercilious , or so controlled by some innate cussedness ' of disposition , that we can not readily adapt ourselves to the ways of men of the world ; but Agassiz , with his enormous physical health and vitality , and his capacity to meet all kinds of men on their own level , drew into our net hundreds of people , powerful through their wealth or // their political influence , who would never have taken any interest in science if they had not first been interested in Agassiz . And these men were the men who gave us the money we needed for the extension of scientific knowledge and the promotion of scientific discovery . Agassiz is a great scientific intelligence ; but he is even greater considered as an immense scientific force . " The extraordinary influence which Agassiz exerted over assemblages of men who had small perception of the scope of his thinking was due to a general impression of his disinterestedness , as well as to his magnetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in need of money for a purely scientific purpose , he invited the members of the Legislature of the State of Massachusetts to visit it , with the design of inducing them to vote the sum he required . After a short persuasive address , delivered in the hall of the museum , he led them over the building , pointing out the great things that had been achieved , and the still greater things that were to follow if his plan was carried out . In ascending the stairs I happened to overhear two intelligent legislators , evidently farmers , who were considering the propriety of giving the proposed legislative aid . " I do n't know much , " said one , " about the value of this museum as a means of education , but of one thing I am certain-that if we give Agassiz the money he wants , he will not make a dollar by it . That 's in his favor . " The appropriation was made a day or two after , though it was generally considered that no other man could have wrung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is hardly necessary now to affirm that Agassiz did not win this distinction of being the greatest scientific force of the country by any of the various arts of insincerity and indirection . Of no man could it be said with more truth that his behavior was always the expression of his nature . The naturalness of his " good manners " constituted their charm . He was what Dryden calls one of " God Almighty 's gentlemen ; " a gentleman inborn and inbred ; a gentleman who had no need of being trained artificially in the rules of politeness , because in him the gentleman was but one expression of the large individuality of the man . So little was there of varnish in his manners , so little of the restraint on sensibility which we are accustomed to consider as the perfection of good-breeding , that he did not hesitate to indulge in occasional outbreaks of intellectual and moral wrath which coxcombs might consider decidedly improper and ungenteel . Indeed , when any thing which he deemed of vital moment was up for discussion , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warmhearted , ingenuous , impetuous boy ; and yet the finest gentlemen of his time admitted that he generally excelled them all in his instinctive conformity to that higher law of good-breeding'which regulates the intercourse of mind with mind . He was the recognized head , the chairman , of a peculiar Boston club , admission to which depended rather on antipathy than sympathy as regards the character and pursuits of its members . It was ingeniously supposed that persons who looked on all questions of science , theology , and literature from different points of view would be the very persons who would most enjoy each other 's company once a month at a dinner table . Intellectual anarchy was proclaimed as the fundamental principle of this new organization , or rather disorganization ; no man could be voted in who had not shown by his works his disagreement with those who were to be associated with him ; and the result was , of course , the most tolerant and delightful of social meetings . Societies based on mutual admiration had been tried , and they had failed ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was a success from the start . The two extremes were Agassiz the naturalist and Emerson the transcendentalist , and they were the first to become intimate friends . Nothing could exceed the admiration of Agassiz for Emerson 's intellectual and personal character . The other members agreed to disagree after a similar charming fasAion , and the contact and collision of so many discordant minds produced a constant succession of electric sparks both of thought and wit . Probably not even the club of which Johnson , Burke , Reynolds , Garrick , and Goldsmith were members brought so many forcible individuals into such goodnatured opposition , or afforded a fairer field for the display of varied talents and accomplishments . When they were all seated at one board , and the frolic hostilities of opinion broke out in the free play of wit and argument , of pointed assertion and prompt retort , the effect wa* singu // larly exhilarating . Indeed , there is no justification for a long dinner where the attraction is simply in the succession of choice dishes and the variety of rare wines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are more active than the palate and the stomach . But during the long period that Agassiz presided over the association it may be said that though he did not contribute the most sparkling sayings , he was still the informing and inspiring life of the club . He radiated his vital courtesy and cheer through the whole assembly of notables , fused them into a compact body of friends , and was most warmly acknowledged as their natural head by those members who were specially distinguished for their conversational brilliancy and charm . Agassiz himself prized the club above all others , because it brought him once a month into intimate relations with persons who were not particularly interested in the subjects which absorbed his own intellect and tastes . He delighted in hearing and in replying to objections to his scientific convictions made by persons who approached the deep questions which the advance of geology and zoology had raised , from points of view opposite to his own . It is said that he was somewhat irritable and impatient in discussing his theories with naturalists and physicists ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same theories with theologians , metaphysicians , and men of letters , and he was always delighted to meet on neutral ground opponents who did not pretend to have the knowledge which would qualify them to contest his conclusions as far as they were derived from the special facts of his own science . He has been charged with arrogance and self - assertion , but he never showed a trace of these qualities in his familiar intercourse with the members of this club . His associates in that society remember him not only with respect but with love . Ask Longfellow , Holmes , Lowell , Peirce , Emerson , Cabot , Hoar , Dana , Hedge , Norton - and , could we question the dead , ask Sumner , Andrew , Motley , Hawthorne-what they think of Agassiz , and the response would surely be one of affection for the wonderful creature , who combined such endless fertility of generalized knowledge with such unbounded geniality of nature . It would almost seem that there never existed a distinguished man who called forth so much love from a wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much implied respect . Indeed , every body who was honored by the friendship of Agassiz feels honored in the memory of it . The " recollections " which any of his acquaintances can record of such a noble specimen of physical , intellectual , and moral manhood must be more or less disappointing ; for the general impression left on the minds of all who knew him can hardly be expressed in details of his life and conversation . " That dear Agassiz " was the judgment passed upon him by a French custodian of scientific collections who had frequent opportunities to know how insatiable was the greed for knowledge which characterized this greatest of modern naturalists ; and " that dear Agassiz " expresses the feeling which is still uppermost in the hearts of all American friends who survive him . And , first , no justice can be done to Agassiz which does not recognize the deep religiousness of his nature . In his youth and early manhood he was a pronounced materialist . It is said of the ordinary New England divinity student that at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corresponding period in his purely scientific career Agassiz may be said to have " experienced " irreligion . The same ardor of nature which made him a resolute scientist made him , at least on the negative side , a resolute atheist . And he was perfectly honest in his disbelief . It is difficult to fix the date when he became a theist . One thing , however , is certain , that he passed into all the mental and moral moods which lead many modern scientists to ignore or deny the existence of God , and to rest satisfied in the general conception of " Law , " without se*ing or feeling any need of a Lawgiver . I have said that he passed into these moods , thoroughly " experienced " them , and felt as well as understood all the logic and all the facts on which such " positivism " is founded . But he gradually passed out of this state as he came nearer and nearer , as an investigator , to the inmost meaning of nature . He ended , much to the contempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in a belief in God more intense than that professed by the majority of theologians . His experience of religion was even more marked than his previous experience of irreligion , and it carried with it all the force // of his nature . Having gone through all the dreary and dogmatic skepticism in which most men of science were contented to remain , he amazed his own class of scientists , in his " Essay on Classification , " by urging them to abandon their neutral or hostile attitude toward natural theology , and to look on the various divisions and classes of nature as the embodiment of thoughts previously existing in a divine creative mind . The scorn with which this essay was received in some quarters was unspeakable . Its author lost caste among many of the foremost naturalists of France , Germany , and England . He was , indeed , accused of shamming religion in order to induce the Puritans of America to give him money to carry out his scientific schemes . It was held to be disgraceful that a great naturalist who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Knowable " should forfeit his intellectual rank by ignominiously giving in to the claims of the priests , and asserting that the " Unknowable " was a personal and infinite God , " known " more or less to the student who explores scientifically the facts of nature with a mind untrammelled by either atheistic or theistic prejudices and preconceptions . The European scientists were strangely at fault in considering the theism of Agassiz as at all influenced by the class that they contemptuously designated as " the priests . " His education as a scientist was entirely independent of all the influences which surround the childhood , youth , and early manhood of most English and American men of science . He never felt the passions or appreciated the theories of any of the theological systems from the dictation of which they may pride themselves on being emancipated . He always seemed to me strangely ignorant of the doctrines which divided the various sects and churches of Christendom , or at least strangely indifferent to them . If he was of any sect , my impression is that he inclined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assert even that . In reading his " Essay on Classification " I was reminded of the ideas of law presented in the first book of Hooker 's Ecclesiastical Polity , and I sent the volume to him . He much admired the first book , but took small interest in what followed ; and of Hooker 's position as the greatest thinker of the Church of England , and as one of the leading minds in the Elizabethan pe nod of English literature , he knew little or nothing . He was , in fact , a naturalist pure and simple , and he rose into supernaturalism in the most natural way . Indeed , far from compromising the cause of science in order to win the goodwill of theologians , he gave the theologians a great shock by early advancing the theory that mankind had no common ancestor , but that its various races were derived from separate originals . He did not much care about names ; he had no objection to the name Adam or the name Eve , but he believed in numerous Adams and numerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him in New England on account of this heresy ; and I remember asking him , before the clatter had subsided , how he contrived to preserve his scientific independence while living in a community which was generally hostile to all opinions which clashed violently with its theological , philanthropic , and political beliefs and passions . " Why , " he answered , " the reason is plain : I never was a quarter of a dollar ahead in the world , and I never expect to be . When a man of science wants money for himself , he may be compelled to subordinate science to popular opinion ; when he wants money simply for the advancement of science , he gets it somehow , because it is known that not a cent sticks in his own pocket . " And he added , in reference to his own theory : " You know that my belief in the essential unity of the races of mankind is not based on their physical descent from a common ancestor , but on the higher ideal ground of a plan existing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of animals , yet carried out according to the laws which regulate the geographical distribution of both men and animals on this planet . Before this scientific discussion is carried far , many of my theological opponents will find that the Divine plan in the creation of man is of much more importance than any question of his physical descent , or the agreement or disagreement of my theory with their interpretations of the first chapter of Genesis . I approach the whole question from a stand-point entirely different from theirs , as I do every other question where science comes into collision with popular belief . And , mind you , my method of arriving at the doctrine of the Divine Existence is a purely scientific method ; and you will find , per- // haps before you die , that this ostentatious denial or ignoring of God , common among naturalists whom I warmly esteem , and whose additions to natural history I am the most ready to acknowledge , will end in making the science itself sterile . The positive system , under its many names and modifications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new discoveries . When the present generation of observers has passed away , the new generation will be more zealous in establishing their dogmas of atheism than ' any of their theological opponents will be in defending their superstitious dogmas founded on the beliefs of past ages . Their disbelief might be of small account if it were not certain to interfere with their original researches . But I fear science will suffer in the hands of its seeming devotees . They will become controversialists instead of being investigators . Now the progress of science depends on the ever-recurring numbers of noble young men who will be attracted to science by the hope of advancing it by new discoveries , and the unselfishness with which they enter on this course must be as complete as that which we know has animated Christian missionaries . If on the threshold of their career they are supplied with sufficient scientific facts and theories to induce them to engage in a free fight with the persons around them who are not scientifically enlightened , they will spend in the popularizing of current scientific hypotheses the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scientific facts . And ( then I will frankly tell you that my experience in prolonged scientific investigations convinces me that a belief in Goda God who is behind and within the chaos of ungeneralized facts beyond the present vanishing-points of human knowledgeadds a wonderful stimulus to the man who attempts to penetrate into the region of the unknown . For myself I may say that I now never make the preparations for penetrating into some small province of nature hitherto undiscovered without **36;317;TOOLONG His secrets from me only to allure me graciously on to the unfolding of them . I sometimes hear preachers speak of the sad condition of men who live without God in the world , but a scientist who lives without God in the world seems to me worse off than ordinary men . Of course I do not pretend to give the exact words of Agassiz in this report . I am only sure as to the playful remark about his never having a quarter of a dollar ahead in the world , and of the solemn and somewhat reserved way in which he spoke of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unknown . The rest embodies his general opinions , often expressed , that every rounded theory of the universe must be imperfect , that the Divine secret still remains undiscovered , and that scientists would be more profitably employed in extending the boundaries of positive science than in propounding any dogmatic system miscalled positive philosophy . Of one thing I am sure-he had a deep conviction , as strong as that of Augustine , or Bernard , or Luther , or Edwards , or Wesley , or Channing , that there were means of communication between the Divine and the human mind . He had an inward experience of this mystical fact-a fact which lies at the centre of all religion-almost as strong as that which we freely accord to the experience of men of religious genius . This " familiar grasp of things Divine " was not one of the least of the fascinations of Agassiz ; and he strenuously insisted that the human mind , in whatever direction of art , science , or literature it was exercised , would starve and dwindle on its own resources alone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by some Divine Power above it if it desired to be continuously powerful ; it must be open to inspiration from the Creator of the world if it would gather strene , th for the difficult task of investigating it . He thus proved that he possessed , in addition to the ordinai*y equipment of the accomplished man of science , that subtle spiritual essence which is called soul . Theologically speaking , all of us have souls , as well as bodies and understandings ; but in the common experience of life soul may be said to be a rare , an exceptional quality of human beings . It comes out in flashes here and there ; but the majority of men , as they ordinarily meet their fellows , indicate but slight possession of it . Hence the justification ' of the seeming profanity of the passionate artist who was trying to convince a dull man of culture that this mysterious quality was evident in the picture he was showing him . " I am not sure , " he at last exclaimed , as he found his exposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have any soul , but , by , I know that I have I " Certainly all who came into contact with Agassiz were made aware that he had a soul , whether or not they had one . Indeed , it flamed out in every expression of his magnificent nature , evident in every statement of fact or affirmation of principle , and in the simplest as well as the greatest things conveying the impression of intense , abundant-even superabundant-spiritual life . A belief in the immortality of the soul was , of course , natural to a man who had such an inward , vehement experience of its reality and force . " To execute great things , " says Vauvenargues , " a man must live as though he had never to die . " Agassiz lived in this way . He must have been surprised when he received the first intimation , about the age of fifty-five , that he was mortal . His physical health was so great that , when he was superintending the arrangement and publication of one of his early works , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desk at the rate of sixteen or eighteen hours a day , taking no exercise ; and when the delightful task was completed , he started on an excursion among the Alps , which exacted as much labor from his limbs as the months preceding it had exacted from his brain . In fact , he seemed , up to the period of his first attack of disease , utterly insensible to bodily as to mental fatigue . He never had an hour in his life when he was not pleasantly occupied , and he innocently wondered when the people he met in society sometimes complained of being bored with life . Every contrivance to kill time appeared to him the funniest of all jokes . " Time ! " he was wont to exclaim ; " my only trouble is that I have not enough time for my work . I can not understand why any body should be idle ; much less can I understand why any body should be oppressed by having time hang on his hands . There is never a moment , except when I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give to me the hours which you say are a bore to you , and I will receive them as the most precious of presents . For my part , I wish the day would never come to an end . " His recreations were only variations in his occupations . He told me ' that he had never known a dull hour in his whole life . He had many vexations in the course of his career , but his vexations were only new stimulants to his tireless activity . His experience of life was so intense and joyous that he hardly admitted the thought that he was not to live forever . Death , physical death , might alter his mode of activity . He admitted that this accident must happen to him at some time or another , but his faith in the continuousness of his individual life never wavered . To be ten minutes in his company was to obtain the strongest argument for the immortality of the soul . The grandeur of his scientific schemes , especially the scheme* of completing his museum , so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever-dilating mind , impressed you with the feeling that the physical man himself would never say die ' ' to the most importunate command of that grim skeleton who huddles into a common grave the philosopher whose brain is glowing with unrealized conceptions , and the husbandman who has only just relaxed his grasp on the plough . When Goethe heard of the death of his mother , he wondered why a woman of such incessant mental activity should have " consented to die . " Hundreds of the friends of Agassiz , who could not pretend to have a tenth part of his marvellous vitality , must have felt a similar wonder when they heard of his departure from earth . No two ideas seemed more incompatible than the idea of Agassiz and the idea of death ; for that grand soul , with its confident and exhilarating activity , exercised on large designs which could be completed within the limits of no mortal life , appeared to carry within it the principle of deathlessness ; and this impression was strengthened by the fact that what it could possibly achieve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it contemplated . He once told me , in illustration of the theory that the mind worked during even a dreamless sleep , that on one occasion , after toiling on a problem which he felt sure a few hours more of consecutive thinking would solve , he was compelled by physical fatigue to go to bed . He slept for some seven hours , and when he awoke he found the answer to his last obstinate questioning of nature clear in his mind . It would seem that this might be a faint type of the unwearied continuousness of his thinking faculty throughout all the long sleep of death . It is well known that he held to the doctrine of the immortality of the souls of animals as well as to the immortality of // the souls of men . In a conversation I had with him a number of years ago he attempted to explain to me his conception of the employments of a naturalist in the next stage of existence , and of the unbounded wealth of material which his soul would possess in observing the souls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that animals had no souls he , of course , emphatically dissented whenever it was brought forward . On one occasion , when the subject was up for discussion , I told him that in a recent visit to the country I had obtained confirmation of his theory from an unexpected *uarter , for I had overheard a farmer , who was goading a yoke of reluctant oxen to perform an impossible task , exhaust all the vocabulary of blasphemy on the poor beasts , singling out not their bodies , but their souls , as the things he specially desired to consign to eternal perdition , and that he was as particular in selecting the inward , unseen , immaterial essence of the toiling creatures for profane condemnation as he would have been in swearing at an average Christian man . " Ah ! " said Agassiz , with a laugh , " that reminds me how stupid most of the keepers of animals are , and how little the fellows know of the minds and feelings of the creatures they oppress . " He then went on to indicate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his interior knowledge of their natures . And indeed his sympathies included all kinds of animals , as they included all kinds of men , and he was repaid in kind . There is not , I think , a single instance of his having been injured by any serpent or beast , however poisonous or ferocious , though much of his life was passed in the company of animals . It is asserted that they have no language , but he found no difficulty in conversing with them , and they seemed to understand him very well , adapted as his modes of communicating with them were to their different natures . There probably never was a naturalist who combined such a knowledge of their physical organization with such a penetrating glance into what he called their souls . He was , in the *sthetics of zoology , the dramatist of the animal kingdom , as Shakspeare was the dramatist of the human race . Whether he had to do with a jelly-fish , or a whale , or an elephant , he knew each of them as Shakspeare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart outward , and not from the flesh inward . " It was curious to notice his behavior in presence of the domesticated animals . The ugliest , filthiest , stupidest , most unreasonable , most obstinate creature in the barn-yard is the pig , yet , with a stick in his hand , Agassiz would go up to the most unsociable , " cantankerous , " misanthropic grunter , and after a few soft words and a movement of the stick over the bristles of the creature in the right direction , the pig would lift its head erect , its small eyes would glisten with a vague intelligence , it would remain almost motionless in a kind of pleased surprise , and emit a sound indicative of as much content and comfort as are indicated by the purring of a cat . The neigh of a horse to him was a more friendly neigh than any ever heard by a hostler or a jockey . He carried serpents in his hat and in his pockets with a grand unconcern , and dropped them sometimes even in his bedroom , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coiled up in her boots . Whenever he entered a menagerie he was eagerly welcomed by lions , tigers , wolves , hyenas , and other beasts of prey , which considered even their keepers as stupid louts , but recognized in him the one person that they could have a rational conversation with . " Beauty , " says the poet , " is its own excuse for being . " Agassiz went beyond this tolerant maxim to the extent of affirming that Deformity has its own excuse for being . The fact that any animal existed was with him a justification of its existence ; and after conversing with it , and penetrating to its interior nature , he treated it as Shakspeare treated Dogberry , or Ancient Pistol , or Mrs. Quickly , or any of the other queer blood-relations connected with him through a common descent from Adam . As there was no form of human existence which was too low to be beneath the humane sympathies of Shakspeare , so there was no kind of animal existence which was too low to engage the sympathies of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kingdom had no malignant feeling toward him ; indeed , they cheerfully consented to let him kill them , knowing that by such a submission to his will they were practically elected as representatives of their species in the grand legislative assembly of the Animal Kingdom gathered in the great hall of the Museum of Comparative Zoology , under the // literal " Speakership " of Agassiz ; that is , under the man who was alone capable of being the interpreter of their language , so that its signs could be clearly understood by the human race , from which they were divided by peculiarities of organization and of soul . One can almost conceive of these martyrs of the animal kingdom as rejoicing while enduring the death which insured to the species to which they belonged an intelligent recognition of their merits from the members of the superior race , to whom they were thus introduced through his friendly agency . Whenever I look at them , preserved so carefully in their glass jars filled with alcohol , I for one am delighted to find them in such excellent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observer in the realm of zoology ; he was a powerful scientific thinker , and from his youth was intensely interested in the great question of clas*ification . He studied all the various systems of classification with intense interest , and came to the conclusion that the divisions of the animal kingdom according to type , class , order , family , genus , and species were not devices of the human understanding to classify its knowledge , but corresponded to ideas in the Divine Mind in His plan of creation ; and that this arrangement in nature was gradually discovered by science , not invented by it . He naturally desired to confer with the champions of all systems , and in his early manhood , after mastering the theory of Cuvier , he hastened to Germany to consult with Oken , the transcendentalist in zoological classification . " After I had delivered to him my letter of introduction , " he once said to me , " Oken asked me to dine with him , and you may suppose with what joy I accepted the invitation . The dinner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was the best dinner I ever ate ; for there was Oken . He unfolded to me , during the hours of a long afternoon , the principles of his system more completely than I could have obtained them from his books . There never was such a feast ! never before were such potatoes grown on this planet ! for the mind of the man seemed to enter into what we ate sociably together , and I devoured his intellect while munching his potatoes . I repeat it-I never ate such a dinner before or since. ** In connection with his studies on the true method of classifying animals , Agassiz was passionately interested in their geographical distribution . " If I live , " he once exclaimed , " I hope to be able to write a good book on that subject . It is of immense importance , having vital relations to other branches of investigation now pursued hy some of the best minds of our time . My convictions are almost settled on this matter . I think that the area over which animals roam is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am almost willing to assert that when God gave them legs He made the gift under the inexorable condition that they should never run away . The theories of Agassiz , as a thinker , are now the subject of vehement controversy among men of science . It is , however , my general impression that the facts necessary to place the Darwinian theory on the solid foundation of a law of nature are yet undiscovered ; and it was this absence of facts to confirm the most captivating of theories which impelled Agassiz to his passionate opposition , his noble rage , " whenever the theory was mentioned . Indeed , that theory was the bate noire of his later scientific life . It diverted him from his own selected paths of investigation into the turmoil of controversy , so that his scientific debates were carried on at the expense of limiting his scientific discoveries . He was conscious of it himself , for the last of his published essays records his belief that science suffers by every diversion of the energies of scientists which tends to substitute premature theorizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never undervalued the positive contributions that any of his opponents had made to zoology , and his admiration of Darwin was always warmly expressed , checked only by disagreement with him on theoretical grounds . Owen was another eminent Englishman whose fame he extended in the United States by enthusiastically pointing out to all questioners the grounds of his admiration of that great zoologist ; and when Owen was up for exposition or discussion , it was only by some side remark that his auditors learned that Owen and he were antagonists on certain disputed questions . He loved his scientific enemies as few Christians have grace enough to love their personal enemies ; but he always demanded that they should be men who were prac // tical investigators of the facts of zoology . For amateurs who took the facts at second hand , and built up ingenious systems by combining the discoveries of many specialists in science , he had an almost irrational indifference . I once asked him what he thought of an attack on his scientific position made by an accomplished scholar and thinker , who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his science , and had decided that he must be ranked in the second or third class . Agassiz burst into a roar of laughter , treating what I considered a serious attack as a great joke . " Why , just think of it , " he exclaimed ; " he undertakes to fix my place among zoologists , and he is not himself a zoologist 1 " He wondered that I did not join in the laugh at what he deemed the funniest literary incident that had recently occurred . " And , " he added , " do n't you know that he has never been an observer * " The meaning of " obscrvation , " in his 1mind , differed strangely from the common use of the word . With him it meant the strenuous exertion of all the faculties behind the eye , as well as the assiduous training of the eye itself . After he had been some fifteen years in the country I asked him what he thought was the best result here of his efforts as a teacher of science , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One of them , to be sure , has turned out to be my deadliest personal enemy ; but I still affirm that he is a good observer , and that is the best compliment I could pay him were he my dearest friend . " At the time that " spiritualism " was most popular in New England the men of science were adjured by intelligent ladies and gentlemen who thought they could believe the testimony of their eyes , and who thus considered themselves to be " observers , " to investigate the phenomena . Agassiz was among the foremost of the scientists who stepped forward in answer to this appeal , but he and his associates could not force the spiritualists to comply with any of the conditions under which scientists observe . They were constantly taunted for not in* vestigating the wonders which they were constantly prevented by the wonderworkers themselves from investigating according to the accredited methods of science . Agassiz during this controversy happened to meet Home , the chief magician of the sect , in a railway car . " It is sad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prejudices of you men of science interpose to prevent the advancement of science , owing to the fact that you refuse to investigate the phenomena which are nightly presented to all unprejudiced observers . " " Mr. Home , " was the reply , " I never refuse to investigate any thing which promises to advance science , and nothing will give me more delight than to investigate the marvels which occur , as you say , at your meetings . " " Well , then , " replied Home , " come this very night and witness the appearance of the spirit hand . " " Nothing will give me more pleasure , " answered Agassiz , " than to be one of the selected guests around the table where the spirit hand appears . My opinion is that it is a physical hand with a little phosphorus rubbed over it ; but I am open to con* viction . I am a little skilled in the use of weapons , and all I ask is that I shall have the privilege of putting my stiletto through it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it is ahumanhand , I feel confident in my power to transfix it on the table , much to the discomfort of its possessor . " Home declined the test . Such a want of faith , he said , would necessarily prevent the spirit hand from appearing . And , indeed , all means of investigation which Agassiz suggested were dismissed as not calculated to induce the spirits to communicate with any company of which he was a member . The geniality of the nature of Agassiz comprehended , as I have said , all mankind , and all the branches of the animal kingdom . His sympathies , in the full meaning of Wordsworth 's lines , " Aloft ascending , and descending down , Even to inferior kinds , " were universal ; but added to this was a personal affectionateness to his mother , his wife , his children , and his particulax friends which it was beautiful to witness . His fiftieth birthday was celebrated by the Saturday Club with a special dinnerand notable poems were read on the occasion by such friends as Lowell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too familiar to be quoted in full , but every reader will remember that they represent Nature as taking the boy by the hand , and leading him irresistibly on to his true vocation of discovering her secrets , which // she gladly unfolded to the favorite she had chosen . There were toil and struggle in the pursuit , but she still lured him on to his object , and " Whenever the way seemed long , And his heart began to fail , She would sing a more wonderful song , Or tell a more marvellous tale ' And at last came the crowning stanza , where the natural mother mourns over the seductions of the great mother , that have drawn her beloved son from the fireside where she wished to keep him : " And the mother at home says , Hark ! For his voice I listen and yearn ; It is growing late and dark , And my boy does not return . " I sat near Agassiz at the table , and watched the effect of the poem , as read in the quiet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was bent modestly down , with a musing smile on his lips , as he recalled the scenes of his childhood and youth ; but when came the allusion to his mother , it was curious to note the effect of natural emotion on a vigorous nature which had intrepidly and even gayly faced death in every form without the least fear of it . The ruddy face palpably reddened still more with restrained feeling ; in a second or two the tears gathered in the bright eyes , and as the last line was uttered , they dropped slowly down his cheeks , one after another , with that slight gasp of suppressed emotion in the throat which it is almost terrible to witness in a strong man . The silence that ensued could not have been more than half a minute , but it seemed to us who were present to endure an hour . Longfellow himself could not have dreamed of producing such an effect , for his tone of voice in the last verse was almost monotonous . But Agassiz recovered his equanimity as by magic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with eyes still glistening , bowed and smiled his acknowledgments to the poet with exquisite grace and good-fellowship . The ordinary course of conversation at a festive dinner then ran fluently on . It was the first time that I had seen a great , brave , strong man shed tears , and I am not ambitious of ever seeing it again . It was inexpressibly affecting and inexpressibly painful . It may be well to add that " Louis " was the favorite son of Madame Agassiz . She was the wife of a Protestant clergyman ; and Professor Silliman , who visited her in 1851 , tells us that although nearly fourscore , " her healthful person was erect , tall , and dignified , while her animated and warm address placed us instantly at ease . " As soon as Professor Silliman told . her that he was the friend of her son , that his adopted country welcomed him among its most precious possessions , " her strong frame was agitated , her voice trembled with emotion , and the flowing tears told the story of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The next morning she came , walking alone a long distance in the rain , to bid us farewell , and parted , evidently with deep emotion , and not concealed , for we had brought the vision of her favorite son near to her mental vision again . She brought for Mrs. Silliman a little bouquet of pansies , and bade us tell her son her pcns*es were all for him . " Such a mother ! In reading , but a few days ago , these passages from the journal of the venerable Professor Silliman , I detected the cause of the unwonted outbreak of sensibility which marked the celebration of the fiftieth birthday of Agassiz . Agassiz , when he first visited the United States , had no intention of making here his permanent home ; but he ended in becoming a passionate patriot of his adopted country , and his love for it , his delight in it , and his determination to remain in it , were expressed in terms which might almost have satisfied the requirements of Mr. Jefferson Brick . The warm recognition he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bat he also found that he soon became a favorite with every kind and variety of our people - scholars , merchants , manufacturers , mechanics , and farmers  --  and that he could not appear before any audience without receiving the most flattering testimonials of regard as well as of respect . The hearts , the minds , the purses , of the people were open to him . He often remarked to me , as he doubtless remarked to thousands of others , that he had never known such a population as ours . In Europe , if you desired to advance science , you had a hard task in getting money from kings and nobles ; but here , he said , the democracy seemed more liberal than kings and nobles . He never ceased to be amazed at the amount of money he obtained from our citizens and legislators in aid of his scientific schemes , and at the short space of time that was consumed in obtaining it . His surprise at first resembled that of // Jenny Lind when she faced the immense audience that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten dollars . " Where , " she asked Barnum , " does de peoples gets all de money ? " The recognition of Agassiz was not confined to the cultured or the moneyed classes . In his scientific explorations in various parts of the country he found that when he desired aid to unearth some curious object he had discovered , a few minutes ' talk with farm-laborers or miners near by would send them after him to the spot where they were to use their shovels and pickaxes in his unpaid service . His fame was so diffused that no queer living thing was caught in wood or river , no strange rock unearthed in opening the track for a new railroad , that was not sent to him as the one man in the country that could explain it . His magnetic power when he was himself in the field of observation resembled that of the Pied Piper of Hamelin , drawing all living creatures after him to the sound of his alluring music . He made every body interested in natural history who came within his sphere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , exceptions ; and the exception in the case of Agassiz was , as may easily be guessed , that of a hard-headed Yankee stage-driver among the New Hampshire hills . On one occasion , while journeying through the White Mountain region , he and his scientific companion , seated on the top of the stage , irritated the driver by repeatedly calling upon him to stop when they noticed any thing botanically fascinating on the road , and jumping down from their seats in order to obtain it . Professor Felton , who was with them , kept his seat during the whole ride , and told the driver , in explanation of their conduct , that they were naturalists . On the next day , when the coachman had another load of passengers , he narrated to those near him on the box the strange freaks of his yesterday 's companions . " Their keeper , " he added , " called them naterals ; and certainly they behaved as sich . " Agassiz came at last , as I have said , to love the country so dearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave it . He showed to me , shortly after the correspondence was closed , the series of letters which had passed between him and the minister of Napoleon III . The Emperor offered him the post of director of the Jardin des Plantes , with a seat , I think , in the Senate . The position was one which a scientific man of the highest rank might well covet , and the emoluments of the office , with that of the other office associated with it , were quite large . His acceptance of the offer would have given him at Paris a rank equal to that which Cuvier occupied in his time . He respectfully declined it , on the ground that he was then engaged in original researches in the United States , which promised to be ver*y fruitful in zoological discovery , and which would take him some years to complete . He considered that the correspondence was closed ; but he was surprised by receiving another letter from the minister , renewing the offer , and informing him that the high office would be kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Agassiz justly thought this was the greatest compliment ever paid to him ; but his determination to live and die in his adopted country was fixed , and his letter indicating this determination closed the correspondence . I preserve but a vague memory of the letters ; they will probably be published in the forth-coming biography of Agassiz by the accomplished and high-souled woman , the companion of his scientific journeys , the partner of his thoughts , troubles , anxieties , triumphs , and aspirations , who was at once the wife of his mind and of his heart . The simplicity , the earnestness , the depth of his affections , were never so clearly indicated to his friends as in the slightest reference he made to her . Such marriages are surely made in heaven before they are afterward consummated on earth ! Another bond which held him to the United States was his high esteem for our American men of science . He felt they were not properly appreciated abroad , especially'in England . He hoped to live to the time when this country would be recognized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a mere scientific colony of Germany , France , and Great Britain , when the judgments of our scientific associations and journals would confer or confirm reputations all over the world , and when none of our scientists would value , as some of them now do , a slight recognition in foreign journals of science more than the warmest appreciation from American organs of scientific opinion . On the latter point he was wont to indulge in delightful outbursts of noble rage . " Do n't // you see , " he exclaimed , " that every American man of science who is elated by foreign recognition , and makes it a mark of honor distinguishing him from his brethren here , stamps himself as a provincial as much as a Canadian or New Brunswick politician does when he is unduly excited by a favorable notice from the government at London Do you suppose that men like Bache , or Henry , or Peirce , or Wyman , or a dozen others , care what is said of them abroad ? They stand on what they are , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that every thing they really do to advance science passes inevitably into the current of scientific thought , and must be respected , whatever Edinburgh , or London , or Paris , or Berlin may say . They are metropolitans , not provincials ; and I hate to see an American of scientific genius show himself a provincial in spirit when his genius might easily place him among the metropolitans , and force foreigners , as far as in science any man can be a foreigner , to frankly acknowledge his equality with the best of them . You can easily make this country a centre of scientific intelligence if you discard the foolish notion that your true judges are not in your own country , but in Europe . Respect yourselves , and they will soon come to respect you . Be indifferent to what they say , if you desire them to say pleasant things of you . " Indeed , Agassiz spoke on this matter as we have heard some self-respecting men of letters speak of the abjectness of spirit which leads many of our authors to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some obscure critic in an English magazine or review as of more worth than the most careful , cordial , and intelligent judgment passed upon them by an American organ of literary opinion . Indeed , few native-born Americans accepted more thoroughly than Agassiz the ideas and sentiments on which our institutions are founded . He had a boundless confidence in the intellectual as well as the material future of the country . As he was himself brought into cordial relations with every class of our society , and was liked and aided by every class , he considered that pure science , which he specially represented , would always have its claims recognized by our democracy , if men of science followed his example in coming into close contact with the minds and hearts of the people . He had immense confidence in education ; but then he desired that educators should be persons capable not merely of communicating knowledge , but of communicating the sacred thirst for knowledge . In his will he described himself as " Louis Agassiz , Teacher . " Every school-master and school-mistress in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading that announcement , for it gave to his or her work a dignity which could not be denied , after one of the foremost minds of the age had adopted " teacher " as his peculiar distinction . Indeed , Agassiz always insisted that something resembling miracles might be wrought in reforming the people through informing them , if teachers could be inspired with the grandeur of the task imposed upon them ; and his hope for the future of the country rested on his firm belief that it would produce teachers competent to grapple with ignorance and vice , and educate the democracy , whose will , enlightened by knowledge , was to determine the fate of the land . He thought the profession of the teacher the noblest of all professions ; and he extended the office of teachers so as to include all good and great minds engaged in disseminating knowledge or in increasing it . He himself gloried in the title of school-master , and preferred it to that of professor ; no school - master or school-mistress ever conversed with him ten minutes without gaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that comprehensive mind and opulent soul ; and there is no danger that our young democracy will grow up to manhood unfitted to perform their duties and vindicate their rights , provided the spirit of Agassiz animates their teachers . @
