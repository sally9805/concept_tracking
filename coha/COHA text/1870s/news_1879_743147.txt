txt The Dominion of Canada is in the position of a man whose enterprising spirit has carried him far beyond the limits of his available resources , and who is driven to ** expedients to avert disaster . One of its most capable financiers months ago expressed the anxiety with which he contemplated the rapid accumulation of public indebtedness . Sir A. T. GALT is not a pessimist in politics , but his fears were aroused by an increase of obligations not warranted by any increase of ability to meet them . It matters not that the author of the warning is now in England , an official abettor of the policy lie deplored . The fact remains that the warning was dictated by a sagacious business experience , and that the reasons which called it forth have been fortified by the measures of another Administration and by events whose significance can not be easily exaggerated . First came a new tariff , extravagantly protectionist in its character , enacted in obedience to a demand which only the recklessness of industrial and mercantile depression could have invested with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a Pacific Railroad policy , that would have seemed wild enough In prosperous times and with the best possible relations subsisting between the Empire and the Dominion ; but which , in the midst of financial peril ' and with imperial feeling alienated by a hostile tariff , looks like madness . As an appropriate commentary on the condition of business and the failure of the tariff to produce the immediate invigoration that was . expected from it , we have had tidings of a succession of bank'failures in the chief city of the Dominion , coupled with multiplying evidence of falling revenue , continued depreciation of values , and a wide-spread loss of heart and hope . And now comes a telegraphic intimation that the Ministers who went from Ottawa to London with the view of obtaining t n imperial guarantee to a loan in behalf of the Pacific Railroad , have not ventured formally to submit their request , which is regarded with disfavor by all parties . Canadian politicians of both parties lost their heads for a time under the excitement that attended the beginning of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , difficulties to which a stunted statesmanship had proved unequal , and they imagined , like the fabled frog , that mere pretension and puffing would insure the possession of greatness . In this frame of mind , they assumed enormous obligations , quite as much on account of the . Empire as because of any estimate of their own probable wants . The Intercolonial Railroad is a fair specimen of enterprises of this character . Judged by an ordinary business standard , there was no more need of the Intercolonial Road than of that part of the Grand Trunk which the Ottawa authorities have recently purchased . The route finally selected for the Intercolonial took it altogether out of the business category , and exhibited it in its proper aspect , ? that , namely , of a military road , which the Empire would find useful in the event of war with the United States . An imperial guarantee of the loan raised for building the road ( lees not extenuate the folly of the policy which led a group of poor and struggling Provinces , with a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , should have been borne by Great Britain alone . But the folly extends much further . Notwithstanding the information that there would be no further guarantees , the Provinces still clung to imperial ideas . British Columbia was induced to link its fortunes with theirs ,  --  the inducement being the promised construction of a road across the continent . The Pacific Railroad scheme is the result . That Canada staggers under the load , and realizes the possibility ' of bankruptcy if the load be not reduced , is apparent to any one who follows the current of provincial thought and . notes the swimor-sink tone of the measures adopted by the men in power . True courage and true honesty would impel them to avow the inability of the Dominion , in its present condition , to fulfill the obligations incurred . They would postpone to a more convenient season the prosecution of a gigantic undertaking to whose requirements the Provinces , unaided , are unequal . The mission to England of which we hear this morning is a formal confession of the fact . The necessity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfriendly tariff is in full play , shows with how little sagacity the affairs of the Dominion are managed . Sir JOHN MACDONALD and his colleagues must have known as well six months ago as now that either imperial help must be obtained or that their Pacific Railroad plans must be deferred indefinitely . Their entire policy should have been framed accordingly . Instead of preserving a harmonious whole , they constructed a tariff that will be more injurious to England than to the United States ; and having thus flung defiance into the face of England 's embarrassed trade , they proceeded with a railroad scheme that is utterly impracticable without England's. help . It is not surprising that the Ottawa gentlemen encounter the cold shoulder in Downingstreet and shrink from a public announcement of the chief object of their visit . To boast of being independent of imperial influence when a tariff is in question , and to humbly pray for imperial money when a railroad is to be built , is one of those impudent paradoxes which John Bull is not ina humor to appreciate . Even supposing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reports that reach him from day to day can not fail to impress on him the futility of the fiscal policy of Canada as a means of extricating it from difficulties . No one proposes to make the protectionist tariff responsible for the collapse of five or six banks and the distrust that prevails in the Dominion from end to end . But though the failures , and the distrust they have intensified , are not products of protectionist legislation , they show that the predicted results of the tariff have not been realized , that the immediate gains which it was expected to yield are not iu hand , and , especially , that the want of confidence from which the trade of the Dominion suffers has been increased , not lessened , by the change . The British public can not be deceived as to the scopo of any loan of credit granted to the Dominion in its present financial plight . A guarantee in this case would mean au almost certain assumption of debt ; and imperial interests , already strained to the utmost , are not in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
