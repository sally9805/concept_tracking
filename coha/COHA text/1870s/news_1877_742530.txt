txt A gentleman by the name of KIMBALL has gained a reputation by his successful efforts to discharge churches from debt , We hear of him at work in San Francisco , where he line inspired at least one religions society to lift a debt of $30,000 , and we have him now in New-York , whore he addresses himself to the liquidation of church debts of hundreds of thousands of dollars . It is a noble undertaking , and Mr , KIMBALL may very justly bo called a missionary in a new . field . Ho has boon instrumental in bringing about a revival of a high form of churcli enterprise . Ho might have boon spared these labors if , before his time , another missionary had preached the gospel of keeping out of debt . It is , doubtless , a very honorable and laudable thing to pay one 's old debts . ' But it is better never to have any . The hard times have brought to light a groat many burdens which wore heretofore kept out of sight , and the missionary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crusade , sufficiently advertised the weight of many borne by the churches . Naturally enough , the men who control church building affairs are extravagant in their management , if they are in their own private business . Costly churches have gone up as freely as costly banks , hotels , and private residences have . But there has been more venturousness in the ecclesiastical enterprises than in the secular ones . The gorgeous house of worship has been built with the proceeds of checks drawn on the bank of the future . It has been argued in nearly every ease that a lino church will " draw , " and that more people will come in and help to pay the debt , if they see a pile of carved stone , decorated with stained glass , and sumptuous with upholstery , opening its doors to them . When the times of shrinkage come , the members of the society stagger under burdens that are greater than they can bear . Nor does it need a costly church to oppress its builders with impending failure . A church society in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only as a temporary chapel , while preparations were being made to erect the more ambitious structure which was to be the church . With that delightful confidence in the future which characterizes so many church builders , the society mortgaged the " chapel " for $20,000. ' rho grand church has never been built , and last week the mortgage on the chapel was foreclosed , the unpaid interest on it having then amounted to $1,379 . How many little churches have gone the same way , disappointed and harassed Pastors and people can . tell . On the tombstone of numberless promising church enterprises may be written , " Died of Debt . " But the great , busy , and prosperous congregations who are so proud of having " a big debt " do not dread extinguishment . They rather think that a church debt is a church blessing . They fancy that it inspires their members with laudable motives , gives them something to work for , and maintains a certain industrial centre around which the workers can always rally . When an appeal is made to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the cheery reply is : " Oh , wo have a big debt , and we can not be expected to do much elsewhere until that is paid off . " And when the work of raising the debt is really taken up , the enthusiastic members go about announe.liig the fact with great satisfaction , as if the enormous figures of the sum to be raised were something to be very proud of indeed . Their preacher is eloquent , their choir superb , and their edifice is conspicuously grand ; but their big debt , after all , is the pot of the parish . They have nursed it with care , and now they advertise it with pride . There is always a certain avoidance of personal responsibility in associate enterprises ' which deceives most people . Members of a religious society occupied in paying off h church debt talk about it as blithely as if it wore nothing to bo.ashamed of . If 0110 of these cheerful Christians were hard at work paying for his own private extravagance , or that of his brother or father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when one hears of the glorious labors of a society which is paying off a big debt , with the admiration which the report excites , there comes the question , How does it happen that these people ever contracted such enormous obligations Y It is fit that men should build costly churches when they can pay for them , The people who murmur at the expenSe lavished on temples built for the worship of Goy would have murmured because the alabaster-box of ointment , " very precious , " was not sold for the benefit of the poor . But to build an expensive church with little or no ready cash , with the vague idea that , somehow , " the LORD will provide , " is not right ; often it is dishonest . The Christian 's faith is bEtaut ) ful and sublime . Inspired by it men have " . subdued kingdoms , wrought righteousness , obtained promises " ; but this is not the sort of faith which should load win to thihlt they can glorify GOD with borrowed moTioy . It is a shame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a church edifice shingled all over with mortgages . And at least one religious denomination sets a good example to the rest of the world by refusing formal dedication to a church which is not paid for . As wo have seen , the incubus of a church debt ? is bad for a congregation which labors under it ; and even t-to spasmodic attempts to lift it are destrue iV3 of forces which ought to be directed to other purposes ; and , what is worse than either of these , an element of dishonesty is liable to creep into the business transactions of a debt-burdened church soCiety . Since it is as true now as it was eighteen centuries ago , that the children of this ' world are wisew in their day than the children of light , we must not expect that the temporal affairs of the churches shall be managed with worldly wisdom . They should be managed with a prudence and honesty that may be as a light to the world .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
