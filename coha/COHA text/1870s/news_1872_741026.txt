txt In Nodaway County , Missouri , there resides an old farmer , ' who appears to have suffered severely iu what most persons will be disposed to believe a very foolish cause . Living in a sort of semi-barbaric style , on the verge of a picturesque wood , and having spent more than his neighbors in the education of a large family of daughters , he became accustomed to regard it as exceedingly impertinent for the sons of other farmers to visit his house with matrimonial intentions . To such an extent did he cultivate this opinion that the daughters themselves , fearful that they might be doomed to be old maids , grew impatient , and resolved to encourage eligible bachelors on their own account . The courtship was all the more romantic and inspiriting through having to be done at secret places in the wood . Signals were exchanged , so that the lovers might never be surprised at their trysting places . This system was continued for a considerable time without any hope that the " stern parent " could be brought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was considered desirable that one of the daughters should elope by way of experiment , to see how the old man would be affected . The result was a shooting match , which ended in a compromise , and the . marriage of the disobedient fair one with the youth of her choice . = The success of the scheme so charmed the second daughter and her lover that they , in a reasonable .. time afterward , resolved to go and do likewise . As in the first instance , they , ttob , were discovered , and the shooting scene was re-enacted . Happily for the combatants , some friends interposed , and the affair terminated without either having been wounded seriously , the lovers being in due course made happy . After this it came to 1 ) o regarded . as a risky thing to undertake the courtship of the remaining daughters ; but as the young men were not wanting-in either courage or enterprise , furtherelopements were planned and successfully carried out , until the old man was robbed of all his treasures , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spared to him by reason of her tender years . However , misses of thirteen and fourteen Summers do not take long to bloom into marriageble young ladies , and this case , as it so happened . proved no exception .. Being the last of the family , , she was looked upon as the greatest prize , and . as a consequence , the competitors the watchful old man , the undutiful ( laughter jumped into the baggy of the most venturesome of her lovers , and started at break-neck speed for the Iowa hne . As ill-luck would have it , however , the enemy was encountered on the way . and what promised to be a deadly contest commenced with revolvers . The old man dismounted and used . his horse as a shield against the murderous bullets that were aimed at ? him . The young girl took refuge under the seat of the buggy and called to her valiant lover " to sail in and  --  cripple old dad . " After such an admonition , as may be expected , the lover felt stronger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " around his antagonist . Not being able to get a chance at him without destroying the " shield . " the inglorious youth resolved to shoot through the body of the horse . The plan succeeded so wellithat the old man , having had one of the fingers of his right hand carried away , threw his pistol upon the road . Sharp as thought , the lover roseatod himself in the buggy , and never drew rein until he arrived at the house of a magistrate , whore the pair were united in wedlock . It will be remembered that the fights which followed all preceding elopements in ' this family invariably ended in forgiveness and reconciliation , although the readiness of . the old man to make terms was , in ioint of fact , not attributable to a sudden change of sentiment . He would still have vengeance if be could , , but , finding the intended sons-in-law wounded , while he had oul'y received a scratch or two , he thought it better to arrange matters . In the case of the last daughter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old man who came off second best ; and , in order to balance the account , be procured a warrant for the arrest of the young man on a charge of attempted murder . ' The bride has since been found . but without the bridegroom  --  the whereabouts of the latter , as she asserts , being entirely unknown to her . Now , it is quite evident from - the unhappy experience of these young persons , that it is not always good policy to cripple the pursuing parent in the bands , for this may only impede his progress an hour , . at most , whereas the slightest touch of a bullet lower down , say at the cap of the knee , or the ankle , can be relied upon to provide him with as much as he can attend to for several weeks . If there are any other families addicted to the queer practices above de-. scribed , this hint may be worth attention .                   @ @
