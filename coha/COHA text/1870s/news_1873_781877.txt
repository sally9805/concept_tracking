txt Many of the circumstances in connection with the Tweed trial are quite as disgraceful as the original robberies of the Tweed gang . We can not prevent a man proving faithless to his trust . We can not always make sure that a public officer will refrain from stealing the public money . But when . an instance of dishonesty has been discovered , and enormous robberies have been brought home to a man , it is a great misfortune and scandal to the community to find that it is impossible to bring him to justice . To have a fury deliberately packed by two Tammany agents , for the trial of the chief Tammany thief , and to see a large part of the Press exulting over the outrage  --  all this is not a spectacle calculated to increase the respect with which New-York is regarded either at home or abroad . It does more to disgrace our City than anything which has happened for two years past . It is all the more intolerable from the fact that the people have made groat exertions to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had accumulated around them . In this object they have been to a great degree successful , but only after long and . repeated efforts . We have now , for the most part , honest judges upon the bench ? there may bo reasons for suspecting two or three of them , but great progress toward a thorough reform of the Judiciary has unquestionably been made . Of course , however , if the rogues who plundered the City have still the power to - pack juries ? as DRENNAN , DOUGLAS TAYLOR , and CHARLES E. LOEW undoubtedly have  --  our reforms practically amount to very little . This is an abuse to which few free nations have ever tamely submitted . Commissioner TAYLOR , Sheriff BRENNAN , and County Clerk LOEW have not the slightest doubt that the people of New-York will quietly submit to it , and at any rate they are prepared to take the risks . TWEED boasted . to a Herald reporter on Friday that no jury in this City could be found to convict him , and while TAYLOR and . BRENNAN and LOEWrepresenting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ juries , he is not likely to , find himself mistaken . Facts and . evidence will count for nothing . The majority of the jury which failed to agree the other day , knew what their decision would be before they had heard a word of the testimony . The Tribune backed them up by suppressing material evidence , and by constantly abusing the counsel for the prosecution . It had no word . to say against TWEED  --  but against the counsel who prosecute him no aspersions are too sweeping . Once more , yesterday . it spoke of the " blunders of the prosecution . which were patent to everybody . " And yet It can not specify a single blunder which the prosecution committed . It also has the impudence to speak of the counsel for the people as a " little ring of unfledged lawyers . " and the " Attorney-General 's Ring . " Against the Tammany Ring it never had a grudge ; it reserves its censure for the lawyers who are endeavoring to bring the thieves to justice . Its original failure to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious blunder  --  its adherence to TWEED now , and its wild abuse of all who are engaged in the effort to bring him to justice , is a still more unpardonable error . The Herald is equally consistent , and even more candid , in its defense of TWEED . It attacks GARVEY , and says it can not form an opinion upon TWEED 'S innocence or guilt . It is evident that a very good jury for the new trial could be drawn from the " intellectual department " of the Herald . " We want to know definitely , " says that journal , " whether TWEET is a criminal or an injured man . " The evidence has long ago satisfied every honest and intelligent man on that point , but the Tribune and Herald first suppress that evidence , then abuse the witnesses who gave it , and finally bully the counsel for the prosecution , as if they were the real culprits . We are inclined to think that the public will not much admire this course of the " independent " Press . To-morrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and we suppose BRENNAN , TAYLOR , and LoEw will put their beautiful heads together , and ransack the slums for another jury warranted " not to agree . " It is of no use warning these men against trespassing on the patience of the public too far . If the events of the past two years have taught them nothing , all the arguments in the world would be thrown away upon them . We hope , however , that Mr. TRFMAIN and Mr. PECKHAM will have no scruple this time about protesting in open Court against any frauds which they may have reason to suspect are being attempted . Public feeling is much aroused on the subject , and the counsel for the people will assuredly have the people with them in any attempt they may make to secure an honest jury . We have got rid of the masters of Tammany  --  it is a little too much to expect us to allow their valets to pack our jury-boxes and corrupt our courts . Let them rest satisfied with winning over the " independent " newspapers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
