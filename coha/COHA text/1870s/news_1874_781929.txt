txt We have the highest respect , personally , for the Democratic candidate for Congress from the Tenth District , Mr. A. S. HEwI LT . We are aware of the exigencies of a party campaign , and that very respectable candidates will make assertions on a platform which they would not venture to repeat in private . Still , we can not but think that Mr. Hewitt , in his recent speech to his electors , drew somewhat freely on his character as a man of accuracy , and imposed somewhat more boldly than is customary on the presumed ignorance of his constituents . Mr. Hewitt is a political economist , and it would . be interesting to have from him a more detailed explanation of his theory that the general depression of business is largely owing to Gen. GRANT 'S spending the three ' Summer mouths at Long Branch . The logical sequence of the two facts would be valuable to trace , and would form a fresh contribution to a somewhat dry science . We , of course , expect every Democratic orator to charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Administration which is in power . The candidate from the Tenth District is not above employing this sophism . He counts upon the ignorance of the working men in the north-eastern quarter , but we may remind him that there are there many laborers and shopkeepers who , if they have not studied ADAM SMITH , SAY , and MILL , have at least used their common sense during the past few years . And . when Mr. HEWITT warns them that it is an irredeemable paper currency which has brought all their calamities on the laboring class , and that the party in power are responsible for that , he goes " beyond the record , " which they know as well as the orator . Mr. HEWITT is too much of an economist to praise paper currency without ' redemption . But when he claims a " hard-money " policy for the Democratic Party , or oppose tion to irredeemable paper as a Democratic principle , his own electors have only to read the newspapers , or to recall last Winter 's Congres sional votes , to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and nothing more . We have republished , within a few days , the views of the leading Western Democratic organ  --  the Chicago Times  --  on the lesson be derived from the Democratic victories in Indiana and Ohio . This shrewd journal sees anything but the triumph of " hard-money " in those victories . And the votes of last Winter show that the Democratic Party are hopelessly divided on that question , and are not at all either a free-trade or hard-money party . Mr. Hxwirr knows perfectly well that at this moment a far larger proportional vote could be polled in the Republican ranks for a speedy and definite return to specie payments than within the Democratic lines . It is true that " irredeemable currency is the robbery of the poor , " as all ages and . countries have experienced , and it will be true during the coming Winter that the wolf will be at the door of many an honest laboring man in the Tenth District , and this mainly because Congress has not had courage to settle the currency for the future , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other ; indeed we may say that the Democratic is more guilty than the other , as it contains the larger proportion of inflationists . It is easy to excite the discontent of the working man , and to direct it toward the party in power . But is this an honest course for a politician who speaks to a wider audience than the constituents of the Tenth District , and who should regard as his greatest treasure his life-long reputation for honor and truth ? Are the present difficulties of the business world any more chargeable on Gen. GRANT than on Gov . Szvaroua or Mr. Tmoraq ? Do they belong any more to Senator MORGAN than Senator Schultz or Senator BAYARD I ' Has not , on the other hand , paper currency led to over-production and gambling speculations , which have brought their usual penalties ? And for paper currency , who can claim exemption of responsibility ? Both parties should humbly cry " Peccavi ! " and set themselves to the task of proving repentance by works . When the Republicans have finally refused to do this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inflationists.
