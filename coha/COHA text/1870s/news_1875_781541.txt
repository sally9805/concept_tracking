txt New-York State is almost alone in retaining the oppresive and antiquated Usury laws of a previous century , its only companions iu this restriction upon comb merce beins . Delaware and Oregon . It is now more than a hundred year since ilte great exponent of common law deelared that ninny good and learned men had " formerly " very much perplexed themselves and others as to tle morality of charging a price for the loan of money ; and certainly since his day the opinion that money should be borrowed and paid , or bought and sold , upon whatever terms the parties to the contract may agree to , and like any other property , has everywhere gained ground rather than lost it . Indeed , so true is this that it may be said that among no English-speaking people , except in New-York , Delaware , and Oregon , and scarcely in any civilized nation , is it held , in the courts of either law or morals , that the lender of money should forfeit it because he charged au excessive hire for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owner should lose all right to his property by receiving au exorbitant rent . The reasons for the general holding of this opinion upon Usury laws are neither few nor deeply hidden . They were intended as aids to the oppressed borrower , whereas all experience has shown that without removing his iieeessities they greatly add to his difficulty in finding means of relief , by driving him from reputable lenders to unconscionable Shylocks , who never fail to make the borrower reimburse them both for the use of their money and for their risk in evading the law . And that Usury laws are , not occasionally but habitually , violated no mercantile borrower need be told . The method is so safe and simple that there is no reason why it should not be practiced . The borrower has only to contract to pay the legal rate of interest , and to have an " understanding " with the lender that when the debt is due an additional gratuity will be given him . Thus the contract is not illegal , the lender gets his usury , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizens ' respect for its laws by enacting without enforcing them . But a more immediately conclusive objection to the obnoxious law in this State is found in the example of the State itself , for while refusing to allow its citizens to take more than seven per cent . interest , even by voluntary and express agreement , it exacts twelve per cent . from its unwilling debtors . And this is not the worst , for the same power which enacted a general law in restraint of taking more than seven per cent . has created more than one privileged corporation which may take not twelve per cent . only , but two per sea . a month . Inconsistency uonld go no further . A fixed rate should lie set at which looney should draw interest , in the abstlice , of any express agreement  --  a regulation necessary , for instance , to prevent litigation , to its the proper return upon trust , moneys iu the hands of the Trustee , and for other less important and equally obvious purposes . And in the second place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the legal rate of interest to he in writing . Beyond this , the State need do nothing ; and such is substantially the law in several States , among them being Connecticut and Massaehmetts . The rate to be fixed by law is of minor importance , since it is at best an entirely arbitrary standard , which can not and should not vary with the daily fluctuations of the market . The legal rate of Louisiana is live per cent. , and of Wyoming Territory twelve per cent. , between which extremes come a score of States with six per cent. , nearly half that number with seven per cent. , three with eight per cent , and live with ten per cent. , as their respective rates of legal interest . The disproportion in favor of six per cent . is considerable ; but in view of the fact that within a slue period two States at least have raised their rate from six to seven per cent. , there does not seem to be sufficient reason for altering the present statute of this State in that respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be confidently predicted , and is not without examples close at home . Avaricious brokers and greedy money-shavers would find their occupation largely transferred to powerful and respectable corporations , which could afford to lend money at rates fixed by its value rather than by the necessities of the borrower , and kept within reasonable rates by the competition of an open market . On the other hand , the present law is of a piece with the outgrown sumptua ry laws of half a dozen generations ago . It was modeled after the law of Eugland when the nation was in its infancy , but , unlike its English prototype , it still remains a reproach to the statute-book . As we before said in a previous brief commentary upon the Supremo Court decision , the statute it impugns is useless became of its constant evasion ; and it is also absurd , vicious , and antiquated , for it first makes a crime of that which is essentially innocent , and then punishes the offense created by arbitrary and extravagant penalties .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
