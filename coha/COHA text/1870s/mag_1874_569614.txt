ARTICLE Ii-GOTT UND DIE NATIJR . Gott und die Natur , von Prof. ULIUcI , o Prof. der Phulosophie an der Universitiit ilalle . Zweite Auflage . Leipzig . Weigel. 1866 . THE works of Prof Tllriei stand in the front rank of the various reconstructive attempts which have been made in Germany since the breaking up of the great philosophical schools . Apart from its intrinsic merit , the work in hand is interesting as showing that German thought has entered upon a new and more healthy direction ; and one which , we may hope , will result in at least some relief from the materialistic gloom which has followed like an avenger upon the previous idealistic glow . The attempt to make the absolute the first principle , the beginning of knowledge , was common to all the later theorizing . Beginning with the notion of the absolute , the problem of philosophy was to trace its necessary development into its relative manifestations . Nothing short of an a priori construction of God and the world was to be thought of . To pay any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that philosophy should be based on facts was to degrade the Bird of Jove into a barnyard fowl , and yoke Pegasus to a plow . With Schelling , the absolute was the pure identity of subject and object , the absolute indifference of opposites . It was neither subject nor object , mind nor matter , ideal nor real , but it was all these at once . The task of Schelling 's philosophy was to show how this pure indifference , which was at once everything and nothing , must develop itself into the polarities of the actual world . ilegel and his followers conceived the problem in essentially the same way . They were even more superior to facts than Schelling ; while they took logic itself by the horns and announced the identity of contradictories as the first principle of philosophy . With ilegel all development is but the unfolding of the absolute idea according to the eternal laws of logic . This climbs through conquered contradictions from point to point , ever uniting opposites in a higher unity in its upward movement , until at last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pure unconscious thought returns into itself ; the absolute finds itself again ; and the circle is complete . To give no further examples : the first fault of all this absolutist theorizing was that the absolute , as these and kindred speculators conceived it , is merely a subjective notion , which corresponds to no objective fact whatever . If we are to begin philosophy and science with the absolute , then , inasmuch as the absolute is given only in thought and never in perception , there must be first of all a strong , cogent proof that the subjective notion corresponds to objective reality . This proof failing , the whole argument floats in the air , and conceri*s itself with fancies instead of facts . But in order to give this proof it next becomes necessary to inquire into the validity of the laws of thought upon which the affirmation of the absolute depends . The absolute is no fact of experience ; the affirmation of it rests entirely upon certain subjective needs . The mind declares that there must be more than we see and hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be an abiding deep of being below ; that besides the finite and conditioned objects of experience , there must be something unconditioned and eternal . But are we justified in attributing objective validity to these notions ? This is , indeed , the great question of philosophy ; the one which sceptics have thrust upon the thinker 's attention from the beginning ; and the one which Kant answered with a tremendous No . Before the absolutist can begin his theorizing at all , he must first rout and silence the sceptics , and reverse the decision which Kant based upon an analysis of reason itself . The second fault is that thought falls into insoluble contradictions in attempting to represent such a development . Not to notice the contradiction in the notion of a necessary development of the absolute , these speculators never succeeded in completing the evolution without cutting the ground from under their feet . If we assume , with Schelling , that the absolute is the pure indifference of opposites , it becomes utterly inconceivable that it should not remain pure indifference forever . Schelling felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the absolute to set the evolution a-going . Accordingly he assumes an obscure duality in the absolute , a // dark nature-ground , which by some unexplained accident fell out into reality and produced the antitheses of God and world , mind and matter , ideal and real , &amp;c . To spend no time in inquiring into the thinkability of such a process , or into Schelling 's sources of information on this interesting point , it is sufficient to remark that by the introduction into the absolute of this dark nature-ground , of these blind polarities , the assumed identity and indifference of the same is destroyed . The original dualism remains unconquered , and the system stands in contradiction with itself We succeed no better if , with ilegel , we conceive the absolute as pure thought . We lack proog first , that there is any absolute thought or idea ; second , that such idea , if it exist , can be conceived as existing apart from an absolute thinker ; third , that such thought can deveop into concrete being . It is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belonging to any one in particular , and which thus take to realizing themselves . The entire system lacks the moment of inertia or resistance . It is simply so pliant and various as to include all views , from the loftiest idealism to the atheism of Feuerbach and the materialism of Strauss . Voices are heard and sounds as of great deeds ; but in this case ignorance is surely the mother of devotion . For these reasons we must agree with the author in rejecting the theorisings of the absolutists as " words , words , words . " On this road no advance can ever be won . It begins and ends alike in the land of dreams and fancies , and impenetrable fogs . The author 's conception of the problem of philosophy reverses completely the direction of this speculation . The knower is the first element in knowledge . The knowing mind is the constant factor which enters into every equation of science . Belief doubt , denial , all are subject to the laws of thought . Escape from them is impossible . Sceptic as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are these laws trustworthy ? If not , then there is an end to all philosophy and science . This question must be preliminary to all discussion . This question the author discusses in his System der Logik . ( See New Englander , July , 1874 . ) Granting that these laws are valid , what is the test of knowledge ? A thought-necessity is the // only valid test . Whatever we can not help admitting must be admitted ; and nothing else can lay claim to reality . But in the first instance all knowledge is self-knowledge ; it arranges itself around the knowing mind as its major axis ; and we are to assume the existence of nothing else , unless we are compelled . But by the laws of thought we are forced to recognize an outer world . The mind finds a manifold of objects standing over against itself . Escape them it can not ; the admission of their reality is unavoidable . Unless compelled to go farther , we must stop here . Analysis and reflection may force us to make further assumptions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only such as the facts force upon us . Immediately , we know nothing of absolute , infinite , unconditioned , &amp;c. ; and the objectivity of these notions must in no wise be affirmed unless a necessity of thought compel us to do so . The contact , too , of these notions can not be determined beforehand , but must depend entirely upon our internal and external experience . How we shall conceive the absolute-what qualities we shall ascribe to it , are questions which no a priori speculation has any means of answering . This , then , is the course of knowledge . We begin with experience , external and internal . Analysis and reflection reveal that we can not stop with them but must proceed to certain assumptions concerning their cause and ground . By the necessities of thought we pass from the facts of experience to the metaphysical notions of cause , absolute , &amp;c . Hence the absolute can never be the beginning of knowledge , but is rather the end of investigation . We can pass from the conditioned to the unconditioned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we may build , the foundations must be laid in the solid earth . It is a wide-spread thought of many that science has laid such successful siege to all Theistic strongholds , that a surrender at discretion is only a question of time . Science is mentioned in certain quarters as a young Hercules who has already strangled an unlimited number of theological snakes , and who will , as soon as he gets out of his cradle , proceed to cleanse the human mind from the worse than Augean filth which the superstition of ages has allowed to fester there . Or it is a glacier , descending with irresistible force upon the valleys where faith has // nourished its high and tender dreams , and will by its frosts strike a speedy and fatal chill to the heart of all that the soul has cherished . Now if it be indeed true , there is nothing to be gained by shutting our eyes to the danger . Denunciation is not argument ; and terror is powerless with law . The only way out of the present trouble is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wcrd that science can utter , and see if the facts warrant the prophecies . This is the road upon which the author has entered . Furnished with the philosophical principles we have noticed , he proposes to discuss scientific theories in the light of scientific facts . It must be observed that a large part of science is not fact , but theory . For example , the law of multiple proportions and constant equivalents is a fact of chemistry , and one which plays a most important and beneficent roll in nature . To explain this fact , Dalton revived the atomic theory of Democritus , and later scientists have very generally accepted it . But the atomic theory is far enough from being a fact of observation ; it is simply a supposition which science makes in order to form some faint kind of notion of the internal nature of matter upon which the law of multiple proportions depends . Certain phenomena of light and heat are observed , and for their explanation a peculiar *ther is postulated ; here again we have a supposition made only to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the underlying activity in these phenomena . Again , various resemblances are noticed among the several members of the animal kingdom , and science sets itself to account for them . One school explains them by a plan common to all ; another by assuming a common origin . Neither view claims to be an observed fact ; both are hypotheses which explain the facts more or less indifferently . Thus it becomes plain that there is a vast amount of intellectual scaffolding in science , and it is precisely in this part of science that its danger lies . That which is really a makeshift of the mind , in order to form some conception of the antecedents of phenomena , is forthwith interpreted into a fact of nature , and sundry mischievous doctrines are built upon it . At all events , we are justified in insisting that the theories thus introduced sh0uld be thinkable . If they involve unthinkable conceptions , then the explanation is // through the unknown , which leaves us no wiser than before . We are also justified in demanding that the theories , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are invented to explain the facts and then fail to give any tenable account of them , they are of no very striking service . So in the light of scientific facts we have , first , to undertake a criticism of scientific theories ; and second , to inquire whether these theories themselves do not postulate something beyond and above them . It will surprise no one acquainted with scientific literature to learn that the author finds the metaphysics of physics fearfully out of joint . Thus , matter and force are the first words in the scientific catechism . They alone were in the beginning , and they alone created the heavens and the earth . Such is the view , not indeed of our best scientists , but of many who claim the name . But what is matter , and what is force , and what are their relations to one another ? Surely , it is not unreasonable to insist upon having something more than a nominal definition of these important notions . At all events , if science is unable to tell what it means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind and spirit are not the realities of creation ; that phenomena are not the realization of the abiding thought underneath ? It must be confessed that very many of our scientists seem never to have reflected upon these questions , and those who have , have not met with any striking success . According to llelmholtz , matter is something resting and inactive . It has no qualitative differences whatever , for these belong to its inherent forces . ( Erhaltung der Krafi , s. 3 f . ) But how the absolutely inactive could accomplish anything to speak of , is not easily made out . To help us out of this trouble , matter is endowed with certain unchangeable forces , but we experience little relief . It is possible to conceive of inactive matter as moved by external forces ; but how the inactive can at the same time possess these forces , that is , how the inactive can be at the same time the active , certainly is visible only to those gifted with at least second sight . According to this view , matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all kinds of activity-which is simply a conjunction of contradictions , a logical chimera . But if the forces which move matter are not inherent in it , and if we adopt this view of matter , they // can not be inherent ; then , since scientists emphatically declare that no force can exist apart from substance , we must assume , alongside of matter , an immaterial substance and power to account for material phenomena . One may take whichever born best suits him , but either will prove disastrous . Briicke solves the problem by declaring that the notion of force rests upon a mental impotence . It may be , but surely science cuts a rather sorry figure in trying to create the world with mental impotences . It is extremely questionable whether a mental impotency would have any great influence with a flying planet . Lotze shows with great acuteness the untenability of the current notions of constant inherent forces , but is hardly as successful in attempting a substitute . The forces of matter vary with conditions . Carbon and oxygen , or oxygen and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temperatures ; but when raised to red heat they combine . Now , a force which thus comes and goes can not be viewed as a constant force inhering in the atoms . According to Lotze , we must view it much more as depending on the relations which things bear to one another . Forces depend upon conditions for their activity . But we fall into difficulty at once in attempting to think out this solution , for conditions and relations , in order to have any effect , must themselves be forces ; and the old riddle comes back unsolved . Force can not be conceived of as adhering in a condition , for a condition is a mode , not a thing . Here again we can take our choice : we can put the forces back into the things , which Lotze repudiates , or we can leave them floating free as conditions , which , though able to accomplish many things , are themselves simply nothing . ( Mikrako8mus , i , 40 f ) IDu Bois IReymond apparently grows vexed at the troublesome question , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing but a covert product of the irresistible tendency to personification which is stamped into us . It is , as it were , a rhetorical artifice of the brain , which seeks for metaphor because clear notions are wanting . In the ideas of matter and force we see returning the same dualism which expresses itself in the notion of God and the world , soul and body . It is the same need , only refined , which once drove men to people bush and fountain , rock , air , and sea , with creations of the imagination . What is // won when we say that the approach of two particles depends upon their mutual attraction ? Not the shadow of an insight inso the nature of the antecedents . " ( Untersuchungen iiber thierisehe Electricitdt , s. 40 . ) This is pure positivism . We know the fact and nothing more . This is to give up all attempts at explanation , to rout gravitation , chemical affinity , and all the other forces as mental imposters , and to content ourselves with a lifeless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an intelligible position , but , unfortunately , it can not be maintained . Comte , although he was constantly upon the war-path against the metaphysicians , did not scruple to deliver himself of some very bad metaphysics ; and Du Bois IReymond also , apparently , finds the " rhetorical artifice " too strong for him . Thus he insists that " Natural Science is a reduction of the changes in the material world to motions of atoms caused by constant central forces which are independent of time , or a resolution of the phenomena of Nature into atomic mechanics . It is a fact of psychological experience that , whenever such a reduction is successfully effected , our craving for causality is wholly satisfied . " Now , it is difficult to believe that by " constant central forces " he understands only " rhetorical artifices . " If he does , however , we must insist that our craving for causality is not satisfied . We read in Aurora Leigh of " yoked thoughts that draw like griffins ; " but we suspect that it would require a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place . Fechner answers the question in pretty much the same way . He says : " Force in Physics is nothing but an auxiliary expression for the representation of the laws of motion and equilibrium , and every clear conception of physical force comes back to this . We speak of the laws of force , but if we look more closely , they are only the laws of equilibrium and of motion , which hold in every opposition of matter . The sun and the earth exercise an attractive power upon each other , but this means only that the sun and the earth move mutually according to law . Of force the scientist knows nothing but the law . We say that there must be a ground for the mutual motion of the sun and the earth , and this ground we call force ; but this ground is nothing but the law . " ( Physikal- and Philosoph. // Atomenlehre , s. 120 . ) We remain still in the old confusion . Law means almost anything in science , and Fechner does not tell us what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the law is to control anything , it must have power ; and the relations of law and force would be still more difficult of explanation . But it is useless to worry ourselves with the endless examples that might be given . The sum is this : Aithoiligh matter and force are the first and last words of science , yet scientists are unable to give anything but the most confused and unsatisfactory account of these , its first principles . Down in this theoretical region we meet with a confusion of tongues which is popularly supposed to belong entirely to the Babel of theology and philosophy . But whatever matter may be in itself , scientists are agreed upon its atomic constitution . It is , indeed , impossible to get any defined notion of what an atom is , or how it is related to force and to other atoms . According to many of the most important scientists and mathematicians , the atom is an absolutely unextended point . Other equally weighty names can be given for the opposite view . These atoms contain infinite powers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fills all space with its forces . It is not very easy to see how this can be ; it looks very much like postulating the infinite in the infinitesimal . Still , all are agreed upon the atoms so far , and all agree that the atoms explain everything . According to the passage quoted from Du Bois IReymond , science is a reduction of all the phenomena of the material world to questions of atomic mechanics . Mr. Huxley says : " If there is one thing clear in the progress of modern science , it isthe tendency to reduce all scientific problems , except those which are purely mathematical , to questions of molecular physics ; that is to say , to the attractions and repulsions , motions and co*irdinations of the ultimate particles of matter . " ( Lay kSiermans , p. 166 . ) Prof. Tyndall suggests ( Frag . Scieace , p. 418 ) that life , emotion , thought , would receive a sufficient explanation , if we were able to trace the molecular interactions of the atoms which compose the body . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the atom and its relation to force , and allow it to be extended and unextended , active and mactive , // identical and different , the question next arises whether , with all this capital , the scientist can give a satisfactory account of the facts . Let it be k&amp;pt well in mind that we are in the region of theory , and that the atom and its forces are only hypotheses invented to help us to understand the facts . If the theory only serves to confuse instead of explain , we are justified in dispensing with it . Here , again , the author finds , what we were prepared to expect , that the atomic machinery works very indifferently . The Eleatic notion of the persistence of Being has modified very strongly scientific conceptions . That Being itself should change , involves the contradiction of a thing 's being at the same time itself and something else . Accordingly , the scientist views his atoms as unchangeable , and attempts to lead all change back to a change of relation among these unchangeable atoms and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unchangeable atoms should change their relations at all , but such is the doctrine . But what kind of insight does this afford us into even the simplest chemical change ? Two unchangeable atoms of hydrogen ( formerly it was one ) unite with one unchangeable atom of oxygen to form water . But surely the approach of these unchangeable atoms a half millionth part of an inch nearer each other , gives no very clear account of the sudden abandonment of all their separate properties , and the assumption of others directly opposed . Conceive these unchangeable atoms disposed in all possible relations to one another , and still not the shadow of an insight is afforded by the hypothesis . Still more marked is the failure of the theory to explain the more complex phenomena of organic chemistry . Even the nascent condition of gases is very indifferently accounted for . It is found that gases , when first freed from combination , have much greater combining power than afterwards . Upon the theory of constant chemical force , this fact renders necessary a modification of the atomic theory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ According to this view , the elements do not exist in the atomic form , but in combination as molecules . At the moment of liberation the atoms of a gas have not yet entered into atomic combination , and hence have greater affinity for other bodies than they have // after combining into molecules . The explanation is quite indifferent , because there seems no reason why the atoms of an element , if they can combine at all , should not unite to the extent of their combining power and thus become inert . Of the facts of isomerism , however , we have no account . Thus many substances , as strychnine and quinine , are composed of the same elements in the same proportions . The explanation is that the molecular management is different . In the first place , the assumed difference of molecular arrangement explains absolutely nothing . Why the same atoms , with the same powers , should have one set of powers when arranged in the form of a pyramid , and another set entirely different when built into a cube , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is so ; it is a fact ; and then we ask him how he knows it is a fact . These are not facts but hypotheses , introduced to explain the facts ; and they utterly fail to do it . But granted that the assumed difference of molecular arrangement is a fact , then the different arrangement is to be explained . How comes it that identical atoms with , of course , identical powers , should build themselves into one kind of molecule in strychnine and into another in quinine . If the same atoms have different forces , they would not be the same , and yet only unlike forces can account for the unlike effects . At all events , it is n otat all easy to see how the same forces should have such widely different results . So patent are these and a host of similar difficulties , that many thoughtful chemists admit the utter inadequacy of the theory ( Graham-Otto , Lelirbuch der ( Jhemie , s. 702 ) , and even that it seems opposed to many of the best established @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern chemists , assume that the atoms themselves have neither quantitative nor qualitative differences , and that the actual differences of compounds depend upon the different arrangement of the atoms . This , we have seen , explains nothing , even if the difference were admitted ; and in the next place , it is incredible that anything like order should exist among chemical compounds if this were the case . Accordingly , Ettingshausen declares : " Without the express assumption that the nature of the atoms allows only certain groupings , the atomic hypothesis would not include the law of definite proportions . " We do , // indeed , seem forced to this assumption , but as an explanation it ranks along with that of Martinus Scribblerus . The spit roasts meat because it has a meat-roasting quality ; and the atoms combine because they have a combining quality . It would puzzle one to detect any difference in the quality of the explanations . Worst of all , too , even this theory does not account for the facts of isomerism ; unless we assume that the unchangeable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compound , and another set in another compound . It is needless to inquire how it would fare with the doctrine of unchangeability under these interesting circumstances . We have not time to follow the discussion of the theories of light , heat , electricity , and magnetism . We dismiss it with the remark that here , too , the author finds the same confusion which rules in all theoretical science . A slight comparison of the teachings of the masters serves to expose a multitude of opposing views , while a still slighter comparison of fact and theory makes it evident that there is absolutely no theory which is not beset with a host of difficulties for which , as yet , science has no remedy . All these great theories , as the author justly observes , belong to the realm of scientific faith ; while many of them find so little support from the facts , and have so little self-consistency , as scarcely to rise above pure fancy . By calling them objects of scientific faith , it is not meant that they may not possibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weighty objections can be urged against them , they can not claim the rank of knowledge . Faith is as necessary to science as it is to religion . The much-talked-of doctrine of the correlation of the forces deserves notice because it is the darling doctrine of those who attempt to explain the universe by a single impersonal force . ilere even scientists , e. g. , Prof. Tyndall , complain of the confusion into which the teachers have fallen . It is very often asserted that light , heat , electricity , &amp;c. , are modes of motion . If so , they are not forces at all . Motion is effect , not cause . They may indeed be attended with peculiar motions , but the true force is not the motions , but their cause . How could motion attract anything as magnetism does ? How could motion manifest itself as attraction in one pole of a magnet and as // repulsion in the other ? Besides , as magnetism does not reside in the mass , but in the single atom , each of which is furnished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It can only be conceived as a polar force capable indeed of producing motion , but without other relation to motion . The same is true for electricity , which the authorities also assure us is identical with chemical affinity . How electricity , as a mode of motion , could lock two atoms together , is a problem which sadly needs explanation . No easier is it to discover how heat , which , in general , drives the atoms asunder , can be the same as chemical affinity , which draws them tegether . To relieve some of these difficulties , Prof. Tyridall assures us that the correlation of the forces says nothing whatever about the forces by which matter attracts , but only of the work which these various forces can do . This may be , but if so , we have no correlation of forces at all ; and the various rhetorical deliverances about " Protean force " and his " myriad manifestations " are of no manner of use , and may as well be laid under the table . In fact , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes so much of just now , has not the shadow of a warrant , except upon a supposition which takes force from the physical list entirely . We have , first , gravitation acting at all distances , and varying as the inverse square . According to Proctor , in his recent lectures on Astronomy , it not only acts at all distances , but acts instantaneously . If this be so , then gravitation stands entirely apart from all the other forces , which act only at molecular distances , and which propagate themselves only in measurable time . In chemical affinity we have a force which acts only under conditions , and which varies at least as the inverse cube of the distance . In cohesion we have still another force , different from , either gravitation or affinity . In magnetism and electricity we have forces which split into polarities in the most unaccountable way . Besides these there are repulsive forces , which vary probably as the inverse fifth power of the distance . If , then , there is only one force in nature , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manifestation , but also its law and nature . Now it attacks and now repels . Now it varies as the inverse square and now as the inverse fifth power of the distance . These considerations , apart from Proctor 's suggestion , // make it impossible to view such a force as physical or mechanical . Mechanical forces know nothing of selective activity , as in affinity and cohesion . They can not be conceived as abandoning all their old properties and assuming others entirely new . Such a force can only be conceived as spontaneous . It is an emphatic logical contradiction to attempt to lead such various and even opposed workings from a mechanical source . Such a force , too , could not reside in the atoms . These would rather be objects of its activity and not its possessors . To make them its possessors would be to split the one force into infinitesimal bits , and also to deny the unchangeahility of the atoms . It is open to the believers in a single force to teach that the phenomena of gravitation , affinity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of manifestation of one underlying force ; but in order to do this they must make that force immaterial and spontaneous . If , however , they refuse to do this , there is no possibility of making out the correlation even among the great physical forces . If in chemical action heat is liberated , there is no need to assume any identity of heat and affinity ; the necepted teachings of the physicists suffice to explain this fact . The approach of the atoms through affinity disturbs the equilibrium of the ether by which the atoms are said to be surrounded . This , in virtue of its elasticity , quivers ; and the result is heat . There is not the slightest reason for supposing any correlation between the affinity and the heat . The same is true for all the stock illustrations of the pretended correlations . The great forces of nature are so related to one another as to work in harmony . This is a scientific and most important fact ; without it , nature would be either a dead equilibrium or a wild chaos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correlation . If science assumes a physical force of gravitation , of affinity , of cohesion , then it is impossible to lead these several forces back to any single physical force . With the failure to establish the identity of the physical forces , the great presumption against the reality of a vital force is all gone . If we are compelled to view gravitation , affinity , electricity , &amp;c. , as real forces , and are also compelled to view them as distinct from one another ; then there is no a priori objection whatever against assuming the reality of a separate // vital force , if the phenomena find no explanation iP the common physical forces . Here again is a department where we have had an abundance of assertion , with a minimum of proof . Of late years , this question of vitality has been a kind of test of scientific orthodoxy . Whoever was bold and loud in denial proved himself sound ; and whoever was not , was looked upon as not yet freed from superstition . Vitality is an empty word with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of impotent credulity . The body is a mechanism ; and has its full explanation in the atomic machinery which composes it . This is the express view of many of the most advanced . We have already seen that the molecular machinery is a rather confused affair , and does not give any very promising account of even simple physical phenomena . Possibly , however , we shall succeed better with the more complex phenomena of the organism . Concerning the emptiness of the word , vitality , it may be remarked in advance that it does not fare much better with the other scientific terms for force . What does science mean by cohesion , or chemical affinity ? What are these but words ? Why does it distinguish the two at all ? How can it be said that both classes of phenomena can not be derived from one single force of attraction ? It is simply taking refuge in an asvlum of ignorance to set these up as distinct forces . Or what are magnetism and electricity ? By what authority are they set up as different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had better instruments or keener insight , that these might all be led out of gravitation ? Can any one prove that they can not ? Why , then , these words too are only asylums of ignorance . We are also instructed that to explain vital phenomena by assuming a vital force is no explanation at all ; but how much better does it fare with the other forces ? To explain chemical phenomena by a chemical force , electrical phenomena by an electrical force , facts of gravitation by a gravitating force , &amp;c. , is really not much better than to explain vital phenomena by a vital force . It is decidedly good to find men suddenly turning positivists upon the question of vitality , while they talk without scruple of chemical , electric , thermal , magnetic , and other forces ; against each of which it might be urged with equal justice , first , that they explain nothing ; and , second , that they are asylums of ignorance . // But may it not be possible to lead vital phenomena out of the qualities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few leading scientists ; we have now to inquire what proof they have to offer . An organism manifests properties unknown in the inorganic world . It is a system of means and ends ; each part exists for every other and for the whole . It is an exquisite mechanism full of the nicest contrivances and balances . It is the expression of a purpose throughout , which refers not to itself alone , but to a perpetuation of the organism . In the constant flow of the component atoms , it maintains its identity and unity ; it is never the same , and yet always the same . Even the lowest organism has definite functions , and maintains itself by an inner activity . It nourishes itself propagates itself ; and as soon as this self-activity ceases , the organism begins to perish . This intelligent adaptation , this inner resisting activity , never occurs in inorganic nature , while it is the essential mark of an organism . To explain these facts , some assume that the body is a pure mechanism , that the attractions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sufficient explanation . But we have already seen that the different disposition of a mass of unchangeable atoms gives no account even of the simplest facts of chemistry . These atoms never touch each other , are simple and unchangeable , and yet when their relations are changed by an infinitesimal distance , suddenly a new compound appears . Anyone may be safely defied to torture any explanation of inorganic chemistry out of this notion , to say nothing of explaining vital phenomena . In fact , this explanation is a blank assertion which there is no means whatever of proving , and which , when followed out in thought , ends in nothing . To explain the facts by the chemical qualities of the atoms is to forget the fact that affinity in general is at constant war with the organism , that as soon as the inner activity ceases , affinity begins its work of destruction . Another explanation is sometimes ventured to the effect that the atoms in certain combinations exhibit cohesive qualities , in others they exhibit chemical qualities , and in still other combinations vital phenomena @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this explanation serves to identify vitality with the other forces . From the phenomena of cohesion , we // infer a force of cohesion ; from those of affinity , we infer a force of affinity ; hence from those of vitality we must infer a force of vitality . In short , this theory of vitality explains life in the organism by assuming it in the atom-not a very brilliant explanation after all ; for almost anything can be brought out of a juggler 's hat , if one is first allowed to fill it with the desired materiaL With atoms qualitatively alike , the pure mechanical view , nothing whatever can be done ; and all the other explanations consist in assuming in the atoms all that is afterwards brought out of them . The atoms explain cohesion , because they have the power of cohering ; they explain affinity , because they have the power of affinity ; they also explain life , because they have the power of producing it . As an explanation this is a great truth , and worthy of all acceptation ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for . How the vital powers of the myriad atoms can produce the single , indivisible life of the individual , is simply inconceivable ; still more difficult is it to see why the same atoms should go to build up such different forms as the organic world presents . The same atoms ought to do the same things ; but they really produce the greatest diversity . Mr. Spencer explains it by referring these facts to the " as yet unexplained principle of heredity , " a principle , by the way , which has in it the gist of the matter . In fine , we must view the conclusion which the author reaches , at the end of a long and careful criticism of all that the authorities have said upon this matter , as fully established . There is just as good reason for the assumption of a vital force as of any other ; and all attempts to lead vital phenoniena from any amalgam of the lower forces is a conclusion resting , partly on scientific prejudice , and partly on wretched logic . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of deducing spiritual phenomena from atomic motions . In fact , there is a contradiction in the very notion . Physics can not view its atoms as spontaneous , and hence physics can never produce the spontaneous . To suppose a mechanism of atoms to produce a being endowed with spontaneity , is to contradict itself . The necessary can never create the free , nor the unintelligent give birth to the intelligent , because in doing so , it would contradict itself . If , then , there is in man any power of self-deter-* // mination , any ability to react against nature and control or guide it , then the necessary physical forces of nature alone can not have given him birth . The science which assumes that they have , must first fly in the face of every man 's experience , and give the lie to the universal consciousness . Here , as in the case of life , if thought , feeling , and mind in general are to be evolved from matter , they must first be involved into it . Whatever comes out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few are beginning to recognize this . Thus Prof. Tyndall says : " Had we not better recast our definitions of matter and force : for if life and thought be the very flower of both , any definition which omits life and thought must be inadequate if not untrue . " ( Frag . Science , p. 123 . ) But to get mind from matter byfirst enlarging the definition of the latter so as to include the former , certainly throws no great light upon the subject . If we attempt to lead all phenomena out of a single cause , that cause must be the highest type of power . Not mechanical , nor chemical force , not electricity , nor magnetism , but mind and will , must be taken as the only type of force on which the actual universe rests . All attempts to base it upon any lower form involve the contradiction of trying to bring out of a thing what is not in it . We may sum up the argument thus far as follows : Science assumes that matter is composed of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what these atoms are . They are next endowed with forces , but no one can tell us what these forces are . The relation of the atom to these forces is also a subject on which we seek in vain for information . After the atoms set to work , they give a very unsatisfactory account of the facts . The attempt to make mechanically intelligible the simplest chemical change , is an utter failure ; while the claim that all this talk about poles and powers , molecules and atoms , explains the harmony and order of the universe , is simply to mistake intolerable subjective confusion for an objective solution of the problem . In our own opinion , science has succeeded in discovering some of the laws of phenomena , and has made more clear the universal order ; while its claim to have explained anything whatever , is utterly without foundation . Yet if we admitted all that is claimed for the atoms , philosophy would still have many questions to ask before it could be // admitted that science had proved its independence . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in reducing every scientific problem to questions of atomic mechanics , ' the question would next arise whether the atoms themselves can be viewed as unoriginated and eternal , or whether they must not rather be conceived as created and dependent . This brings us to what the author calls the ontology of science ; and out of the admitted , or rather the emphatic , teachings of science , he concludes that the laws of nature are enactments of a Will above them , that the forces of nature abut on a supernatural power behind them . This is next to be examined . The author agrees with the scientists in viewing matter as having an atomic composition , and in viewing the atoms as being centers of force . The notion of matter as something dead or inactive , he throws away as a logical chimera Purely inactive matter could never come into knowledge , for it is only as it produces effects upon us that we become aware of its existence . The essence of matter is this resisting power ; and an atom can only be viewed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forces capable of producing motion , are held together by this central static , or resisting force . After seeking to vindicate this conception , and thus rescue the scientific doctrine of the atomic constitution of matter from the internal contradiction which the common conception involves , the author next proceeds to inquire what further postulates we are forced to make . According to the express teaching of science , the atoms are mutually conditioned by one another . Everything in the physical realm , whether it be matter or force , is what it is , and does what it does , only through the co-presence and co-working of another . The force of affinity only acts when the proper conditions are present . The forces of electricity , of magnetism , &amp;c. , all are dependent upon conditions . Science knows nothing of the unconditioned or absolute . Philosophy , however , does ; and after listening to the scientist as he describes the conditioned existences of the physical realm , philosophy insists that , backoftheseconditions , atoms , andforces , **26;847;TOOLONG Being upon whom these depend . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each atom is conditioned by other // atoms , yet the sum of the atoms is unconditioned ; but this bridge is untenable . A sum of conditioned existences can neVer make an unconditioned . The notion involves the contradiction of being at the same time conditioned and unconditioned . The conditioned nature of atomic action is still clearer . The commencement of any atomic action presupposes the preentrance of its condition . But this entrance of the condition is also an atomic action which , in turn , is impossible without the pre-entrance of its condition . But such a series can not be infinite , for that supposes a dependent activity , which , by the supposition , had a beginning in time , to be also etcrnal . That is , all atomic activity is dependent . It can not depend on itself , for that would make it independent ; it must then depend upon another activity , which is the true absolute . The warrant for this conclusion is , that if we make our minds clear upon the subject , we shall see that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason up to this point , we must trust it still further . This final affirmation of an unconditioned Being back of all the conditioned existences and forces of experience , is as emphatic as any other to which we yield unhesitating credence . We can escape it only by remaining in the fog of mental confusion , or by assuming a suicidal position with reference to the validity of our mental operations . We shall reach a similar conclusion if we consider another scientific dogma  --  the void between the atoms . Scientists in general insist upon the void space as strongly as upon the atoms themselves . So , then , each atom sits alone , cut off by an absolute void from all of its neighbors . And yet this atom is said to affect every other atom in the universe , to send its influences across the dizziest distances of space , and to fill space , indeed , with its activity . It would be hard to conceive a doctrine more palpably absurd . Scientists have repeated it , until familiarity has covered its inconceivability ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth , the notion is positively unthinkable ; and when clearly represented to the mind , it is repudiated as impossible . Not to insist upon the absurdity of supposing the infinitesimal atom to fill all space with its activity , the notion involves a positive contradiction . The doctrine is that the atom acts across void space , and without // any media whatever . Be the distance molecular or stellar , this doctrine always involves the decided contradiction that a thing acts where it is uot and is not where it acts . It is just as impossible for science to reconcile this doctrine to its other dogma of the inseparability of matter and force , as it is to reconcile it to philosophy . At all events , the force must be where the effect is produced , but if so , then , according to the doctrine , we have an absolute void between the force and the atom in which it is said to inhere  --  a condition which is as much like a separation as we can easily conceive , although such sep . aration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctrine to either philosophy or to other scientific dogmas . If , now , science insists upon its atoms , and the void between them ; then philosophy insists that , alongside of the atomic forces , we must assume another continuous , immaterial , super . atomic force as the only possibility of atomic working . If science clings to its atoms , philosophy proves that they are utterly powerless without this further assumption . Let it be always kept in mind , that we are in the realm of theory . Science attempts to make phenomena thinkable by its atomic theory ; and philosophy proves that all the atomic explanations are unthinkable , unless a continuous , immaterial , independent force be assumed as the condition of atomic activity . If we think at all , and think consistently , we can not avoid the conclusion , that science as well as religion demands something behind phenomena and the conditioned forces of nature . Thus we are forced to the assumption of an absolute Being ; and the attempt to construe the universe into atomic mechanics is seen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as yet wholly undetermined . It is far enough from being God in the common sense of the word . We have now to inquire how we are to conceive this absolute which science , philosophy , and religion alike are forced to assume . At this point , it has been the fashion with the German speculator , and also with Sir Win . Hamilton , Mr. Mansel , and II . Spencer , to leave experience , and begin to chop logic and split hairs over an a priori notion of what the absolute must be . Out of this mistaken procedure has arisen ineffable confusion and all kinds of mischievous notions . Hamilton and Mansel , on the authority of their self . // made absoute , denied that we can have any knowledge of it whatever , although they left it to faith . Mr. Spencer , more logical than they , turned it into the darkness of utter nescience , and left us only the relative and the conditioned . But all these notions arose from analyzing an a priori conception of the absolute , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolute to have any objective reality . But , as we have already seen , this a priori construction of the absolute is impossible . We rise to the absolute from the conditioned facts of experience , and the content which we put into the absolute must be determined entirely by those facts . How , then , are we to conceive this absolute Being which we plant at the base of phenomena ? We have given a partial answer to this question in oar review of the author 's Logic . ( New Englartder , July , 1874 . ) The author applies and illustrates those principles at great length in the present work . The argument is briefly as follows : Thought is governed by laws which are entirely subjective in their origin . We must think according to certain laws and forms . Whatever contradicts them can not come into knowledge , or if it could , it would wreck the whole fabric and plunge knowledge into irredeemable chaos . And yet nature is knowable . The laws without correspond to the laws within . The forms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world is cast in the moulds of intelligence ; it is a thought-pattern in which the web of the world is woven . This supposition lies at the basis of all science , yes , of all knowledge of nature whatever . Deny it , and the possibility of science falls away . Admit it , and the agreement demands explanation . Whence this harmony between mind and nature ? There it stands , an undeniable fact ; whence comes it ? If we think at all , we are forced to admit that the unconditioned Power upon which nature depends , proceeds according to the laws and forms of intelligence . If we look more closely at nature , we find that it is a vast system of means and ends . Its exquisite contrivances outrun not merely our highest understanding but even our power of admiration . From the wide-reaching law to the single organism everything bears the stamp of adaptation and purpose . There is absolutely nothing new to be said // on this subject . Let one open his eyes , and he will see the illustrations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proceeds not only according to the general laws and forms of thought , but it also sets purposes , adapts means to ends , and out of the crossing and conflicting forces of nature , wins results which are intelligible only as intended . However they have been brought about , by law or otherwise , the conclusion is still irresistible that they existed in thought before they existed in fact . If you say that they flow out of the atoms , the sufficient reply is , that nothing can come out which was not in . If the materialist obj ects that by a system of trial the right forms are at last chanced upon , the answer is , that this system of trial would be useless without the express assumption , that the atoms are so constructed as to make the best the strongest , as to form intelligent combinations , and destroy the opposite . Evolution without a previous involution is nonsense . This absolute , then , must be conceived as working according to the methods of a rational mind , as proposing ends , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it must be conceived as intelligent , free , self-conscious , personal . Free because absolute ; intelligent because it works intelligently ; self-conscious because it has plans and aims ; and personal because these notions are the root-factors of personality . It is a decided contradiction to suppose the higher to be the work of the lower . If intelligence and volition appear in the created , then there were intelligence and volition in the Creator . One objection which the materialist urges deserves notice . It is claimed that , granting the intelligent activity and the working toward certain ends , it by no means follows that it results from intelligence in the Creator . It may spring from instinct , from a blind impulse which works toward certain ends , and yet has no consciousness of them . We see this manifested in the instinct of animals . The bird , the bee , the silkworm , manifest the greatest skill in preparing the nest , the comb , the cocoon ; and yet we attribute no intelligence to them . Why not , then , suppose the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and , instead of a personal Creator , assume a blind instinctive force as the best explanation of the phenomena ? This objection would have much more force , if some one // could tell us what instinct really is . It appears to us that the psychology of the lower animals is very much in the dark . Who knows whether they have consciousness or not ? Who is prepared to give anything but baseless assertion upon this point ? If one chose to assert that the lower animals are conscious of ends and purposes , who could disprove it ? And we must either do this , *must view them as highly intelligent , or we must find the cause of their peculiar activity in the peculiar determination of their nature . But whence this determination ? It can only rest upon an intelligent activity behind it . If we grant intelligence and purpose to the animal , the objection based on the so-called instinct vanishes . If we deny them to the animal , there is all the more necessity of attributing them to the Creator . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and personal . With this proof we have implicitly answered the question concerning its knowability . There is no warrant for believing in any other notion of the absolute . We are not forced to conceive it out of relation , as Hamilton , Mansel , and Spencer teach ; but , on the contrary , we are forced to conceive it in actual causal relation to the universe . Hence all the logical bngbears which have been conjured up concerning the incompatibility of the idea of absolute and of first cause are quietly disposed of by the fact , that the absolute is , and can be , known only in causal relation to the world . To the objection which these philosophers urge , that intelligence is incompatible with the absolute , because intelligence is a limitation , we may say that it is one of those dreary logical puzzles which need no answer . The objection is contradictory in itself for if the power to know be a limitation , the inability to know would be in uch more a limitation . The same contradiction lies in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consciousness is a limitation ; for if consciousness is a limitation , surely unconsciousness would be a much greater one . But apart from the inherent contradiction of these objections , they all rest upon the mistake of attempting to construe the absolute a priori . We have already seen that the content of the notion of the absolute can only be determined from the facts of experience as interpreted by the laws of thought . Beginfling // with these facts , we find ourselves forced to conceive the absolute as intelligent and personal . This is the only absolute for whose objective existence there is a shade of proof . If philosophers choose to amuse themselves , and frighten people of weak nerves , by constructing absolutes out of contradictions , in order to win great renown by afterward proving that the manufactured mermaid is unthinkable , they are at perfect liberty to do so ; but before they carry the conclusions won by this logical jugglery over to the Creator , they must first prove that their home-made notion represents the Creator as the laws of thought and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have done this , these logical jugglers will find their occupation gone . Of course , no rationale of the Divine nature can ever be given , but the same is true of our own nature . We are forced to conceive ourselves as free intelligences , but how we can be either free or intelligent , no one can tell ; indeed , it is impossible to explain how we can be at all . How anything whatever can be , is a question which none can answer . All the facts of sensation and perception are of this order . We know them as facts and as facts only ; and yet , though it is utterly impossible to explain bow they can be facts , we feel no hesitation in accepting them as real . So we are forced to conceive God as intelligent and personal . As such He is an ultimate fact of knowledge . How He can be either intelligent or personal , we leave to those who love such riddles , to solve . It is sufficient that we are forced to conceive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shown in the conception . Until this can be shown , we must admit the fact as we admit any other fact , though we can give no further explanation . Thus we have come to the conclusion that apart from the conditioned forces of nature , we must assume an immaterial , omnipresent , intelligent force , as that which co5rdinates nature and gives it all its specific determinations . The word which Paul pronounced upon Mars Hill , is rc*choed and reiterated by science : In Him we live and move and have our being . This view , however , is not pantheism , as the author proceeds to show : " So long as the condition of the sciences allowed one to conceive matter as one and continuous , and as obtaining // the manifold form and quality of different things through a force within or over it , so long was it possible to view that spiritual First-force pantheistically - - , i. e. , as world-soul , or world-spirit But since it has been scientifically established that matter in itself consists in an immeasurable multitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scientifically impossible , and can only be held by thoughtlessness . At the present time , one has only the choice between the extreme materialism , which ascribes the origin of the world to a harmonious concourse of atoms which happened by a fortunate accident , and that idealism , which leads it back to the activity of a spiritual , self-conscious absolute , which works by plan , or purpose . The ground-conception of pantheism is the substantial identity of God and Nature . According to this view , God has created the world out of his own substance and essence , or , in the process of self-realization , has passed into the manifold of terrestrial existence . Hence the absolute substance is identical with the substance of the world and natural things . But this notion becomes self-contradictory when it is applied to matter in the scientific sense , i. e. , to the multitude of atoms and their conditioned forces . It is unthinkable , because selfcontradictory , that a mass of atoms which are separated from one another , and have manifold differences , should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and maintains its unity in self-consciousness . It is no less unthinkable , because equally contradictory , to assume that the divine Substance , while originally , and in itself one and continuous , has disrupted itself for the building of the world , into the plurality of the manifold atoms . For apart from the question whether such an act is conceivable at all , still , in consequence of this disruption , the one divine force with the unity of its self-consciousness would again have only the plural and diverse atoms for its supportthe contradiction would remain the same . Finally , it is just as impossible to help ourselves with another theory which is sometimes ventured , viz : that the atoms are not material points , but have a like spiritual nature , are animated by the same thought , and , in a joint activity , like a multitude of little gods , have built up the world . For it not only contradicts all experience , to attribute to the atoms , without distinction , perception , // consciousness , thought ; but it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different and are furnished with diverse conditioned forces , could be moved by one and the same thought , and work together for the realization of one purpose . " ( S. 520 . ) That is , we can not view the conditioned as a part of the unconditioned ; because the conception involves irreconcilable contradictions . Matter and its forces are all conditioned , and hence can not be independent or eternaL With this proog materialism loses all scientific value as a philosophy . No more can they be viewed as emanations from the absolute ; the moment we attempt to think out this proposition , we meet insuperable difficulties , which make the pantheistic theory untenable . There is only one other alternative-that of creation , in the purest and strongest sense of the word But what if this , too , should land us in contradiction ? The notion of a creation from nothing has always been a great scandal to philosophers , many of whom , as Sir Win . Hamilton , have not hesitated to declare it a pure impossibility ; and yet if we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To escape this danger , Mr. Martineau , in one of his collected essays , suggests that matter , as simple resistance , should be viewed as a kind of datum objective to God , and constituting an eternal object of his activity . The author on purely philosophical grounds disputes the pretended impossibility ; and shows , first , that the same difficulties lie against both the atheistic and pantheistic theories ; and , next , that the difficulties vanish upon examination . As materialists even , we can not escape the notion of a creation out of nothing ; " for upon closer examination , every event , every working , every motion irresistibly demands it . For suppose we should lead the present condition of the world back to the motions of an original manifold of atoms , still is this motion absolutely unthinkable without the assumption of a prime - mover. - - - Every commencement of motion , every causal motion , is necessarily self-motion ; and every pure self-motion is in fact a creation out of nothing . For the motion which originates from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolute beginning which has nothing for its antecedent . - . . And if the prime-mover has the power to // cancel the dead rest , the negation of motion , and bring about a first motion ; we can with the same right attribute to it the power to cancel the negation of things , that is , to create the world out of nothing . For the one is just as unthinkable as the other . " ( S. 638 ) It fares no better with the pantheist in his attempt to escape the doctrine of creation . He conceives that the one absolute substance sundered itself in some way or other into the diversity of the actual world . But , " how one and the same substance could divide itself into diverse substances is , at least , full as inconceivable as a creation out of nothing ; since , indeed , the diversity of the substances proceeds from their pure identity , therefore from the negation of all diversity , consequently from nothing . What difference does it make whether we assume that the diverse substances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Him ? " ( S. 649 . ) No pantheist would assume that the present determinations , powers , and quantities of things existed , as such , in God ; yet if not , then , in their origination , there was a passage from their not being to their being-that is , a creation . The pantheist may object that they existed potentially in God , but this can only mean that God had the power to produce them . But , as such , they did not exist , and when they were brought forth , that which before was not , was made to be . But this is all that the theist under . stands by creation . " We by no means contest the principle : out of nothing , nothing comes . We must assert , however , that it lacks the dignity of a logical law , according to which our thinking must proceed . It is much more a limitation of our thought , because of which we are unable to represent the origination of a thing which does not yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two logical laws of our thinking . For the law of identity and of contradiction determines only that we must think A=A and can not think A = non-A ; and the law of causality only says that all that happens or becomes . . must have a cause of its happen . ing or becoming . The first law , therefore , only demands that nothing ( if it were thinkable ) must be thought as nothing , something as something , this as not that , &amp;c . The second law demands that , when anythiug originates , no matter how or // whence , a cause of its origination be assumed . But a cause is present , when through any force whatever a negation is cancelled and a something put it ' its place . In truth , therefore , the sentence , out of nothing comes nothing , has been falsely opposed to the notion of creation , as if the two were logically incompatible . The notion of creation in nowise involves that something comes out of nothing , or that nothing of itself passes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the negation of the world is cancelled , and thereby the world established . Only the sentence , something is originated by nothing , would contradict the laws of causation , and render the notion of creation impossible . But this notion in nowise affirms that something is produced by nothing ; but rather that through God the world was originated . And to this assertion it is plainly impossible to oppose either the maxim , from nothing comes nothing , or any logical law whatever . For it lies neither in the principle of identity and contradiction , nor in the law of causation or the sufficient ground , that the through ( the causal power ) is not sufficient for the production of anything , but that an out-of ( a stuff ) must be also added . " ( S. 651 . ) " By the Word of the Lord were the heavens made . " By His power that which was not , was made to be . The notion involves no contradiction ; all that can be said is that it is incomprehensible . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with incomprehensibilities . Every change , every event , every becoming involves riddl*s which neither philosophy nor science can answer . We know the fact and nothing more . Who can tell how , from the union of oxygen and hydrogen , water can be produced ? What science can make it in the slightest degree comprehensible ? Who knows what happens with these gases when they suddenly lose all their peculiar properties , exchange their powers of repulsion for the contradictory ones of attraction , and that too under the influence of a force of repulsion ( heat ) ? Who has the slightest insight into the sudden productions through these incomprehensible processes , of qualities which did not exist before ? We see the fact and are forced to admit it , but all attempts fail to explain or comprehend it . Now we are in no worse position with reference to the doctrine of creation . It // involves no contradiction , and is hence possible . lit does involve incomprehensibilities , but so does every fact . The opposing theories of atheism and pantheism involve , first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided and insuperable contradictions . It is , then , impossible to hold them in the light of clear and steady thought We must , then , admit the only remaining doctrine , as one which , while we can not explain or comprehend it , must still be held as the only lasting plan upon which our thought can rest . In the section upon the relation of God to the world , the author seems at times to waver a little in his determination not to construct the absolute a priori . Along with much acute* criticism , the a priori conception of the absolute sometimes presents itself . We agreed , at the start , to determine the content of this notion entirely from the facts of experience , as interpreted by the laws of thought By a rigorous interpretation of these facts , in accordance with these laws , we find ourselves forced to assume the existence of an omnipresent , ever-working supernatural Force , who once established , and now coordinates and controls , all nature according to the methods of a rational mind . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ putting into the notion of the absolute : and this content we are forced to attribute to it . We hardly think it necessary , therefore , to answer the objection ( p. 662 ) that the absolute must necessarily be the one and only being . For by the law of causation , we can not view a thing as at once cause and effect ; hence for the conditioned existences of nature , we are forced to assume an unconditioned existence separate from them . What need , then , to reply to the objection , which can only be raised by the tbeoriser on the a priori conception of the absolute , that the absolute must be the only being , when we are forced to conceive the absolute as distinct from the conditioned . Equally unnecessary is it , from our point of view , to reply to the objection ( s. 664 ) that the absolute as such excludes all relativity ; and therefore can stand in no relation to the world . This objection is completely answered when we remember that we know the absolute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no warrant for believing in an absolute which excludes all relation . We postulate the absolute // for the express purpose of standing in causal relation to the conditioned facts of nature ; and it would be a strange piece of ingratitude , if ; after we have affirmed it upon the sole authority of the relative , it should now grow proud and disclaim all possibility of connection with the relative . In that case , the absolute and not the relative must vanish ; for we made the former only to support the latter ; and if it refuses to do so , it is not worth keeping . The same reply holds for the objection considered ( s. 665 ) that the relativity of God and the world involves the dependence of the former . We have been forced to postulate God as cause and world as effect ; and it is certainly a remarkable discovery that an effect can in any wise condition its cause , at least so as to reduce it to dependence . We first posit the effect in absolute dependence upon its cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the latter 's independence ! The question ( s. 666 ) whether the existence of the world is compatible with the infinity and eternity of God , is equally inadmissible , for whatever content these words may have , it must be determined entirely from the facts . Surely to reason from the finite to the infinite , and then , after having reached the infinite by the aid of the finite , to insist that the latter is irreconcilable with the former , is a queer specimen of logic . Objections drawn from the notion of the omnipotence of the absolute move us less yet . A moment 's reflection upon the way in which we come to this notion , relieves it of all difficulty . The facts of experience compel us to assume a power above all and which controls all ; but there is no warrant for believing in that wretched concoction of contradictor , y nonsense which can accomplish with equal ease the reasonable and the unreasonable , the thinkable and the unthinkable , the possible and the impossible . We by no means assert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions ; on the contrary , they are all acute and convincing . We do think , however , that a shorter way was possible . All these questions are inadmissible from our standpoint . They all rest upon an a priori construction of the absolute , which we have seen to be impossible . It is sufficient to say to all such objections that they are based on subjective nonsense , which has been mistaken for objective fact . // See , then , the point to which we have come . We began by listening to science as it expounded its first principles and its conclusions . We found them very unsatisfactory , and in sad need of rectification . The notions of matter and force , and of their mutual relations , were seen to be utterly indefinite and in many cases contradictory . Upon inquiring into the teachings of science concerning the atoms , we again found much that was unthinkable , while the so-called explanations turned out , upon examination , to be only subjective confusion . We next found that scientific theories all postulate something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we are compelled to postulate an omnipresent , ever-active Intelligence , who is not only author , but also administrator , of the steady laws of nature . Instead of the deistic conception of God as apart from the world , we find ourselves forced to assume not only that by Him are all things , but also that in Him are all things . The attempt to make mechanically intelligible the phenomena of nature , was seen to be an utter failure ; while the notion of an eternal mechanism was found to be a contradiction . How the phenomena of nature are produced , no science can tell ; we know but this : the Power from whom nature flows works intelligently , and according to the methods of a rational mind . We are forced to conceive it as intelligent , self-conscious , and personaL In the attempt to think out this conception , we found that it does , indeed , involve incomprehensibilities , but no contradiction , and that it is the only conception which does not involve insuperable contradiction , and the only one upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the author in his proof that science postulates God not only as free and intelligent , but also as having au ethical nature . The discussion of the relation of God to humanity , of the old problem of evil and its bearing upon God 's power and goodness , and of the vexed question of freedom , must also be omitted . Indeed , we have given only the faintest hints of the author 's extended discussions . But if any one wishes to see how confused the metaphysics of physics are , and how weak its atheistic arguments , we commend to him this work as a storehouse of scientific facts , of acute criticism , and of just speculation .
