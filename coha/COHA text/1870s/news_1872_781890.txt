txt There is a familiar proverb which sets forth the dread of fire entertained by a burnt child . Those who are familiar with the peculiarities of the amateur agriculturist , are aware of thefierce vindictiveness with which he regards the seedsman who has misled him into buying seeds and bulbs which do not fullfill the expectations of the purchaser . That the burnt agriculturist not only dreads but hates the seedsman , is a proverb which is eminently true , and of which Mr. HORACE GREELEY is just at present a shining , not to say a howling , instance . It seems that there is a firm in this City which proposes to sell the most extraordinary sorts of flowers and fruits . It is plain that the *Demme who are engaged in this scheme undertook it with a firm reliance upon the gullibility of Mr. GREELEY . The pretensions made by them in behalf of these seeds are so enormous that no sane man would be capable of accepting them as true . It follows that they must have undertaken their business for the express @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Chappaqua farmer , as the only man who would listen to their professions and buy their wares . Doubtless they have reaped the harvest which they anticipated , and they can therefore afford to laugh at the rage with which the Tribune denounces them , now that its agricultural head has discovered that be has been made the victim of a joke . Ono can easily picture the beaming countenance of the sage as hoe listened to the temptations ollered by the wicked florists . With what joy did ho seize the blue-moss rose-bush . and hurriedly pay any price that might be asked for that unique treasure . How gladly did ho invest a fifty dollar bill in the purchase of a strawberry-tree , warranted to reach the height of a dwarf pear-tree , and to produce fruit the size of a pippin . And with what a wild outburst of enthusiasm , accompanied , doubtless , with the reckless dashing of his spectacles on the floor , and the performance of a later Pyrrhic dance , did he clutch to his bosom the wonderful cabbage-rose , which , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ size and peculiar shape of the cabbage . Laden with these treasures , he must have rushed with frantic eagerness to the railway , anxious to reach Chappaqua before some rival-agriculturist should meet him , and violently despoil him or his treasures . It is sad to think of the wasted careand unwearied hope with which he watched the incubation of his seeds , and the sprouting of his rosebushes . No one who knows his simple nature can doubt that he placed implicit faith in the blue-moss roses which wore soon to bloom . and . the strawberrytree which was sure to boar . With his feminine incapacity to keep a secret , be unquestionably confided his floral hopes to his intimate friends , and there is time reason to believe that Mr. Harm Surat was made to wade in the mud . of the Chappaqua farm in order to see the blue-moss rose , and . Mr. JOHN Mounissmv was compelled to shiver beside the strawberry-tree , while its happy owner lauded its beauty and worth . That those new varieties proved oldfashioned failures no one need be told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died , and the mammoth cabbage oven turned out to be a common Peony . At what precise time Mr. GREELEY discovered that he had been imposed upon , and that his hopes were utterly ruined , is not known , but it may be presumed that the discovery immediately preceded the fierce denunciations of the wicked florists which have appeared in the Tribune during the last week . It is. of course , impossible not to sympathize with Mr. GMEELEY in his disappointment . It is also melancholy to find . that ago does not seem to bring him wisdom:and that be is as easy a prey to the impostor , or the practical joker , today as he was in the ingenuous days of his youth . While , however , this sympathy with him will be general , it is hardly probable that the public will justify him in his exhibition of wild . auger toward those who have misled him . It was certainly an unfair thing to take his money for shrubs and seeds which were worthless . Still , the maxim caveat emptor ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the florists ; and as his disappointment is in a great measure the fault of his weakly , confiding nature , ho ought not to permit himself to fly into a Passion with those who have vir , timized him .
