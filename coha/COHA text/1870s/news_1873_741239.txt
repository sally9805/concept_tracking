txt We have lately noticed in quarters which usually furnish sound . views of finance what we consider a curiously perverted conception of the free-banking movement . This has been described as a movement on the part of the national banks ' to secure license to extend their loans at will , and , therefore , unduly . Nothing , we believe , could be more erroneous than this estimate of the movement , both as to those who are most infinen*id in it and as to the probable effect of free banking on the loans of the banks . We are not , of course , prepared to say that the banks are not generally in favor of free banking , and it would be folly to deny that if they get it some of them may abuse it . But it is the business men of the country who are most interested in the reform . They will get the greatest benefit from it , and they furnish the public opinion which is steadily gaining in force , and . which will in the end force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be plain to any one who considers fairly what free banking is . It is simply removing the present restriction on the reserve , and . leaving the banks to regulate their loans as the necessities of the hour may require . Now , the necessities of the hour are the necessities in the main of business men . It is only when they need . money , and . need a good . deal of it , that the banks will have any inducement to loan out any part of their ordinary reserve . This need . on the part of business men will arise generally from legitimate causes , and they will , for the most part , be able to furnish adequate security for such loans as they may require . If they can not furnish such security they ought not to get the money of the banks . If they can furnish such security they ought to get the money , and they ought to get most when they need most . For the law to interfere and say they . shall only get a certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep under all circumstances , whether they *wish to keep it or not , and whether the fact of their keeping it secures strength or invites disaster , is not only an arbitrary thing for the law to do , but it is also an extremely hazardous thing . In any case , it is plain that the law is a limitation of more consequence to the business community than to the banks . Business men so understand it . If they did . not understand it before , they - wore pretty effectually taught it during the recent prolonged and distressing season of " tightness " in the money market , when . a large share of the money of the country was shut in the vaults of the banks , and . another large share was " locked up " by speculators , who were able to lock up their portion solely for the reason that the Banking law had already locked up so much . From this state of things the speculators made a profit ; some of the banks are suspected of sharing in that profit , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hem did ; but those who suffered a loss , and suffered it uniformly and universally , - ere the unfortunate business melt of the iiinintry .. And their loss wary in vited and made possible by the well-intended but oppressive restrictions which the law imposed fur their security . If these restrictions wore removed , it is quite probable that some of the banks would bo guilty of unduly extending their loans . But it is not probable that many of them would , because , presuming the requirement of frequent published statements , no bank could rashly reduce its reserve without losing the confidence of the community . Depositors would be likely to gradually desert a bank which showed a plain recklessness as to preserving its ability to repay deposits when they might bo needed . It may bo said , and by certain writers on the subject it is very frequently said , that the business community can not be trusted to do this ; that they will not always desert a bank , oven when its reserve is much lower than that of others . There is some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or of weak men , or of mon themselves largely extended and involved with their bank , will not or can not protect themselves when the bank shows signs of bad management . But two considerations must be kept in view in this connection . One is that the number of mon who will act in this way is a minority . . Banks could not continue to do business if they wore not . In the mass of men with whom the banks deal , a great majority are and must be cautious and honorable men , who can and . will protect : their own interests . Tho second consideration is that whatever risk of loss comes to depositors from the rashness of their banks , is their own risk . They can incur it , or they can avoid it , as they will . But the risk which comes from violent " squeezes " in the money market , which are made possible by arbitrary provisions of law , is not their own risk . They can not avoid it or prevent its recurrence . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and when Congress is brought into sympathy with the best business men of the country , no such risk will be imposed by law . We believe free banking will , in the main , be t afe , because its safety will depend on those who use the banks . We know of no better way of protecting the public than leaving them to themselves in such matters as these . What reason have we to suppose that Congress can do better than those who are directly interested ? What moans is open to Congress that may not be left open to each depositor to ascertain just what proportion of reserve to liabilities is the safest 7 Such a problem is at best a delicate and difficult one . It is not easy to see the safety of trusting it to Congress instead of to those whose property and . credit are involved . And we are confident ? that what risk . there may be in free banking would be compensated for many times over by the destruction of that false and mechanical reliance on the law to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the most obvious consequences of the excessive interference of the present statute .
