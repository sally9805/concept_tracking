txt The Cuban resolutions introduced , into the House are like those offered in the Senate by Mr. CARPENTER ; but Mr. POLAND declines to be responsible for anything beyond presenting them , and asking their reference to an appropriate committee . We are glad on Mr. POLAND 'S account , for we believe this Cuban movement to be corrupt , and that it originates not so much in a desire to benefit our own country , as to force us to intervene in favor of the Cuban revolt . Moreover , it is pushed by means of Cuban bonds , prepared , printed , and signed in New-York , and by money furnished by the agents here of the insurrection . That Mr. CARPENTER or Mr. POLAND has knowledge of these corrupt appliances we do not for a moment believe . The four paragraphs of the preamble of the resolution are made up in about equal parts of truth and error . The resolution itself first asserts : " That it has become the duty of the United States to recognize Cuba as one of the independent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That the United States will observe strict neutrality between the contending parties during the further prosecution of the war , and will accord to each of them belligerent rights and equal privileges and advantaties in all ports and places within the United States . " It is our " duty " to introduce into the commonwealth of nations a new State when our own welfare , and the rules of public law which we vindicate , demand it . If we profess to be on terms of amity with the parent Government against which a revolt is going on , it is not our duty to crcatc a new State by our intervention , but simply to recognize proved or accepted facts . If we have , and need have , no practical relations with the revolters -- either personal , commercial , naval , military , or official  --  which forces us to deal , as a Government , with a new state of things , we should be as reserved in our action as becomes a great and impartial power . If we can not be impartial , but must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because our national interests demand intervention against the former Government , then we should openly say so to all the world , and honorably Pass from the condition of neutrality to that of hostility against one side , and alliance with the other . Every honest man will , we think , concede the justice of these propositions . If this Government in its wisdom decides that it must recognize a new State inside of Cuba  --  two Governments in that island instead of one  --  and hostilities between the two continue , as the resolution contemplates , then are we to be neutrals in the armed conflict after our recognition I If not , that clearly is equivalent to a declaration of war by us against Spain . But if ' we profess , and the President proclaims neutrality , as England did in our civil war , and as we did in the Franco-German war , what will be the situation and the probable result ? What will be the rights of Spain and our own duties ? The things we demanded of Great Britain , and Germany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms , and sale of ships-of-war , are freshly remembered , as well as the result at Geneva . These are an indication of what our own duties will be , and if Spain declares and maintains an . adequate blockade of the Island of Cuba , she will have the same rights of searching all neutral vessels , ineluding our own , for contraband , as we exercised against English and French ships during our blockade of the Southern ports . Spain will , also , have the additional right to capture all ships or cargoes belonging to the Republic of Cuba which she finds on the high seas , and the Republic will have a cor ? responding right . No one can believe that , even with the best intentions at Madrid and Washington to preserve the peace between Spain and the ' United . States , while the contest for supremacy in Cuba is going on , Spanish cruisers can exercise the right of searching for contraband American vessels on the high seas without bringing on in the end a collision between herself and us . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language , it would even then be difficult to keep the peace ; but the difficulty is greatly increased when the officers do not speak our own language . The declaration that the United States " will accord to each of them belligerent rights and equal privileges and advantages in all ports and places within the United States , " will not affect this right of blockade and search for contraband ; but under it we shall , if perfectly neutral , have to decide whether to permit both parties to fit out mil-. itary enterprises in , and bring their prizes within , our ports , or ' whether we shall rigidly exclude both . The latter is the usual practtce of perfect neutrality ; and , in that event , Spain will have no privilege in our ports greater than those of the new Republic , and We shall be under the obligation of applying to both the rules which we insisted , at Ge neva , Great Britain should have applied t both combatants in our recent civil war .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
