txt The news justreeeived from Russia forms a curious commentary upon the recent declaration of the Nihilists , that " while the Czar 's person is sacred to them , they will not cease to destroy his officers until justice is done . " At the time , this assertion may have been made in perfect good faith ; but from the assassination of a sovereign 's confidential servants to that of the sovereign himself there is , as the French Revolution showed , but one step . The five shots aimed at the Czar are the natural sequel of the attacks on Gen. TREPOFF and Gen.VON DRENTELM , the threatening letters sent to various leading St. Petersburg officers , the recent murder of a student as a traitor to the Nihilist cause , and the widespread dissemination of incendiary pamphlets . Time , which has transformed Russian Imperialism , has transformed Russian Nihilism likewise . When TOURGUENIEFF first bestowed the nickname in his novel of " Fathers and Children , " he made the hero define it as " doing nothing , and merely finding fault . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stage . Such events as that which has just taken place speak for themselves . The numbers of the malcontents are indeed insignificant as yet , compared with the whole population of Russia , but where the intensity of an entire system is thus compressed into a few disciples , their energy becomes doubly formidable . In no country are there fewer ultra-Radicals than in Russia , but in no country'are those who do exist more resolute or more ferocious . It is , in any case , a fact worth noting , that the reign of the present Czar has afforded the first example of political assassinations perpetrated by the people , such attempts having been heretofore the exclu sive work of the nobility . PETER III . was murdered by four officers of good family , belonging to the Preobrajenski ( Transformation ) Regiment . PAUL was strangled by three of the young nobles attached to the service of the Winter Palace . It is now all but certain that the mysterious end of ALEXANDER I. , in 1825 , just at the moment when his anti-aristocratic reforms were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The natural enemies of an autocrat are not , the plebeians but the patricians ; and NICHOLAS 'S appreciation of this truth is shown by the fact that the serf emancipation , for which his son has received so much credit , was really planned by himself , in order to counterpoise the nobility by creating an independent middle class . The first attempt upon the life of the reigning Czar was made on the 16th April , 1866 , by the discharging of a pistol at him as he was leaving the Summer Garden at St. Petersburg . Fortunately , a bystander noticed the attempt in time to strike up the weapon , an event still commemorated by the small chapel of dark marble that looks down upon the Neva from that historical spot , with the inscription , " Touch not mine anointed . " That day 's work was Count SCHOUVALOFF 'S first step to his present commanding position . Prince DOLOOROUKOFF , the head of the Secret Police , utterly failed to trace the assassin , whom he persisted in believing to be a Pole . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his elevation , ' fixed the crime upon the Russian Nihilist , KARAKOZOFF . In the following year came BEREZOVSKI 'S attempt at Paris , drawing from Lows NAPOLEON the readywitted remark : " We are now doubly friends , for we have been under fire together . " In certain select Russian circles there are whispered rumors of a third attempt , when the chain supporting the " elevator-chair " in the Winter Palace was sawn half through , and the lady to whom the Czar had yielded his place fell and broke a limb . For all these sinister portents , however , the Czar has only himself to blame . Called to the throne just when his father 's tyranny had done its worst , he rushed at once into the opposite extreme of hasty reform . The emancipation came in 1861 , the redistribution of land in 1862 , the introduction of postage and gas in 1863 , that of trial by jury in 1864 , the development of the railway system in 1866-7 , the revision of the tariff in 1808 , the reorganization of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of liberty had been thus fostered , and the publie mind habituated to startling changes , the Czar , scared bythe repeated attempts upon ' his life ; and by the " Moscow petition " of 1870 for popular privileges and the freedom of the press , made a sudden and violent reaction toward despotism . Discontent followed , as a matter of course , and its centre , as in mediaeval Paris , was the University . The plot of NETCHAIEFF in 1871 , and that of the " five universities " in 1872 , were the protest which the oppressed students , deprived of public speech and representation , forbidden even to hold meetings among , themselves , he sized in with childish restrictions , subjected to cruel and degrading punishments , made against their oppressors . The spread of Nihilist doctrines is made formidably easy by the system of village communes , and its influence upon the common people ; nor can this spectacle of open and bloody resistance to the Government be wholly without effect even upon the phlegmatic Russian . The best remedy for this agitation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Panslavist war ; and that remedy , if men and money are to be had for the purpose , Russia would only be too ready to apply .
