A SKETCH . IF this philosophical teacher and divine had chosen to live in some rural spot , or from an academic grove had sent his thoughts out to the world - in such case possibly the world 's attention would have been more speedily fixed upon him . He would be even more conspicuous by position , though not by magnitude , than he has become through his peculiar eminence among the notable preachers of New York . Settled in a provincial town , he doubtless would make the place of his teachings , as Emerson has made Concord , a modern oracle and shrine . Frothiugham has been called the successor of Theodore Parker , whose life he has written with equal simplicity , reverence , and judicial poise . Certainly we have no other man who , since the death of Parker , has so persistently grounded all religious faith and hope upon the basis of reason , nature , discovered law . No other preacher , taking up the ideas to which Parker finally advanced , has so expanded and developed them in keeping with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him rests upon a religious orator who displays less of that magnetic power which , in its lower manifestation , sustains the demagogue , and , in itshigher , the noble leader of men ; yet upon one who can see to it , by every gift of culture , purpose , and unflagging , zeal , that no step is taken backward , and who with his rational intellect has crystallized in a religious system what was at first an inspiration  --  the revelation of a lofty and impetuous yet somewhat overburdened soul . Parker stormed traditionalism in its stronghold . Boston , the nucleus of intellectual pride , was so content with the advance of Unitarianism that it was less easy to draw her liberals any further than to disorganize the ranks of the extreme devotees of authority . While Parker was striving to enfranchise religious belief , even a Roman Catholic was more likely to swing over to rationalism than was a Unitarian of the period . Frothingham , the disciple and successor , saw that to make the work complete he must enter upon a wider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  the world as rep. resented in a metropolis . Mr. Conway recently said of London that it afforded a hearing and companionship to any mind , no matter how eccentric , since there is no person who will not find among millions , gathered from every race and country , others of like creed and disposition with his own . In New York , since it has fairly become metropolitan , the same chance is to be found as in London , Paris , and other great cities of the world . Here , then , Frothingham at least was sure , first , of a foothold ; secondly , of room for growth ; and hither he came , to transplant his scion and to nourish it for years . In such a place as New York enduring qualities are not those which at once enforce attention . Every year some new claimant appears in each profession , and often disappears as quickly . But . when position is once legitimately attained , it is reputation and power , extending to the borders of the land . Mr. Frothingham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediate followers , but also , whether he will or no , what is termed a " popular preacher . " His church is at the present time one of the widely known resorts of visitors who would acquaint themselves with the characteristic men and places of the city . In making a brief sketch of its leading features , we may also touch upon its religious // system , and upon the quality and bearing of the preacher to whom it owes a vigorous establishment . It is believed that many readers who are bitterly at variance with Frothingham 's doctrines must nevertheless take an interest in the power and attitude of the man . No preacher is more fully entitled to the epithet " representative . " In temperament and person he is of the purest New England type . As to the former , Edwards , Hopkins , Bellamy , were of the like spiritual , self-contained , and daunfless mould ; as to the latter , his form and features repeat characteristics which have been found among eastern theologians and scholars from the early colonial times . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the large unarched New England nose , and the pointed chin-suggesting equally the most delicate refinement and the sturdiest polemical valor . Here are the blue-gray , scholarly , half-gentle , half-satirical eyes , a mobile mouth , compressed and accurate lips . The whole head is of the down-east , Brahministic type ; somewhat aristocratic ; for the clergy of the New England colonies were an aristocracy by selection , learning , and faith . In brief , here is one whom you might suppose to have had , like Emerson , eight generations of orthodox preachers behind him ; a man who , in the light of an earlier period , might have been a Calvinist of the sternest order , and have died for his belief , or have gone out into the forest with as stout a heart as he brought , in these times , to oui ' " wilderness of brick and stone . " But we are not living in the colonial period , and Calvinism , being no longer a protest , is no longer an instinctive religion with men of his type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the service conducted by him , and then speak of his devotional philosophy - remarking that this , while changeless in an essential spirit of aspiration and receptivity , is avowedly subject to modification by whatever 479 knowledge may be acquired . Though its purpose remains the same , its outward form moves in an ascending scale . " More light , " is the teacher 's perpetual cry , and his belief is even more freshly and truthfully set forth as new discoveries are apparent to him . The large hall in the Masonic Temple , at the junction of Twenty-third street and Sixth avenue , is a place leased on Sundays to Mr. Frothingham 's congregation , and devoted to the performance of a religious service . A lofty ceiling rests upon two rows of imposing but somewhat cumbrous pillars , that lead to a semicircular recess and the speaker 's chair-above which are visible the ancient symbols of the " craft . " Exercises begin at 10:45 A. M. , but at that time not more than one half of the audience has arrived . It is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visible upon the countenances of regular attendants . A voluntary is performed upon the organ , and a hymn , possibly selected from the Unitarian collection , is sung by a choir of four voices . You will not fail to take notice that the music is exquisite . This , and the floral decorations of the lecturn , show that here the tusthetic harmonies are well observed , though rendered subordinate to the main purpose of the hour . The preacher rises , and receives close attention . The book which he usually reads is one compiled from the sacred scriptures of many ancient nations , and entitled " The Sacred Anthology " : a work arranged by Moncure D. Conway , in whose London chapel a liberal service also is held . Mr. Frothingham begins to read , in tones that at first are somewhat labored or muffled , but speedily attract and hold the ear ; his voice , despite a few peculiarities of articulation , having a quality and distinction of its own . His chief effort is to convey the full meaning of the printed text @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the teachings of the ancient scriptures . This is from the Hindu " ; or , " This is from the Chinese " ; afterward , // " This is from the Hebrew " ( Old Testament ) ; or , " This is from the PerSian " ; or figain , " This is from the Christian " ( New Testament ) ; thus giving no precedence in authority to any selection , but valuing each for its beauty , wisdom , piety , and internal truth . After the reading , of this unusual character , the doors are opened to admit another throng of people , who seat themselves in time for the prayer . The speaker 's voice rises in an invocation to the Supreme Source of Law and Goodness-an address which is an aspiration , a poem of reverence , worship , and acknowledgment , but never , by any chance , a petition to a listening Ruler for gifts , protection , or other personal and special benefits . The ties of human brotherhood are remembered ; the noble souls that have sought for truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoken of as the saints whose memory every professor of the liberal faith must love and cherish , and whose example it is a holy ambition to imitate . Thus much of Positivism is often reflected in Mr. Frothingham 's speech and prayer . But in assuming for the title of an important volume , * which illustrates his religious system , a phrase adopted by the followers off Comte , he seeks to invest the beautiful expression with a more expansive and spiritual comprehensiveness . Still , the idea of human brotherhood , as a religious basis , is frequently advanced by him in words such as these-which formed the larger portion of one of his recent prayers : Let us be striving , this morning , to get some nearer Insight into that great Eternity , to which so many things are passing ever more from our mortal sight . We would feel how little we know , how short-sightedis our vision . We would know how much there is of purity that we have never felt , how much of justice we have never seen , of sweetness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have never cherished . We would believe , in our life , that there are worlds on worlds of knowledge , of wisdom , of good , of sanctity , of loving kindness , and good will , which * " The Religion of Humanity .

We would believe that these worlds are round about us all the time . We would believe that , whatever we may have of faith or hope , of love or earnest desire , we can eater into and bring down into our hearts the peace and strength of these blessings . We would remember the character of those before , the gifts that have come down to us , the light of glory in our darkness , of hope in our fears , of courage In our weakness , of faith in our doubt , of peace and joy in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as this of doubting and questioning - where there are so many things to be asked , and answers are so few-where the problems are so deep and perplexing and the solution of them so far away-where there Is so much to be borne and forborne , so much to be remembered and so much to be forgotten-where there are so many debts to be forgiven , so many evils to be eradictited , so many wounds to be healed , and so many patients to be cured-where there is this perpetual struggle-where we must lift ourselves up by such strength as we possess-we would remember the great words of faith and courage that echo through all the ages , responded to by the earnest hearts of mankind , the great strong-hearted men , the noble , sainted women , who , with hearts full of affection , and souls bright with glory , and minds thirsting for truth , have walked their short journey in life and done the work given them to do while the day lasted , and , in parting , have left behind them contributions to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be profoundly grateful for all these aids , and supports , and benedictions , and by our endeavor we would make them not less , but more , richer , not poorer ; to help ourselves and to help our fellow men to renew their lives , and so render praise and glory for ever to the Author of Supreme Goodness and Life . This prayer , equally with George Eljot 's noble lines beginning , " Oh , may I join the choir invisible , " breathes the spirit of reverence for the saints and martyrs of humanity ; but does not aspire to the utter self-*abnegation implied in her relinquishment of the desire for a personal immortality beyond the grave . After another hymn , the sermon is delayed for a few moments during the admission of a new multitude of late corners , who arrive for the purpose *of listening to this unique discourse . An air of mutual acquaintance pervades the congregation , more noticeable than in other churches ; but there are many strangers , attracted by the reputation of the preacher , and dispoeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Judged simply as an intellectual // performance , the sermon is almost without a modern counterpart . However impressive the genius , fervor , oratory , of the most noted preachers be longing to our established sects , there is no one of them whose spirit is more eloquent and imaginative , and no one who relies so utterly upon the force of reason in his teachings , or who ventures to proffer his audience a discourse so thoroughly demanding attention and the exercise of the mental powers . While profoundly reverential , he reverses the method of evangelical preachers , . and essays to reach the heart through the brain-through the perceptive , reasoning , and esthetic faculties . He prefers to take the hearer in his sanest , acutest moodhis most logical mood ; in the full possession of the judgment with which a hu*nan being is endowed . As he stands with his sinewy but light and graceful figure , apart from the desk , you see that , although his discourse may have been carefully prepared , it is to be spoken , not read ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and you study the play of his features as he begins , without flaw or impediment , to speak and " think while on his feet . " It is a remarkable piece of intellectual oratory , exciting the surprise of cultured listeners . Commencing without a text , but with the announcement of a theme , he continues for an hour or more to pour out a stream of thoughts in language nearly as compact as Emerson 's prose , yet so clear that even his youngest auditors are persuaded by its charm . We should compare his thought to Emerson 's for closeness and wisdom , but it is arranged upon a logical system which *s absent from the epigrammatic essays of the Concord sage . Frothingham 's method is synthetic ; he pays regard to the framework and order of his discourse . At times his expressions are highly poetical , and he warms into eloquence of looks , speech , and gesture . What the teachers call elocution is against him ; his voice , in spite o* himself , plays him tricks , . and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentence . But he is all imbued with his theme , forces hearers to keep pace with him , and holds them to the end . Every face is directed toward him ; young and old hang upon his lips , as if anxious that no word " should be lost . " In the total absence of ordinary platform tricks this is , I say , a triumph of pure reason . At the close , even if you feel that you have been subjected to a certain mental tension , you acknowledge that nothing can be more fascinating than the study of so fine and free an intellect thus brought into play . There is no mental impoverishment ; the audience departs well fed , and the food carries its own aid to digestion . What is the religion taught by this preacher , and how is this congregation , with its original forms of worship , gathered and sustained by his ministrations ? Recalling the series of discourses preached at the Masonic Temple last winter , and condensing their essential matter , we . may obtain a partial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Frothingham 's own words . His rational or " reasonable " religion is to be distinguished , first , from a religion founded , like Romanism , on authority ; secondly , from a religion founded on simple faith . It claims to have reached a higher level than that of the Old or New Testament . It subjects the chronology , history , miracles of the Bible to investigation , and judges it to be a compilation , and not a single work divinely organized and inspired . It has no sealed book . Its canon of Scripture is not completed , nor will be . It reads all Bibles , Indi* an , Persian , or Christian . It opposes alike that " evangelicalism " which requires us to accept as revelation a special theory of the universe , and on the other hand that bold intellectualism which is equally intolerant in an opposite way . It recognizes the heart and soul of man , with his instincts and hopes . Finally , it discerns a perpetu. // al revelation in the phases of nature , as elucidated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infidelity , as opposed to orthodoxy , but regards the infidels of all periods as earnest and conscientious men ; often martyrs and pioneers of new thought . Infidelity is a great word and describes a great thing . It has been applied to holders of widely different opinions ; to the primitive Christians , to the Jews of the middle ages , to the Protestants of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries , to historians , to the New England transcendentalists , to the school of Parker . It is used to describe the opinions of the minority , the suspected and hated few . Modern infidelity is of two kinds : the old , destructive school of Paine and the French revolutionists , the new , constructive religion which liberalists are professing . This religion is more than any particular system of faith , and much greater than the forms and traditions of the past ; in fact , it is always seeking grander and more beautiful forms , a surer vision , a more radiant hope . Mr. Frothingham does not hold himself quite in sympathy with the woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand and a bucket of water in the other , that with the one she might burn up heaven and with the other extinguish hell . On the contrary , while preaching that right should be done because it is right , lie also justifies a system based on hopes and fears ; on a wise recognition of con8equence8 . These he deems the enactments of the universe , and thinks that according to their natures they produce the conditions which people have dramatized under the epithets of heaven and hell . To be sure these words , in their theological sense , are spoiled phraseology , and no longer believed in . But they have had their restraining uses , have acted as a police force in the regulation of human affairs , and their place must still be suppliedby a wholesome regard for the good or evil consequences which inevitably wait upon the observance or vi@lation of universal law . In answer to the question propounded by the advocates of tradition and authority , Why go to church ? he takes occasion to explain and justify his own forms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who find the standard orthodox ceremonies fiat , stale , and unprofitable . The aim of his service is to stimulate the mind and move the feelings in the direction of ideal thought , goodness , and beauty ; it belongs to those agencies by which men are elevated and made pure . To these ends it legitimately employs : ( 1 ) Music . ( 2 ) Reading of Scriptures which contain the antique wisdom of the race ; all " sacred* ' writings that utter the solemn convictions of their ages and peoples . ( 3 ) Prayer . There is no religion without this . But to prayer he restores the original meaning , the heart 's desire for unattained good . It is hunger and thirst for divine things , not a means of propitiating higher powers or establishing private relations with a patron deity . The desire is its own satisfaction ; the petition its own answer . Omit this aspiration and the spiritual or finest intellectual feature of his service would depart . ( 4 ) The sermon . This is addressed not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , like the Romish priest or Protestant divine , arrogate a special inspiration by virtue of ordination or consecration . He has no gospel ofredemption , no sealed commission ; he claims for his words no authority , and affects to possess no knowledge above other men . It is his province to discuss subjects which people require to have presented statedly , for the reason that secular life tends to keep them out of mind . These are not the Trinity , deity of Christ , atonement , and other traditional themes ; rather the relations of man to man , the hopes and capacities of the race , the significance of the ancient words God , immortality , life , death-of worship , piety , brotherly love . All these he would interpret and illuminate as matters of vital concernment , and apply their les // 483 sons to the needs of the hour . In this way the higher ministry is attained , and made progressive and perpetual . Mr. Frothingham 's views concerning the nature and existence of a Divine Being are frankly set forth in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expression , entitled " The Living God , " " Thoughts About God , " and " The Theist'sFaith . " His position relative to this subject and to the question of immortality , the two vital matters with every inquiring soul , has been so often scrutinized , that he seems at pains to define it , for the satisfaction of his hearers and for his own vindication before the outer world . He may be termed a theist , in the broad and aspiring sense of that word . Our thoughts of God , he says , are all that we have ; but the picture framed by human mind is inadequate , whether that of the Trinitarians , the Unitarians , the Theist , or the Pantheist . Anthropomorphism is totally absent from his conception , and he discovers this quality in all religions of all races - from the savage to the modern Christian-in the faiths of the Indian , the Hebrew , the Greek , the Goth , the bigot , and the philosopher . To limit the Divine Being by our thoughts of him is fatal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , makes Deity responsible for what ts due simply to the limitations of our own minds . Human thoughts about God harden into tyrannous theologies . We arraign Providence by our own standards , not Seeing that inflexible and eternal Law is the universal and benignant Providence ; we measure God by our own narrow comprehension , as if we could embrace the vast design . Therefore Frothingham foregoes all attempts to conceive of a personal God . But let us quote his own words : In this it is not implied that God does not exist as a being , but only that we do not apprehend * " Beliefs of the Unbelievers , and Other Discourses . " By 0 . B. Frotblugb.am . New York : G. P. Putnam 's Sons . him as a being . It is impossible for me not to believe that the universe is governed by an intelligent will ; but it is equally impossible for me to imagine the nature of the intelligence or to conjecture the movements of the will . Believe in the Supreme Power , trust it , repose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reality beyond our comprehension or our reach . This is a point that can not be seized too firmly . The stronger my faith in God the more modest my estimate of such an idea of Him as it is practicable for me to form . The notion that He might be such a being as mind can conceive , no greater , no wiser , no nobler , would drive me into atheism . It is only by remembering faithfully the utter inadequacy of my thought that I can make Him an object of adoration . With the sorrowful atheism of Mill , for example , Frothingham is wholly at issue . He finds peace and satisfaction in the reign of law . He recognizes what we call evil as a portion of a universal plan beyond our present comprehension or arraignment , and believes in God as " a power outside of us that works for righteousness . " * If this be so , the heart of the theist is content . Faith in such a power , based on what we can discover of the nature of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a faith as one may reasonably cling to . * From another prayer , taken from the report of the service at Masonic Temple , June 4 , 1876 , we quote the following passage , in further illustration of Mr. Frothingham 's conception of the Su. preme Being : " Spirit of Truth , Inspirer , Helper , Consoler , we invoke Thy presence ; we implore Thy peace . Thou hast no name by which we can call Thee ; Thou hast no orm under which we can apprehend Thee ; Thou dwellest In no place ; Thou hast no temple ; Thou speakest to us in no voice ; we have no thought that can comprehend Thee , no feeling that can do justice to Thee ; and yet we may have Thee in our hearts ; through the dark paths of our life we may be guided by Thee as our light . . . . We would feel the privilege of being emancipated ever so little from the bondage of prejudice and tradition , of being able to lift up our minds ever so little above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and everlasting light that is changeless and shadowless , for ever and ever . We mourn not that what has been called inspiration has ceased , that great words once devoutly listened for are hushed , that much that has been mistermed knowledge has passed away , that revelations which men have walted for , and longed for , and greeted with uplifted souls , have lost their meaning for us . We rejoice that our hearts are stirred as with a divine hope , that our minds are quickened with a deep and earnest love of knowledge , that our souls are alight with glorious anticipations of human good , that our conscience has felt the power of unutterable law , and our hearts the sweetness of an unspeakable peace . " // He consequently does not seek to recall a vanished God , deeming a God . who appeared and then disappeared to be more hopelessly absent than a God who never appeared . Nor need we imagine a time when God will manifest Himself , nor solve the difficulty with those revivalists who import a Deity for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this supreme power-define it and speculate about It as we will-think of It and reason about it as we may-is or is not LIVING  --  a real power of intelligence and will , or nothing at all but a fiction of our minds . - - - The universe Is conceded by earnest , believing , religious men , not matei-ialisls or skeptics , to be not so much a complicated machine , which once made need not even be superIntended , as a living abode and ever present manifestation of whatever being , spirit , power it is that men call by the name of deity . - - - So far then , the conception of a living God is made definite . No hint , it may be , is thrown out in regard to the nature of infinite being ; we are as far perhaps us ever from a knowledge of what God may be in Himself ; nay , the mystery of that may possibly be deepened ; still that whatever power there is is alive , in every atom of space , in every Instant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , let us add , in a much higher form In mind than in visible matter . er*Ist is then the object of the teach discourses , so far as theology is concerned , to seek for the present manifestation of this Supreme Being , discarding all other revelations , and to constantly obtain loftier views of His goodness and power . Upon the question of immortalityi .. e. , of the future existence of the soul in its separate individuality , preserving its affections , conscience , noquirements , memories , hopes , tastes , and perceptions-upon this question Frothingham 's position seems not unlike Emerson 's , to wit : that this " secret is very cunningly hid . " He has referred to the belief of the early Christians in the resurrection of all who belong to Christ , and to the new doctrine of Dodwell and Clarke , the Oxford lecturers , who made the immortality of the soul a consequent upon its immateriality ; but he finds no proof of all this , not even in the modem phenomena &amp; " spiritualism . " Yet in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is specially diehe discerns a " great hope , " a hope cussed , also , In his sermon entitled " The Glorified Man , " delivered April 16 , 1876 . ( G. P. Putwide , encouraging , and sweet to men . nam 's Sons . ) To be permitted thus to hope is enough . The mystery of the future is its charm . The hope of immortality is deeper and more universal than the belief in it . It seems never to die ; . it revives and increases as the faith in conscious continuance in another state of being declines . Among just grounds for this hope he includes the imperative demand for justice , in view of the apparent disarrangement and incompleteness of human affairs ; in the incompleteness and arrested development of life and of the soul itself ; in the starvation and frustration of our holiest natural affections and aspirations . Reason lends its ear to such cries , and those who disbelicve in creeds and revclation may well cling to this magnificent hope. * As to faith itself , when assuming the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happiness after death , and to possess a monopoly of the privilege of admitting souls to it , he esteems this a sheer perversion of power . The pretension is that of supposition , not of faith . Religion has no sympathy with it ; true religion strives to disengage itself from this despotism , of which extreme types are found in the iron sway of the Roman Catholic church and in the unyielding dogmas of the Calvinists . But faith based upon knowledge and upon loftiness of motive is a part of true religion . The trouble is that it often claims to rest on knowledge when it rests on fancy ; to rest on fact , and its fact is fiction ; to rest upon history , and its history is mythology . The place and work of true *faith are admitted by science it-self : For the scientific man lives by faith , in this sense : faith in the integrity of Nature , the omnipresence and inviolability of law , the equivalence of forces ; falth that " the universe was made at one cast , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that sand grains and planets obey the same kind of impulse ; faith of a truly audacious and somewhat speculative sort . // the ground of moral enthusiasm and of every historic reform . The strong workers , the wise prophets , the bold achievers , have been men who believed in inviolable laws and principles , have been eminently men of faith . Let us now consider this preacher 's relations with the flock under his charge , and the nature of his practical admonitions . Teaching a rational , not authoritative religion , and always seeking new light for faith and hope , he naturally pays careful , learned , and eloquent attention to scientific discovery and social progress , and finds the clearest revelation of Deity in Nature 's elements and processes , and the best evidence of " pure religion and nudefiled " in the sympathy of man with man . His illustrations and arguments are largely drawn from acientific truths , of which no one is a more ardent and well-informed observer . His moral injunctions are pointed and incessant . He is a stern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many to venture upon dangerous ground . There is no sentimental looseness or license in his doctrine . Morals are of the first importance . Works , despised by the Calvinist , receive honor at his hands . Spirituality begins , continues , and culminates in use . To be nobly , humanely useful is to be spiritual in a grand way . Love your neighbor more than yourself ; pay your debts ; lead pure and rational lives ; conform to the laws of nature ; be honest even in your secret heart . After all these he fearlessly and honestly endeavors . He strives in every way to nourish a close and deligjtful social brotherhood among his people . As to the worship of children , he enjoins upon parents the duty of keeping the youthful heart untrammelled either by selfishness or superstitious fear . He finds in the very clogs of life its greatest opportunities . Even the clog of theology , the stumbling-block of bigotry , the barricade of dogmatism , have a use and value . False religions have educated the human mind in faith and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The theology of New Engisnd , against which liberalism is a protest , explains New England 's moral growth : Hard , acrid , angular , how many tender bosoms have been bruised against : t ; how many delicate consciences and sensitive souls have been wounded and struck to death by its sharp points ! And yet what a discipline In thought It was t For when men were hedged round as with a line of fire by these tremendous dogmas of predestination , depravity , atonement , hell , It was Imperative that they should resist and react . Reaction In favor of rational liberty of mind could not be prevented . . . . It was the conscientious effort of those pious , painful men to find out the truth within the limits appointed to them-to grapple with the terrible questions which their age propounded , and to answer them as they could . Peoplewho are brought up outside of the old theology , who were boru into liberalism without personal knowledge of the older faith , having no problams thrown down before them , and consequently being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tempted never to ask , and falling to ask become loose , flaccid , and Indolent In their minds . We have to conjure up for them new questions , to bring forward new problems that will take the place of the grim old provocatives their fathers knew . It is to little purpose that we have garnered these thoughts from the outgivings of Mr. Frothiugharn , if it does not now appear that he ht*s a very definite creed of his own in the liberal religion , and that he belongs to the constructive rather than to the old destructive order of spiritual reformers . In calling upon those who are dissatisfied with traditional theology to come out openly in favor of the new religion , and thus join the ranks of the searchers after truth , he is earnest and plainspoken . Clearness and faithfulness in conviction he deems especially important in a period of transition , and pays a tribute to Proctor for honesty in disavowing an inherited creed because it was inconsistent with his scientific faith . He takes up and demolishes , one by one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wine in old bottles , and he that is not with the truth is against it . Frothingham , as we already have intimated , differs from other radicals by his comprehensive mental scope and impartial attitude . He certainly has little of the bigotry of reform , or of the pride that apes humility . Often // his congregation is startled by some ground taken precisely the opposite of what the more radical expect from him . Thus , in speaking of the Pharisees , he perceives their spirit among both the Philistine and Bohemian classes of all times ; among conservatives and radicals , rich and poor , the formal and the free . It is the spirit which brings those of any class to set themselves apart as being worthier than their enemies or neighbors . This is the soul of Pharisecism , the source of exclusiveness , assumption , arrogance , and , of course , of bitterness , formalism , hypocrisy . There are Pharisees philosophical , scientific , aristocratic , democratic , professional , orthodox , heterodox . The attitude of actors toward the clergy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dramatic calling . The Bohemian may be a Pharisee as lofty in pretension as the Conventionalist , etc. , etc . The strictly judicial cast of mind which prompts these utterances leads one often to think him unduly fond of paradox , until it is seen that what seems startling to others is to him the first and most truthful view of his subject . As his point becomes fairly understood , you perceive that he is an intellectual discoverer , with a method original and peculiar . Yet with all his reasoning , it has been well said that his " mind is logical in its method of thought , but not in form of expression . " The latter is often rhetorical , and seems discursive from its wealth of imagery and illustration . It should be remembered that he said of written English , " is but an accident . " He is a poet-one who masters and is not carried away by his imagination . The resthetic side of his nature is cultured to a rare and sensitive degree . Taste is apparent in word , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his duty as a teacher , and is not one like him who - built his soul a lordly pleasure house , Wherein at ease for aye to dwell . His predilections for art and literature are manifestly strong , and if he had followed authorship exclusively , he would be most distinguished in that calling . His scholarship excels that of many learned doctors . If not elaborate in special fields , it is broad , rich universal , cove ring with ardent and impartial view the literature of all peoples and times . Owing to the popular knowledge of Mr. Frothingham 's liberality toward all who desire to worship after the dictates of their own natures , all sorts of new-fangled reformers and doctrinaires appeal to him and to his society for recognition or aid . If he has a weakness , it is an excessive good nature , which makes him averse to utterly repelling even the most indiscreet . His charity in this respect often has led to a misconception of his own views on the part of the orthodox world , who father upon him many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be heartily amused at the poverty or foolishness of the creed . In reality the critical bent of his mind has been so increased by training that , as becomes an investigator , he subjects every fact and doctrine to the most relentless scrutiny . A disdain of empty sentiment never leaves him ; there is no obtaining emotions under false pretences at Masonic Hall . Conscience and sincerity make him strong and clear . One who listens to him for the first time might accuse him of lacking that indefinable quality termed magnetism . But he is in truth both magnetic and humane , full of Rractical charities , and exquisitely sensitive to the friendship of those whom he respects and loves . In private life he is delightful , and , by his sweetness , humor , conversational tact and power , the inciter of general delight . To see him in his home is a privilege indeed . Here , and among the groups of his select acquaintance , he is the flower of courtesy and companionship-a gentleman of the most refined and genuine school . A word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Religion of Humanity , " mentioned heretofore , is a series of essays upon Modern Tendencies , God , the Bible , the Power of Moral Inspiration , Providence , Immortality , Conscience , the Soul of Truth in Error and that of Good in Evil . Another of his volumes is " Beliefs of the Unbelievers , and Other Discourses . " His " Life of Theodore Parker " is an inspiriting and well-proportioned biography . It has been aptly succeeded by the " History of Transcendentalism in New England , " a book which those interested in that remarkable phase and movement long ago called upon him to write ; and no other man , unless we include Dr. Ripley , is so fitted for the task , or could have accomplished it so readily and well . It is , in its way , a handbook of philosophic inquiry , from the time of Kant , and as a record of New England transcendentalism and of the lives of the poetic , original beings who were the leaders of that movement is , and will remain , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the ways , thoughts , and culture of the young . Years ago he made an attractive paraphrase of some familiar Scripture legends , in two volumes- " Stories from the Lips of the Teacher " and " Stories of the Patriarchs . " His " Child 's Book of Religion , " for Sunday-schools and homes , is a unique and attractive compilation , prose and verse , for the enjoyment and religious training of children . He has been a frequent contributor to our leading magazines and reviews . A feature of his church is the gratuitous distribution of his more impressive discourses , stenographically reported from week to week . These , and all of his printed works , are issued and for sale by the Putnams , and form a library of original and eloquent religious teaching . Mr. Frothingham was born in Boston , and is now at his prime , something more than fifty years of age , although his face and figure are those of a younger man . He belonged to the Harvard class of 1843 , went through the course of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his distinguished father , a Unitarian clergyman . For some years he was the pastor of a church in old Salem , but finally , after a period of study , controversy , and foreign travel , grew too radical and progressive to be bound by the ties of any existing organization . In 1855 he began to preach , upon an independent basis , to a small congregation in Jersey City . In 1859 he removed to New York , organized a society , and for some years preached in a church near Sixth avenue , on Fortieth street . After a time it was thought advisable to sell that building , and the society removed to Lyric Hall , which became famous through the reputation of its preacher . A peculiar congregation , though until recently a small one , gathered around him ; a fit audience , though few , making up in character and influence whatever it lacked in numbers and worldly wealth . Some of our choicest and best known writers , thinkers , and philanthropists , have belonged to this society . It has also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church going , have resorted to Mr. Frothingham 's church as to a place where absolute freedom of conscience is proffered to the worshipper . No doubt it is looked upon as a cave of Adullam by the orthodox ; certainly it is the haunt of eager , restless , unsatisfied spirits , attracted by the originality and boldn6ss of the preacher 's views . Members of the literary , artistic , and dramatic guilds favor it , and here you find a select group from the scholarly and learned professions . Many Israelites , of the progressive school , are scattered among the audience . In the fall of 1875 the society removed from Lyric Hall to its more convenient and beautiful quarters in the Masonic Temple . An immediate and great enlargement of the congregation was the result . It has nearly doubled its numbers and resources , and the hall , during the winter of // 1875- ' 76 , was crowded with audiences listening to a brilliant and notable series of discourses . Marked attention was given to this series by that portion of the press which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the men and matters of our time . The spirit of the society is declared by the " rules " of the " Independent Liberal Church " to be not in any sense ecclesiastical or dogmatical , but is purely social . No distinction is allowed between members of the " church " and members of the " congregation . " The society is " cordial , open , humane ; its welcome is warm , its sympathies are wide , and it relies on these qualities for its influence and success . " But one regular service with preaching is held during the week , that of Sunday morning  --  the afternoon of Sunday being devoted to pastoral lectures and instruction . Social reunions occur on secular evenings , at intervals , and are of a pleasant and entertaining nature . A peculiar feeling of brotherhood exists among the frequenters of the church . No sacraments are observed or rites administered . The ceremony of christening , or the dedication of childhood , as a social rite of poetic significance , is performed by the pastor when requested .

This is in accordance with the principle announced in - its constitution , which declares that it is " established for the support of public worship , the maintonance of a religious faith , liberal , intelligent , and progressive , the cultivation of religious life , individual and social , insisting always on freedom of individual opinion in all matters of religious belief , and claiming to be responsible only to God and the private conscience . " A section of the by-laws declares : " It is expressly understood that no subscription or assent to any covenant or formula of faith shall be required of any member . " The national " Free Religious Association " is an organization which counts upon the list of its directors such names as Emerson , Youmans , Curtis , Higginson , Weiss , Sargent , Lucretia Mott , Lydia Maria Child . Frothingham 's position as the most active and eminent leader , since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America , is confirmed by the action of this body . At the time of its formation he was unanimously elected to the Presidency , an office which he still retains . His own church , as we have seen , has reached a vigorous maturity . Leaving out of question the vitality claimed for such an institution as we have described , it is exposed to perilous contingencies , being held together and nurtured by the force of a master who as yet has but few professional associates , and to whose place no one at this moment could fitly succeed . - Our sketch , however inadequate , of a remarkable teacher , his system , and the church under his guidance , must now be ended . But even this much will serve to show that many notions current with respect to Octavius Brooks Frotl*ingham are utterly superficial ; that his reverential and judicial qualities are on a level with his acknowledged intellectual genius , and that he exerts in this I*ommunity , and througliout the world of religious aspiration , a constant , earnest , and most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
