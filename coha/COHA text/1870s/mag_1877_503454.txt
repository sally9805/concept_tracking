Mns . ANNIE EDWARDS shows in her new novel a tendency to careless writing . She has always had a propensity to loose and almost free-and-easy style , and this is apparently growing upon her . A verbal critic might find many causes of offence in " A Blue Stocking " ; but unless he were particularly captious , he would soon forgive all these for the sake of the story and the pleasant way in which it is told . Mrs. Edwards has the faculty of making living men and women , and of interesting us immediately in them . She does not write in what Walter Scott called " the big bow-wow style , " in which he naively said he himself was an adept , and of which George Eliot is the great living exemplar . She deals little in analysis and in introspection , but simply puts her people before you , gcts them into trouble , and then gets them out of it ; and what would a novel reader ask more ? The book is called " A Blue Stocking , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is she herself very blue , except with that sort of blueness which comes upon a young woman who js engaged to marry one man when she loves another . In her early youth she was over educated , and was up in all the " ologies " ; but of this she became heartily sick , and was ready to sacrifice the whole Royal Society for her love for a cousin , " a dandy with an eyeglass , " and yet a good manly sort of fellow at hottom notwithstanding . The heroine of the story is Daphne Chester , a young widow with a child , who , living a secluded life in the island of Jersey , was in her extreme youth led into a marriage with a good-for-naught , who deserted her , and died miserably , relieving her of an intolerable burden . She lives with three maiden aunts at an old farm , called Fief de la Reine , and is oppressed by the monotony of her existence . Her brief married life was so sad that at twenty-two she looks upon the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one day , as * " A Blue Stocking .

For Daphne is very beautiful in the fair , golden-haired , Venus type . Rarely have the personal charms of a fair woman been more deftly set forth-rather indicated than described-in any of the many novels of the day . We feel rather than see that she must have been enchanting . The gentleman drops a letter , which Daphne picks up and returns to him . She sees that his name is Sir John Severne , and that the letter is in a lady 's handwriting . In fact , it is from the blue stocking to whom he is engaged . Sir John goes off to the seashore , and thither too goes Daphne 's mischievous little son , whom she left in charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a book and forgot her charge . The boy is surprised by the incoming tide , and would certainly have been drowned but for Sir John , who saves him at the risk of his own life . Daphne returns to Fief de la Reine just in time to see her little darling brought in safely by those who have gone to Sir John 's assistance , while Sir John walks behind dripping like a sea god . Daphne rushes to him , falls on her knees , takes his hand and covers it with kisses . Here is a situation for a man who at a glance had become enamored of the beautiful young mother whom he met in the fields . Of course he falls desperately in love , and Daphne , in a most unaccountable manner , does the same . But what is to be done ? He is solemnly engaged , an engagement of three years ' standing , during which time he has been in India , out of reach and out of sight of the blue stocking . Daphne discovers the engagement , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John make love to her . But he does it all the same ; and Daphne , in spite of her honor , likes it hugely . Nevertheless she is firm , and will give her lover no encouragement . This situation furnishes the complication of the story , which , to tell the truth , is not of very // robust construction . Of course everything turns out all as it should . The blue stocking at last takes matters into her own hands , defies her family , is married to her cousin , and comes to Fief de la Reine to see Daphne and " tell her all about it " ; whereupon , of course , all objection as the score of honor being removed , Sir John and Daphne go and do likewise . The minor personages of the story are drawn with great skill , and are very interesting . Two of the old aunts are admirable : one a selfish sentimentalist of the old school ; the other a simple , downright , full-hearted woman , between whom and Daphne there is a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who visit Jersey in a yacht , and the dandy with the eyeglass , who yet is man enough to take his cousin up in his arms and carry her through the water , and stop in the midst of it , and make love to her-all are touched off with a vivid pencil . The book , although not one of Mrs. Edwards 's best , is very pleasant reading . - Sometimes a poor thing is so perfect in its kind as to have some interest as a study , as a specimen of its sort ; and such is the last number of the " cobweb series " of which we have already noticed two-by Daudet-which are of remarkable excellence . The third , like its predecessors , is a translation , but from the German . * Why any one should have written this book , and why , it being written , any one should have translated it , and why , it being translated , any one should have published it , passes our understanding We were about to call it silly ; but it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it , and certainly nothing mentally injurious to any one , except that it is always injurious to read very poor books . This one is simply inane . There is not a page of it that is worth a place in a story-newspaper . It is full of conversation whic.h is about on a level with what may he heard in the railway cars any day , or when ladies meet on visits of ceremony . The talk indeed is quite like what one hears every day among people who really do not converse , exchanging words without thoughts . Here is a specimen of what passes between the personages : Camilla , who had been talking to the others in a low tone , replied with a how , " I assure you , Herr Richards , that it gives me pleasure to make your acquaintance . " " Oh , that is much too formal , Camilla ! " cried Delhruck , for now that Herr Richards has hro. ken the ice , I feel that we shall he friends . Spend this evening with us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have you here also . Is it not so , Camilla I " " Certainly , I hope that you will accept my hushand 's invitation , Herr Richards . " Clothilde whispered : " You say that as if you did not want him ; I like him very much . " " Have you time to spare for a visit to my studio ? " asked Deibruck . " Nothing could give me greater pleasure . " " Then come , and you shall give me your opinion of the picture I am engaged apon now . " The book is full of such stuff as thistalk without any purpose , without any meaning . Indeed , we were somewhat puzzled whence to take our example . Now the bald representation of every-day life is not art , is not literature . The novelist 's function is to represent nature truthfully , and yet to have that representation significant , full of meaning . The story of the book is not worth speaking of ; indeed , the whole thing is full of emptiness . The personages are mere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appears in the figure on the court cards of a pack . Any bright schoolgirl might write such a book . The translation is worthy of the original . It is full of misuses of words , many of which are vulgar Americanisms . The writer has learned English in a bad school . - There is a cry , if not a demand , for American novels-that is , novels of which the scenes and the personages are peculiar to this country . It is to be regretted that the attempts to furnish this " article " are rarely very admirable . Here is one , however , the merit of which is considerable. * The scene is laid in the Mohawk valley ; the time is the beginning of this century . The principal figure-almost the hero-is an old gentleman , the proprietor of the manor which is called by his family name . Mr. Johnson is a type of a sort of gentlemen who were not uncommon here before the Revolution , and for a generation after // ward . They were not all manorial proprietors , or all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and coinpletest sense of the term . Dignified , courteous , easy in their manners , kindly natured , and well educated , they were also men of principle and of nice honor . Besides all this they had a recognized social position . Whether they were rich or not , men of iuferior condition in life recognized their superiority . All men were then equal before the law , as they are now , but deference to superiority had not disappeared . And while there was no truckling on the one hand , or ( at the North at least ) no arrogance on the other , and far less snobbishness than there is now , there was a consideration given to men of this class , which has vanished , or which is awarded only to wealth orto political position , no matter how gained . Mr. Johnson , of the Johnson manor , is an American Sir Charles Grandison without that stiffness and self-consciousness which makes Richardson 's elegant and irreproachable hero rather a bore . Washington was a man of this sort ; but there is at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was not somewhat stiff and self-conscious . Some one has wittily but irreverently called him " Sir Charles Grandison in regimentals . " But Mr. Johnson , although the most prominent figure in this tale of our olden time , does not fill the author 's canvas , upon which many other personages figure largely . Indeed , it is rare nowadays to find a novel in which so many of the persona* , es are really important , and contribute so largely to the interest of the story and the development of the plot . The heroine is his niece ; but she is not known to be so when she appears upon the scene and enters his house ; for her mother has been carried off by a scoundrel who had won her love against the wishes of her family , *and who , a Tory , had joined himself to the Indians who fought on the side of the British Government . Her captors were supposed to be Indians only , and among them her daughter was born . This is the knot of difficulty which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become lovers , and it is to bring them together under proper conditions satisfactory to all parties concerned that the mystery is unravelled . We shall leave th' rest of 45 the story to the author 's telling , and content ourselves with saying that in telling it he presents the most lively and truthful picture of our colonial life that we know in fiction . The pretence , however , that the book was written " long years ago , by one of the prominent actors in the drama it depicts , " who was an old man , and who found in its composition the employment and the pleasure of his declining years , is a most transparent literary fiction . From beginning to end the book bears the impress of to-dayof this very day , not even of yesterday . And besides this general impression left by it as a whole , it contains phrases which are the latest coining of the slang mint of to-day . We have marked only two or three of the many that we observed ; but , for example , " Hamilton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him , sir , " " but I 'd lose them and him too , before Bob Van Tassel should go back on a friend , " are phrases unknown even twenty years ago . And Mr. Johnson , of Johnson 's manor , would never have said , " I will leave this afternoon for Philadelphia . " That slovenly phrase is older indeed than the preceding slang , but not older than the present generation . But if our author does not reproduce the language of the period of his tale very accurately , he is successful in the very much more important matter of manners , customs , mental tone , contemporary incident , and the general atmosphere of his little history . On all these points we venture to say that he is correct , or sufficiently so to give his reader a correct notion of our society at the period which he describes . His personages interest ; and the vicissitudes through which they pass are of sufficient importance and described with sufficient skill to make his book , as a whole , a work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it warrants expectations of something better hereafter . Wnzrnnm rhetoric is a science may be reasonably doubted . Science implies facts and fixed relations . It is free from the intrusion of personal influences , whether of an individual or a multitude . The science of chemistry or of acoustics , for example , is just as uiideniable in every respect in Central Africa as in France or in England . Indeed , the laws // of either would be just as absolute and as operative if there were not a living being on the earth . So even with the science of philology , although that has for its subject human speech . If every human creature were swept from the world but one , and the records of former speech were left , that one man could study philology . But rhetoric has direct relation to men as individuals , whether singly or in groups or masses . As the author of the book which is the occasion of our remarks* justly says : " The specific province of the rhetorician is to render given ideas effective in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ militant . " It follows that what is good rhetoric at one time and under certain circumstances , is bad at another time and under other circumstances . What is good rhetoric when one sort of men are to be affected is bad in the case of other men . Rhetoric seems clearly to be not a science , but an art , and the most artful of all the arts . We know that our author might reply that the laws of his science are absolute , and that they regulate the use of a force which may be applied as circumstances demand . But this is true of all arts ; and none the less because of the absoluteness of its laws does the fact that rhetoric is concerned with the production of effects upon the minds of other men than the one who conforms to its laws , place it outside of the pale of Science , and within that of art . Professor Hill 's view of rhetoric is original . He excludes from it invention , the disposition of subject matter , questions of taste , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He includes the laws of mind , the relation between thought and its expression , the laws of idea based upon the essential nature of the four elementary classes of ideas , and the law of mental economy as enunciated by Spencer , which he endeavors so to modify and to develop as to refer all valid precepts of style to a single law , and the laws of form which he derives from a single principle . Briefly , his work is a systematic analysis of the modes of effective expression in language , and so far in * " The Science of Rhetoric : an Introduction to the Laws of Effective Discourse . " By DAVID J. ilna iSmo , pp. 304 . New York : Sheldon &amp; Company . deed it is scientific . From this point of view the work appears to be an excellent one , and we believe that very few of the author 's positions or laws will be disputed by competent critics . The value of Dr. Hill 's book , however , is chiefly , if not altogether , in its excellence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its power to teach composition . This indeed the author himself sees , and in this his work is no better and no worse than any other upon the same subject . For although rhetoric has been taught since the days of Aristotle , we may be sure that the study of it never made a man a good writer or orator . It is an historical and analytical study the value of which is within itself . Dr. Hill himself justly says : " Rhetoric can not make laws for composition , but it can discover them , and explain why poetry pleases and why eloquence wins , by referring their effects to the laws of mind and language . " THE labors of Mr. Parkmnn in elucidating antiquarian points in American history are so well known that the announcement of his latest work arouses pleasant expectations . The romance of early American colonization has been overlooked by two many of our native authors chiefly on account of the scanty information which we possess on the subject , and still more on account of the prosaic nature of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the hackneyed episode of Pocahontas , and the adventures of Daniel Boone , there is very little in the early history of the English colonies , now the United States , on which to weave interesting legends . The case is , however , different when we turn to the experience of the Latin races from Spain and France that took possession of Mexico and Canada . From first to last their history is romantic and picturesque , on account of that mingling of love and war which constitutes the charm of legendary stories . Mr. Parkman seems to have been early struck with these features in the story of Canada , just as Prescott found pleasure in the glowing recitals of Bernal Diaz and the early historians of Peruvian and * " Frontencec and New France under Loui&amp; NiP . " By FRANCIS PAzxumAre . Boston : Littie , Brown &amp; Co. // Mexican conquest . In the same spirit as Prescott , and with the same tireless research , Parkman has endeavored to unravel the tangled labyrinth of truth and fiction in his special department of American history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as renowned as those of the historian of Cortes , are not ; less romantic and interesting . In his " Frontenac and New France " we are introduced to one very finely individualized character . The fiery governor of New France , and the real founder of the province of Canada , stands before us , a veritable man , a representafive grand seigne ? tr of the old school , hot-headed and passionate , as proud as Lucifer , cruel and unbending when opposed , pliant and perfectly charming in his courtesy when he wished to be , and withal " a gentleman to the tips of his fingers , " as the old phrase ran . In perpetual quarrels with his equals or rivals , yielding to no one but the King , but remarkably kind and affable to his inferiors in rank , Frontenac was one of those positive characters that hardly admit of cool judgment in their own days . No man was more bitterly hated and devotedly idolized by opposite parties during his career than Frontenac , and yet today the utmost that is known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name to a county of Canada . Mr. Parkman has done us a real service in telling us about this fiery soldier , and a short sketch of his career may not prove uninteresting . Louis de Buade de Frontenac was one of those nobles of the Fronde who thwarted Cardinal Mazarin of his will for so many years during that strange period of French history . He married for love one of the most beautiful ladies of the court of Louis XIV. , and quarrelled with her all the rest of his life to such an extent that they never could live together . Partly to secure mutual peace , and partly to replace the breaches in his shattered fortunes , Mine . de Frontenac , who was a cousin of the famous Mine . de Montespan , successor to La Vallidre , induced the King to appoint her husband Governor General of Canada in 1772 . He went to his post at Quebec to find himself in a divided empire , where he was confronted by two rivals of nearly equal power ; one , the Sicur Perrot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head of the clerical party . flow the haughty seigneur chafed against the divided authority , and how for ten years he and his two enemies made the life of the King and his ministers miserable by reams of angry correspondence , till in despair his majesty recalled Frontenac and his principal foe together-all these things are quaintly and graphically told from the original reams of now musty and faded correspondence , through which Mr. Parkman has rummaged so industriously . Had Frontenac 's life ended with his recall in 1782 , his history might never have been written by an American . For seven long years thereafter his life seemed to be a total failure , for he was displaced at sixty-three years of age , and obliged to hive in obscurity on a small estate . But his opportunity came when his enemies , left behind him , proved unable to control the Indians and cope with their New England rivals , ending by forcing the country into a fresh war with England . Then at last the King turned to Frontenac , a man in his seventieth year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but no means beyond his own audacity and address . Frontenac at seventy proved more active than most men of thirty . He came back to Canada , . gained over the Indians by his personal talent , attacked the British settlements , captured the Dutch village of Schenectady , threatening Albany and the whole line of the Hudson , repulsed the Boston Puritans under Phips , from Quebec , cleared all Canada and Acadia of the English and hostile Indians , and at last threatened Boston ; triumphant everywhere , bold and wary , a model soldier , dying in his harness at seventy-eight , just as the peace of Ryswick was concluded . One of the most remarkable figures in American history , he will always stand out where he is known , and we must thank Mr. Parkman for introducing us to this representative of the viejile noblesse in their best aspect . AMznIcAns are such a busy people that they find but little time for amusements , and seek , as a rule , those pleasures that involve rest for themselves in the character of spectators . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field sports and pursue them according // to rigid rules as " sportsmen , " is numerically small in America . Ninetenths of the shooting and hunting on this continent is still performed for an object which the English sportsman holds in disdain as " pot hunting " - that is , for the sake of the game killed for food . The tendency of all athletic exercises to run to excess , ending in producing a few highly trained professionals and a crowd of lazy and critical spectators , is well known . It has been checked from time to time by the introduction of new fashions in sport , the latest example being the rifle movement , but recurs with regularity as the new fashion becomes old . There are indications , however , within the last few years that a reaction from the old lazy spirit is setting in among a portion of our people , especially in the more thickly settled States of the Atlantic seaboard . As the profusion of game decreases and the occupation of the " pot hunter " becomes more precarious , the love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mingled Scandinavian and Teutonic ancestry of the Americans , begins to assert itself . We hear of sportsmen 's associations in many States , of game laws enforced , of new books on hunting and fishing , and of summer vacations spent in such remnants of wilderness as civilization has left us . The appearance of Mr. ilallock 's " Sportsman 's Gazetteer " " c at the present time is an indication of the change , and , as nearly the first of its kind , is a mark of the advancing civilization affecting our particular family of mankind . The Latin races so called-French , Italian , Spanish  --  and the Celtic , so closely mingled with them in blood through the Gauls , have never displayed the passion for " sport " which distinguishes the Germanic and Scandinavian families . The old Romans gave little attention to hunting , which they left to the Greeks ; Xenophon and Arrian being the only " sporting " authors of antiquity . Virgil in his " Georgics " and " Bucolics " sings the praises of agricultural and pastoral life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fishing . The * " The Sportsmen 's Gazetteer and General Guide . " By CHARLES HALLOCIc . New York : Forest and Stream Publiahin , Company , American News Company , agenti. feudal nobility of the middle ages , so devoted to the chase , were all of the Germanic or Scandinavian families , and their habits survive to the present day wherever their descendants are unmixed . In America we find the same characteristics in the United States and Canada , but almost entirely absent in Spanish America save among the few " rubios " or fair-haired descendants of the old Goths . This sporting feeling is an anomaly of its kind , utterly inexplicable to those in whom it is not inborn , but a perfect passion where it exists . The sardonic question of that pink of politeness Lord Chesterfield , who after his first and last fox hunt asked , " if men ever hunted twice , " expresses the feeling of one class , just as the celebrated Assheton Smith of England , who assisted at the death of some two thousand foxes and rode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shows the enthusiasm of the other . The feeling can not be analyzed , but its existence in the Norse-Teuton blood is notorious , and nowhere is it stronger than in America , however it be stifled for a time by the necessities of life . We have in our mind to-day school teachers , editors , college professors , men tied down to sedentary pursuits for all of the year but a brief vacation , who invariably employ their leisure in fishing or shooting excursions , to the great disgust and wonder of their wives , who belong to the Chesterfield school of humanity . To this large and increasing class Hallock 's " Sportsman 's Gazetteer " will be a welcome book . It gives them an alphabetical index of all the places to get game or fishing in the United States and the means and cost of reaching them . At least it aims to do this , and does it to a certain extent , its faults being those of omission , not misinformation . In so much we are glad to record the omissions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fatal gift to the game-exterminating , " pot-hunting " class . Apart from the gazetteer , Mr. ilallock gives a complete and concisely written account of all the game birds , beasts , and fishes of North America , arranged on a very clear plan . The great difficulty in a popular account of such animals is to secure a nomenclature which shall be // plain to the ignorant , while enabling a person moderately versed in natural liistory to recognize a given animal under a number of local names . A familiar example of this difficulty in America is the common ruffed grouse , called a " partridge " in New York and New England , a " pheasant " throughout the South and Southwest . Mr. HaUock obviates the difficulty by heading his chapters with the most popular English name and giving the subdivisions and ornithological names in the text , both sets of names being indexed at the end . Besides the natural history , which occupies a third of the book , there are voluminous articles on sporting dogs of all kinds and their treatment in health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blinds and decoys , fishing-rods , artificial flies and other baits , a complete treatise on all sorts of sporting boats and canoes , with names of makers and prices , closing with full instructions for preserving skins of game , and a list of all the natural history and sporting books published here or in Europe . The only fault that we can see in this book is that it attempts too much and is consequently incomplete . This is a fault , however , that can be remedied in subsequent editions . As it stands , it is a very fascinating book for any man imbued with a love of sport , and invaluable for a greenhorn aiming to become a sportsman . THE " Reminiscences " of Froebel , * the founder of the kindergarten system of instruction , have been introduced to this country in a translation by the widow of Horace Mann , who , like her husband , has devoted her life to the interests of education . Froebel was born in a small village in Thuringia , Germany , in 1782 . His childhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a father and " a real step-mother , " who , when she did not neglect him , treated him unkindly . Probably the home was not free from conjugal discord , for when one of his brothers returned on a vacation , and pitied and caressed the uncared-for child , little Friedrich naively inquired why it was that God did not make all the peo * " R inigcenc&amp;* of Friedrich Froebel . " By B. YeN MARENHOLZ-BULOw . Boston : Lee &amp; Sheppard . pie men , or all women , so that there should be no quarrelling . His brother kindly undertook to explain the problem , showing him the processes of vegetation , the compensating nature of imperfections in male and female flowers , and how the harmonies of beauty and use were born out of the connection of opposites . This , he says , was to him the beginning of all satisfactory thought , and ever after Nature , as seen in the world of vegetation , was his normal school . The sombre coloring of his early years reminds one of the surroundings of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shadows of the old church , so that no sunbeam could enter it , and he was kept much of the time a prisoner , as it was too much trouble to look after him out doors . As workmen were repairing the church , his principal amusement was to watch them from the window , and use the pieces of furniture he was able to move , to imitate them in their labor . It was the recollection of this ungratified building instinct which suggested to him in later years that children ought to be provided with materials for building among their playthings . His education at schools was so slight and superficial that he may be called self-educated , He was not allowed by Frau Froebel the advantages of a university course , which had been given to his brother and her son , on the plea of too great expense ; and being apprenticed to a manager of forest land , he studied assiduously by himself . His father 's death , when he was twenty , left him free to choose his own course , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became acquainted with Gruner , the director of the Normal school , who , seeing his special talent , proposed to put him at once into the school , with a class of forty boys . He went into this new work with heart and soul , feeling as if he had always taught , and he soon had the model class , and parents were invited to witness his method of instruction by drawing out the pupil 's own faculties . He believed hiiusel* led by heaven to be an educator , and sought in every possible way to improve his own deficiencies , carrying pupils with him to the school of Pestalozzi , his forerunner , and even gave up his work for a time to be a learner in // the university of Gottingen . His teachin* rested on this fundamental principle , that the starting point of all we see , know , or are conscious of , is action , and therefore that human development must begin in action . Life , action , and knowledge were to him the three notes of one harmonious chord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mental and physical power through observation and active work . The authorities of the country met his efforts at first with indifference , then with opposition , and in 1851 the government at Berlin , without assigning any reason , forbade any kindergarten to be established within Prussian dominions .

Mine . von Marenholz-Billow tells us how she first met this noble man . On arriving at a certain watering-place she learned from her landlady that a man had recently settled down on a small farm near the springs , who danced and played with the village children , and therefore went by the name of the " old fool .

The loving patience of the man was so moving as to bring tears . After the games were over she entered into conversation about education , and was invited to his institution .

When a friend was lamenting over the slow advance of his method , he replied , " If , three hundred years after my death , it shall be completely established , I shall rejoice in heaven . " Many of his sentences are quoted through the book ; also long conversations . " I see in every child the possibility of a perfect man , " showed the main spring of his actions . He had the power to look into the innermost nature of children , and they all loved him . He felt that childhood had been for generations pinioned in a strait jacket , and he longed to help every human soul to grow of itself , out of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not long before his death he said , " If they will not recognize and support my cause in my native country , I will go to America , where a new life is freely unfolding itself , and a new education of man will find a footing .

A shawl . or heart-shaped one , not giving rise to a marked contrast , does not make thinness more noticeable , but will add seemingly to the height .

THE Rev. E. E. Hale achieved such a brilliant success in story telling years ago , so fresh and piquant , overflowing with fun and fancy , that we are tempted to pass by his latest production* in kindly silence , as one unworthy of his reputation , unless it is to be regarded not as a story , but a guide-book for invalids seeking a warmer climate , who incline to San Antonio . The preface and probably much of the book were written in transitu on the palace car Pittsfield ; in short , a recent trip to Texas has been * " 6 ' . T.

It might represent a " Grievously Tedious Tale " or " Gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for " Gone To Texa.s , " this title resuscitating the story current in the days of the early settlement of Texas . According to this ancient joke , when an insolvent debtor , or a rough who had been engaged in an " unpleasantness , " or any other loafer who had changed his home , wish . ed to leave warning behind him where he had gone , he chalked upon his door the letters " G.

This idea may have given a name to the sheltering State . But we are favored with another title , " The Wonderful Adventures of a Pullman , " so we can take our choice ; but really , as the car has nothing to do with the story , and has no " adventures " at all , if that is even a proper use of the word , we must refuse to admire either .

At least this is the case with such a happy temperament as ispossessed by Mr.Appleton ( who is already very favorably known by his " Nile Journal " and a " Sheaf of Papers " ) , a fine representative of the best style of Bostonian-keen and thoughtful , artistic and witty , with a sound basis of common sense .

" The faint margin of difference between demand and offer is soon lost for the priceless rarity which can not be now recovered ; and if in London or Paris one tries to buy such goods , he quickly feels how cheap had been the Eastern merchants ' highest price .

" His description of Rahatlicum , the first // sweetmeat in the world , makes us wish , as he suggests , that if the Turks are driven from Constantinople , some refugee may take pity on us and establish the genuine delicacy here .

Mx . ALDEN , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Times , " has , at the " request of a wide circle of subtle and malignant enemies , " consented to rescue his popular " sixth-column fancies " from the speedy oblivion which awaited them , and publishes a round hundred and a score of his comments on current events. * There is a remarkable similarity and evenness of style from first to last ; each brief essay containing four or five long paragraphs of quaint criticisms , and whimsical exaggeration , on something new and peculiar . For his subjects he takes some curious item in a Western paper , or a comical misprint in an advertisement , or a misunderstanding of some commonplace statement . He sees the possibilities of humor in these trifles , and makes the most of them . The titles , as they appeared in the daily , arrested the eye as it roved over the page , and the " sixth column " was eagerly examined by many of Mr. Alden 's admirers . Such headings as " Spiritual Candy , " * Glass Eyes , " " Ghost Catching , " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a unique treatment of an absurd theme . His propositions for the amelioration of existing difficulties , such as turning Vesuvius into a cheap cremating furnace , or training cats as messengers in the postal department , are developed in a quiet and plausible manner , which reminds one of Dean Swift 's " Modest Proposal " of baby rag6ut . No one can read his talk on " A National Want " - viz. , a variety of parent who will go to bed at eight o'clock  --  or his melancholy prediction that " The Coming Man " will be both toothless and hairless , without acknowledging that Mr. Alden possesses both humor and wit . and is extremely entertaining in spite of correct orthography , good taste , and unvarying * " Domestic F p*osive , and other Sixth- Cotnina Fancies .

It must be a solemn position , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the exchanges for material ! A boy with two stomachs is a god-send ; a smoking infant , or a girl who swallows needles , are perfectly invaluable . We presume there will be no dearth of topics for such fertile imagination , and odd conceits need but a trifle to rouse them to success . Mr. Alden 's many friends will be glad to see these smile-provoking " Fancies " in book form . J. M. BAILEY , the Danbury joker , has a good deal of genuine humor , and his second book , * strange to say , is better than the first . That was too scrappy , too great an effort to be amusing , made up of grotesque and gross exaggerations , and there was an almost monotonous dependence upon a demonstrative adjective to give a snap to otherwise - dull stories . There has been a lull in Mr. Bailey 's popularity , while other men have taken his place , the Burlington " Hawkeye " being just now most conspicuous . But this little volume proves his wisdom in waiting , despite the cry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he could improve on his first venture , successful as that was . It is oddly named- " They all Do it " being the heading of a short sketch , somewhere toward the middle of the book , of the excuses a wife is apt to make for her dinner even when she has had ample time to do her best . Most men dislike profuse apology as heartily as did Dean Swift , who , when a farmer 's wife spoiled his dinner by saying , " It is not good enough for his worship to sit down to , " exclaimed , " Then why did n't you get a better ? You knew I was coming . I 've a great mind to go away and dine on a red herring . " The ludicrous positions connected with the annoyances of every-day life give material for Mr. Bailey 's book , and surely one who can dwell on the absurd side of house-cleaning , or putting up stoves , or bringing in the week 's wash on a cold Monday night , deserves the thanks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ J. M. BAru , vY , the " Danbury News " Man . Boston : Lee &amp; Sheppard . // " plain people " to whom these sketches appeal for recognition . It is well to laugh over the disagreeable and inevitable , the " total depravity of inanimate objects , " etc. , if one can only see the fun . The old advice , " grin and bear it , " is homely but wise , and no one can help laughing at Mr. Bailey 's extravaganzas . He says : " We never can tell exactly when we lose our , umbrellas . It is singular how gently an umbrella uuclasps itself from the tendrils of our mind , and floats out into the filmy distance of nothingness . " Reality vs . Romance is ably portrayed in his " Cotter 's Saturday Night . " The enfant terrible has a faithfulphotograph . A conjugal quarrel over croquet is somewhat overdrawn , but capital . His description of a struggle with an exasperating burean drawer that will neither shut nor open , is admirable . Also the agonies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irritating " tidies " get a hit . He has not much respect for women as barbers , affirming that " when a boy 's hair has been cut by his mother , the edges of it look as if it had been chewed off by an absent-niinded horse . " Occasional bits of pathos , a tender touch here and there , are a pleasant relief . In a sensible preface the author begs his readers to restrain their ardor , and not try to finish the book at one sitting , but dip into it now and then , when tired or depressed . What must be the feelings of the good people of Danbury , as they read of a man on Division street , or a woman on Main street , and fear it will be their turn next ? It must be an alarming thing to reside in the neighborhood of one of these vigilant reporters , always hungry for material for his next paragraph . MACMILLAN &amp; Co. , London , have just given us an expurgated edition of Robert Herrick 's poems , * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who is himself a poet , and to whom we owe the " Golden Treasnry " of English song , which is so popular . It is well occasionally to turn from new books and spend an hour with an old favorite , who has been neglected and perhaps forgotten . We know * " U*'irysomela . A Selection from the Lyrical Poems of Robert Ilerrick . " By FRANCIS Tuinesm PALGUAvE . London : Macmillan &amp; Co. even less of Ilerrick 's personal history than of Shakesp3are 's . He was a bachelor and a clergyman , hardly a model in either character ; he kept a faithful maid servant , Prudence Baldwin , to whom he addressed complimentary and grateful rhymes ; he also kept a pet pig , which he taught to drink out of a tankard . And these facts , together with a tradition that he one day threw his sermon at the congregation with a curse , for their inattention , forms almost the sum total of what can be learned of the poet 's life . A few boyish letters have been preserved , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to " pinches of the purse , " and there is a statement that he was the originator of " Poor Robin 's Almanack . " He had a lazy , amorous temperament , and his " Humane Poems " are classed by Hallam among the " poetry of kisses . " When fierce war was raging in every English county he was bemoaning " the death that is in Julia 's eyes , " and talking of the " parliament of roses . " He candidly tells us that He has seen and still can prove The lazy man the most doth love . For twenty years the vicar of Dean Prior , until ejected by Cromwell , he hated the country , and taking up his residence in London , he wrote : Ravisht in spirit , I come , nay more . I fly To thee , blest place of my nativity ; London *ymy home is ; thonbh by hard fate sent Into a long and dreary banishment . And in another place he says : More discontent I never had Since I was born than here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , In this dull Devonshire . Yet he never wrote so well as in this quiet spot , and there " he acquired that love of flowers and of fragrance which imparted to his verse the beauty of the one and the sweetness of the other . " One of his warmest admirers pronounces him the very best of English lyric poets . " He is the most joyous and gladsome of bards , singing like the grasshopper as if he would never grow old . He is as fresh as the spring , as blithe as the summer , as ripe as the autumn . " Herrick 's style is his own . We are reminded of Anacreon and Catullus , but there is no imitation of them , nor of his contemporaries . He bowed before the genius of Ben Jonson , but was always himself-sunny , // unaffected , and sincere . The coarseness which mars his verses does not seem to belong to them , and was , we will hope , added to suit the polluted taste of those times . In looking over his " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wonder that a man whose life seemed one rollicking carnival of love and enjoyment , could be equally at ease in strains of humble piety . Is this a fast ; to keep The larder lean And clean From fat of meats and sheep ? Is it to quit the dish Of flesh , yet still To fill The platter high with fish ? We miss from Palgrave 's collection the sacred song on Lent : Is it to fast an hour , Or ragg 'd to go , Or show A downcast look and sour No .

This rare virtue , humility , he could hardly be said to possess . Some one observes that Herrick had so very high a notion of the value of his own compositions that he conceived it necessary only to mention his friends in his volume in order to confer immortality upon them . Many wild tales , fully believed by his admiring neighbors , are still repeated of the fearful achievements of his wandering spirit . If his ghost does return , how mortifying to his pride and expectations to find his glowing predictions a failure , and to see in our literature only a brief allusion to his poems , and " himself " classed with Cowley , Crashaw , etc . But if he comes once more , this charming revival of his merry , musical roundelays , by an appreciative friend , will restore his equanimity , and the shadowy form of the once portly and handsome poet will long to give his grateful thanks to Mr. Palgrave-as do we all . - From Osgood &amp; Co. we receive the collected edition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred and fifty songs , ballads , and memorial verses . May he live to give us a round three hundred ! The son of a clergyman , educated at Harvard , always associated with what he calls the " Brahmin caste , " nature and culture have combined to produce the accomplished poet , wit and humorist . He is the Horace of our age , minus his coarseness ; satiring folly , foppery , and pretension , yet making no enemies . With wondrous versatility he talks trifles with the frivolous , good sense with the educated , and deep philosophy with the thinkers , equally ready in putting into verse the abstract and concrete . Every important anniversary , every great occasion , every national guest , has been heralded and honored with never a dull or forced rhyme , such as we often see in Tennyson 's efforts to keep up with the births and marriages in the royal family . Tears and mirth , pathos and puns , sentiment and merriment , all sail with fitting colors upon his deep sea of thought . Best of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never leaving a sting behind . We may well be proud of such poets as Holmes and Lowell , who unite inimitable humor with extensive erudition and profound philosophy ; but while Lowell has caricatured his countrymen , to the intense delight of the English , portraying , in the broadest , coarsest exaggeration of Yankee dialect , the prejudices and hypocrisy of New England , Dr. Holmes has been a model of patriotism and sincere devotion to his native land . This edition , simply bound , with no illustrations nor extravagance of margin , will be very acceptable to the admirers of the author . * " The Poeticat Works of Oliver Wendell Holmes . " Household Edition . Boston : J. II . Osgood &amp; Co. // - AMONG the literary and social " sensations " of the day in England , hardly one has been more lively-we can hardly say profound-than that produced by an article in the " Contemporary Review " which has for its title " The Last New Thing in Journalism . " It is directed against certain weekly papers published in London which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even of greatest public importance from a personal point of view . It is very sharp , and indeed is a most formidable arraignment of the public as well as the publishers of these papers . It is anonymous , but an author and a motive were at once found for it in general report . It is said to be by Mr. Robert Buchanan , poet and essay writer , and to have been written by him in revenge for the rejection of his articles by some of the very papers which he attacks . Here at once is a wrong view taken of it . The artich* is published without a name , and stands on its own merits . What matter who wrote it , and with what motive ? If its assertions are true and its opinions good , let them be judged by themselves . They are not affe*cted by the identity of the writer , or his possible motive . Suppose that that motive were pique , if the thing is good in itself , what matter again ? Suppose , on the other hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is bad in itself , let it go speedily into the limbo of things forgotten . But it is good and sound , and hence the commotion that it has stirred up . The point of the article is expressed in one sentence : " Scarcely anything is too ignoble to find its way into print in some shape or other . " The indictment extends over many pages ; it has many counts ; it touches many subjects ; but there is the gist of it . Nothing is too ignoble to be printed-nothing is too ignoble , if printed , to fail to find a reading buying public . The kind of journalism which is the subject of this much talked of article is an ignoble attempt to supply an ignoble demand . It is a base business-base on both sides ; baser than much business that is more criminal . On one side , men and women who might fill up their leisure time by pursuits innocent at least , if they could not bear the strain of having them elevating , choose to sit down to printed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a presentation of all subjects in such a mean , debasing aspect that life and human nature are constantly soiled and degraded before their eyes . Journalists , whose opportunities to teach what is wholesome , to purify the public taste , and to elevate the public tone of mind , are greater than those ever before possessed by any sort or profession of men , descend from this elevation to the lower level , to the lowest level , and live by smirching the reputations of men , and even of women , by giving some people pain for the pleasure of those whose pleasure is the paiu of others , and by teaching that nothing is good , nothing is great , nothing is admirable . Mutual admiration is narrow ; but compared to this , mutual admiration is grand , lofty , elevating.
