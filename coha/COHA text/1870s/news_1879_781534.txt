txt There was a time when it would have been thought rank heterodoxy to plead that temperance means anything but total abstinence . " Moderate drinking , " the teetotalers wore wont to say , " is a league with death , a covenant with hell , a device of Satan to drag men down to the lowest depths of drunkenness . " The temperance reform in this country began about thirty years ago . The societies organized by the promoters of the movement were known as " ' Washingtonian Societies , " the name of the Father of his Country being borrowed , for some inexplicable reason , as the war-cry of the new crusaders . Nothing short of total abstinence was countenanced by this society , the founders of which were six reformed drunkards of Baltimore , in 1840 . The lines were drawn very rigidly , and the taverns , inns , and other places of public entertainment were speedily divided into two classes  --  those which did not keep or sell even malt liquors or wines , and those in which roystering , defiant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prior to this date , say 1838 , nobody pretended to cure intemperance by total abstinence . The drinking of beer and wine was encouraged , and in Boston , where Medford rum and Holland gin had been the common beverages for generations , one of the early temperance societies built and maintained a brewery for the use of its members in order to promote , as far as possible , the use of beverages which should displace the fiery spirits most affected by the Bostonians of the time . The Washingtonian movement changed all this . The wine decanters , which had heretofore stood in rank and file upon , the sideboards of substantial people , went into the sideboards . Men who had drunk at the counter of the grocery , in city or in country , went behind the screen in the rear of the store to quaff their fiery drams , or sneaked around by back doors when the vigilant spies of the Washingtonian army were elsewhere engaged . Seine antiquarian would do a service to the literature of the country by republishing the tracts of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the rising generation of thirty years since  --  in which the lessons of total abstinence were enforced by precept and example . Some of our more mature readers will recall with pleasure . , My Mother 's Gold Ring , " " Good Enough for the Vulgar , " . " The Striped Pig , " and other delightful stories which formed the staple of the temperance literature of 1838-40 . The title of this last tract , by the way , was suggested by the , device of a lawless rumseller at a New-England " muster " or " training . " This graceless scamp pitched his tent on the edge of the training-field and hung out a highly-colored picture of a pig striped in red and white . The inquiring visitor was shown a common pig , whose white bristles were striped with red paint  --  a bold cheat ; but , leaving by an exit in the rear , the cheated man was given " fourpence worth of rum , " which was ample return for the fourpence ( 614 cents ) which he had paid to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seller and the buyer agreed to violate law and newfangled custom . All this , however , is by way of reminiscence . The years have rolled away , and drunkenness is as prevalent as over . In regions where a prohibitory law has been placed upon the statutebook , it seems as if the demon of perversity had been raised . The mystery surrounding the sale of spirits and wine ha 's , apparently , enticed into the snare of " the old serpent " thousands of people who would not have hankered after strong drinks if they had not also been " stolen waters , " proverbially sweet . Total abstinence , as preached and practiced , has accomplished no permanent reform . The crying sin , the great crime of society , to-day , as in 1840 , is drunkenness . The awful pit is filled now , as then , with the lives and happiness of millions of our countrymen and countrywomen . There is something pathetic in the spectacle of an assemblage of comfortable , well-to-do citizens who plead to the total abstainers , " Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evils of intemperance . They ask to be allowed to practice the virtue of temperance . It is needless to add that by " temperance " they do not mean total abstinence , any more than they mean " raw beefsteak " when they call for " rare-done . " The temperance men of the new order plead ' that they may be not too roughly snatched from their beer and claret . They do not ask for brandy , unless they take a " pony " with their black coffee ; and all sorts of rum an &; other spirits they heartily eschew , except - in the most moderate and artistic doses . But , like the lotos-eaters , they plaintively lift up their voices against being disturbed by any violen , t reform . The ascetic zealot of teetotalism launches his diatribes on these gentle lovers of good living and moderation , and cries , " Woe unto you , moderate drinkers ! You set the example to the whisky-bibbers , the sots , and the drunkards ! You it is agreed that , though men may drink for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in others . They will not " treat . " This is striking at the root of the great evil . The ram-sellers will all hold up hands against a reform like this , which will destroy nine-tenths of their custom . A man accepts an invitation to think in a public drinking-place . Presently he returns the compliment by inviting his entertainer  --  and his entertainer 's friends . The party , say , now numbers eight . It is inevitable that each of the eight shall " treat " the company once , at least . Possibly , when each man , by some curious unwritten law of etiquette , has " treated " in his turn , the round begins again , and , with a rigid observance which is worthy of , a better cause , each drinker stays until he has drank and has " treated " his whole share of what is sardonically called " the entertainment of the company . " This is a most miserable business . The men who have the courage to pledge themselves not to treat anybody , as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his sermons , F. W. ROBERTSON ' told young men that there might come to them , some time , a total eclipse of faith , when the heavens were as blackness of darkness over them . In such a crisis , he said , they should remember that it was better to be honest than dishonest , better to be pure than corrupt , better to be courageous than cowardly , better to tell the truth than to lie . In like manlier , men who can not be total abstainers  --  and there are not a few  --  may serve their fellow-men by engaging not to drink in business hours , by pledging themselves not to treat other men and thereby enticing others to drunkenness , and by agreeing not to drink spirits of any kind . Something must be done to stay the tide of intemperance . For thirty years or more , the total abstainers have tried their ineffectual experiment . Those who can constantly practice total abstinence are safe anyway . Let us see what the " temperance " men eau do for the reformation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
