txt The increased cost of living in England has begun to tell upon a class which has hitherto never raised a claim for aid . Working men , by combination , by emigration , and other means , have placed themselves in a position better than those immediately above them in the social scale . The lower middle classes are the worst off now , and their difficulties seem likely to increase . How great those difficulties are may be gleaned from returns recently published . It appears from these that between the year 1852 and l-871 - the price of beef increased forty-seven per cent. , and of mutton thirty per cent. , the chief causes producing this rise being the Russian war and the cattle plague . The increased coiraunption of animal food is another cause of the maintenance of prices , but a more influential cause is to be found in the continuous depreciation in the value of money . The increased demand has been fully met by an increased supply , for we find that between the periods named the importations into Great Britain of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three hundred per cent. , so that the explanation of the rise in price seems plain . But with the depreciation of money there has not been a corresponding rise in salaries , and most of the persons who form the class to which we are now alluding are clerks or persons employed upon limited wages . Sometimes even professional men , lawyers , doctors , and clergymen , are , in a pecuniary sense , no better off , and by all these the increased cost of living is severely felt , more severely , as we learn from English advices , than it ever has been before . Meanwhile the condition of what are called the poor is improving . They live better than formerly , they are better paid , get better food , and more comfort . The numbers who receive aid from the public rates are decreasing . Those who received such assistance in 1871 were fewer by 29,152 than they were in 1870. - Marriages among the working classes too are becoming more numerous , disease less frequent , and the mortality rate lower . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the " working classes , " and a much more unsatisfactory condition for the class next to them . Now how will this affect ourselves 4 The progress of the country is very largely dependent upon immigration . We can not afford . to lose so valuable a source of population . But it is the laboring classes that - we are chiefly in need . of . The so-called " lower middle class " of English . society would , in its present form , furnish very little that we want in the shape of immigrants . To the men who have been accustomed to manual labor , there is room to spare in the United States , and there will be room for many long years to come . We want such , and we can promise them work and a competency . But clerks , shopmen , the incumbents of small offices under Government or public bodies , and all of a similar kind , are of little use here , except upon one condition . New-York is overstocked , we might say overburdened , with them already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , received more than 300 applications . And similar experiences are met with daily . When , therefore , we learn that the difficulties of the lower middle classes are turning the attention of many of their numbers to emigration , it is duo to ourselves and to them to name the one condition upon which alone they can hope to prosper if they come here . They must give up all expectation of obtaining employineut in accordance with the notions that . they have been accustomed to enterrtain . They must be prepared to strike out into new channels , to resort to labor , probably , certainly to perform work which hitherto they have not dreamt of . If they would make this country their home , the lauds are broad and ready to receive them , but they must lay aside the effeminate discipline of the counting house , and be ready to understand that their province here will be not to superintend the work of others , but to do the work themselves . The Man who emigrates with this intention and resolve , even though he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and . to consider himself in a social position above the working man , will prosper . If he is not prepared to accept that condition , it would be better for him remain " at home . " The subject therefore affects us very materially . We want immigrants , but we want useful immigrants . Now if the lower middle class of English society is being raduced to a condition of necessity where it must perforce turn to manual labor ; it is more to our interest to let it replenish the ranks of the working men at home than to form a current of crude emigration here . As a rule it is notin emigrating class . It would not be difficult , therefore , to induce it to remain - Where it is ; but iu fare of the . change that is coming over English society , nothing can be more plain than the necessity we have for . holding out all the attractions in our power to the working classes , since . we not only have to compete with the rivalry of foreign nations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Britain , and the impoverished state of a class of which we are not so much in need .
