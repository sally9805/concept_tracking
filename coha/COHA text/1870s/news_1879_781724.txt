txt As the rise of rents in Brooklyn and the gloom which overspreads England indicate , Mr. TALMAGE is at present on British soil . He went away to rest  --  so he informed his flock . Years of eloquent preaching had begun to tell upon his arms and legs , and he could no longer stand on his head in the pulpit without the risk of symptoms which , in any other man , would have been held to indicate an undue pressure of blood on the brain . Having thus been compelled to go to England for rest , lie is seeking it by lecturing . He has an agent with him whose business it is to " whoop him up " ? as Mr. TALIMAGE , with his fine command of Scriptural language , would say  --  and who fulfills his duty with groat earnestness . On every book-stall in England are copies of an alleged life of TALMAGE , " the Great American Preacher , " in which the goodness and greatness of Mr. TALMAGE and the unspeakable wickedness and meanness of those of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of lying are expressed in words that would burn nicely were a beneficent match applied to the pages . Especially does this " Life of Talmage " berate the " unsanctified press , " that hurts Mr. TaLma.en 's feelings by hinting that a minister should be au honest man instead of a tricky mountebank . All the hostile criticisms of Mr. TALMAGE spring , so the author of this veracious volume asserts , from envy of the great man 's greatness . It is rather remarkable that so good a man should consent to be a minister , when so many other ministers are filled with envy and hatred , and go about telling malicious lies about him . On the blank walls of London are enormous pictures , which most people regard as vulgar caricatures of TALMAGE until they see ' TALMAGE in the flesh , when they straightway wonder why nature took the trouble to construct him merely to caricature the art of lithography . The agent does not spare his hand or his conscience in sending circulars over the land , advertising the remarkable curiosity that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exceptionally high price for exhibiting it . From present appearances , his labors will be successful . TALMAGE will lecture often and will make money  --  which process he doubtless considers the best way of resting . To be sure , educated Englishmen will share the opinion lately expressed by a London paper , that inasmuch as there are scores of London cabmen who are masters of vulgar and profane language , it was hardly worth while to import TALMAGE , but there are thousands of lovers of the trapeze and music-hall performances who will find TALMAGE quite an amusing novelty . Although we may none of us be particularly proud of Mr. TALMAGE 'S performances abroad , all just men will be ready to defend him against malicious and false accusations . Of this character are , in all probability , certain professedly truthful accounts of the manner in which the great preacher conducted himself on board the steamer which carried him across the Atlantic . It is alleged that on the first Sunday morning of the voyage the amazed Captain found Mr. TALMAGE suspended by the feet from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the quarterdeck , and his arms whirling in vast and rapid circles . Two Quartermasters wore instantly ordered to assist him from his apparently perilous position , but the astonishment of the Captain when he found himself denounced by Mr. TALMAGE as a hater of Christianity , and a wicked interrupter of divine service , knew no bounds . Now , plausible as this story may appear on its face , a little reflection will show that it is probably without foundation . Persons who are familiar with Mr. TALMAGE 'S preaching and have sat , so to speak , under the shadow of his trapeze , assert that he never preaches in an inverted position . Of course , when he warms with his subject , and approaches the climax of his sermon , his legs take up the burden of his eloquence , and it is then to be expected that he would throw somersaults and stand on his head ; but he invariably begins a discourse by planting his feet firmly all over the pulpit floor , and by preaching exclusively with his arms . Had the story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , position , and on reaching the third or fourth division of his sermon brought in his legs , and proceeded to hang himself head downward from the rigging , there would have been nothing incredible about it , but the way in which it was told gives us sufficient reason to denounce it as a wicked calumny . In all probability , Mr. TALMAGE was too sea-sick on his first Sunday at sea to think of preaching , for when we reflect what the effort to bring one 's boots to the surface costs a Seasick man of average height , we can understand how horribly a person of Mr. TALMAGE 'S length of leg must have suffered at sea . Then there is another story to the effect that on the afternoon prior to Mr. TALMAGE 'S recent lecture in Edinburgh , he went through the principal streets of the city turning somersaults at , the- rate of twenty per minute , and bearing on his bosom and back respectively tine syllables TAL and IMAGE in letters eight inches high . The rapidity of his movements made these two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the whole affair proved a magnificent advertisement . Every student of optics knows that this story is untrue . Mr. TALMAGE may have turned somersaults in the streets of Edinburgh , but his revolutions , unless they wore as frequent as one hundred and twenty per minute , could never have produced the optical effect credited to them . Now we may safely assert that , even in his most eloquent sermons , Mr. TALMAGE never turned somersaults at any such rate of speed . Neither he nor any other man could possibly do it , and , if inquiry were made , it would probably be found that Mr. TALMAGE has never turned more than four or five consecutive somersaults , even in his most eloquent moments . Mr. TALMAGE may have his faults , for he is alleged to be human , and no human being , is wholly free from faults , but he should not bear the burden of false accusations . It is to be hoped that the exposure of the falsity of the two stories above mentioned may put a stop to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gymnastic progress of the age may be unimpaired by the malice and mendacity of his enemies .
