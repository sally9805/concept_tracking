txt On the 15th of last month , after we had repeatedly called attention to the matter , an ordinance was passed by the Health Board to the following effect : " No street railroadcar shall have cushioned seats or backs ; cars shall be washed and . cleansed every day ; neither straw nor hay shall be used on the flooring of street-cars ; soiled clothing or bedding , either in bundles or baskets , shall not be carried by cars , except upon the front platform ; every car shall be supplied with specified ventilators . " Three weeks have passed since the foregoing appeared in all the daily journals of the City , but strange though it seems , there has not yet been the slightest attempt made at enforcement . The cars of the Avenue B , or " Belt line , ' are still as dirty and as poorly ventilated as they have been all the Winter and Spring . The cars of the " Green line , " running between the Grand and . Thirty-fourthstreet Ferries , have fully half an inch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Houston-street cross-town cars are in about the same condition as those of the " Green line . " The Third-avenue cars carry their old dirty cushions and . backs , as if no ordinance had . ever been framed to prevent them . The Second . Fourth . Sixth , Seventh and Eighthavenue cars also remain as before , while the cars of the West-street , Bleecker-street and Ninth-avenue lines are , if possible , dirtier than they have ever been before . Of the latter three , it is only right to say that the cars of the Ninth-avenue are by many degrees the filthiest . There is no denying the fact that the great increase of small-pox in our midst has been due almost entirely to the extraordinary facilities afforded . by street-cars for spreading the disease . Persons in whom the disease was already developed . have been frequently found riding from one point to another closely packed among other passengers . Convalescent patients , from the Smallpox Hospital on Blackwell 's Island . have traveled in this way , to every part of the City , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the indifference of public officials . In short , the cars have , so far , been the direct means of increasing the mortality of New-York , until  --  according to a recent estimate  --  it has become greater in - proportion to the population than that of London , Paris or Berlin . When we first drew attention to the " irregularities " at the Small-pox Hospital , a flippant defender of the Health Commissioners declared that they had nothing to do with the management of that institution . Perhaps the same person will now ' undertake to prove that it requires a longer period than three weeks to enforce so simple acondition of an.ordinance as the daily washing of street-cars ! The approach of warm weather makes it absolutely necessary that nothing shall be left undone to improve the sanitary condition of the City . Clean street-cars are as needful to promote this end . as are clean streets , and the railroad companies can not be too soon compelled . to recognize this fact .               @ @ @ @ @ @
