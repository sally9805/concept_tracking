txt We may well shudder when we think of the frightful calamity which would have fallen upon mankind had not the Herald warned us just in time of the tremendous consequences of cutting a canal through the Central American Isthmus . We have actually made surveys and taken all the preliminar  --  steps toward the work of connecting the two great oceans , and had it not been for the Berald it is reasonably certain that before many years the fatal canal would have been cut , and the ruin of Canada and Great Britain accomplished . It is generally Down that the comparative mildness of the climate of our Atlantic States , of Canada , Great Britain , and of Norway , is due to the influence of the Gulf Stream . In like manner , the great current of the Pacific Ocean  --  the Kuro-Siwobrings warmth enough to Alaska to render that region habitable . Now , both the Gulf Stream and the Kuro-Siwo are caused by the equatorial currents of the Atlantic and the Pacific . The Atlantic current , flowing westward from the neighborhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roque , and is deflected into the Gulf of Mexico ; whence it issues under the name of the Gulf Stream . It is believed that the Gulf of Mexico was formed by the erosive action of the equatorial current , and that the latter would have forced its way through the ' Isthmus of Darien had not nature placed a barrier to its progress in the shape of the granite mountain range that forms the backbone of the New World . Let us suppose that a canal were to be cut through this isthmus so that the waters of the Atlantic and the Pacific could mingle without any obstruction . The equatorial ' current would then find no obstacle in the way of its westward course , and would have no further excuse for seeking an outlet through the ' Straits of Florida . It would pour into the Pacific and join its waters with those of the great Pacific equatorial current . It is the latter current which , turning northward after reaching , the Asiatic coast , ' forms the Kuro-Siwo . The result of uniting the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a vast increase of the volume and temperature of the Kuro-Siwo . This is what the Herald has just discovered , and we can not be too thankful that the discovery was made in time to stay the rash pick-ax of the canal makers . It would be difficult to overestimate the terrible consequences which would follow the disappearance of the Gulf Stream . Another glacial period would immediately begin . The whole of Canada and British America would be buried . under eternal ice , and a like frigid fate would overtake the north-western part of Europe . The valleys of the St. Lawrence and the Thames would be filled with enormous glaciers , and the coasts of Ireland and England would be inhabited only by wandering Esquimaux , seals , and Polar bears . The Queen , who now trembles in her gorgeous apartments in the Tower of London as she reads the " powerful editorials " which emanate from the Herald 's intellectual department , would be compelled to go and tremble in India or Australia , while London would slowly disappear under . a mountain of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scene of . another masked ball from which persons of real merit could be excluded on the frivolous plea that they had not been invited to attend ; and the office of Governor General of Canada would cease to exist . As for New-York , its commerce would vanish , inasmuch as its harbor would be ice bound more than half the year . Still the Berald would undoubtedly continue to be published , and special telegrams from Ujiji and Timbuctoo containing poetical quotations from Shakespeare and Dr. Watts would take the place of the present Herald " specials " from London and Paris . Meanwhile the increased warmth of the Kuro-Siwo would give Alaska and Oregon a climate of almost tropical warmth . New cities would spring up on the Pacific coast , and the greater part of the population of the Atlantic States would go West .. The Atlantic Ocean would become a solitary and frozen waste , and ? Pacific Mail stock would , appreciate , while the Cunard and Inman Companies would be totally ruined . Of course , all this can be prevented by the simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Herald , however , does ? not advocate any such plan , and is apparently quite willing that England and Canada should be covered with perpetual ice . There are insults which can only be washed out with ice , and it is not strange that at the present moment the Herald is willing to see Ottawa City ground to powder under a giant glacier . However , it is just probable that the isthmus may be cut without depriving us of the Gulf Stream . The Herald has apparently forgotten that the proposed canal will be provided with a number of locks , and that unless the equatorial current has a unique talent for running up hill , it can not rush through the canal with any force . At any rate , Ottawa City and London need not fear immediate destruction . The canal will not be cut for some years to come , and there will be abundant time for Lord DUFFERIN to give another masked ball , and to invite the entire intellectual department of the Herald to be present , disguised as able editors and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
