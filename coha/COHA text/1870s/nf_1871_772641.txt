Illustration : Decoration Illustration INTRODUCTION . The evening before leaving for one of my periodical excursions , I was putting in order my guns , my insect-cases , and all my travelling necessaries , when my eldest son , a lad nine years old , came running to me in that wheedling manner  --  using that irresistible diplomacy of childhood which imposes on fathers and mothers so many troublesome treaties , and which children so well know how to assume when they desire to obtain a favor . " Are you going to make as long a journey as you did last month ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as we are so soon leaving for Europe , I want to complete my collection as rapidly as possible . I know you will be a good boy during my absence , and obedient to your mother . You will think of me sometimes , will you not ? " " I should much prefer not to think of you , " he responded . " You would rather , then , that I staid at Orizava ? " " Oh no ; I should like you to go , and  --  to go with you . " " What can you be thinking of ? Before we were a mile on the road you would be knocked up , complaining of heat , thirst , fatigue  --  " " That 's quite a mistake , dear father . I know I should be very useful to you , if you would only take me . I could pick up wood , light the fire , and look after the cooking , besides catching butterflies and insects , both for your collection and mine . " " That 's all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a thorn you would cry . " " Oh father ! I promise you I will never cry , except when  --  I ca n't help it . " I could not resist smiling at this answer . " Then it is a settled thing , and I am to go with you , " exclaimed Lucien . " We must consult your mother , and if she sees no objection , I  --  " The child ran off without allowing me to finish my sentence . While I went on cleaning my guns , I found that I was pleading with myself in favor of the little would-be traveller . I also remembered that when I was only seven years old I had travelled long distances on foot in company with my father , and to this early habit owed much of the power of accomplishing dangerous and fatiguing journeys , which would have frightened stronger men . I even persuaded myself that it would be useful , before leaving Mexico , to impress the memory of my son with a sight of some of the grand scenes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the wonderful country in which his infancy had been spent . I moreover knew that l'Encuerado , the gallant Indian who had been my servant for so many years , perfectly adored his young master , and would watch over him just as I should , and thus ward off any possible mishaps . On the other hand , I risked inspiring my son with that love of travel and adventure which had contributed materially to my scientific collection , but very little to my fortune . Nevertheless , what a wholesome influence is exercised over the mind by an almost unceasing struggle with the difficulties that beset one 's course through an unknown country . Both the mind and body of my son must surely benefit by such an excursion , which might be curtailed if desirable . Soon after the boy returned , accompanied by his mother . " What is all this about a journey , for which my consent is the only requisite ? " asked my wife . " Mine is needed too , " I answered . " Why not take him , dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sight of him for an instant . " " What ! do you take his part ? " " He does long so much to go with you , " she said . " Be it so , " I replied . " Get your clothes ready , for we must be off the day after to-morrow at daybreak . " Lucien was almost beside himself with joy . He rushed about the house from one end to the other ; gave the servants much unnecessary trouble ; leggings , boots , and a game-bag , he wanted ; also a sword , a knife , insect-cases  --  in fact , a whole multitude of requirements . L'Encuerado , who was almost as rejoiced as the lad , cut him a travelling-staff , as strong and light as was requisite , and made him other auxiliaries necessary on such excursions . From this moment forward , Lucien was constantly running and climbing about all the rooms and the yards round the house , to accustom himself , as he said , to the fatigue of a long journey . At dinner-time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to prepare his system for the meagre fare of the bivouac . In fact , I had to quiet him down by recommending more coolness to his excited little brain . The eve of our departure arrived , and several friends came to bid me farewell . My son told them of all the great things he had determined to achieve  --  how he would crush the heads of scorpions , and with his sword cut down trees or kill serpents . " If I tumble over the rocks , " said he , " I shall only laugh at my bruises ; and if we meet with any tigers  --  " A An extremely warlike attitude terminated this sentence . Ceasing at length from want of further words , he would very willingly have reduced to silence , with his sword , those who disapproved of my project of taking into the forests and savannahs my child of nine years old , and exposing him to all the unknown dangers of savage life  --  to fatigue , rain , and all kinds of maladies ! Why , it appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the life , or at least the health , of my child . The unanimity of these reflections began to shake my resolution , and I expressed myself to that effect . " Oh father ! " cried Lucien , " are you going to break your word to me ? " " No , " I replied ; " neither now nor ever . I want you to become a man , so you shall go . But be off to bed , for you must be ready to start by four o'clock in the morning . " I had given notice of my intended tour to my friend Francois Sumichrast , a Swiss savant , well known for his discoveries in natural history , in whose company I had undertaken several journeys . About ten o'clock at night , I began to fancy my letter of information had miscarried , when a knock at the door startled me , and I soon recognized the happy voice of my friend . He had come expressly from Cordova , in order to make one in our little expedition . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he quite took the part of the young traveller ; almost what I might have expected from a companion of Toepffer . " Come here , " he cried to Lucien , who , half-undressed , had just peeped in at the door . The boy ran to him , and my friend , whose stature much exceeded the average , lifted him up and embraced him as an ally . " At your age , " said Sumichrast , " I had made the tour of Switzerland , my bag on my back , and had tried my teeth on bears ' - steaks . I predict that you will behave like a man . Shall I be wrong ? " " Oh no , M. Sumichrast . " " Can you live without eating and drinking ? " " I will do all you do . " " That 's well ; now go to bed . If you keep your word , when we return in a month 's time you 'll be a prodigy . " Next morning Lucien was up and ready long before day-break @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a jacket and breeches of blue cloth , with his Mexican cloak over them ; he carried in his belt a sword ready sharpened , to cut his way through the creeping plants ; while over his shoulder was passed the strap of a game-pouch , containing a knife , a cup , and a change of under-clothing . The broad-brimmed hat , or sombrero , on his head , gave him a most determined air . I had almost forgotten the famous travelling-staff which for the last two days had been resounding against all the floors in the house . L'Encuerado , a Mistec Indian , and an old tiger-hunter , who , through a thousand dangers faced in common , had become much attached to my person , at last made his appearance , clad in a leathern jacket and breeches , which had given him his name of " Encuerado . " B The brave and adventurous Indian was almost beside himself with joy at the idea of conducting into the forest the child whom he had known from his cradle . On his back he fastened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as coffee , salt , pepper , dried maize , cakes , etc . Lucien 's younger brother and sister had jumped out of bed , and were dancing all round us : the latter seemed somewhat sad and uneasy , but the former was dissatisfied , manfully asserting that he , too , was quite big enough to go with us . At the last moment my poor wife lost all her courage , and regretted she had ever given her consent ; but when Lucien saw the tears which his departure had called forth , he became heroic in his self-denial , throwing aside his hat and stick . " Mother , " he cried , embracing her in his arms , " I will not go away if it makes you cry . " " All right , then ; I will go instead , " said his brother Emile , who ran and picked up the stick and hat , and then walked towards the outer door , utterly disregarding his bedroom costume . " No , no , " said my wife ; " I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasure . " The kind mother again kissed her child , and commended him anew to our joint care . I led off my little companion ; but when we got into the court-yard , I had to exercise all my authority to make his younger brother give up the stick and hat he had taken possession of . When restitution was effected , the two children kissed each other , and parted friends . At last the outer gate was passed , and our footsteps rang through the quiet streets of Orizava . We were commencing the first stage of our journey in pursuit of scientific discoveries .

B Encuerado , in Spanish , means both naked and clad in leather . Illustration CHAPTER I. WHO WE ARE .  --  GRINGALET.  --  SUNRISE .  --  THE SUGAR-CANE .  --  A HALT . It was the 20th April , 1864 . The clock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grace chimed 4 A.M. just as we turned into the main street that leads out of the town . Sumichrast took the lead . Tall in stature , noble in mien , and broad-shouldered , he was , in spite of his blue eyes and fair hair , the perfect representative of moral and bodily strength . I was always in the habit of permitting him to lead the way , when , in any of our excursions , it was necessary to favorably impress the imagination of the Indians . He was distinguished as an ornithologist , and was never so much at home as in the midst of the forests ; in fact , he often regretted that he had not been born an Indian . His gravity entirely devoid of sadness , his skill in shooting , and his silent laugh , often led me to compare him to Cooper 's " Leather-Stocking ; " but it was " Leather-Stocking " become a man of the world and of science . Illustration Next let me describe my son . Like all children , he was imitative , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and this was sufficient to give him a precocious taste for natural history ; but in his character he was earnest and reflective , and very eager for knowledge . Sumichrast took pleasure in the boy 's intelligence , and often amused himself by arguing with him . From the flashes of childish humor which he would display on such occasions , my friend sometimes gave him the nickname of " Sun-beam . " Next to the child came l'Encuerado , an Indian of the Mistec race  --  a strange mixture of delicacy , simplicity , kindness , candor , and obstinacy . In the interval that had elapsed since I first met him , twelve years before , in the Terre-Chaude , he had become my friend as much as my servant . But he was never happy in a town , and was always praising wild life , even the inconveniences of the solitudes in which he had been born . Illustration " What a pity that it is so dark , " said Lucien , whom Sumichrast was leading by the hand . " For what reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why ? Because every one is asleep now , and none of my friends will see me pass with my sword , my gourd , and my game-pouch . " " So you think that your travelling-costume would make your companions envious ?  --  that 's not a kind feeling . " " No , father ; I should like them to see me , certainly ; but I do n't want to give pain to any one . " We passed along the foot of Borrego , the mountain which has become so famous , owing to the conflict which took place there between sixty French soldiers and two thousand Mexicans , and had just reached the gateway of Angostura when a dog ran past , but soon returned , barking and fawning upon us in every way . It was Gringalet , an elegantly although strongly made greyhound , which had been a companion of my boy 's from infancy , l'Encuerado having brought him up " by hand " for his young master . Gringalet was an orphan from the time of his birth , and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times a day he gave his adopted child milk through a piece of rag tied over the neck of a bottle . The dog had grown up by the side of his young master ; many a time , doubtless , he had snatched from his hands the half-eaten cake , but such casualties were only a temporary check upon their mutual attachment . He manifested , therefore , a decided preference for three objects  --  Lucien , his nurse , and bottles in general . I was at first rather vexed that the poor beast should have taken upon himself the liberty of joining our expedition , so I tried to drive him back . Gringalet ran to take refuge by the side of Lucien , with ears laid back , and one paw raised ; and looked at me with such mild eyes , so full of supplication , that I could not find it in my heart to carry out my intention . Sumichrast and l'Encuerado both interceded for the animal , which , crouching and wagging his tail , came and lay down humbly at my feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his favorite , hid his face in his hands . I was vanquished . " Come along , then , and let us take Gringalet ! " I said . So I caressed the dog , which , clearly seeing that he had gained his cause , bounded along the road in the most extravagant leaps , clearly indicative of his emotions of pleasure . In spite of all his efforts to keep them back , tears escaped from Lucien 's eyes , and I had to turn my head away to avoid having to recall the promise he made to refrain from crying . But , nevertheless , although I wished him to learn how to bear stoically any physical suffering , I had no desire to quench in him the evidences of a feeling heart  --  that potent source of our sweetest pleasure and our bitterest sorrow . The gates of the town were still closed . On arriving in front of the guard-house , I rapped at the window to awake the old man , the guardian of the keys of the town . " Wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obliged to go home again ? Ca n't we start to-day , M. Sumichrast ? " eagerly asked Lucien . " Keep quiet , " replied Sumichrast ; " the porter is an old man , and we are disturbing him earlier than we ought , which always puts him a little out of temper . However active we may be , it is a good thing to know ' how to wait . ' " At last the door-keeper made his appearance , the chains dropped one by one , the heavy gate turned on its hinges , and Lucien was the first to spring out into the open road . The sky was starless , the morning dew chilled our blood , and we felt that uncomfortable feeling which , in the tropics , affects the traveller just at the period when night gives place to day . I led Lucien by the hand , lest , in the dim light , he might fall . He shivered with cold , but was unwilling to complain ; I stepped on quickly in order that he might get warm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little bed , and thought of the cup of warm chocolate which his mother often used to bring him as soon as he awoke ; but , unmurmuring , he retained his place by my side . Beyond the village of Ingenio , a brisk south wind blew the dust in our faces and retarded our speed . All round the trees bent before the squall , and the large plantain leaves flew about , torn into ribbons . We now turned to the right , and crossed a prairie . L'Encuerado required breath , for his load weighed at least eighty pounds , although , like AEsop 's burden , it would surely get lighter at every meal . An enormous rock , which had tumbled down from one of the surrounding mountains centuries past , offered us a retreat sheltered from the wind . At this moment a line of purple edging the eastern horizon announced the dawn of day . " Come here , " I called to Lucien . And taking the lad between my knees , I said , " You see that bright band of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire ? Well , from the middle of it the sun is just going to rise . At this very moment , in Europe , it is almost noonday ; but , as recompense , they will have dark night when it is three o'clock in the afternoon here , and we shall be pushing along , overwhelmed with the heat of an almost vertical sun . The red line is now getting wider and paler ; it is more like a golden mist . But turn round and look at the mountain tops . " The child uttered a half-surprised cry ; although we were in comparative obscurity , the ridges of the Cordilleras seemed all on fire . " Do you understand that phenomenon ? " asked Sumichrast . " Yes ; for I know the earth is round , and these mountains , which are higher than we are , of course first catch the rays of the sun . " The day broke , and a burning glow suffused the horizon ; in a few minutes the sun rose and inundated us with light . The birds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , careering from every mountain top , soared above our heads . The sunbeams twinkled through the dew-drops , and the grass of the prairie seemed decked with diamonds . Black vultures , which soared even higher than the eagles and the kites , traced out in the blue sky the immense curves of their majestic flight . On every bush insects spread their gauzy wings ; perhaps they felt that not a minute should be lost by beings whose birth , life , and death are all comprised in one single day . " Oh ! " cried Lucien , " as soon as we get home I shall tell mamma how beautiful is sunrise ! Is it not a shame that so many of us sleep through the hour when this lovely prospect can only be enjoyed ? " I was obliged to cut short the little fellow 's admiration  --  an admiration I also shared . Each resumed his load ; and now , in spite of the wind , we all felt eager to advance . Gringalet , as glad as we were at the return of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ditches , and rolling in the dust in his wild gambols . Our young companion began imitating his frolics ; but I soon called him to order , for our day 's journey was to be as much as six to seven leagues , and it was necessary to prevent Lucien fatiguing himself unnecessarily . " You always go either too quickly or too slowly , " said Sumichrast to the boy ; " travellers , like soldiers , must walk at a regular pace , so as to reach their halting-place without more than necessary fatigue . Come  --  form in line ! That 's well ; now , on we go ! " Illustration : " We were just then passing through a plantation . " Lucien measured his steps by those of his instructor . It was most amusing to see him trying to keep a pace quite at variance with the length of his short legs . " Halt ! " cried Sumichrast ; " you can hardly imagine your legs are as long as mine . Perhaps in about ten years ' time you may enjoy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk naturally  --  without either effort or hurry . One , two , three !  --  now you are perfect . Keep on without noticing me ; you ca n't walk at my pace , so I must take to yours . " As our journey was to extend to the distance of three hundred leagues , it was quite requisite that the boy should accustom himself to a regular step . After several attempts this was accomplished , and all progressed together . We now directed our course towards the heights . Our intention was to make our way into the Cordillera , and , passing round the volcano of Orizava , to descend into the savannahs beyond , slanting off to the left so as ultimately to reach the sea . Then we thought of traversing the prairies and forests of the Terre-Chaude , so as again to come to our starting-point through the mountains of Songolica . This circuit would represent a journey of a hundred and fifty leagues as the crow flies , or at least three hundred leagues , reckoning all the circuits and bends we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we had made up our minds to seek , when opportunity offered , the hospitality of any Indian villages that might come in our road , and only when absolutely necessary to camp in the open air . About eleven , the heat became overpowering , and Lucien began to inquire about breakfast . We were just then passing through a plantation , I might almost say a forest of sugar-canes . The stems of the plants were either of a yellowish hue or veined with blue , and were more than six feet high . The latter kind will ultimately supersede its rival ; for the cultivators assert that , although not so large , it affords a much more certain crop . L'Encuerado , seizing his machete ( a straight and a short cutlass , indispensable to the inhabitants of the Terre-Chaude ) , cut down a magnificent stem , and , peeling it , offered each of us a piece . The sugar-cane is extremely hard , and it is necessary to cut it up in order to break the cellules in which the sweet juice is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pith of the valuable plant ; and even Gringalet seemed to be just as fond of it as they were . Not far from the cane-field , some Indians were working on a new plantation . The ground was covered with ashes . The foreman explained to us that when the canes are cut down , the first thing is to pull off the long leaves , which are left on the ground . In eight days this rubbish is dried by the tropical sun ; they then set them on fire , and the ashes which result serve as manure . Five or six Aztecs were cultivating this apparently sterile ground by means of a primitive kind of plough , made of a mere stake attached to circular discs of wood forming spokeless wheels ; it was drawn by two oxen yoked together . Sumichrast took Lucien by the hand . " In future , " said he , " when you crunch a lump of sugar , you shall know something of the manufacture of what you are eating . The sugar-cane is called , in Latin , Saccharum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' because the product of this plant was so rare that it was sold only at the druggists ' shops . The plant itself is said to be a native of India , and is , as you see , a tuft of vegetation , from which spring six to twenty tall stalks , with joints varying , both in number and in distance , from each other . The most esteemed variety , the Tahiti cane , is striped with violet . The specimen you are looking at is one of the most remarkable as regards size , for it must be nearly thirteen feet high . " " It is like a stalk of maize , " said the boy . " That 's true , except that maize has only one stem . Look , there 's an Indian about to cut down the very plant I was showing you ; he has severed it through obliquely at a single blow , as near the ground as possible . Now he is stripping off the leaves , and with another blow of his weapon lops away the green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he cuts it in lengths , taking care to sever it between the knots , as they are required for planting new ground . " " Planting ! " repeated Lucien ; " the knots are not seed ? " " No , Master ' Sunbeam ; ' the seed of the sugar-cane comes to maturity too slowly . It takes four years to produce a plant from it which is profitable . Now , as young fellows of your kind are rather numerous , and consume a good many preserves and sugar-plums , it is highly necessary to devise some rapid method of supplying the sugar you devour . This method has been found out . Each of these pieces of cane will be stuck into the earth , and the knot , from which in the open air the leaves spring , will send down roots into the soil . Small as it is , it will grow vigorously ; and in a year , or eighteen months at most , it will have produced a dozen stalks quite as fine as the one you have been looking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on account of his load , disliked standing still , had kept moving , so we had to increase our pace to catch him up . As we were passing on , Lucien saw the Indian planting the very pieces of cane he had just observed cut up . Ere long we came upon a fresh plantation , in which the tender shoots , almost like grass , appeared over the ground . Sumichrast dug a little hole round one of the plants , and showed to his wondering pupil that the fragment of the stem was already provided with small rootlets . Suddenly , at the turn of a path , I was saluted by a man on horseback . It was the steward of the estate that we were crossing . " Hallo ! Don Luciano , where are you off to with all that train ? " cried the new-comer . " To visit the forest of the Cordillera , " I replied . " May you travel safely ! but is the young gentleman going with you ? " " Yes , to be sure . Good-bye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Till we meet again ? By my word , you shall not say that just yet . The goodwife has some eggs and fried beans ready for breakfast ; and I ought to have some bottles of Spanish wine , in which we 'll drink to your pleasant journey , unless you 're too proud to accept the hospitality of a poor man . " Being very hungry , with pleasure we accepted this cordial invitation . The steward further insisted upon taking our little traveller up in front of him . The child was only too pleased . " Oh dear ! " said Sumichrast ; " why , it 's spoiling the boy at the outset . " " It will be half a league the less for his poor legs , " said Antonio ; and , spurring his horse , he galloped off with Lucien to get our breakfast ready . Gringalet was in consternation at his young master 's departure . Raising his intelligent face , he seemed as if he wished to question us , and pricked up his ears as if to listen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the distance . At last he raised a plaintive howl , and started off in pursuit . Surprised at not seeing l'Encuerado , I turned back , fancying he had remained behind . I was expecting to see him appear , when Sumichrast burst out laughing . At a turn of the road he had caught a sight of the horseman , with the dog on one side and the Indian on the other , who , in spite of his load , kept up without difficulty . This feat on the part of my servant did not much surprise me , for I do not think that in the whole world there are any more indefatigable runners than the Mistec Indians . At twelve o'clock , just as the bell was calling home the laborers , I entered the courtyard of the sugar-mill , where I caught sight of my youngster sitting on the ground , with his dog at his feet , looking with rapture at some ducks that were enjoying themselves in a muddy pool . Illustration Illustration CHAPTER II . SUGAR .  --  GRINGALET IN THE MOLASSES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ INDIAN SUPPER . The breakfast was a cheerful one , thanks to the Spanish wine spoken of by our host . The Indian laborers , with their wives and children , assembled in inquisitive groups round the windows of the dwelling . Lucien certainly carried the day , for he it was that they chiefly sought to see . As for Gringalet , he was much less cordially received by his brother-dogs belonging to the place ; consequently , he scarcely left his young master 's side , and showed his teeth incessantly . Sumichrast wishing , before we set out again , to explain to his pupil how sugar was made , took him to the mill , situated in a wide rotunda . Here two upright wooden cylinders , fitting close to one another , revolved on a pivot , set in action by means of two oxen yoked together , crushing the canes which an AztecC was introducing between them . The machine groaned , and seemed almost ready to fall to pieces under the impetus of the powerful animals , which were urged on both by voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in lengths of about a yard , and bevelled off at the ends , so as to be more readily caught between the two cylinders . After having been subjected to this heavy pressure , they came out squeezed almost dry , and the sweet juice , or sirup , flowed down into a large trough hollowed out of the trunk of a tree . As soon as this receptacle was full of juice , an enormous valve was opened , and the turbid , muddy-looking liquid flowed along a trench , and emptied into a brick reservoir . On its way it passed through the meshes of a coarse bag , and was thus roughly filtered ; it was then conveyed into immense coppers placed over a hot furnace . The fragments of crushed cane , having been rapidly dried in the sun , were used to feed the fire which boiled the juice so lately squeezed out of them . Near the aloe-fibre filtering-bag , in front of which the morsels of cane and rubbish constantly accumulated , stood a little boy about twelve years old , whose duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my coat , to call my attention to the fact that the lad had only one arm . " How did you lose your left arm , pobricito ? " I asked . " Between the crushers , senor . " " Was it your own fault ? " " Alas ! yes . My father looked after the machine , and I helped him to drive the oxen ; and he had forbidden my going near the cylinders . One day he went away for a few minutes , and I tried to put a piece of cane between the rollers ; but my finger caught , and my arm was drawn in and crushed . " " It was a terrible punishment for your disobedience , " I said . " More terrible than you think , senor . My father died six months ago , and I have several little brothers . If I had both my arms , I could earn a quarter of a piastre a day , and also help my mother . " " How much do they give you for watching this filtering-bag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " D he answered . I looked hard at Lucien , who threw himself into my arms . " Oh ! I will always obey you , " he cried , with emotion ; " but do allow me to give all the money in my purse to this little boy . " " Give him a piastre , my boy ; we shall meet with others in want , and you must reserve something for them . " " Oh ! young gentleman , " said the poor mutilated lad , looking with wonder at the coin which represented sixteen days ' work , " we will all pray for you ! " And he hurried to clear out the bag , which was already too full . The process adopted in the sugar-mill we speak of was of most primitive simplicity . The European manufacturers employ iron cylinders turned by steam or water power ; also lift and force pumps , which quickly convey the sap into the basins in which it is to be clarified by fermentation . But for comprehending easily all the operations required in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which every thing was done before our eyes , was much preferable to any of the modern mills provided with all kinds of improved apparatus . When our young traveller saw the thick , muddy , and turbid liquid , which was being stirred up by a gigantic " agitator , " he could hardly believe that it could ever produce the beautiful white crystal with which he was so well acquainted . " But where 's the sugar ? " he eagerly asked . " There , in front of you , " replied Sumichrast . " The sugar-cane , like all other vegetables , contains a certain quantity of liquid , in which the sugar is held in a state of solution ; if this is removed , prismatic crystals immediately form . Look now ! the contents of the copper are just beginning to boil , and are covered with a blackish scum , which is carefully skimmed off ; for in three or four days , when it has fermented , it will produce , by means of distillation , the ardent spirit which l'Encuerado is so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above the copper shows that the juice is evaporating ; in a few minutes more it will be converted into sirup , and will ultimately form crystals . Come and see the result of the last operation . " We entered a large gallery , in which a number of moulds  --  made of baked earth and shaped like reversed sugar-loaves  --  were ranged in lines under the beams , like bottles in a bottle-rack . Into these , which had been previously moistened , some laborers were pouring the boiling sirup . A little farther on we were shown what had been boiled the day before , and was crystallizing , assisted in the process by an Indian , who stirred it slowly . From a trough , open at the lower end , a thick liquid was flowing , called " molasses , " or treacle , which is used for making rum , gingerbread , and for other purposes . The lowest part of the sugar-loaf seemed , also , to be yellow and sticky . Passing through a dark passage , Lucien noticed two half-naked laborers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dough . " What a nasty mess ! " he cried , with a self-satisfied tone . " What would mamma say , if she was here ? It was only the other day she gave my brother and sister a good scolding . " " What was it for ? " I asked . " For mixing up mud to build a town and reservoir in the long passage in our house . " " What part did you take in it ? " " Oh , I was architect ; but I was scolded as much as the others . " " That I can readily believe , " replied Sumichrast , who could hardly keep his gravity ; " but come , let us follow these laborers , and you will soon see that they are not mixing up this mud for mere pleasure . " To his great surprise , our little traveller saw them filling up , with a dark-colored liquid , the empty part of the moulds , from which the molasses had drained away . " They are spoiling the sugar-loaves ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to whiten it . The water that is contained in the clay will filter gradually through the sugar , and will drive before it the molasses that is left round the crystals ; and this operation , several times repeated , will produce that spongy kind of sugar which is well known to retain a flavor of the cane , rather disliked by Europeans accustomed to the finer products of their refineries . " The only department we now had to visit was the " drying-room , " where the sugar-loaves are piled up to dry , and wait for a purchaser . In our way thither we nearly fell into an immense reservoir , level with the surface of the ground , and full of molasses ; the scum floating on the top so exactly resembled the rough and sticky floor of the sugar-mill that it was easy to make a mistake . Gringalet was unfortunate enough to be the cause of our avoiding this accident . Restless , like all his kind , he ran smelling about in every direction , just as if he was trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legs , to get in front of us , he suddenly disappeared in the thick liquid . I pulled him out directly ; but as soon as he was on his feet , he rolled over and over on the ground , so that when he stood up his coat was bristling with pieces of straw and wood ; in fact , he scarcely looked like a dog at all . I called him towards the pond outside , but the poor brute was quite blind and confused , and did not seem to hear . As a matter of course , all the laborers raised shouts of laughter ; but poor Lucien , fancying that his dog was going to die , followed him in despair . Gringalet , no doubt wishing to comfort his young master , leaped upon him and covered him with caresses , and of course with saccharine matter , in which he so lately had a bath . As it was too late for any other course , I made up my mind to laugh , like every one else . While l'Encuerado was washing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , soon after which we resumed our journey . Don Antonio , like a real Mexican , pitied us for having to travel on foot like Indians ; he especially commiserated our young companion , and thought , indeed , that we were very cruel . " He must learn to use his legs ; that 's the reason why God gave them to him , " said Sumichrast , who delighted in an argument with the steward . " What good are horses , then ? " " To break your neck . Besides , there are plenty of infirmities in life without making one out of the horse . " " The horse an infirmity ! " cried the Mexican . " Yes , certainly  --  among your caste at least ; for you could no more do without a horse than a cripple without his crutch . " Don Antonio whistled without making any reply , and , untying his horse , took Lucien up in front , and accompanied us for more than a league . At last , as his duties called him home , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after we had lost sight of him , we could still hear him wishing us a pleasant journey . We had to cross a wide prairie ; the heat was suffocating , and we marched on side by side in dead silence . Lucien 's walking was much hindered by his game-pouch and gourd , which , in spite of all his efforts , would work round in front of him . I soon noticed that he had got rid of the troublesome gear . " Hallo ! " I cried , " what have you done with your provisions ? " " L'Encuerado wished to carry them for me . " " L'Encuerado 's load is quite heavy enough now , and you must get accustomed to your own . In a few days you wo n't feel it . Habit makes many things easy which at first seem impossible . " " Senor , " said l'Encuerado , " Chanito ( this was the name he gave to Lucien ) is tired , and this is his first journey ; I 'll give him back all his things to-morrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get accustomed to them now . Give him back his baggage , it is not too heavy for him ; if you do n't , you will be the one to be scolded . " The Indian grumbled before he obeyed ; then , taking the boy by the hand , dropped behind , muttering to him : " When you do n't want to walk any more , Chanito , you must tell me , and you shall ride on the top of my pack . " " No , " said I , turning round ; " if you do any thing of the kind , I will send both of you home . " " My shoulders are my own , " replied the Indian , earnestly ; " surely I have a right to employ them as I choose . " Sumichrast burst out laughing at this logic , and I was obliged to go on in front , or I should have done the same . Nevertheless , I feared lest Lucien should learn , on the very first day of his journey , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , therefore , pleased to hear him refuse several times the Indian 's offer of putting him up on his pack , an idea which the faithful fellow persisted in with an obstinacy which I had long known him to possess . A little time after  --  thinking , doubtless , that his dignity compelled him to prove that he was easily able to increase the weight of his load  --  he seized Gringalet , who was walking close behind lolling out his tongue , and throwing the dog up on his back , and commencing an Indian trot , ran by us with a triumphant look . Gringalet was at first taken by surprise , and , raising a cry of distress , wanted to jump down ; but he soon sat quiet enough , without displaying any uneasiness , to the great joy of my son , who was much amused at the incident . The plain which we were crossing seemed absolutely interminable . " It 's no use our walking , " said Lucien ; " we do n't appear to make any advance . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Look in front of you , and you will see that the trees on ahead , which a short time ago looked like one uninterrupted mass of foliage , can now be discerned separately . " " You mean the forest which we can see from here ? " " What you take for a forest is nothing but a few trees scattered about the plain . " " Is n't M. Sumichrast wrong in that , father ? " " No , my boy ; but those who have more experience than you might well be mistaken , for when objects are seen at a distance they always seem to blend together in a group . This morning , for instance , when we were walking along the main road , you were always exclaiming that it ended in a point ; but you were convinced that your eyes deceived you . It is just the same now : these trees appear to be farther apart in proportion as we approach them ; and you will be quite surprised presently when you see how distant they are from each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which are millions of miles apart , and yet appear so thick in the sky , that your brother Emile was regretting , the other night , that he was not tall enough to grasp a handful of them . " " And do n't forget , " added Sumichrast , " that light and imagination often combine to deceive us . " " Just as in the fable of the ' Camels and the floating sticks . ' " " Bravo ! my young scholar ; you 've heard that fable ? " " Yes . One evening I was going into a dimly-lighted room , and I fancied I saw a great gray man seated in a chair ; I cried out , and ran away , afraid . Then papa took me by the hand and led me into the dark room again , and I found that the giant which had frightened me so much was nothing but a pair of trowsers , thrown over the back of an arm-chair . The next day mamma made me learn the fable of the ' Camels . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , our party reached the foot of the mountains . " On our road I called Lucien 's attention to a small thorny shrub , a kind of mimosa , called huizachi by the Indians , who use its pods for dyeing black cloth , and for making a tolerably useful ink . The plain assumed by degrees a less monotonous aspect . Butterflies began to hover round us , and our young naturalist wanted to commence insect-hunting . I restrained his ardor , as I wished to keep our boxes and needles free for the rarer species which we might expect to find as soon as we had reached more uninhabited districts . At last , lagging a little , our party reached the foot of the mountains . It was now five o'clock ; night was coming on , so it was highly necessary to look out for shelter . We came in view of a bamboo-hut in the nick of time . An old Indian was reclining in front of it , warming his meagre limbs in the rays of the setting sun , clad in nothing but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brim . He rose as we came near , and proffered us hospitality . His wife , whose costume consisted of a cotton shirt edged with red thread , came running in answer to his call , and was quite in raptures at the prettiness of the " little white traveller , " who completely ingratiated himself by saluting her in her own language . We had accomplished a journey of seven leagues , although Lucien , thanks to Don Antonio 's horse , had not walked quite so far . The aborigines set before us rice and beans . After this frugal repast , washed down with cold water , I wanted Lucien to lie down on a large mat ; but the restless little being took advantage of his elders being comfortably stretched out to sleep , and ran off to see our hostess 's fowls roosting for the night on a dead tree , and then to prowl up and down in company with l'Encuerado . The latter had ferreted out a three-corded guitar which was in the hut , and strummed away at the same tune for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boy , although to us it was quite the reverse . At last our bedding was unrolled , and I enjoined repose on all . Gringalet couched down in the hut , at the feet of his young master . L'Encuerado , however , preferred sleeping in the open air , only too happy , as he said , to see the sky above , and to feel the wind blow straight into his face without having to be filtered through walls and windows .

When I speak of Aztecs , my young readers may perhaps think I allude to these dwarfs . I will therefore state , once for all , that this name is intended to apply only to the Indians , the descendants of the fine race over whom Montezuma was emperor when Cortez conquered them .

WAKING UP IN THE MORNING . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE BOTTLES .  --  MASSACRE OF THISTLES.  --  THE CHARCOAL-BURNING INDIANS . I rose long before day and woke my companion . Lucien rubbed his eyes two or three times , trying in vain to make out where he was . After some moments , drawing the coverlet over him , he turned round to go to sleep again . " Now , then , young Lazybones ! " I cried , " do n't you hear the cock crowing , telling us we ought to be on our road ? Jump up and look round , and you will see the birds and the insects are already busy . " The child got up , appearing half stupefied , and stretched himself with a long yawn . " Oh , papa ! " he said , " I ache all over ; I 'm sure I shall never be able to walk . " " You are quite mistaken , " I replied , half supporting him . " You only feel a little tired and stiff ; your limbs will very soon work as freely as ever . Go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hostess is preparing coffee . " The little fellow did as he was told ; but he limped sadly . " Do your legs feel like mine ? " he asked of l'Encuerado . " No , Chanito ; we did not walk far enough yesterday for that . " " You ca n't mean that we have n't walked far ? Papa says that we are now seven leagues from Orizava . " " Yes ; that may seem a great deal to you , and perhaps too much ; that is why I wanted to put you up on the top of my pack . Now , come , let me see where you suffer . " " All over my limbs , but particularly inside my knees . " " Wait a minute , and I 'll soon cure you . " L'Encuerado then laid Lucien down in front of the fire , and began to rub him after the Indian method , vigorously shampooing the whole of his body . Next he made him walk and run with the longest strides he could take ; and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boiling coffee . Having been revived and strengthened in this way , the lad quite recovered his sprightliness , and soon asked when we were going to start . I gave a small present to the old couple who had so kindly accommodated us , and our little party began its second day 's work ; Gringalet sniffing the breeze , and evidently enjoying the excursion as much as any of the party . When the sun rose , the sky was covered with grayish clouds , driven along quickly by a north wind ; but the weather was cool , and well adapted to walking . A limestone mountain rose right in front of us , the slope of which we had to climb ; but ere we reached the top , we halted at least twenty times to take breath . Our little companion , with his head bent down towards the ground , struggled to retain his place by our side . At last we reached the summit , and felt at liberty to rest . Casting a glance on the plain beneath us , the boy surveyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He silently contemplated the panorama which was spread out beneath , although he failed to completely comprehend all that he saw . " Look at those black spots moving about over the plain , " said he . " They are oxen , " I replied . " Oxen ! Why they are scarcely as big as Gringalet . " " Do n't you know that you must not trust to appearances ? Recollect the trees you saw yesterday , which you thought were a forest . " " But if , from this height , the oxen appear no larger than sheep , the sheep ought not to look greater than flies . " " You can easily judge ; there is a flock of goats down below . " " A flock of goats ! It is like a swarm of ants . " " Exactly ; but look at them through the telescope . " Availing himself of the glass , which he used rather unskillfully , Lucien raised a sudden cry . " I see them ! I see them ! " he exclaimed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowding together , in front of a little boy who is driving them . " " It is most likely a man , who is diminished by the distance . " " The idea of men of that size ! " " Well , look at the foot of that wooded hill ; the thin line which you might easily take for a mere pathway is the main road . Perhaps you may see an Indian family travelling along it . " Illustration : " The basket and its bearer chased one another down the hill . " Lucien kept shifting his telescope about for some minutes without descrying any thing ; but at last he broke out in a fresh exclamation . " Have you discovered any men ? " I asked . " Oh yes !  --  men , horses , and mules ; but they are regular Lilliputians . " " You are quite right , " said Sumichrast ; " how do we know that Dr. Swift did not first form his idea of ' Gulliver 's Travels ' from looking at the world from the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was obliged to take the young observer away from this point for contemplation to proceed on our journey . The ridge of the mountain was soon crossed , and we began to descend the other side . I took Lucien by the hand , for the slope was so steep that it needed the utmost care to avoid rolling down over the naked rocks . Several times I slipped , and scratched my legs among the bushes . Sumichrast , who had taken his turn in looking after the boy , was no better off than myself . The descent was so steep that we were often forced to run , and sometimes the only thing possible to retard our impetus was to fall down , and run the risk of being hurt . Therefore , in spite of Lucien 's promise to walk prudently and with measured step , I declined to allow him to go alone . We at last , to our great satisfaction , got over about two-thirds without any accident , when l'Encuerado , losing his equilibrium , fell , turning head over heels several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the hill , finally disappearing into a thicket . " Look after Lucien , " I said to my companion , who was a few paces in front . And I dashed forward anxiously to assist l'Encuerado . I feared that I should find the unfortunate Indian with some of his bones broken , even if not killed ; so I called to him , when he replied almost immediately ; but his voice sounded not from below , but from a spot a little to my left . I could not stay my rapid course except by grasping a tuft of brush-wood , to which I hung . Then , turning towards the left , I soon encountered the Mistec , who had already begun to collect his burden . " Nothing broken ? " I asked . " No , Tatita ; all the bottles are safe . " " It 's your limbs that I mean , my poor fellow ! " " Oh ! my nose and arms are a little scratched , and my body is rather knocked about ; but there 's not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added he , looking with complacency at the leathern garments which had given him the name of l'Encuerado . " Well , you have had a narrow escape . " " Oh ! senor , God is good ! In spite of the basket-work case , the bottles might have been broken , and they are not the least hurt . " For my part , I was more inclined to recognize God 's goodness in l'Encuerado 's almost miraculous preservation . As to the basket , the Indian had tied it up so strongly , that I was not at all surprised to find that our provisions were uninjured . " Give a call-cry , " said I to the Indian , " Sumichrast can not see us , and may think that you are killed . " " Chanito , hiou , hiou , hiou , Chanito ! " " Ohe ! ohe ! " replied Lucien . And the boy , looking pale and alarmed , almost immediately made his appearance . He rushed up to his friend , threw his arms round his neck , and embraced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little injured by his terrible descent , could not help weeping at this proof of Lucien 's attachment . " It was nothing but a joke , " he said . " You 'll see me perform many a feat like that . " " Your face is all over with blood ! " " That 's a mere joke , too . Would you like me to do it again ? " " No , no ! " cried the child , catching the Indian by the jacket . I dressed l'Encuerado 's hurts , and we were about to continue our journey . " I say , " said Lucien , archly , just as the Indian was hoisting his basket on to his back ; " how would it have been if I had been perched on it ? " " Then I should not have fallen , " replied l'Encuerado , with the utmost gravity . In a minute or two more we were at the foot of the mountain , when Lucien , overjoyed that the descent was accomplished , gave a leap which showed me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late struggle . " There 's a pretty beginning ! " I cried ; " how did you manage to get your trowsers in that state ? " " It is my fault , " said Sumichrast , with consternation ; " wishing to descend more rapidly , and fearing another tumble , I advised him to sit down and slide carefully . I did not foresee the very natural results of such a plan . " " Well , papa ! it does not matter in the country . " " If my advice had been taken , " broke in l'Encuerado , " he would have had a pair of leathern pantaloons , which would n't suffer from such contingencies . Never mind , Chanito , we 'll mend them with the skin of the first squirrel which comes within reach of my gun . " We were now passing through a dark gorge full of thick brush-wood . In front of us rose a wooded mountain , which we had to climb . The shrubs were succeeded by gigantic thistles , which compelled us to advance with extreme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were obliged to use our knives to clear a passage . L'Encuerado , putting down his load , taught Lucien how to handle his ; showing him that a downward cut , if the weapon slipped or met with but little resistance , might be dangerous . Enchanted with his lesson , and cutting down several stalks at a blow , our young pioneer soon opened for us an avenue rather than a path . The thistles gradually became fewer . Sumichrast walked in front , destroying the last obstacles that severed us from the under-wood . It was now breakfast-time , and as we continued our course we looked out for a favorable spot to halt at , when the measured strokes of an axe fell upon our ears . This noise told of the presence of wood-cutters , who were certain to be provided with maize-cakes and beans ; so we resolved to make our way up to them , and thus economize our own resources . After an hour 's difficult ascent , just as we were despairing of reaching the Indian , whose axe had ceased to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there 's a fire ! " At the same moment Gringalet began barking furiously , and a few paces more brought us to a burning charcoal-oven . The charcoal-burner , who was surprised at our visit , seized his long-handled axe . But the presence of the child appeared to reassure him . " Good-morning , Don Jose , " said I , using the common name which is applied in Mexico to all the Indians . " God preserve you , " replied he , speaking in broken Spanish . " Are you all alone ? " " No . I have six companions . " " Well , will one of you sell us some maize-cakes , and give us some water ? " " We have neither water nor cakes . " " I 'm quite sure you will be able to find some , " I replied , placing a half-piastre in his hand . Illustration : " Almost immediately the foliage was pushed aside . " The Indian took off his straw hat , scratched his forehead , and then , placing two fingers in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the foliage was pushed aside , and a boy about fifteen years old , wearing nothing but a pair of drawers , made his appearance , and halted , as if terrified at the sight of us . " Run to the hut , and ask for cakes and some capsicums , and bring them here , " said the wood-cutter , in the Aztec language . " It 's quite needless , " I replied , in the same idiom ; " we can breakfast much more comfortably in the hut . " The wood-cutter looked at me in artless admiration , then taking my hand , placed it on his breast . I spoke his language , and I was therefore his friend . This is a feeling common to all men , whatever may be their nationality or social position . Following the young Indian , in five minutes we reached a very primitive dwelling ; being but four stakes supporting a roof made of branches with their leaves on . The wood-men in Mexico construct such temporary places of shelter , for at the commencement of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An Indian girl warmed us a dozen of those maize-flour fritters , which are called tortillas , and are eaten by the natives instead of bread . She also brought us a calabash full of cooked beans , which hunger rendered delicious . " Why do n't they serve the meat first ? " asked Lucien . " Because they have none , " replied Sumichrast . " Have n't these Indians any meat ? Poor fellows ! How will they dine , then ? " " Do n't you know that the Indians never eat meat more than three or four times a year ; and that their usual food is composed of nothing but black beans , rice , capsicums , and maize flour ? Have you forgotten our dinner yesterday ? " " I fancied that we had arrived too late for the first course , and that all the meat had been used . But shall we live on beans the whole of our journey ? " " No ; our meals will not be quite so regular as you seem to think . Yet we shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shooting , a little rice when we have been unfortunate , and fried beans whenever chance throws in our way any inhabited hut . " " And we shall have to go without dessert ? " said the child , making up his face into a comical pout . " Oh no , Chanito , there will be dessert to-day , " replied l'Encuerado . " Perhaps as good as the cook would provide at home ; but , at any rate , it is sweet enough . Look at it ! " The Indian girl brought a calabash full of water , and a cone of black sugar , weighing about half a pound . " What is that ? " cried Lucien . " Panela , " answered the Indian girl . " Poor man 's sugar , " interposed Sumichrast . " The manufacture of white sugar , which you saw yesterday , costs a good deal , for the laborers employed to make it have to work night and day , and thus it becomes expensive . Now , some sugar-makers avoid all this outlay , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harden in cooling . This dark-colored sugar costs about one-half as much in making as the other . " " I can well believe it , " said the child ; " but it contains all that nasty scum which we saw . " " That makes it the nicer , " said l'Encuerado ; " it has a richer flavor . " And taking a morsel of the panela , he soaked it in the water in the calabash and sucked it . When Lucien saw that we , too , imitated the Indian , he soon made up his mind to do likewise , the sweet taste overcoming his repugnance . When we had finished , our young companion was anxious to know how charcoal was made . Sumichrast led him close to a recently-felled oak , the small branches of which an Indian was cutting into pieces two or three inches long , by means of an instrument something like an enormous pruning-knife . A little farther , on the open ground , two men were collecting these pieces of wood in circular rows . This pile was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in height , although it was not half finished . Lucien could easily see this when he approached the Indian who was looking after the lighted furnace , in which the wood , completely covered with earth , formed a kind of dome , from the summit of which a blue flame was hovering , proving that the mass inside was in a red-hot state . The Indian kept walking round and round the furnace , plastering damp earth on any holes through which the flame started . For , as Sumichrast properly observed , a charcoal of good quality must be smothered while it is being burned . " Suppose the fire went out ? " said Lucien . " Then all the work must be begun over again . " " But the fire might burn only one side . " " They would then have badly-burned charcoal , nearly half wood , which would cause a bad smell when it was used . The wood in the oven we are looking at will be entirely charred to-night ; for the fire , which was lighted at the centre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Before long the Indians will cover up the opening at the top , over which the blue flame is hovering . The fire will then be quite deprived of air , and soon afterwards go out . In about eight days your mamma may perhaps buy this very charcoal which you have seen burned . " " Suppose the charcoal went on burning ? " " Then the Indian , to his great vexation , would find nothing left but ashes . But he will take good care not to lose the fruit of his labor . He will use as many precautions to prevent the fire burning up again as he does now to hinder it going out . " A little farther on a man was filling up his rush bags with charcoal which had cooled . As it would take him more than one day to reach the town , he was lining his sacks with a kind of balm , the penetrating odor of which always announces , in Mexico , the approach of a charcoal-carrier . This plan is adopted to preserve the charcoal from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carrying on their backs their four little sacks of charcoal , " said Lucien , " I had no idea that they were obliged to live in the woods , and cut down great trees to procure it ; and that they had to pass several nights in watching the oven . " " No more idea , perhaps , " I replied , " than the little boys in Europe have of the sugar-cane plantations ; and that without the plant all those beautiful bon-bons , which delight the sight as much as the taste , could not be made . " " But , papa , have n't I heard you tell the Mexicans that in France they make sugar with beet-root ? " " Yes , certainly you have ; and , in case of need , it might be extracted from many other roots , plants , or fruit ; but beet-root alone yields enough sugar to repay the trouble of extraction . " It was quite time for us to be off ; so I put an end to the ceaseless questions of the young traveller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the same path which had led us to their place , we should come , in less than two hours , to a hut situated on the plateau of the mountain . The Indians certainly seemed to forget that Lucien 's short legs might delay our progress . Illustration CHAPTER IV . A DIFFICULT ASCENT .  --  THE GOAT .  --  THE INDIAN GIRLS .  --  THE TOBACCO-PLANT.  --  THE BULL-FIGHT.  --  GAME .  --  LUCIEN 'S GUN .  --  OUR ENTRY INTO THE WILDERNESS . Our way led through nothing but scrub oaks , for all the larger trees had gradually disappeared from the mountain-side , which had for some time been cultivated by the Indians . The path was steep , rugged , and stony ; and seemed , at first , to defy any attempt to scale it . Notwithstanding the measured pace at which we were walking , we were obliged to stop every minute to recover our breath . Lucien followed us so eagerly that I was obliged to check him several times . He was surprised at not seeing any living creature , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flutter round every bush . But the north wind was blowing , and the sun was hidden behind the clouds , so that both the insects and birds kept in the deepest recesses of their hiding-places . As we advanced , our road became much steeper , and we were obliged to cling to the shrubs for support . L'Encuerado , who was impeded by the weight of his load , pulled himself up with his hands , so had hard work to keep his balance . Soon it became impossible for him to go farther ; but , fortunately , we had foreseen ascents of this kind . So I gave the child into Sumichrast 's charge , for if he had been left to climb by himself , he would most likely have rolled over and hurt himself against the stumps or sharp rocks . I made my way into a copse , and with my machete I cut down a moderately-sized branch , the end of which I sharpened to a point . Then , going forward and unrolling a leathern thong , thirty feet in length , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to the stake , which I drove firmly into the ground . By means of this support , which served as a sort of hand-rail , l'Encuerado could clamber up to me , thanks to the strength of his wrists . Ten times this awkward job had to be repeated , and the path , instead of getting better , became worse . We then shifted our work , and I took charge of the load , while the tired Indian fixed the lasso . I was just making my third ascent , when Sumichrast , who had gone on before us to reconnoitre the ground , made his appearance above . When he saw me stumbling and twisting about , falling now on my side , and now on my knees , toiling to advance a single step , my companion burst into a fit of laughter . I had then neither time nor will to do as he did , and his ill-timed mirth vexed me . At last I caught hold of the stake , bruised and exhausted , and ready to wish there was no such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scarcely three hundred feet more to ascend , and shouldered the basket himself . Now that I was a mere spectator , I could readily forgive him his fit of merriment . Nothing , in fact , could be more grotesque than the contortions he went through trying to keep his balance . L'Encuerado was the only one who retained his countenance . As for Lucien , he seemed to feel the efforts of Sumichrast as much as if they were his own . " You see , " I said to my son , " that in countries where there are no beaten roads a walk is not always an easy matter . " At last , we got out of this difficult locality . While all this was going on , Gringalet , gravely squatting down upon his haunches , seemed perfectly amazed at our efforts . Pricking up his ears and winking his eyes , he quietly surveyed us ; no doubt secretly congratulating himself upon being able to run and gambol easily in places where we , **25;682;TOOLONG bipeds , found it difficult even to walk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the evening before , we traversed a granite surface soil which formed the ridge of the mountain ; but a sudden turn in the path led us to a plateau , on which stood a rudely-built hut . Three children ran away as we came near , and two lean dogs began to prowl round Gringalet with any thing but friendly intentions . A goat , which was quietly cropping the scanty grass , suddenly raised its head , and , cutting several capers , ran with its head bent down , as if to butt our little companion . I could not reach the spot in time to prevent this unforeseen attack , nevertheless I shouted , in hopes of intimidating the animal ; but Gringalet , who was far more nimble than I , boldly faced the enemy , and soon forced him to retreat . " Were n't you afraid of him ? " asked Sumichrast . " Rather , " answered Lucien , hanging down his head . " Well , it did not prevent you facing the foe . " " If I had run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faster than I can , would soon have overtaken me . I waited for him , so as to frighten him with my stick , and , if possible , avoid his horns . " " You could not have acted more sensibly . At all events you 've plenty of coolness , and that is about the best quality a traveller can show . " " All right now , but in future I shall keep clear of goats . But I thought they were afraid of men . " " Not always , as you were very near finding out to your cost . Perhaps , however , " continued Sumichrast , smiling , " your enemy did not look upon you quite as a man ; and , after all , I fancy he thought more of playing with you than of hurting you , for he must be thoroughly accustomed to the sight of children . " At this moment Gringalet came running up with his tail between his legs , and with a most doleful look ; he was closely pursued by all the dogs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making a kind of howling noise , common to those that are but half domesticated . On hearing all this uproar , two Indian women came running towards us , but stopped , abashed at our appearance . The youngest of them , rather a pretty girl , wore nothing but a short linen chemise , and a piece of blue woollen stuff fastened round her hips by a wide band , ornamented with red threads . Her hair , which was plaited and brought over her forehead , formed a sort of coronet . Her companion , who was dressed in a similar way , wore , in addition , a long scarf , which was fixed to her head , and fell round her like a nun 's cloak . " God bless you , Maria ! " I said to the eldest . " Can you take us in for one night ? " Illustration : " On hearing the uproar , two Indian women came running towards us . " " I have nothing to offer you to eat , I am afraid . " " Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Well , I must see if my husband objects to guests . " " Surely your husband will not refuse the shelter of his roof to weary travellers ? " She reflected for a moment , and then answered , " No , he is a Christian ! Come in and rest yourselves . " The Indian woman called to her children , who one after the other showed their wild-looking heads peeping out from some hiding-place , and ordered them to drive away the dogs . It was not without some degree of pleasure we got rid of our travelling gear , as we felt no ordinary amount of weariness , which was easily accounted for by the exertion of our recent ascent . L'Encuerado , always brisk , began to assist the housewife ; he stirred up the fire , arranged the plates , and looked to their being clean . The Indian woman then asked him to go and draw some water from a spring about a hundred yards from the hut ; and off he went , led by the children of our hostess . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shaved , rode on bamboo-canes as make-believe horses , and pranced along in front of him . Except on the side we had just ascended , the plateau was entirely surrounded by high mountains . The hut , which was built of planks and covered with thatch , appeared very cleanly kept . Behind it extended a small kitchen garden , in which fennel , the indispensable condiment in Aztec cookery , grew in great abundance ; in front , there was a large tobacco plantation , and an inclosure where both goats and pigs lived on good terms with each other . The situation appeared somewhat dull to us ; but in the tropics the absence of sunshine is sufficient to give a sombre look to the most beautiful landscape . Lucien wanted to pay a visit to the tobacco-field . The stems of this plant are more than three feet high , covered with wide leaves of a dark-green color . The flowers , some of which were pink and others a yellowish hue , indicated two different species ; their acrid smell was any thing but pleasant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful vegetable belonged to the same botanical family as the potato , the tomato , the egg-plant , and the pimento . " Among the ancient Aztecs , " said Sumichrast , " tobacco was called pycietl ; it was the emblem of the goddess Cihua-cohuatl , or woman-serpent . E In Mexican mythology , this divinity was supposed to be the first mother of children ; and , in the legend about her , the European missionaries fancied that they recognized some features resembling the sacred history of Eve . Up to the present time , the Indians , who have renounced the errors of paganism and profess the Christian religion , continue to make use of the plant consecrated to their ancient goddess , as a remedy for the sting of venomous reptiles . " " Then that is why they cultivate tobacco , " said Lucien , " for I know that they seldom smoke . " " No , but they sell their crops of it to the Creoles , among whom smoking is a universal habit . It is said that the word tobacco comes from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spaniards first discovered it . About the year 1560 , it was introduced into France by Jean Nicot , who gave it his own name ; for savants call this plant nicotian . It is a certain fact that the modern Mexican Indians smoke hardly any thing but cigars or cigarettes . As for pipes , they have not long known of the existence of such things ; and the works of certain romancers , who so often describe the Aztecs as having the pipe of peace , war , or council constantly in their mouths , are simply ridiculous . You may recollect how astonished the French were , on their arrival here , to find they could not procure any cut tobacco ; while on the other hand the Indians crowded to see the foreigners inhale the smoke of the plant from instruments made of clay , wood , or porcelain . " F " I remember , " cried Lucien , " that one day l'Encuerado took a pipe belonging to an officer who was staying with papa and began to smoke it . You should have seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what happened to him ? " asked Sumichrast . " The pipe made him sick , and then papa , who knew nothing about his smoking , gave him some medicine ; but l'Encuerado told me that the medicine was not nearly so nasty as the pipe . " The culprit , who had just joined us , cast down his eyes at this tale about him , and murmured in a sententious tone of voice , " Pipes are an invention of the devil . " G Followed by my companions , I again drew near to the hut , and the master came out to bid us welcome . Our hostess placed upon a mat an earthen dish containing a fowl cooked with rice , and the Indian , his wife , and his sister-in-law , offered to wait on us . Lucien invited the children to partake of our repast ; but they refused to sit down beside us . Towards the conclusion of our dinner , one of them brought us half a dozen bananas , which were most welcome ; while we were drinking our coffee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To my great satisfaction , I saw that , in spite of the long day 's journey , Lucien joined in , and ran and jumped about with as much energy as his play-mates . At last the children got tired of this game , and , bringing a kid , had a mock bull-fight . The animal , wonderfully well trained to the sport , ran after the youngsters , and more than once succeeded in knocking them down . When Lucien met this fate , Gringalet became furious and sprang upon the pretty little creature ; but the dog 's young master got up in a moment and soon quieted his protector 's energy . We had noticed , ever since we set out , that Gringalet always preferred to follow close to the boy , and seemed to have taken upon himself the task of watching over his safety . Our host told us that he was born and also married in the village of Tenejapa ; but being enlisted for a soldier by force , he deserted and took up his abode on this plateau . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a visit for six years . His fields produced maize , beans , and tobacco , which his wife and sister-in-law took twice a year to Orizava to exchange for necessaries for housekeeping . He was as happy as possible , and was never tired of praising the charms of forest and plain . But his raptures were not required to convert us to his opinions . Nightfall was accompanied by cold , to which we were but little accustomed . The Indians lent us some mats ; then we all wrapped ourselves up , and were soon asleep , notwithstanding the primitiveness of our couch . About two in the morning I woke up numbed from the lowness of the temperature ; Lucien also was nearly frozen . I hastened to cover him up with my sarape , for on these heights we were exposed to the north wind blowing from the volcano of Citlatepetl , and the atmosphere would not get warm again until sunrise . Sumichrast soon joined me ; he had also given up his covering to the child . I then set to work to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our movements ultimately roused up our host , and , thanks to him , we were soon able to sit down in front of a powerful blaze . Still l'Encuerado , from force of habit , who was hardly sheltered at all , was sleeping like a top . At last , aided by the heat , sleep resumed its influence , and I dropped off again in slumber . When I awoke , the sun was shining in a cloudless sky , and every body was up . Sumichrast was inspecting the arms and ammunition , for from this day forward we should have to provide our own subsistence . I was quite surprised at the time I had been asleep ; but a slight touch of lumbago reminded me of yesterday 's difficult ascent , which fully accounted for my drowsiness . I must confess I felt much more inclined to go to bed again than to continue our journey ; but , as I was obliged to set a good example , I began to help my companions in their preparations for departure . I have already described @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mine also consisted of strong cloth trowsers , and a blouse made of the same stuff . The weapons of each were a revolver , a machete , a double-barrelled gun , and a game-bag filled with necessaries . We duly examined the contents of the basket , which l'Encuerado carried on his back by a strap fixed across his breast or forehead . Sumichrast then took out a long parcel he had put into the basket when we started , and unrolled the cloth which formed its first covering . His smile and mysterious look quite puzzled us ; at last he drew from the paper a light fowling-piece , which he placed in Lucien 's hands . The boy blushed and trembled with joy , and became quite pale with anxiety . He hardly dared to believe that his fondest dream was thus realized . He could not speak for pleasure , but threw himself into my friend 's arms . I was as much surprised as he was . I had often thought of giving Lucien a gun ; but I was so afraid of an accident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , Chanito ! I pity the poor tigers ; what a number of them you will kill ! " exclaimed the old hunter . " What beautiful skins you will be able to take home to mamma ! Come , let me handle your gun ; it looks as if it was made on purpose for you . Oh ! how I pity the poor tigers ! " And he began to dance about with the energy of delight . Illustration It was decided that the gun should always be loaded by us , and that Lucien should only shoot under our directions . I also added that , at the least infringement of these rules , the gun would be taken away , and the little fellow well knew I would keep my word . In vain , so I allowed him to carry it , which he did with great pride . Illustration : " Behind us opened a dark , narrow ravine , with perpendicular sides . " After a good breakfast , we regulated our compasses . Lucien said good-bye to his little companions , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . Our host , however , accompanied us to the summit of the mountain . There we found ourselves in a vast amphitheatre , commanded on all sides by wooded ridges ; at our feet stretched the plateau we had just crossed , and far beneath us we caught indistinct glimpses of the plain below . Behind us opened a dark , narrow ravine , with perpendicular sides , almost like an immense wall . Above us was the pale blue sky , dotted over with vultures . On the verge of the forest our guide parted from us with regret , and wished us a successful journey . Sumichrast loaded Lucien 's gun , and told him to fire it off as a salute on our entering the wilderness . The shot was fired , the echoes reverberating in succession , each louder than the last ; then all was once more silent . After casting a last look over the valley , I was the first to make my way into the forest . From this moment we had only God 's providence and our own exertions to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us farther from the haunts of men . Illustration FOOTNOTES : E In the Aztec language , cihuatl signifies " woman , " and cohuatl signifies " serpent . " F The Indians that inhabit the vast plains to the north of Mexico all smoke ; from this , doubtless , arises the usual supposition that all American Indians smoke .  --  ED . G In giving utterance to this anathema , l'Encuerado was unknowingly agreeing with James I. , king of England , who published a work against smokers . Illustration CHAPTER V. THE GREAT FOREST .  --  CROWS .  --  THE FIRST BIVOUAC .  --  THE SQUIRREL-HUNT.  --  OUR YOUNG GUIDE .  --  THE CHANT IN THE DESERT . We were now more than 5000 feet above the level of the sea , and the coldness of the breeze quite surprised my son , who , being accustomed to the climate of the Terre-Temperee , had never before felt any thing like the atmosphere we were now in . As if by instinct , he held his fingers in his mouth , to prevent their getting numbed . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no longer any need to complain of the cold . As we advanced , the trees grew closer and closer together . Lucien , who now for the first time saw these enormous trees , to whom centuries were no more than years are to us , seemed strongly impressed at the sight of their gigantic proportions . He almost doubted the reality of the scene which met his eyes . Having previously seen the pigmy world of Lilliput from the top of a mountain , he was now ready to inquire if this was not another illusion , exhibiting to him the empire of one of those giants whose marvellous histories his mamma had related to him . An oak-tree which had fallen across our path gave him a good opportunity of measuring its size , the limbs of which seemed to touch the sky . The ancient trunk was black , wrinkled , and partly buried in the earth by the weight of its fall ; even as it lay prostrate , it was several feet higher than ourselves , while the large branches , scattered and broken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A flapping of wings suddenly attracted our attention , and we saw two couples of enormous crows take flight , saluting us as they went with a prolonged croaking . " Be off with you , children of the evil one ! " cried l'Encuerado ; " you 've no chance of frightening us , we are too good Christians for that ! " " Whom are you calling to ? " asked Lucien , who looked round him with surprise . " To the crows , of course . " " Do you believe that they can understand you ? " " Not the least doubt about it , Chanito . These scoundrels are harder in their flesh than they are in their hearing ; and just because they are dressed up in a beautiful black coat , like that your papa wears on festival days , they think to have every thing their own way . But if one of them dares to come to-night and prowl round our fire , I 'll kill and roast him , as sure as my name is l'Encuerado ! " The boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was always astonished at the whims of the Indian , who never failed to interpret the cries and gestures of animals according to his own fancy , and to give a sharp rejoinder to the imaginary provocations which , as he considered , were offered to him . Sometimes , even , he laid the blame on inanimate things , and then his conversations with them were most amusing . The old hunter had no doubt contracted this habit at a time when , living alone in the woods and feeling the need of talking , he conversed with himself , having no one else to address . However this might be , he kept up conversation with either a leaf or a bird in perfectly artless sincerity . For four hours we proceeded through the forest , feeling almost overcome with the heat . Pines and oaks appeared , one after another , in almost monotonous regularity . Gradually the ground began to slope , and the altered pace we had to adopt both rested us and also increased the speed of our march . At length we emerged into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character , the ceibas , lignum-vitae trees , and creepers were here and there to be seen . " Halt ! " I cried out . I soon got rid of my travelling gear , an example my companions were not slow in following . L'Encuerado and Lucien immediately set to work to find some dry branches , while Sumichrast and I began to cut down the grass over a space of several square yards . " Have we finished our day 's journey , then ? " asked Lucien . " Yes , " I replied ; " do n't you feel tired ? " " Not very ; I could easily go farther . Have we walked very far ? " " About four leagues . " " And are we really going to rest after a trifle like that ? I always thought travellers went on walking until night . " " Nonsense ! " said I , taking hold of his ear . " What an undaunted young pedestrian ! Four leagues a day are no such trifle when you have to begin again next morning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an old proverb , which I intend to carry out to the letter ; for forced marches would soon injure our health , and then good-bye to the success of our expedition . As to walking until night , it is perfectly impossible , except when one is certain to meet with an inn . Under these large trees , no one will ever think of getting ready a meal for us ; and , I suppose , you have n't much wish to die of hunger . We may very likely have to tramp one or two leagues more before we are able to kill the game which will form the mainstay of our dinner . " " I never thought of all that , " said Lucien , shaking his head , and looking convinced ; " but what shall we have to eat this evening ? " " At present , I have n't the least idea ; perhaps a hare or a bird , or even a rat . " " A rat ! I certainly will never touch one . " " Ah ! my boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know as yet what it is to be so  --  and then you 'll see how greedily you will make a dinner off whatever Providence provides . " " Do you think we shall often have to go a whole day without eating ? " " I hope not , " I answered , smiling at Lucien 's anxious and somewhat pensive tone . During this conversation , l'Encuerado , as active as a monkey , had clambered up a pine , and his machete was strewing the ground with slender boughs . We also set to work at shaping the stakes , which I drove into the ground by means of a stone , which served as a hammer . Some branches , interwoven and tied together by creepers , formed a kind of hurdle , which , fixed on the top of the posts , did for a roof . The Indian , assisted by his little companion , who was much interested in all the preparations , filled the hut with leaves , and covered the branches with a layer of dry grass . Under this shelter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the cold . It is impossible to describe Lucien 's enchantment . This house ( for this was the name he chose to give to the shapeless hut , in which our party could scarcely stand upright ) appeared to him a perfect masterpiece of architecture , and he was astonished at the rapidity with which it had been built . He helped l'Encuerado to make up the fire , so that all that was requisite on our return was to set a light to it . Then , armed with our guns , we set off to seek for our dinners . Seeing that we left behind us all our baggage , Lucien exclaimed , " Suppose any one came and stole our provisions ? " " Upon my word , " cried Sumichrast , " you 're the boy to think of every thing . But there 's no need to fear this misfortune ; most likely , we are the only persons in the forest ; or if any one else should be here , it would be an almost miraculous chance if they discovered our bivouac @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " You may call it a road if you like , but we are the only people who have trod it ; no one could discover our encampment unless they had followed us step by step . " The child shook his head with a rather doubtful air ; the idea of the desert is not readily nor suddenly comprehended . I well recollect that , during my first excursions in the wilderness , I was constantly expecting to catch sight of some human face , either just when I was emerging from a wood or in following the paths made in the savannah by wild cattle . At night , especially when I was troubled by sleeplessness , I was always fancying that I recognized , in the distant sounds , either the crow of a cock , the barking of a dog , or the burden of some familiar song . Illustration : " We now entered one of those glades . " " But if no one can discover our bivouac , " remarked Lucien , casting a glance behind him , " how shall we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way that is simple , but rather laborious ; we shall walk one after the other , and the last man 's duty will be to notch the trees and shrubs . " " Shall I walk first ? " asked Lucien . " No ; that place belongs by right to the best shot ; for if we put up any game , we must n't let it escape . In the mean time , until you know how to use your gun , you shall form the rear-guard . " This duty did not seem to displease Lucien , who immediately seized his sword and followed us , at a little distance , inflicting on the trunks of the trees the gashes which were to guide us on our return . He performed his work with so much ardor that his strength was soon exhausted . L'Encuerado afterwards taught him how to handle his weapon in a more skillful manner , and to notch the trees without stopping in his walk . A path marked in this manner is called , in Canada and the United States , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are so often met with in the midst of a virgin forest , although it is impossible to explain the cause why the trees do not grow just in these spots . As there was no living creature to be seen , I agreed with Sumichrast to leave Lucien and l'Encuerado on the watch , and that we should walk round , each on our own side , so as to meet again at the other extremity of the open space . Gringalet , seeing us separate , could not at first make up his mind which party he should go with ; but bounded from one to the other , and caressed each of us , raising plaintive whines . At last he seemed determined to follow me , but scarcely had I progressed a hundred yards before he stopped , as if to reflect . He probably thought he had left something behind , for he quickly disappeared . I walked for half an hour through the brake , with eye and ear both on the watch , and my finger on the trigger , without discovering the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more fortunate than I was , when suddenly a gun went off . At the same time , I saw Sumichrast pointing to a number of squirrels crossing the glade . " Have you killed one ? " I asked . " Yes ; but it is sticking fast between two branches , sixty feet above the ground ; it is a shot thrown away . " We watched anxiously the rapid bounds of the graceful little animals which we had just disturbed , as they were fast making their way into the wood . " Is l'Encuerado asleep ? " I cried , with vexation . My question was answered by two shot-reports in succession , and almost immediately Gringalet , l'Encuerado , and Lucien emerged from the forest . After searching about for a few minutes , the boy raised up his arm and showed us two squirrels he was holding . We now hastened our steps ; the Indian had taken possession of the game , and was moving on towards our bivouac , while Lucien ran to meet us . " Papa , papa ! " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killed one of the squirrels . Oh ! M. Sumichrast , you shall see it ; it is gray , with a tail like a plume . " " But was it really you that shot ? " I asked . " Oh yes ! I shot , but l'Encuerado held my gun ; we aimed into the middle of them , for there were a great many . If you could only have seen how they jumped ! The one I hit climbed up on the tree close by ; but it soon fell as dead as a stone . L'Encuerado says that it had n't time to suffer much pain . " The poor child was making his debut as a sportsman , and his heart seemed rather full , although he was very proud of this first proof of his skill . Sumichrast was the first to congratulate him . As for me , although I was well aware of the Indian 's prudence , I made up my mind , if only for the sake of economizing our powder , both to blame him and also to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Come , " said I to Lucien , who was hugging his gun against his chest , " you must be our leader in finding our way back to our encampment . You marked out the road , so mind you do n't mislead us . " Our young guide led us back to our starting-point with far more self-possession than I expected . " A child 's attention is always being drawn away , " observed Sumichrast to me . " How do you explain Lucien 's having followed the trail so readily ? " " Perhaps because it was partly his own work , " I replied . " It is , too , because I am so short , " replied the child , with an arch smile ; " I am much closer to the ground than you are , almost as close as Gringalet , who is so very clever in finding a trail . You see , papa , that it 's some benefit in being little , and that I have some chance of being useful . " I need hardly say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lofty stature . " At this rate , " I replied , " I ought to have brought your brother Emile ; for he is so short that he would have followed a trail even better than you . " " Of course you ought . Do n't you recollect that when we were walking over the mountain of Borrego , he often spied out insects that you had missed seeing ? " I was evidently regularly beaten . We sat down in front of the fire , before which the two squirrels were roasting . L'Encuerado caught in a dish the fat which trickled down from the animals , and every now and then basted the meat with it . The flesh of the squirrel , both in flavor and color , much resembles that of the hare ; so our little mess-mate ate it with evident enjoyment . Dried maize-cakes , called totopo , took the place of bread , and each one had his allowance of it . We could n't help feeling uneasy about Gringalet : we had given him about half a squirrel , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself upon it frantically . The poor beast had consequently only some scraps of totopo . It was , however , highly necessary to accustom him to feed on game , as our maize-cakes were far too valuable to be doled out thus . Each of us poured a little water from his gourd into a calabash , which served for a drinking-vessel . The poor dog , thus allowanced , must have been sorry that he ever joined us . The sun was perceptibly sinking . " Well , Lucien , " asked Sumichrast , " what do you think now of rat 's flesh ? " " I 'll tell you when I have eaten some of it . " " What ! do n't you know that the squirrel and the rat are very near relations , and that they both belong to the Rodent family ? " " They certainly are a little alike , " said the child , making a comical face . " Especially the species which we had for our dinner ; which , by-the-by , is not yet classed by naturalists . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gray on the flanks , and white under the belly . The ears , too , are bare , instead of having those long points of hair which give such a knowing look to the European squirrels . " " Do squirrels feed on flesh ? " " No ; acorns , buds , nuts , grain , and sometimes grasses , constitute their principal food . " " Then , " replied Lucien , triumphantly , " the flesh of the squirrel can not resemble that of the rat , for I know that the rat will eat flesh . " The assured and self-satisfied tone of the little savant made us smile ; but I almost immediately desired him to be silent , for a noise of branches rustling , which had excited our attention , became every moment more distinct . Gringalet was about to bark , but l'Encuerado caught him by the muzzle , and covered him with his sarape . A whole troop of squirrels , no doubt those we had hunted two hours before , made their appearance , uttering sharp cries . They sprang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distance . We noticed them running after one another , sometimes along the top , and sometimes along the bottom of the most flexible boughs . They moved forward as if in jerks , sometimes stopping suddenly and climbing a tree , only to descend it again . When on the ground , they sat up on their hind legs , using their front paws like hands , and rubbed their noses with such a comical air that Lucien could not help speaking loud to express his admiration of them . Hearing so strange a sound as the human voice , the graceful animals took flight , but not quick enough to prevent Sumichrast 's gun from wounding one of them . The squirrel remained at first clinging to the tree on which it was when the shot struck it ; but , after a pause , it relaxed its hold and rolled over and fell to the ground . Nevertheless , it had strength enough left to turn round and bite the sportsman , who carelessly laid hold of him . L'Encuerado skinned it immediately , keeping the meat for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cries of the birds resounded , and night at last shut us in , bringing with it the solemn silence of the wilderness . L'Encuerado struck up a prolonged chant , and Lucien 's fresh young voice blended with that of the hunter . The tune was simple and monotonous in its character ; but there was something touching in hearing the Indian and the child , both equally artless in mind , uniting together to sing the praises of God . The chant was ended by a prayer , which Sumichrast and I listened to , standing up , with our heads bared ; and it was with earnestness that my friend repeated l'Encuerado 's solemn " Amen , " expressed in the words , " God is great . " Illustration Having fed the fire with sufficient wood to keep it up all night , we lay down , side by side , under the hut . The wind moaned softly through the foliage , and , under the influence of the gentle breeze , the pine-trees produced that melancholy sound which so exactly calls to mind the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means of thinking of it , I felt it even in my sleep , for I dreamt that I was at sea , and that the vessel that bore me was sailing over silvery waters . Illustration CHAPTER VI . COFFEE .  --  TURPENTINE .  --  COUROUCOUS.  --  PINE-NEEDLES.  --  THREE VOLCANOES IN SIGHT AT ONCE .  --  THE CARABUS FAMILY .  --  SCORPIONS .  --  SALAMANDERS.  --  A MIDNIGHT DISTURBANCE . The first thing I saw on opening my eyes was l'Encuerado , who was getting ready our coffee , and Lucien crouching close to the fire , piling up a quantity of dry branches round the kettle , at some risk , however , of upsetting it . " Why , Lucien , " I cried , " it is not light yet , and you are up already ! Did n't you sleep well ? " " Oh yes , papa , " he answered , kissing me ; " but l'Encuerado disturbed Gringalet , so he thought proper to come and lie down on me , and that woke me , for Gringalet is very heavy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I got up to look after the fire . " " And you are doing your work capitally . The kettle is singing loudly , and l'Encuerado will find it difficult to take it off without burning his fingers . " But the Indian had provided himself with two green branches , which he used to lift off the make-shift coffee-pot , into which he emptied both the sugar and the coffee . " Where is the filter ? " asked Lucien . " Do you think you are still in the town ? " I replied . " Why do n't you ask for a cup and saucer as well ? " " But we can never drink this black muddy stuff ! " cried Lucien . " Never mind , Chanito , " said the Indian ; " I 'll soon make it all right . " Then , taking his gourd , he poured from it some cold water into the mixture , and it immediately became cleared . I told Lucien to go and wake up Sumichrast . The child approached our companion , who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for coverlet and pillow . " Hallo ! hallo ! M. Sumichrast ; the soup is on the table . " " Soup ! " repeated Sumichrast , rubbing his eyes . " Ah ! you little monkey , you have disturbed me in such a pleasant dream . I fancied that I was no older than you , and that I was once more wandering over the mountains of my native land . " It is considered wholesome to take a cup of Mocha after a hearty meal ; but , with all due deference to Grimod de la Reyniere and Brillat Savarin , coffee seems still sweeter to the taste when taken at five o'clock in the morning , after passing the night in the open air . The day broke ; it was a magnificent sight to see the forest gradually lighted up , and the trunks of the trees gilded by slanting sunbeams . Before starting again , one of our party carefully examined the ground on which we had camped , so as not to forget any of our effects , which , if lost , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's basket was decked with the three squirrels ' skins , which would thus gradually dry . We had walked on for nearly an hour , the only incident being our meeting with various kinds of birds , when the melancholy cry of the couroucou struck on our ears . The call of this bird is very much like that uttered by the Mexican ox-drivers when they herd together the animals under their care ; hence its Spanish name of vaquero . We gave chase to them , and in less than half an hour we had obtained a male and female . Lucien was never tired of admiring these beautiful creatures , with their yellow beaks , hooked like those of birds of prey . The male bird , in particular , was magnificent ; the feathers on the head and back seemed to be " shot " with a golden green , while the edges of the wings and the belly were tinted with the purest crimson , shaded off into two black lines , which extended as far as the tail . " Shall we find many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked Lucien . " No , Master ' Sunbeam ; ' they are rather rare ; so we must take great care of the skins of these we have shot . " " Is their flesh good to eat ? " he asked . " Excellent ; and many a gourmand would be glad to make a meal of it . However , at dinner-time , you shall try for yourself ; and you will meet with very few people who , like you , have partaken of the trogon massena . " " At all events , it is n't another relation of the rat  --  is it ? " asked the boy , archly . " No ; it belongs to the family of climbers  --  that is to say , to that order of birds which have two toes in front of their claws and two behind , like your great friends the parrots . " After we had dressed the skins of the couroucous , and carefully wrapped up the game , we again moved on . The ground became stony , and the descent steeper . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the bottom of the ravine ; but we very soon discovered , to our great disappointment , that we should have to begin climbing again , leaving behind us the oaks and the ceibas , and meeting with nothing but gigantic pine-trees . The pine-needles , H which literally carpeted the ground , made it so slippery , that for every step forward we frequently took two backward . We fell time after time , but our falls were not in the least degree dangerous . Sometimes , as if at a signal , we all four rolled down together , and each laughed at his neighbor 's misfortune , thus cheering one another . Lucien had an idea of hanging on to Gringalet 's tail , who was the only one that could avoid these mishaps . This plan answered very well at first ; but the dog soon after broke away by a sudden jerk , and the boy rolled backward like a ball , losing all the ground he had gained , but he at once got up again , quite in a pet with the dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his treacherous behavior . The troublesome pine-needles obliged us again to resort to the stake and lasso plan ; l'Encuerado , with his load , strove in vain to keep up with us . " Can any one understand the use of these horrible trees ? " grumbled the Indian . " Why ca n't they keep their leaves to themselves ? Why do n't they grow in the plains , instead of making honest folks wear the flesh off their bones in a place which is quite difficult enough to traverse as it is ? " " God makes them grow here , " said the child . " Not at all , Chanito ; God created them , but the devil has sown them on these mountains . I have travelled on the large plateau , where there are whole forests of pines , which proves that it was only for spite that they grow on this ascent . " Fortunately Lucien only half believed what the Indian said , and very soon asked me all about it . " The pines , " I replied , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except in cold climates and dry soils . If l'Encuerado had been acquainted with the history of his ancestors , he would have been able to give you some better information about them ; he would have known that , in the Aztec mythology , they were sacred to the mother of the gods , the goddess Matlacueye , who , curiously enough , fills the part of Cybele among the Greek goddesses , whose favorite tree was also the pine . " Just at this moment we were passing close to a giant of the forest , which had been broken by a squall of wind ; from three or four cracks in its trunk a transparent resin ran trickling out . Lucien , thinking these globules were solid , wished to take hold of one of them ; but his fingers stuck to it . " I fancied , " said he , " that turpentine was obtained by crushing the branches of the pine-tree , just as they crush the stems of the sugar-cane . " " You were wrong , then , " I answered . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , content themselves with cutting down the tree within a foot of the ground ; the resin at once begins to ooze out , and gradually fills the leathern bottles placed to receive it . As soon as the resin ceases to flow , they cut the tree up into fagots for the use of the inhabitants of the towns , or the Indians living on plains , whose poor dwellings often possess no other light than the smoky glimmer from a branch of fir . " I was obliged to cut short my explanations , in order to help Sumichrast and l'Encuerado , who , in spite of the lasso , seemed as if they were trying who could slip fastest . The only way we could get on at all was by describing zigzags , and thus we were two hours in climbing a quarter of a league . At last we arrived on the verge of the forest . The rocky ground seemed quite pleasant to walk upon : we could now advance in a straight line , and were able , with very little trouble , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view was in sight , for we overlooked all the surrounding country . On our left rose the gigantic and majestic peak of Orizava or Citlatepetl  --  that is , the " mountain of the star "  --  which rises to 17,372 feet above the sea-level . Lucien thought that this could not really be the same mountain the summit of which he was in the habit of seeing every morning . " It is quite a different shape , " he said . " It is not the mountain , but the point from which you look at it , that has changed its appearance , " replied Sumichrast . " But it looks much higher , " said Lucien . " That is because we are nearer to it . From here we can discern the beautiful forest which surrounds its base as you ascend , the pines growing farther and farther apart , and gradually disappearing altogether . Higher still may be seen the glaciers glittering in the sun ; and , last of all , the perpetual snow surrounding the crater , which was visited for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frenchman . " " Popocatepetl , Istaccihuatl , " said l'Encuerado gravely , pointing out the mountains . The two mountains mentioned by the Indian were towering up behind us  --  a sight that alone repaid for our difficult ascent ; we could admire in turn the three loftiest volcanoes in Mexico . " Where is Popocatepetl ? " asked Lucien . " There ; that enormous cone which rises to our right , " I answered , pointing in that direction . " Is it the smallest of the three ? " " No ; on the contrary , it does not measure less than 18,000 feet in height . Dias Ordas , one of the captains of Fernando Cortez , made its first ascent . Its name signifies ' smoking mountain . ' " " Yes ; and I know that Istaccihuatl means ' white woman ; ' but I do not know the height of it . " " It is 15,700 feet above the level of the sea . " " How can mountains like these be measured ? " asked Lucien . " In the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the aid of a barometer , when an ascent has been made . The column of mercury in the instrument falls in proportion as the barometer is carried up the mountain , because the air which presses upon the mercury reservoir becomes less and less dense . " I quite forgot the lapse of time while contemplating the glorious panorama spread beneath . Just around us the ground was rocky and volcanic , and covered with mosses of various colors ; rather lower down the ground was hidden by the fallen leaves of giant trees ; beyond was a succession of smaller crests , frequently quite barren , sometimes covered with sun-scorched verdure . On the horizon , which was hidden by a transparent mist , the two volcanoes of the plateau stood out in bold relief against the blue sky , facing the other colossus , which seemed to protect us with its shadow . The peaks of these mountains , clad with their perpetual snow , can be seen by sailors forty leagues at sea . I was really sorry to give the signal for departure . We again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult and slow , our descent was proportionably rapid . Thus we fell forward instead of falling backward . Gringalet , who seemed amused at our ridiculous postures , and was too confident in his own powers , shared our mishaps , much to the amusement of his young master , who had predicted that such would happen . L'Encuerado , utterly tired out , bethought himself of dragging his basket along the ground , which was so thickly covered with leaves that he managed it without damaging his load or breaking the bottles . At last we came upon oak vegetation ; and , still farther down , tropical plants . Various birds enlivened our journey by their song , while numbers of brilliant-colored insects hummed cheerfully round us . In less than an hour we had passed from autumn to spring , after having had a glimpse of winter . The creepers very soon obliged us to cut a passage with our machetes ; but what was our joy upon perceiving , at the bottom of the ravine , a stream bordered with angelica and water-cress ! Thanks to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . While l'Encuerado was getting dinner ready , I went to examine the half-rotten trunk of a tree which was lying on the ground . A multitude of insects , of an elegant shape and of a metallic-blue color , fled at my approach ; they belonged to the numerous Carabus family , the flesh-eating Coleopterae , which are found both in Europe and in America . " Why do n't they fly away , instead of running or tumbling over on the ground ? " asked Lucien . " Because they are but little used to flying , and are very quick at walking , " I answered . " Oh papa ! the one I have caught has wetted my fingers , and it feels as if it had burned me . " " You are right ; but you need n't be afraid ; it will not hurt you . Many of the Carabus family , when they are caught , try to defend themselves by throwing out a corrosive liquid ; others make a report , accompanied by smoke , which has given them their name of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the bark , in which they must lead a very gloomy life ? " " Larvae and caterpillars ; they are , therefore , more useful than injurious . " " To what order of insects do they belong ? " " To the Coleoptera order , because they have four wings , the largest of which , called elytra , are more or less hard , and justify their name I by encasing the two other wings , which are membranous and folded crosswise . The cock-chafer , you know , is one of this order . " A fresh piece of bark revealed to us two scorpions with enormous bellies , and heads so small as to be almost imperceptible ; all they did was to stiffen out their tails , which are composed of six divisions , the last terminating in an extremely slender barb . " Oh , what horrid creatures ! " cried Lucien , starting back ; " if it was n't for their light color , you might take them for prawns with their heads cut off . " " Yes , if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be very surprised when I tell you that they are allied to the spider tribe . " " I should never have suspected it . Are they dead , then , for they do not move ? " " Insects belonging to this order are very slow and lazy in their movements . They are found under most kinds of bark ; therefore I advise you to take care when searching through it . " " Should I die if I were stung ? " " No ; but it would cause a very painful swelling , which it would be best to avoid . " " I shall be afraid to meddle with the bark of trees , now . " " Then good-bye to your making a collection of insects . Prudence is a very good quality , but you must not make it an excuse for cowardice . " Upon examining the insects more closely , I saw that one of the scorpions , a female , was carrying three or four young ones on her back . This sight much amused Lucien , especially when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Do you know , Chanito , " said l'Encuerado , who had now joined us , which showed that the cooking did not require his undivided attention , " that when the mother of the young scorpions does not supply them with food , they set to and devour her . " " Is that true ? " asked Lucien , with surprise . " If the little ones do not actually kill their mother , at all events they feed on her dead body , " I answered . " You will have plenty of opportunities to verify this fact , for these insects are very plentiful in the Terre-Temperee . " " Ah ! " cried Lucien , " I was quite right , then , when I called them horrid creatures . " L'Encuerado , stripping off another piece of bark , exposed to view a salamander , which awkwardly tried to hide itself . " You may catch it if you like ; there is nothing to be afraid of , " said I to Lucien , who had drawn back in fright . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You are too frightened to see clearly ; it is a salamander , an amphibious reptile of the frog family . The scorpion has eight feet , while the salamander , which is much more like a lizard , has only four . " " Are they venomous ? " asked Lucien of the Indian . " No , Chanito ; Indians " ( it was well worth while hearing the contempt with which l'Encuerado pronounced this name ) " are afraid of it ; once I was afraid of it myself , but your papa has taught me to handle it without the least fear . " And the hunter placed the salamander in the boy 's hand , who cried out  --  " It is as cold as ice , and all sticky . " " It must be so , as a matter of course ; the salamander , like a fish , is a cold-blooded animal . The viscous humor which is secreted by the skin of the salamander is able to protect them for a short time from injury by fire , by means of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , can be plunged into melting iron without burning it . J Thus an idea has arisen that these batrachians can exist in the midst of flames . Although these poor animals are deaf , nearly blind , and remarkable for their timidity , poets , much to the amusement of naturalists , have chosen the salamander as an emblem of valor . " Assisted by Sumichrast , I continued the examination of the immense tree , which , being half rotted by the dampness of the soil , supplied us with some very beautiful specimens of various insects . Suddenly we heard Lucien speaking in supplicating tones ; I ran towards him , and found him trying to prevent l'Encuerado , who had got possession of the salamander , from making a trial of its powers of resisting fire . " All right , Chanito ; I will not leave it long on the coals ; your papa said that these animals do not mind it a bit . " Lucien would not consent to this cruel experiment , but carried the animal back to the tree on which we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close when we returned to the fire ; from the stew-pan an appetizing odor was escaping , in which one of the couroucous , with a handful of rice , was boiling , while the other bird was roasting in front . It was really a capital dinner ; first we had some excellent soup , of which Lucien had two platefuls ; then came what was left of our squirrel , and last of all the roasted couroucou , which l'Encuerado served up on a bed of water-cresses . We had an unlimited supply of water ; and , although my readers may smile at what I say , I really believe we drank too much . A cup of coffee crowned our feast , and then the remains were left to Gringalet , who licked every thing clean , even to the very saucepan . Lucien , having finished his meal , lay down by my side , and was not long before he was fast asleep . Illustration A dismal howling from our four-footed companion woke us up with a start . We seized our arms . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between his legs , turned his nose to the wind with an anxious glance , and set up a fresh howl , which was answered by the shrill prolonged cries of the coyotas , or jackal of Mexico . Illustration : " It was really a capital dinner . " " So these miserable brutes think they are going to frighten us ? " cried l'Encuerado . And while we were making up the fire , the Indian rushed off into the darkness . " Are they wolves , M. Sumichrast ? " asked Lucien , anxiously . " Yes , my boy , but only prairie wolves , " he answered . " Do you think that they will first devour l'Encuerado , and then attack us ? " " You need n't be frightened ; courage is not one of their virtues . Unless they were starving , they would n't venture near us . " All at once we heard a shot . The whole forest seemed in movement ; the cries of the birds resounded through the trees , and the echoes repeated the noise of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the harsh cry of the coyotas . At length the silence , which for a short time had been disturbed , was once more restored , and the forest resumed its solemn stillness .

THE CATS ' - EYES POMADE.  --  ARMADILLO.  --  LUCIEN AND THE CRUEL FERN. - THE FALLEN MOUNTAIN .  --  THE WOODPECKER.  --  THE BASILISK.  --  L'ENCUERADO 'S FRESH IDEA . Gringalet , who had been the first to give the alarm , was also the first to go to sleep again . I could not help waiting with some degree of anxiety for l'Encuerado 's return . In a quarter of an hour , as the Indian did not arrive , I began to think that , confused by the darkness , he had missed finding our bivouac . After having called him two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was just going to fire off my gun , so that the noise of the report might serve as a guide to him , when I heard the sound of his guttural cry . " What on earth has possessed you to chase useless game at this hour of the night ? " I cried , as he came into sight . " I felt bound to give these screeching animals a lesson , senor ; if I had n't done so , they would have come back to disturb us every night , " answered the Indian , gravely . " Have you killed any of them ? " " I only managed to wound one . I followed it  --  " " At the risk of falling into some pit . You ca n't see at night  --  at least , as far as I know . " " Not very well ; but that is all your fault , " replied l'Encuerado , in a reproachful tone . " What ! my fault ? " " The brujos ( sorcerers ) have many a time offered me an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they wanted too much for it . You knew much more about it than the sorcerers ; and if you would only have told me the way to make the ointment , and how to use it , I should have been able to see at night , long enough ago , which would be quite as useful to you as to me . " This was an old story , and all that I could have said to the Indian would not have convinced him that I could not make him see in the dark . It was broad daylight when Sumichrast awoke us . The brook , which we could cross at a leap , sometimes rippled over pebbles , and sometimes glided silently over a sandy bottom . The plants which grew on its two banks fraternally intertwined their green branches , and their flowers seemed to exchange their perfumes . From the boughs of the large trees hung gray mosses , which made them look like gigantic old men ; the sun gilded their black trunks with its rising beams , and from the tops of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Our eyes , which had become accustomed to the comparatively barren places we had traversed the day before , dwelt with delight upon this lovely and glorious scene ; our hearts rejoiced in the midst of this calm and luxuriant aspect of nature . It was with feelings of regret we got ready to move on again . " Suppose we were n't to go till the afternoon , " said Sumichrast . " Suppose we do n't go till to-morrow , " I answered . These ideas seemed so thoroughly to respond to the wish of all , that , in a moment , our travelling gear was scattered again on the ground . The first thing we did was to take a bath ; then the thought struck us that we had better wash our clothes . Lucien , helped by l'Encuerado , who had nothing to wash for himself , as he wore his leather garment next to his skin , laughed heartily at seeing us turned into washerwomen ; still he did not do his part of the work at all badly . He then undertook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black , was sadly in want of cleansing . Unfortunately , the dog was hardly out of the water when he began rolling himself in the dust , and , as dirty as ever , came frisking around his disappointed little master . We were roaming about in every direction , in the hope of collecting some insects , when Gringalet pricked up his ears and showed his teeth . The rustling of dry leaves attracted our attention to a slope opposite to us , on which an armadillo was seen . Generally speaking , these animals only go out for food in the night . This one , which we saw in broad daylight , was about the size of a large rabbit . Pricking up its ears , it raised its tapering muzzle so as to snuff closer to the branches . Its head , which was very small , gave it a very grotesque appearance . Suddenly it began scratching up the earth with its front paws , furnished with formidable claws , and now and then poked its pointed nose into the hole it had dug . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towards the animal , when I saw it leave off its work , and , bending down its head uneasily , as quick as lightning it rolled itself up into a ball and glided down the slope . Just at my feet it stopped , and I only had to stoop down in order to pick it up . Gringalet , who then appeared at the top of the slope , was evidently the cause of its sudden flight . I rejoined my companions , carrying my prisoner , who tried neither to defend itself nor to escape . Lucien examined with curiosity the scales which crossed the back of the armadillo , and its pink transparent skin . I told him that this inoffensive animal , which feeds on insects and roots , belonged to the order Edentata  --  mammals in which the system of teeth is incomplete . " But , " said he , " I have seen pictures in which armadillos are represented with armor formed of small squares . " " That is another species , which also lives in Mexico , " replied Sumichrast . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the idea with great vehemence . He wanted either to carry it away alive or to let it go  --  both being plans which could not be allowed . Gringalet , however , cut short the discussion by strangling it , l'Encuerado 's carelessness having left it in his way . The boy , both angry and distressed , was astonished at the cruelty of his dog , and was going to beat him . " He has only yielded to instinct , " said Sumichrast . " A fine instinct , truly , " replied Lucien , in tears , " to kill a poor beast that never did him any harm ! " " He has saved us the trouble of killing it . Men , and all carnivorous animals , can not live except on the condition of sacrificing other creatures . Did n't you shoot a squirrel yesterday ? And you did not refuse your share of those beautiful birds , the plumage of which so delighted you . " " Yes , but I did not strangle the squirrel with my teeth . It 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably ; but it was much the same to the squirrel . However , if there 's another chance , you shall lend your gun to Gringalet . " Lucien smiled through his tears , and his indignation gradually calmed down . Certainly the result is the same , whether you wring a fowl 's neck or shoot it ; yet I could never make up my mind to the former operation . Lucien , who was endowed with almost feminine sensibility , was often angry with l'Encuerado , who could scarcely resist the temptation of firing at any thing alive , useful or not , which came within reach of his gun . We had spoken often enough to the Indian on the subject , but he always asserted that if God had allowed man to kill for the purpose of food , He had also ordered him to destroy hurtful animals , as they were the allies of the demon . Unfortunately , horses and dogs excepted , all animals were hurtful in l'Encuerado 's eyes . Gun on shoulder , we made our way up the bed of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through a thicket of plants . I noticed a fine tree-fern , the leaves of which , not yet developed , assumed the shape of a bishop 's crosier . Lucien remarked this . " You are right , " said I , " it is very curious . Do you know Jussieu divided all vegetables into three great orders  --  Acotyledons , Monocotyledons , and Dicotyledons . Ferns belong to the first ; K they have no visible flowers , and are allied to the sea-weed and mushroom tribe . It is only under the tropics that ferns attain the dimensions of the one you are looking at ; in colder regions their height seldom exceeds a few feet . Ferns formed almost the sole vegetation of the primitive world , and we frequently find evidence of some gigantic species which are now extinct . " Lucien , being desirous to examine the crosier-shaped stalks , allowed us to get in front of him , then crept under the fern . As the leaves of this shrub are furnished underneath with long prickles , when he wanted to rejoin us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worse he became entangled . He cried out to me in a most distressed voice , and not knowing what had happened , I lost no time in going back to him . I found him fighting hard against the thorns which were scratching his face and hands . L'Encuerado and Sumichrast also came to his assistance . I disentangled the boy as quickly as I could ; but already he had several scratches over his face and hands . " How came you not to think , " I said , " that by struggling in this way you would only the more entangle yourself ? " " I saw you all leaving me ; I scarcely knew what held me back , and I got quite frightened ; but I 'm not crying , papa , and yet the fern-prickles scratch terribly . " L'Encuerado turned up his sleeves , and , seizing his machete , rushed at the fern . " Are not you ashamed to attack a child ? " he cried . " It 's all very fine to display your bishop 's crosier and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I know you would n't dare to do it ! Never mind , though ! I 'll punish you for your malice . " The poor plant , alas ! was soon cut down ; thus the growth of years was destroyed in a few minutes . After an hour 's walking , the head of our little column suddenly came in front of a whole mountain-side which had slid from its original position . The sight was a magnificent one ; the accumulation of rocks , piled one on the other , had crushed down in their fall the trees that impeded their course . We saw before us an inextricable pile of trunks , monstrous roots , and masses of rock , suspended and apparently ready to fall . The catastrophe must have recently occurred ; for here and there a branch was still covered with foliage , and the grass had not as yet carpeted the immense gap . Lucien was so astonished at the wild grandeur of the scene that it actually put an end to his chatter . Without speaking , we joined Sumichrast , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been filled up by the avalanche of rocks , we saw certain indications . We could hear the rumbling noise of water flowing beneath us . On our left , at the foot of the mountain , extended a wide basin , which , from its regular outline , might well have been made by the hand of man . Every thing seemed silent and deserted around us , although the bushes that margined the edge of the lagoon must once have sheltered many a guest ; now the imposing grandeur of the scene had awed them , or driven them off . " How could such a great mass as this fall down ? " asked Lucien . " We can only conjecture , " replied Sumichrast ; " perhaps the stream flowing beneath the base of the rocks had excavated fissures , and thus undermined it . " " The noise must have been terrific , " said Lucien . " Doubtless it was , " replied Sumichrast ; " and the shock possibly felt for many leagues round . " " Have you ever seen a mountain fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes ; I did five years ago , when I was in company with your father . A whole forest disappeared before our eyes in a land-slip , which also overwhelmed four or five Indian huts . In a year from the present time , the wilderness of bare rocks that we see before us will be again covered with thick vegetation ; mosses will grow over these gray-colored rocks , and the stream will have renewed its course . If chance should ever lead us again to this spot , the rich foliage and flowers would almost prevent our recognizing the desolation which now impresses us so much . " I crossed the stream , in order to reach our bivouac by the opposite bank to that which we had hitherto followed . Suddenly a noise , like a mallet striking the trunk of a tree , attracted our attention . " You told me just now there was no one but ourselves in the forest , " cried Lucien . " Chut ! " replied l'Encuerado ; " it is nothing but a large woodpecker . " And each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near the winged workman , who so loudly betrayed his presence . Ten minutes elapsed , but all was silent , and the object of our search appeared to have moved off . In fact , we were about to give up the pursuit , when three blows , struck at regular intervals , resounded near us . The Carpintero ( carpenter ) , for such it is called in Mexico , has very brilliant yellow eyes , red feathers upon the head , while the body is dark-colored streaked with white . It climbs easily up the trunks of trees , resting upon its tail-feathers . At length we observed it , and as we looked , admiring its plumage , it again struck three resounding blows , and ran round the tree as if to inspect the other side . " The fool ! " muttered l'Encuerado ; " he thinks he can pierce a tree as thick as my body with three pecks of his beak ! He 'll soon be eaten . " And he fired at the bird and hit it . " I say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big tree ? " " No , my boy ; that is a popular but unfounded idea . The woodpecker strikes the trees in order to frighten the insects that are concealed under the bark ; and the action which l'Encuerado has interpreted in his own way is performed with a view of getting hold of the fugitives . " Sumichrast showed Lucien that the woodpecker , aided by its wedge-shaped beak , could , in case of need , rip up the bark under which its prey was to be found ; that his tongue , covered with spines bending backward , is well adapted to seize the larvae ; and , lastly , that the stiff and elastic feathers of its tail afford it a very useful support in the exercise of its laborious vocation . " You often get the better of me in argument , " said l'Encuerado ; " but it 's no use your saying that woodpeckers do not bore into trees , for I have seen them doing it . " " You are right , up to a certain point , " replied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees , which their beaks can with ease penetrate . As for piercing sound trees , that 's quite another question . " While l'Encuerado was preparing the armadillo and the woodpecker , which we were to have for dinner , we walked down the course of the stream , the agreeable freshness of which was very pleasant to us . All at once Lucien pointed out to me a basilisk sitting on a stone , the rays of the sun setting off its bright shades  --  yellow , green , and red . This member of the Iguana family , which bears no resemblance to the fabulous basilisk of the Greeks , got up at our approach , puffed out its throat , and shook the membranous crest on the top of its head . Its bright eye seemed to scan the horizon ; no doubt it caught sight of us , for its flaccid body stiffened out , and with a rapid bound it sprang into the stream . The reptile raised its chest in swimming , beating the water with its fore paws as if with oars . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great sorrow , for he wanted to obtain a further inspection of it . Illustration : " The dog began to howl desperately . " Gathering round the fire , we arranged our baggage , ready to start the next morning . As there was still another hour 's daylight , Lucien remained with l'Encuerado , and I went with Sumichrast to reconnoitre the route we intended to take . The sun was setting , and we were slowly approaching our bivouac , when Gringalet 's whine met our ears . I hastened forward , for the dog began to howl desperately . I reached the hut quite out of breath . Every thing seemed right , but Lucien and l'Encuerado had disappeared . I looked anxiously into my companion 's face . " No doubt , " said Sumichrast , " l'Encuerado has gone to take a stroll , and left the dog asleep . " I raised a call-cry . What was my surprise at hearing it answered from up above us . My son and the Indian were sitting thirty feet from the ground , hidden in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to address l'Encuerado rather angrily . " Do n't flurry him , " said Sumichrast ; " he 'll need all his presence of mind to get the boy down safely . " With an anxiety which may be easily understood , I watched all the movements of the lad , who was every now and then concealed by the leaves . " Gently , " cried l'Encuerado ; " put your foot there . Well done ! Now lay hold of this branch and slide down . Do n't be afraid ; I 'll not let you go . How pleased and proud your papa will be when he knows how high you have climbed ! " The Indian was wrong ; I was neither pleased nor proud . The trunk of the tree was five or six feet in circumference ; the first branches sprang at a point no less than seven to ten feet from the ground , and I could not make out how the boy managed to reach them . As for l'Encuerado , or rather the ape that went by that name , I knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , confess that I felt all my anger melting away when I saw the skill and coolness of the young acrobat . Certainly , Sumichrast appealed to my own reminiscences , and offered to lay me a wager that I had climbed many a poplar without the advantage of such superintendence as l'Encuerado 's . At last the two gymnasts reached the lowest branches , and I breathed more freely . " Papa , " cried the child , " we climbed right to the top , and there found a nest and a squirrel 's hiding-place . " " Have you suddenly gone mad ? " said I , interrupting him and addressing the Indian . " Mad ! " repeated he , with the most sublime simplicity . " Why ? " " Could n't you have chosen a tree that was not so tall ? " " Do n't you wish Chanito to learn to climb ? At all events , the senora intrusted him to me . " " And so you risk his breaking his bones ? " " I 'm not a child , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a branch . " Enough of these gymnastics ! Come down at once ; although God knows how you are going to manage it . " The words were hardly out of my mouth when Lucien reached the ground , suspended by a lasso which l'Encuerado had tied under his arms . The Indian had pulled him up to the lowest branches in the same way . " You have not acted sensibly , " said I to the Indian ; " we do not begin to learn to ride by mounting a wild horse . Lucien does n't know yet how to climb high trees . " " Lucien can climb as well as I can , " retorted the culprit ; " he has never eaten an orange out of your garden without clambering up to gather it himself . " " That 's something new to me , " said I , looking hard at my son , who blushed . " At any rate , orange-trees are very different in size from cotton-woods , so you risked killing him . " " No ; I kept tight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chanito were likely to come to his death by my fault , I should die first . " " That would n't bring the boy to life again . There will be plenty of dangers in our excursion without seeking them out for mere pleasure . I want to bring you all back safe and sound to Orizava ; therefore , do n't let us have any more of these ascents . " Having uttered this remonstrance , I turned on my heel , for it was no use trying to have the last word with l'Encuerado . I was , however , quite sure that he would not renew the exploit which had displeased me , and that was all I wished . At supper-time , Gringalet did not show any repugnance to the flesh of the armadillo , the taste of which reminded Lucien of sucking-pig . " Are armadillos very scarce ? " he asked ; " they are never sold in the market . " " Just the contrary , " replied Sumichrast ; " they are very common , and the Indians never fail to feast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What does the name armadillo mean ? " " It is a Paraguayan word , the meaning of which is , ' encased in armor . ' The Aztecs call the animal ayotochitl , that is , ' gourd-rabbit '  --  ' rabbit ' on account of its ears , and ' gourd ' because , when it rolls itself up in a ball , it reminds one of that vegetable . " L'Encuerado had gone to sleep . Lucien soon went into the hut , and I noticed that Sumichrast carefully arranged the leaves which were to form our bed , although he himself lay down anywhere . I was much less inclined for sleep than my companions , and contemplated them all reposing ; reflecting on the strange chance which united , under the same shelter , in the midst of the wilderness , persons born of such distinct races and in such different climates . We could all surely depend on one another , for in previous expeditions our mutual friendship had been put to the proof . Seeing how well Lucien bore the fatigue , I rejoiced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good guardians . When I entered the hut to seek repose , I disturbed Gringalet , who , before lying down again by his young master , licked his hand : here was another devoted friend  --  " the dog , which combines all man 's better qualities , " as Charlet observes .

A VULTURE 'S FEAST .  --  DRAGON 'S BLOOD .  --  A CORAL SERPENT .  --  THE OWL .  --  MEXICAN MOLES.  --  TOUCANS.  --  THE SCOLOPACIDAE.  --  L'ENCUERADO TURNED TAILOR .  --  SUNSET . We left our bivouac at daybreak , first ascending and then descending , sometimes making our way through thickets and other times through glades ; suddenly a flock of vultures attracted our attention . A hideous spectacle was now presented to our eyes . A coyote  --  doubtless that which l'Encuerado had wounded the day before  --  lay half devoured on the ground , and more than fifty guests were coming in turn for their share , and to tear , in turn , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creatures ! " cried Lucien . " I ca n't think why the nasty smell does not drive them away . " " It is just the reverse ; it is the smell which attracts them , " I replied . " Even when they are soaring high up in the sky , and scan the horizon with their yellow eyes , their subtle sense of smell enables them to catch the effluvia of the putrefied matter on which they feed . " In some of the towns of Mexico the black vultures are so numerous  --  living there , as they do , almost tame in the streets  --  that our young companion was well acquainted with these birds ; but he had never been present at one of their joint meals . The sight of one of their bare , black , and wrinkled necks , plunged into the body of the animal , made him almost ill . " Poh !  --  what disgusting birds ! " he cried . " You are wrong , " I said ; " the birds are only obeying the instinct implanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ' rapacious order ' or ' birds of prey , ' which is given by naturalists to vultures , eagles , falcons , and owls . You are aware that the science which describes the habits of birds is called ornithology . Cuvier , the great classifier , divides the feathered tribe into six orders  --  birds of prey , passerines , climbers , gallinaceans , wading , and web-footed birds . In order to prevent confusion , the orders have been subdivided into families , the families into groups , the groups into genera , and the genera into species . " " How are they all to be recognized ? " " By the study of certain special characteristics , which serve as distinguishing marks . Birds of prey , for instance , have curved beaks and claws , legs feathered either to the knee or down to the foot , three toes in front , and one behind ; also , the back and inside toe are stronger than the others . The vultures which you are looking at , the only birds of the order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " L Illustration : " A flock of vultures attracted our attention . " " Look ! there are some which keep at a distance . They look as if they were afraid . " " No ; they have gorged themselves , and are now digesting their meal ; unless danger compel them to take flight , they will remain motionless until sunset . " " Will they attack live creatures ? " " Very rarely ; for they are dreadful cowards , and , besides , do not care much for fresh meat . " We had now left far behind us the miserable crew of carrion-eaters , when Lucien suddenly cried out  --  " Oh , papa ! look , there 's a bleeding tree ! " " It is a pterocarpus ; that is , a vegetable with membranes resembling the wing of a bird . The red sap which is trickling down from its bark is called dragon 's blood , thus named by the Greeks , who ascribed to it a fabulous origin . The blood-tree , for so the Indians designate it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gum which exudes from it is a good remedy for dysentery . " L'Encuerado picked off a few dry flakes of this invaluable production ; and then , dipping his finger into some of the drops which were still liquid , he rubbed it all over Gringalet 's legs and paws , who was thus provided with red top-boots . As a matter of fact , this operation must have had a good effect upon the animal ; for this gum , being very rich in tannin , was certain to brace the tissues and muscles ; but the first sensation of it seemed to distress the poor beast , who ran along lifting up his legs in a very comical fashion . " Gringalet walks very much in the same way that l'Encuerado did the time he put on his beautiful blue slippers , " remarked Lucien , in great glee . " You do n't mean to say , " said Sumichrast , " that l'Encuerado ever wore blue slippers ? " " Yes ; the other day there was a dinner-party , and mamma told him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once ran off to buy a pair of pumps he had seen in a shop , and , just at the moment they were all sitting down to dinner , he made his appearance in his new foot-coverings , and  --  a cravat ! " " A cravat ! " repeated Sumichrast , more surprised than ever . " Yes , a real cravat ; but as he had never before worn any thing on his feet but sandals , he lifted them up when he walked just as Gringalet does now . Mamma advised him to put on his sandals again ; but he would not obey her , so he was well punished , for he tripped up and broke a whole pile of plates . It was not until after this misfortune that he could be persuaded to take off his blue pumps ; and even then he could not bear to part with them altogether , so he hung them round his neck , and kept on waiting at table , as proud as possible with his grand decoration . " This adventure was only too true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Why did you hang the shoes round your neck instead of putting them away in a corner ? " asked Sumichrast of the Indian . " I did it to let all the world know that I had bought them , and that they belonged to me , " replied l'Encuerado . Illustration : " Lucien loudly called out to me . " Our encampment was established at the entrance of a fresh glade . L'Encuerado had killed five or six small birds ; we were , therefore , certain of something for dinner . We had scarcely finished our building operations , when Lucien , who had been prowling about , lifting up stones and looking under stubs in order to find insects , loudly called out to me . When I got up to him , I saw at the bottom of a hole a coral-serpent , measuring about a yard in length . The reptile was coiled up , and remained motionless while we admired its beautiful red skin , divided at intervals with rings of shining black . L'Encuerado promptly cut a forked stick and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediately tried to stand up on end ; its jaws distended , and its head assumed a menacing aspect . Gringalet barked at it furiously , without , however , daring to go near . The Indian unsheathed his cutlass  --  the prospect of an unlooked-for addition to dinner quite delighted him . The flesh of the serpent is a well-known Indian dish . Previous to the conquest of Mexico by the Spaniards , the rattlesnake itself found its place at their highest festivals . DioscoridesM prescribed the flesh of the viper as a tonic , and it formed one of the component parts of theriaca , the great panacea of our ancestors , which was one of the principal branches of Venetian commerce . In spite of all these precedents , the dish proposed by l'Encuerado was unanimously rejected . Having cut off the serpent 's head , we all went off to reconnoitre . Going in pursuit of a troop of squirrels , we were led to the edge of the glade without having been able to reach them . A little way in the forest , Sumichrast espied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hollow at the foot of an old tree . We all kept quiet for ten minutes , in order to observe the bird 's way of hunting . At last it suddenly reappeared , and , standing motionless and upright upon its legs at the entrance of its place of refuge , it looked very like a sentinel on duty in his watch-box . Suddenly it started , and slightly bending its body , winked its great yellow eyes several times ; then , skimming over the ground with the swiftness of an arrow , it darted into the high grass . It soon made its appearance again , with its feathers erect and flapping its wings . It held in its mouth a poor little mouse , which it carried off into its subterraneous retreat . It was the species of owl called Athene hypogaea , which is often met with in the savannahs , and hunts in the day-time as well as in the night . " What a comical-looking bird ! " said Lucien ; " and yet I 'm half afraid of its brilliant eyes and hooked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Chanito , " replied l'Encuerado ; " and when he settles near a hut at night , and raises his dismal cry , he predicts the early death of some one of those who hear him . " " That ca n't be , " replied Lucien , " for there was an owl in a hole in our garden wall , and papa would never have it disturbed ; yet the owl made its cry every night . " " Your father knows how to avert the spell . Besides , the bird that lived in the wall was a common owl . " " Both in Europe and America , " interposed Sumichrast , " screech owls , and their kinsmen , the common owls , barn owls , buzzards , and all nocturnal birds of prey , are looked upon by the ignorant as birds of ill omen . Their strange appearance and their mysterious habits give rise to a repugnance which often changes into fear . It is quite wrong to have any dread of them ; as a matter of fact , the bird you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more useful than injurious to man , for it destroys a vast number of small mammals  --  jerboas , shrew-mice , dormice , and field-mice , which ravage the farmer 's crops . You will recollect that the owl , among the ancient Greeks , was the bird of Minerva ; with the Aztecs it represents the goddess of evil . " A little way from the spot where we lost sight of the mouse-eater , there were some enormous holes dug out by the tuzas , N the Mexican moles , so dreaded by agriculturists . This animal is about the size of a kitten ; it lives in companies , and works underneath the surface of the soil in a way very dangerous to travellers , who suddenly find the ground sink under their feet . L'Encuerado , who was very fond of the flesh of the tuza , which used to be sold in the Indian markets , placed himself in ambush in the hopes of killing one . Five minutes had scarcely elapsed when we heard a gunshot , and the hunter made his appearance with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short feet , ears and eyes almost imperceptible , a mouth furnished with formidable incisors , and on each side of its jaws a vast pouch filled with earth . Lucien declared that he would never consent to eat of this creature , and promised his share to l'Encuerado . Our attention was again attracted towards the forest by the cries of five or six toucans , and again we set off in chase . These birds are extremely suspicious , and their capricious flight almost baffles pursuit . I succeeded , however , in killing one ; the others flew off , raising cries of anger . " How can they bear the weight of such an enormous beak ? " asked Lucien , who had run to pick up the bird , and was struck with admiration at its beautiful green and yellow plumage . " Nature has made provision for that : the enormous beak , which seems so heavy , is composed of a very light porous substance . " " Then it can not eat any thing hard ? " " No ; its flexible beak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on nothing but soft fruits ; and even these it breaks up awkwardly . If we could have got near them , you would have seen them plucking berries and tossing them in the air , so as to catch them in their immense jaws . " " What good is its great mouth ? " " I ca n't say ; for the naturalists , who have been as much puzzled as you are by this peculiarity , have been unable to explain it . " " Then I am more learned than they are , " said l'Encuerado , with a magisterial air . " Do you know , then , why toucans have such exaggerated beaks ? " " Because they have been made by a wise Creator , " replied the Indian . " No doubt about that , " remarked Sumichrast , smiling ; " but the point is , why they were made so . " " Because their beak , calcined and reduced to powder , is the only efficacious remedy for epilepsy . Toucans are very scarce birds , and if their beaks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ size , this medicine could never be obtained in sufficient quantities . " L'Encuerado 's explanation was perhaps as good as our uncertainty . I remember that the Indians do , in fact , make a great mystery of a powder against epilepsy , and that a toucan 's head may often be noticed hanging up to the wall of a hut , as a preservative against St. Vitus ' dance . Instead of resting , Lucien prowled about in every direction , breaking away bark , and lifting stones with all the ardor of a neophyte in entomology . Since meeting with the coral-serpent , he took precautions which gave me confidence ; for it is quite uncertain how a reptile or any other creature may behave when it is disturbed . The child suddenly called out to me ; he had just discovered a nest of scolopendrae , commonly called centipedes , and he was afraid to touch them . The centipedes , surprised at being disturbed , rolled themselves up ; their pale blue color somewhat diminishing the repugnance which their appearance generally excites . It was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ventured to place one on the palm of his hand ; the insect gradually unrolled its articulations , each of which was provided with two pairs of feet ending in hooks , but its walk was so slow as rather to disappoint the young observer . " What is the use of having forty-four feet , " he cried , " if the centipede can not get on faster than a carabus , which only has six ? " L'Encuerado could alone explain this mystery ; but still he kept silence . " Are these creatures poisonous , M. Sumichrast ? " " It is said so ; but some species  --  that , for instance , which you are examining  --  may be handled without danger . " " Here is a little centipede with only twelve legs . " " It has only just come out of the egg ; their rings increase in number as they grow older , and this is one of their peculiarities . " " How hard the rings , are ! they are almost like armor . " " It is armor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so to speak , separating insects from crustaceans ; centipedes are not very distant relations of lobsters . " " Look , papa ! I have just found a chocolate-colored worm , which looks like a centipede . " " That 's not a worm ; it is an iulus , first cousin to the centipede . Do n't take it up in your hand , for it will impregnate your fingers with a sickening odor . " We resumed our progress towards our encampment , Lucien and l'Encuerado preceding us . The weather was warm without being suffocating ; the slanting rays of the sun were moderated by the foliage , the birds were singing , and to-day , like yesterday , seemed as if it would be one of the least fatiguing in our journey . We were now in the midst of the Terre-Temperee , and were surrounded by white and black oaks . Ceibas , elm , cedars , and lignum-vitae trees only grew here and there ; and the mosquitoes , so plentiful in the Terre-Chaude , did not trouble us here . The timber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; we were in a virgin-forest , but were still too high up above the plains to have to struggle against the inextricable net-work of tropical creepers . The tuza made its appearance at our dinner , dressed with rice . Although the appearance of this animal is repulsive , its flesh has an exquisite flavor . I offered a piece of the thigh to Lucien ; he found it so nice , that he soon held out his plate  --  or rather his calabash  --  for more . Sumichrast told him he was eating some of the mole , though not aware of it : he appeared confused at first , but soon boldly began on his second helping . After the meal , l'Encuerado took from an aloe-fibre bag a needle and bodkin , and set to work to mend Lucien 's breeches , torn a day or two before . Two squirrels ' skins were scarcely sufficient for the would-be tailor , who lined the knees also with this improvised cloth . Lucien was delighted at this patching , and wanted to try on his mended garment at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in every posture , quite fascinated with the rustling noise produced by the dry skins . Gringalet , who had been asleep , suddenly came up to his young master with visible surprise . With his neck stretched out , his eyes glittering , and his ears drooping , ready to retreat in case of need , the dog ventured to take a sniff at l'Encuerado 's work , then shook his head energetically and sneezed . After repeating this operation two or three times he seemed to be lost in thought . " He knows all about it , and can see at once that it is not badly sewn , " said l'Encuerado , with evident satisfaction . But all of a sudden , after a final and more conscientious examination , the animal began barking furiously , and seizing hold of the patches that had been so industriously sewn in , he tried to tear them away . " The simpleton fancies the squirrel is still alive ! " cried the Indian . Although driven away at least twenty times , Gringalet kept on returning to the attack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a fresh rent was made . Then l'Encuerado became angry , and the dog having been punished , went and crouched down by the fire ; but he still continued to show his teeth at the strange lining which seemed so offensive to him . The sun was setting ; its golden rays , quivering among the branches , appeared one by one to get higher and higher until gloom began gradually to pervade the forest . We were assembled around our bivouac , when a rosy tint suddenly illumined the tops of the trees and penetrated through the foliage . As this marvellous effect of light appeared to last a considerable time , we again went into the open glade , so as to be better able to observe it . The sky appeared as if it was all in a blaze ; vast glittering jets of light seemed as if darting from the setting sun ; a few clouds , tinted with bright red color , flitted across the heavens . The bright gleam became more and more vivid , but without at all dazzling our eyes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the falcons , who were making their way to their aeries , stopped for a moment their rapid flight , and whirled round and round in space with an undecided air . " The wind will blow tremendously to-morrow , " said l'Encuerado ; " only once before did I ever see the sky lighted up as it is to-night , and then two days after there was a frightful hurricane , which demolished most of the huts in our village . " " I think we shall get off with nothing but a south wind like that which worried us the day we set off , " said Sumichrast . Wrongly or rightly , I attributed this phenomenon of light to the position of the clouds . The intensity of the light decreased till it was nothing but a glimmer . Night resumed its empire , and there was naught to guide us back to our bivouac but the flame of our fire . Illustration FOOTNOTES : L From the Greek Greek : kathartes , " that which purifies .

About three o'clock in the morning we were awakened by a hoarse roaring ; the trees seemed to shiver ; sometimes the uproar appeared to grow less and almost to cease , and then broke out again louder than ever . I hastened to warm some coffee ; but two or three times the intermittent squalls scattered the burning fagots of our fire , and the hot ashes nearly blinded us . This mishap was owing to the open glade being so near to us , across which the wind rushed furious and unrestrained . Almost before daylight appeared , I led my companions farther under the trees , the state of the atmosphere making me feel very uncomfortable . The lofty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon us a perfect hail of twigs and dead leaves . We were almost deafened by the noise of the clashing boughs ; sad and silent we proceeded on our way , perceiving no signs of any living creature , and in much trouble how we should obtain our dinners . Towards mid-day , the wind fell ; puffs of heat , which seemed to spring from the ground beneath , almost suffocated us . Lucien did not say a word , but , in spite of my advice , he was constantly lifting his gourd to his lips , a proceeding which could only excite his thirst . Gringalet , instead of frolicking about , as was his custom , followed us closely , drooping his ears and tail . We were , I believe , the only living beings moving under the shade , which now seemed converted into a hot furnace . Meeting with some rocks , we made up our minds to hurry on , thinking to come upon a stream ; a vain hope !  --  the rocks soon came to an end , and were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had only been a little grass , we should have set to work to construct our hut ; for the dry heat , blown up by the south wind , rendered exertion almost unbearable . A second time we found ourselves among rocks ; but they were so enormous , and so close together , that it was evident we were in the vicinity of a mountain . " Hiou ! hiou ! Chanito , " cried the Indian , joyously ; " forward ! forward ! we are very nearly at the end of our troubles . " The boy smiled and adopted the swift pace of his guide , while Sumichrast lengthened his strides so as to get in front of me . Following my companions , we soon came upon a dry , barren spot in front of a steep ascent . After we had all taken breath , I gave it as my opinion that we should overcome our fatigue and scale the side of the mountain ; but no one showed any inclination to move . My poor Lucien lay panting on the hard stones , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his face purple with the heat ; he had thought the day 's work was over . Nevertheless , as soon as he saw us starting again , up he got and followed us without a word of complaint . I wished to lighten his burden ; but he heroically refused , and proportioned his pace to that of l'Encuerado . Gringalet was continually sitting down , and hanging out his tongue to a most enormous length ; it was , doubtless , his way of testifying that he moved an amendment against the length of the journey . " We were quite wrong in finding fault with the shade , " said Sumichrast ; " for in this unsheltered spot the heat is more insupportable than under the trees . The sun seems to dart into us as if its rays were needles ' points . " " Do n't drink , Chanito ! do n't drink ! " cried l'Encuerado to Lucien . The poor little fellow replaced the gourd at his side , and bent on me such a heart-rending look that I caught him up in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said my friend , who was sheltering himself under a gigantic rock ; " I confess that I am dead-beat . " It was a great relief when we were seated down and deprived of our burdens ; but , instead of setting to work , according to our usual custom , to collect wood for our fire and to construct our hut , we remained idle , looking at the horizon , without exchanging a single word . At our feet extended , as far as we could see , the tree-tops of an immense forest . We had turned our backs upon the volcano of Orizava ; on our right the black summits of the Cordillera stood out against the red sky ; the urubu vultures were whirling round and round high up above us  --  the only living creatures we had set eyes on since the evening before . It was now four o'clock ; a kind of hot blast beat into our faces , producing the same sensation as that experienced in front of a furnace when the door is suddenly opened . The south wind sprung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undulating like a liquid surface . I in vain endeavored to overcome the state of nervous prostration which had come over me ; the terrible wind which parched and burned us took away all power of will . Our eyes were inflamed , our lips cracked , and our heads heavy , and no one cared about eating ; all we longed for was water , and we were obliged to watch Lucien , to prevent him emptying his gourd . He was nibbling a morsel of totopo , which he , like us , could hardly swallow . Sheltered behind the rock , we contemplated with dread the colossal trees round us , which swayed and bent , sprinkling the ground with their scattered boughs . The sun set , pale and rayless , as if drowned in the ill-omened yellow clouds . The wind kept puffing and blowing at intervals . A few minutes ' lull enabled us to collect a little grass , and then , seated side by side , we watched the approach of night , dark , desolate , and starless ; but the comparative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhausted lungs . Lucien went off to sleep ; Sumichrast and l'Encuerado tried to follow his example ; Gringalet seemed afraid to go far away , and crouched down at our feet . Ere long , I was the only one of the party who was awake . What an awful night ! About nine o'clock the squalls ran riot with unexampled violence ; if it had not been for our shelter behind the rock , we should surely have been swept away . From the forest beneath came a roar like that of waves beating against a cliff ; branches broke off with an uproar sounding like a series of gun-shots , and the leaves , driven by the wind , covered us with their debris . Every now and then an inexplicable and increasing hoarse rumbling filled my mind with anxiety . I listened , holding my breath with fear ; the rumbling seemed to approach , as if bringing with it new and unknown perils . Then suddenly , prevailing over the tumult , a formidable crash made itself heard , followed by a shock prolonged by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , vanquished by the hurricane . Sometimes one might have fancied that a multitude of men were fighting together in the darkness that no eye could pierce ; there were plainly to be recognized the wild cries of the conflict and the plaintive moans of the wounded ; and then , again , a fresh shock shook the earth , and deadened the outburst of the mighty lament . I must confess that at this moment I bitterly regretted having brought Lucien ; I remembered that my friends had predicted to me all the perils which now threatened us . While listening to the uproar of the tempest , I felt my resolution give way , and I had serious thoughts of returning to Orizava the next day . Towards midnight the storm abated a little , and , giving way to fatigue , I fell asleep . I had only just closed my eyes when I suddenly jumped up again , deafened as if by a hundred claps of thunder joined in one . The darkness was as thick as ever , and the wind was still more boisterous ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before another colossus groaned and fell . My companions were now all awake . " What 's the matter , M. Sumichrast ? " asked Lucien , in a low tone . " It is a hurricane , my boy . " " One might fancy that a giant was passing through the wood , shouting and whistling , and breaking down all the trees as he went along . " " I wish that was all , " replied Sumichrast ; " but it 's something much worse ; it is the south wind , the sirocco of the Mexican coast . " " Will it sweep us away , M. Sumichrast ? " " I hope not ; thanks to the rock which shields us . " A tree now fell close to us , and covered us with dust . Clinging tightly to one another , every moment brought with it a fresh anxiety . We dared not speak of our feelings , for fear of frightening our young companion , who pressed close up to me . Amidst the universal destruction going on , it only needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for us to be swept away like chaff before the wind . I had witnessed many a hurricane , but this fearful night exceeded all . At last daylight appeared ; the sun rose gloomily , and exposed the disasters of the terrible night . On every side trees , broken and uprooted , lay prostrate on the ground , or , half suspended by the creepers entangled in their branches , were balanced like the formidable battering-rams of the ancients . Lucien was speechless at the sight before his eyes . A sudden cracking noise was heard , and another forest giant slowly bent over , and , describing a rapid curve , crushed its branches against the ground ; ten seconds destroyed the work of centuries . L'Encuerado attempted to go two or three yards beyond our rock ; but , surprised by a sudden gust , he had but just time to throw himself prostrate on the ground to prevent being swept away . Something , however , had to be done ; it was no use trying to light a fire , and yet , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great need of some comforting beverage . The squalls gradually abated , but were still every now and then violent . Intervals of profound silence succeeded to the uproar of the storm , when the leaves were motionless ; then we might have fancied the tempest was over . But suddenly the frightful roar again commenced , and the gale covered the ground with fresh fragments . We were beginning to take courage a little , when a formidable crash resounded above us ; an enormous pine , growing on the mountain a hundred feet over our heads , tottered and then fell , tumbling down the slope with a horrible uproar . Quick as lightning , l'Encuerado seized Lucien , and lay down with him along the foot of the rock ; I and my friend immediately followed his example . The fallen giant came crashing down in rapid bounds , smashing every thing in its path , and accompanied in its descent by masses of broken rock . It struck against the block that sheltered us , which gave forth a dull sound , but fortunately resisted the shock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a prodigious bound , continued its impetuous course down to the foot of the mountain . We were nearly crushed by a perfect avalanche of stones which followed in its wake . I raised myself , not without emotion . The danger had been serious ; indeed , the enormous rock to which we owed our safety had slightly swerved . If this accident had occurred in the middle of the night , the fright would have driven us out of our place of shelter , and we should certainly have been destroyed . I first returned thanks to God , and then to l'Encuerado , who , being close to Lucien , had shielded the boy with his own body . The child , who fully comprehended the danger , hung round the Indian 's neck . " I shall tell mamma that you saved my life ! " cried he , kissing l'Encuerado . The latter would have replied , but , affected by the caresses of his young favorite , he could only press him in his arms , while two tears trickled down his dark cheeks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take so much trouble to show us his power , " exclaimed the Indian , addressing the wind , in order to hide his emotion ; " a grand miracle , indeed ! to uproot a pine that was going to die of old age , and to roll it down a mountain-side ! Why , I could do the same if I chose , with the help of my machete . Oh yes ! blow away ! and knock down another tree on us , and then you 'll thoroughly convince us that the devil is your patron ! " In spite of the serious nature of the occurrence , Gringalet was the only one among us who could hear this speech without a smile ; and even the dog rubbed up against the orator 's legs , as if to show his approval of all he had said . The hurricane now subsided ; but it was likely enough to redouble its intensity at night , and reason dictated that we should take advantage of the calm for moving onward . L'Encuerado resumed his load , and with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I took Lucien by the hand ; for there was a danger that some tree which had been shaken by the storm might suddenly fall across our path . The heat , which continued to inconvenience us , rendered walking a very laborious effort . The lips of our young companion were all cracked , and he spoke with difficulty . We suffered dreadfully from thirst ; but it was necessary to bear it patiently , and to be very saving with the small stock of water which still remained in our gourds . Soon we came upon the spot where , an hour before , the tree had stood , the fall of which had so nearly crushed us . A widely gaping hole exposed to our view the broken roots of the colossus , and the earth round them was already dry . We pushed on with much difficulty , exhausted , out of breath , and half famished ; for , since the night before , we had eaten nothing but some morsels of maize-cake . Moreover , our eyes were so red and swollen that we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so tired ! " said Lucien to me . " So we all are , my poor boy ; but we must pluck up our spirits again , and keep on walking , for our lives depend on it . " " Father , I am so thirsty ! and the water left in my gourd is quite warm . " " It will be better for you not to drink ; for a few draughts of water taken when walking increase perspiration , and make the thirst worse , instead of quenching it . " The poor little fellow heaved a sigh , and crept closer to my friend , who advised him to place in his mouth a small pebble , which alleviates thirst by exciting salivation . In spite of all our exertions , we made little or no advance , and a profuse perspiration added to our exhaustion . Fortunately , every thing seemed to indicate that the tempest was over . L'Encuerado led the way ; his manner appeared as if searching for something . At length I saw him throw down his load and plunge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands full of a kind of mulberry , the fruit of the sarsaparilla , the acid flavor of which much revived Lucien . We now understood l'Encuerado 's peculiar way of walking . He fancied he had noticed a young shoot of this plant , and at first concealed the discovery from us , fearing some deception . I can hardly describe the pleasure that was afforded us by obtaining these berries in such a welcome time . This shrub , with its vine-like and thorny stalk , abounded on the steep slope . We resumed our march in much better spirits , thanks to this God-send . L'Encuerado filled his cap with them , and walked on bravely , with his head bare . Another half-hour 's climbing brought us to the verge of the forest . Suddenly I lost sight of Gringalet . I called him several times , and at last he emerged from a clump of shrubs , with his tail and muzzle wet . Sumichrast rushed in search of the water , and soon cried out to us in a joyous voice  --  " A spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get to it first . Under the foliage of sarsaparilla our companion was kneeling down and catching in his hands a little streamlet of limpid water , which was trickling from between two rocks . With keen enjoyment , he was sprinkling it over his face and arms , an example each of us soon imitated . At last I hurried our party away , for the horrible roaring of the hurricane still seemed to din in my ears , and as yet we had no shelter within our reach . After having filled our gourds , we recommenced our climbing , enlivened by l'Encuerado , who kept on congratulating Gringalet upon his discovery , and promising him , as his reward , a whole series of good dinners . Illustration The hour was now approaching at which we feared that the hurricane would recommence with redoubled violence ; so it became highly necessary to select a spot for our bivouac . Moss and lichens here covered the rocks with a variegated carpet , and , in proportion as we ascended the mountain , the cooler air relieved our lungs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we found ourselves on a plateau dotted over with stunted shrubs , distorted and twisted with the winds and storms . Fresh summits rose in front of us , but they were too far off to cause us any fear . Sumichrast halted near three gigantic stones , placed so as to leave a space between them , in which we could encamp , as if in a fortress . Illustration : " Sumichrast halted near three gigantic stones . " This spot we selected for our bivouac . The wind still blew in squalls , but the increased clearing of the atmosphere gave us reason to hope that we should have nothing more to fear from the hurricane . We all went in search of firewood , and ere long after were enlivened by the gleam of an immense fire . At sunset , the glittering beams of the sun 's very last rays reached our camp . The sky was blue , and the air was fresh , so I abandoned the idea of returning home . Night came on , a fine rain purified the air , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by fatigue , we wrapped ourselves up in our sarapes , and soon fell into a sound sleep . Illustration Illustration CHAPTER X. THE RABBIT .  --  WILD POTATOES .  --  A DIFFICULT PATH .  --  AN EXTINCT CRATER.  --  HOAR-FROST.  --  THE TORRENT .  --  THE FAWN .  --  THE TETTIGONES.  --  THE DRAGON-FLIES . The next day , when I opened my eyes , the sun was shining brightly in a blue sky . I made up the fire , and walked off , with my gun on my shoulder , to try and obtain some kind of game , so as to surprise my companions when they got up . For about a quarter of an hour I traversed tracts of heath which reminded me of my native country , when a too confiding rabbit came frisking along within gunshot , which I knocked over and placed in my game-bag . On my return all were up , standing round the fire , and they hailed me as a conqueror . The terrible trials of the day before seemed to be entirely forgotten ; even Lucien had recovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an incredible short space of time had it skinned , and placed to broil on the burning coals . " Well ! what do you think of hurricanes ? " asked Sumichrast of Lucien , who was watching him cleaning his gun . " They are most awful ! I should never have thought that the wind , which is invisible , could have blown down and broken up trees as big as that one which almost fell upon us . " " Were you much frightened ? " " Rather ; and so were you , for you were quite pale . " " The danger was much greater than you imagined . If the uprooted tree had pitched on our rock , it would have upset it , and crushed us beneath . " " Then the wind must be much stronger in forests than in towns ? " " No ; for the hurricane of yesterday probably destroyed entire villages . It was one of those tropical storms which happily only break out at long intervals . Many an Indian is at this moment rebuilding his destroyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sat down at the foot of a tree . When I passed near him , I saw he had tears in his eyes . " What 's the matter ? " I asked . " I was thinking of mamma and my brothers . M. Sumichrast told me that the tempest must have demolished whole villages ; so perhaps our home has met with some misfortune . " " Do n't be frightened , my dear boy ! Thank God ! stone walls can generally stand against wind . Besides , this hurricane can hardly have been felt at Orizava . At all events , your mamma has more reason to be anxious about us , for she knows that we are far from shelter  --  exposed to all its violence . " I kissed poor Lucien , and comforted him as well as I could , assisted by l'Encuerado , who soon afterwards took him off to look after our roast rabbit . The tochtli , or Mexican rabbit , is different from the European species , although it has the same colored coat and instincts . In fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family of the animal we are going to have for breakfast ? " asked Sumichrast . " Yes ; it is a Rodent . " " Well done ; but how did you recognize it to be so ? " " By the absence of canine teeth in its jaws , its large incisors , and its hind legs being longer than its fore legs . " " Come , your memory is good . You should also know that , in Europe , the rabbit , which is nearly allied to the hare , is thought to be a native of Africa . Formerly , the Aztecs used to sacrifice hundreds of these animals to the goddess Centeutl , who is the Ceres of Mexican mythology ; and the nobles used to wear cloaks made of the hair of the hare , mixed with cotton . With regard to the larger hare , known farther north as the Jackass rabbit , the Indians generally refuse to eat its flesh , under the pretense that it feeds on dead bodies , a mistake which as yet they have not been persuaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like guests who have to make up for a forced fast . The meal finished , without further delay our little coterie moved on again . Instead of the abundant and bushy thickets of sarsaparilla , we met with nothing but stunted shrubs . However , as we approached the mountain the vegetation assumed a richer aspect , and the bare rocks no longer protruded through the soil . Here and there , tanagers , with black backs , yellow breasts , and violet-blue throats , fluttered around us ; also other variegated birds of the Passerine family . We were just about to begin climbing the slope , when l'Encuerado , whose piercing eyes seemed to see every thing , exclaimed : Illustration : " A labyrinth of rocks brought us out in front of a stony rampart , more than a hundred feet in height . " " There are some potatoes ! " Lucien ran towards the Indian , who , with his machete , had already cleared away the earth round a small plant with oval-shaped leaves , covered with soft greenish berries . Some wrinkled tubercles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between our fingers . This is the origin of the valuable plant for which Europe is indebted to America . After climbing some time , we came upon a mass of rocks all heaped up in a perfect chaos . Some obstacle or other incessantly obliged us either to jump over or make a circuit so as to get forward . The temperature , however , was refreshing , and rendered our exertions less fatiguing . The chances of our journey brought us out once more upon the plateau . All the mountain crests we could see were barren , and a profound silence reigned on every side . We stopped to take breath , and the sight that met our eyes impressed us with its stern grandeur . It reminded Sumichrast of the Swiss mountains which he had so often traversed ; and some flowers he gathered further recalled his home . While thus occupied , two butterflies fluttered over our heads . " It is an Alpine species ! " eagerly cried my friend . The locality prevented him from following these capricious insects for any distance : for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with rocks , and followed , with a longing eye , the two winged flowers which had recalled to him a fleeting image of his fatherland . A labyrinth of rocks brought us out in front of a stony rampart more than a hundred feet in height , and almost perpendicular . This unexpected obstacle brought us to a halt . How should we make our way over it ? Upon examining the spot , we decided to incline towards the left , which seemed to us the most accessible road . In parts the wall diminished in height , but we tried in vain to climb it . A more successful attempt , however , brought us nearly to the top , but not without great fatigue , for sometimes the rock appeared to hang over us . At length , by climbing on to Sumichrast 's shoulders , I managed to reach the flat surface above . I hoisted up Lucien here with the lasso ; next I drew up Gringalet , who was only too pleased to submit to the operation , and lastly Sumichrast and l'Encuerado . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ground was , comparatively speaking , level , but covered with stones of a volcanic nature . We still kept on our way , although it was four o'clock , in the hope of finding some tree at the foot of which we could make our bivouac . L'Encuerado put down his load to climb up a needle-shaped rock , the extraordinary position of which reminded us of the celebrated leaning tower of Pisa . When he had reached its top , the Indian called out to us that he could see a clump of trees . The cold began to inconvenience us and we wanted wood to make our fire , so , plucking up fresh courage , we continued our journey . The distance now traversed was inconsiderable ; but the ups and downs and circuits had quite wearied us . Gradually the rocks decreased in size , and were more widely spread ; a plain slightly depressed in the centre , dotted here and there with thinly growing thickets , was reached . In the background there was a clump of firs and a glittering lake , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Sunset surprised us ere we had finished our labor . " It now became highly necessary for us to seek shelter , for our teeth were chattering with the cold . L'Encuerado , having climbed a tree , cut down the wood that was necessary for the construction of a hut ; while Lucien broke all the dry branches off , a task in which I helped him . Sunset surprised us ere we had finished our labor . The waters of the lake assumed a dark hue , and the mountain peaks towards the setting sun furrowed the sky with their strangely irregular outlines , and the breeze resounding through the pine-trees produced a solemn and grave chant , a peculiarity which has doubtless given to this species of tree the name of Pinus religiosus . As the rays of the sun died away and the dark shadows covered the sky , the silence became still more profound . Suddenly the last rays of the luminary vanished ; the gathering darkness imbued us with an emotion which those only can understand who , like us , had found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Creator 's hands . Lucien , too , was subject to the influence of the twofold majesty of darkness and solitude ; he was speechless , and looked by turns both at the earth and the sky . The stars appeared glittering in the blue heaven , and were reflected on the motionless surface of the neighboring water . Suddenly a luminous ray seemed to dance over the lake , and then to divide into a shower of sparks . It was the reflection of our fire , to which l'Encuerado had just set a light . The piercing cold was excessively trying : our sarapes did not seem sufficient to protect us from its influence . Fortunately we had obtained fuel enough to keep up the bivouac fire all night . Our meal , although without meat , was a cheerful one . Each in turn retired to his pine-leaf couch ; and soon I alone remained up , not feeling an inclination for slumber . What a contrast it was ! The night before , at this time , we were deafened by the uproarious wind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we , perfectly helpless , sheltered behind a trembling stone , could scarcely breathe the burning air . Twenty-four hours had hardly elapsed , and a few miles had brought us on to a granite soil where we felt even unpleasantly cold ; it was no longer the uproar , but the silence , which awoke in my mind the reveries of loneliness . We rose before dawn , perfectly benumbed and hardly able to move our lips . L'Encuerado stirred up the fire so as to get the coffee ready . The first ray of light showed the ground covered with a white shroud of bright hoar-frost . Lucien had never seen this phenomenon before , and was never tired of admiring it . Sumichrast explained to him that the drops of dew , which every morning may be seen glittering on the grass in hot countries , freeze in situations of great altitude , and produce those beautiful transparent globules which , owing to the refraction of light , assume so beauteous an appearance . The rays of the sun warmed us but little , so I hastened our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lake , we once more found ourselves among rocks . The summit which we had traversed was doubtless the crater of some extinct volcano . I took a farewell look at the gigantic semicircle , edged with mountain crests , ere commencing a journey quite as difficult as that of the day before , through the immense stones which had been vomited forth by the burning mountain . More than once we got into a cul-de-sac , and we sat down utterly discouraged . For the last time I examined the horizon . We were now standing on the highest summit of the Cordillera ; opposite us , as far as we could see , rose verdure-clad peaks , which gradually diminished in height . We were again about to meet with tropical vegetation , and should ere long reach the plains and forests of the Terre-Chaude . The way seemed direct and easy ; but how many obstacles must be overcome , how many valleys must be crossed , ere we could reach our destination ! We descended the slope by a giant staircase , each step of which must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . More than once the lasso was called into use ; but all obstacles were at last safely overcome . I can not describe the joy I felt upon once more seeing pine-trees . We sought in vain for any traces of the hurricane ; this side of the mountain had evidently not been visited by it . The slope was now more gradual ; our pace became faster , and a few oaks were in sight . A rumbling noise made us stop and listen attentively , but l'Encuerado , who was more expert than we were in making out distant sounds , told us that it was a torrent . Squirrels gambolled on the branches as we passed by , and toucans seemed to tempt us to stop ; but we were all anxious to reach the waterfall . Ere long , oaks and birches , and afterwards guava-trees , surrounded us on every side . The ground was now level , and in less than half an hour l'Encuerado conducted us to the edge of an immense ravine , at the bottom of which there was a roaring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became less abrupt , and we established our bivouac . While we were cutting down some branches , Sumichrast put his finger to his lips and seized his gun . A slight noise was heard in the thickets , and our companion disappeared . We were listening , holding our breath , when we heard the screech as of an owl ; we knew it was a call , so l'Encuerado also glided away through the bushes . " Why did M. Sumichrast call l'Encuerado ? " asked Lucien , in a low voice . " Probably because he has discovered the trail of some animal . " I had scarcely finished speaking , when a movement in the leaves attracted my attention . A fine fox , with an eager look , and its tail lowered , rushed past me . I fired , but without effect , for it bolted off among the trees , followed by Gringalet . Almost at the same moment , a report told me that l'Encuerado had also seen game . Lucien was very sorry that I had missed the fox ; I only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having awkwardly put to flight the quarry which was probably being pursued by my companions . I then continued my work of cutting off the branches , and told Lucien to strike the flint and light the fire . Thanks to l'Encuerado 's lessons , he managed his work much better than I had expected . We heard Sumichrast give a call , to which Lucien answered , and the disappointed hunter joined us . " What did you fire at ? " he inquired of me . " At a fox , which I missed ; were you chasing it ? " " No ; I caught sight of a doe and its fawn , but I could not get near them . " " And where is l'Encuerado ? " " He wanted to shoot some bird , so as not to come back quite empty-handed . " " Chanito ! Hiou ! Hiou ! Chanito ! " we heard shouted in the distance . " Hallo ! hallo ! " answered the boy . And , soon after , l'Encuerado returned , carrying a fawn on his shoulders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " cried Lucien ; " why did n't you take it alive ? " " Bullets are the only things that can run as fast as these animals , Chanito . " " What became of the mother ? " asked Sumichrast . " I was not able to get near her ; but at all events , we have more than enough meat now , both for to-day and to-morrow . " Lucien took possession of the fawn . He had always longed to possess one of these animals alive . He duly examined the slender legs and tapering muzzle of the poor creature , whose fawn-colored back , dotted over with symmetrically arranged spots , would change in color as it got older . " Well , Master ' Sunbeam , ' in what class will you place this mammal ? " asked Sumichrast , addressing Lucien . " It is not like any of those I know . " " Well , then , you never can have seen goats , cows , or sheep . It is a ruminant , or an animal which has three or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incisors , while the upper jaw has nothing but a cushion or gum . " " That 's right enough , " said Lucien , opening the fawn 's mouth . " In all ruminants , the food , when swallowed , passes into the first stomach ; it is then brought up to be chewed again ; this is called ' chewing the cud . ' You must often have seen a cow or a sheep sitting quiet in the sun and constantly chewing . " " Yes , " replied Lucien , " and l'Encuerado always told me that they had eaten some bitter herb . " " His explanation is about as correct as that given by the Mexicans , who say that an animal which chews the cud is reading the newspaper . Another characteristic of these animals is , that their feet are cloven . " " And they have horns ! " cried Lucien . " Not all of them ; for instance , the camel , llama , and musk-deer , are exceptions . " It remained for us to decide how our fawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we left the point entirely to l'Encuerado , and I made my way down to the bottom of the ravine . Upon lifting up some stones and pieces of bark , I discovered several species of the Carabus family . Lucien caught on a shrub some insects of a very peculiar shape ; at the first glance , Sumichrast recognized them as tettigones . " These insects belong to the Hemeptera family , " said he , " therefore they are allied to the bug and the grasshopper ; these insects have neither mandiblesO nor jaws ; their mouth is a sort of beak , formed of a jointed tube extending along the breast , which you can see very plainly . This order is a very numerous one , and the two species you have just found are peculiar to Mexico . " " Here is one like a fowl , and another like a canoe . " " You are quite right , and you will meet with others which are still more singular looking . " The appearance of these little creatures pleased Lucien very much , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hand , he saw them jump off and disappear . He was just going to return to the shrub on which he had caught them , when his attention was attracted by an immense dragon-fly , commonly called in Mexico the devil 's horse , and in France demoiselle . The beautiful insect , after flying round and round , settled on a plant , and was immediately caught in the young hunter 's net . The prisoner had greenish eyes , a yellow body , and its wings were dotted over with black and scarlet . It doubled back its tapering body , as if to try and sting the hand which held it , and shook its gauzy wings with a kind of metallic sound . A half-eaten mosquito hung out of its mouth , and , although the dragon-fly was sadly bruised , it continued its meal , much to the amusement of Lucien , who hardly expected to find such tiger-like habits in an insect so elegant in form and so harmless in appearance . " It is of the order Neuroptera , " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on its four wings . This insect first lives in the water in the form of a larva , in which state it remains a year  --  it is very much like the insect you are holding , only , all that can be seen of its wings are small swellings , which grow longer each time the animal changes its skin . This swelling is a sort of sheath to the beautiful gauzy wings which distinguish all the Neuroptera , and the dragon-fly in particular . " " What ! does the dragon-fly begin its life by living in water like a fish ? " " Yes , and they are quite as voracious in that state as when they are perfect insects . The larva changes to a grub , and greedily devours water-lizards and young fish ; after a certain time , which varies according to the species , it rises to the top of the water by crawling up a reed , and remains perfectly motionless , exposed to the rays of the sun ; suddenly , the skin covering the head bursts open , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , takes flight , and loses no time in darting upon the first insect which comes within its reach . " My lecture was interrupted by the cry of " Hallo ! hallo ! " from l'Encuerado . It was his substitute for a dinner-bell . Illustration FOOTNOTE : O A very hard substance placed immediately under the upper lip , which insects use for cutting and tearing their food . Illustration CHAPTER XI . A BLUE LIZARD.  --  THE GUAVA-TREE.  --  A CATARACT.  --  NEST OF YELLOW SERPENTS.  --  A VEGETABLE HELMET .  --  THE KINGFISHER .  --  HUNTING WATER-FLEAS.  --  THE TADPOLE.  --  A COLLECTION OF WATER-BUGS . The rice-soup , our every-day fare , was , on this occasion , followed by fawn cutlets broiled on the embers , accompanied by potatoes . This precious tubercle , in its savage state , only reminded us very slightly of its cultivated progeny . The pulp , instead of being floury , is soft , transparent , and almost tasteless . That , however , did not prevent us from eating them , and doing justice to our venison . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Sumichrast , according to circumstances , the calumet of repose , of council , or of digestion , Lucien returned to the shrub on which he had previously found the insects . He collected a great number of these , and also discovered a third species , which was shaped like a triangle , with two horns at its base . He ran to show us these miniature bulls . Afterwards , armed with a long branch by way of a lever , he tried to raise up a decayed root covered with moss . He succeeded to do it , after some trouble , and saw , cowering down among the roots , a beautiful lizard ; it had a greenish back , and its mouth and the sides of its body were bright blue ; it was a variety which we had never before observed . The little animal , doubtless dazzled by the light , allowed itself to be caught , and then suddenly bending down its head , bit the boy 's finger , who at once dropped it . L'Encuerado soon caught the runaway . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " asked Sumichrast of Lucien . " That is why they bite , I suppose , " replied the boy , shaking his head . " Yes , " said the naturalist , " but you need n't be afraid ; its bite is not venomous . " ' This brute is surely not disposed to strife , But you attack it , it 'll defend its life . ' " Night came on . A multitude of insects whirled round and round our fire , burning their wings as if they enjoyed it . Lucien wanted to know what attracted so many of these poor creatures to the flame . As he inquired , two or three great beetles suddenly appeared with loud buzzing , and at once precipitated themselves into the burning coals . " See what comes of giddiness , " said Sumichrast . " If since we set out we had walked blindly on without looking where we went , long ere this we should have found ourselves at the bottom of some ravine . " " But these butterflies and beetles throw themselves into the fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ logic of facts . " They are not aware that the flame will burn , " I replied . " That 's true , " murmured the Indian , in a tone of compassion . Fatigue compelled us to give up our relaxation , and we soon went to sleep in a warm atmosphere , which seemed all the more pleasant when we remembered our sufferings of the night before . Our slumbers were interrupted toward morning by the frequent cries of a flight of passerines , called " alarum-birds " ( despertadores ) by the Mexicans . It was hardly light , and , in spite of l'Encuerado 's predictions , it had not rained . The light of our fire , when we stirred it , soon drove away our winged friends ; but , thanks to their waking us , the first rays of the sun found us all ready to set out . Just as we were going to start , an unforeseen difficulty arose  --  how to cross the ravine and ford the river ? L'Encuerado said that it would be necessary to go up-stream ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the contrary , was of opinion that there was much more chance of the banks becoming less steep if we went in the opposite direction ; he carried the day , and led the way , cutting a passage through the shrubs with his machete . As we were determined to skirt the edge of the water , we could not get along without great difficulty . The noise of the torrent , which seemed to grow louder , attracted us towards the forest , where the absence of grass and under-wood enabled us to get on faster . The trees grew farther and farther apart , and we again came upon brush-wood , ere long coming out on to a plain , dotted here and there with guava-trees . These trees furnished us with a quantity of green fruit , of which we were all very fond . L'Encuerado availed himself of this unexpected harvest by filling up all the gaps in his basket with them . The wild guava , a sort of myrtle , which grows naturally in the Terre-Temperee , reaches to a height of several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is eaten by the birds or larvae , is luscious , highly scented , and full of pips ; they have the reputation of being antifebrile and astringent . When the shrub is cultivated , its appearance changes considerably ; its branches grow longer , and are covered with leaves which are silvery on the back , and the fruit they yield are as large as lemons , which they resemble in shape and color . We all put on our travelling gear again ; but when l'Encuerado wanted to place the basket on his back , he found he could not possibly lift it up . I helped him , trying all the time to persuade him to throw away half his stock ; but he resolutely refused to follow my advice . When he began to walk , he staggered like a drunken man , and at last fell down beneath his burden , and all the guavas rolled out on to the ground . Our laughter rather hurt the brave Indian 's feelings . " By Jose-Maria ! " he cried , holding up his hands towards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what a disgrace , not to be able to carry a handful of guavas ! In my youth it would have taken three such loads as those to have made me fall down on my knees like a broken-down horse . Poor old fellow ! " L'Encuerado was certainly exaggerating his former strength ; but , at any rate , it cut him to the heart to have to throw away so much of the fruit he had gathered , and our insisting upon his doing so quite crowned his vexation . With a view of consoling him , I reminded him that the guavas would spoil in twenty-four hours , and that his basket held more than we could possibly consume . Sumichrast was walking about twenty steps in front of us , when suddenly he stopped and drew back . When I got abreast of him , my eyes met an immense ravine , at the bottom of which the torrent was rushing with a loud noise . The water was first calm and sluggish , accumulating in a large basin , then it suddenly burst forth against an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ columns , which , after uniting , broke into a thousand little cascades . We all wished to visit the bottom of this ravine , in order to enjoy this wondrous sight in all its grandeur . Before making our way into the brush-wood we put down our insect-cases and game-bags , for the enterprise required our unimpeded agility . As long as we could cling on to the plants and shrubs , the descent was mere child 's play ; but we soon found ourselves treading on a reddish ferruginous soil , which some great land-slip had exposed . Sumichrast was the first to venture on this dangerous ground , which gave way under him at his third stride . Our companion rolled over the declivity , instinctively grasping the first branches he could reach ; but he let go directly , uttering a piercing cry . Fortunately a shrub kept him from falling into the gulf . I planted my feet as deeply as I could in the crumbling soil , so as to be able to help my friend , who , with his face contracted with pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already red , swollen , and covered with blisters . The branch he had caught hold of in his fall belonged to a gigantic nettle , called by the Indians Mala-mujer , or " bad-woman . " This plant only grows on damp banks  --  " a piece of malice , " said l'Encuerado , " adopted in order to play shameful tricks on unsuspecting travellers ; towards whom it treacherously stretches out its green stalks and velvety leaves as if offering them assistance . " Illustration : " A shrub kept him from falling into the gulf . " We felt quite grieved at Sumichrast 's suffering ; for we well knew by experience the intolerable pain which is produced by the sting of this herb . L'Encuerado took Lucien in charge , while I gave my assistance to the injured man . For some distance we moved along without much difficulty , but very soon a whole forest of nettles stood up in front of us . Lucien and Sumichrast sat down , while the Indian and I , by means of our machetes , opened out a narrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so we had now almost got out of our difficulties . The stalks of the nettles , cut off a few inches above the ground , served to give firmness to our footing . But l'Encuerado , always too confident , tripped up , and his right cheek was brushed by some of their leaves ; it only needed this to render him perfectly unrecognizable . Although I pitied him , I could not help smiling at the grimaces produced on his sun-burnt visage by the painful stings . Even Sumichrast , when looking at him , forgot his own sufferings . Under a cypress , we observed five or six snakes , each about a yard and a half long . One , more courageous than the others , remained under the trees and steadily surveyed our party . Gringalet , furious in the extreme , barked and jumped all round the reptile , which , raising its head from the centre of the coil formed by its body , shot out its tongue . Its skin was of a golden yellow , dotted with green spots , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the dog ; the snake then coiled itself up , slowly turning its head in every direction , as if to select the best direction for retreat . Suddenly it unrolled its whole length , exposing to our view an unfortunate sparrow , which was still breathing . Leaving it unmolested , after a few minutes ' delay it seized its victim by the head , by degrees the little feathered innocent disappeared , and the snake remained motionless as though exhausted by the exertion . " Is it a rattle-snake ? " asked Lucien astonished . " No ; it is a common snake  --  that is , a reptile which is not venomous . This one is called by the Indians the Yellow-snake , and , from ignorance , they are in very great dread of them . It is in the habit of climbing trees with great activity , and hunts birds . The statues of the Aztec god of war , the terrible Huitzilipochtli , to whom thousands of men were offered as living sacrifices , had their foreheads bound with a golden snake , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have just seen is that which the Indians thus honored . " A little farther on , Lucien fancied that he saw , stretched out upon the grass , a long white snake . Gringalet , much bolder than usual , seized the reptile in his mouth and brought it to us . But it was nothing but a serpent 's skin : I then told the child that all reptiles of this kind change their skin twice a year , and they get out of it as if from a sheath . We continued our descent , and l'Encuerado , who had taken the lead , suddenly turned back to us with his head covered with an immense vegetable helmet . I at once recognized it to be the flower of a plant I had met with in the neighboring mountains . Nothing could be more splendid than this blossom , which , before it is full-blown , looks like a duck sitting on the water . In a single morning the enormous corolla opens out and changes into a form resembling a helmet surmounted by a crest ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost dazzles the eyes . The seed of this creeper , the Indian name of which I forget , is flat , and of a heart-like shape , having depicted on one of its faces a Maltese cross . Illustration : The Cataract . Even Sumichrast for a moment forgot his injuries while examining this wonderful flower , and Lucien , finding a second , very soon covered his head with it ; but the poisonous and penetrating odor exhaled from the corolla made him feel sick , so he soon relinquished this novel head-dress . A few more steps brought us to the bottom of the ravine , and Sumichrast and l'Encuerado set to work to bathe their stings in the cool water ; while I and Lucien sat down together on a rock , washed on one side by the stream , and leisurely contemplated the beautiful scene before us . In front of us was situated an immense mountain , cleft open as if by the hand of some giant , the sides of which were clad with a carpet of verdure of a thousand different shades . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopping up the immense fissure , there was an enormous accumulation of gray and dark-tinted rocks , between which appeared , every here and there , the foliage of some tree , enamelled with flowers . From the midst of the mountain , as if from some invisible cavern , sprung out a large sheet of transparent water , which , although calm and almost motionless in appearance , descended in one fall to a rock which projected in the cataract , like the prow of a ship . As if rendered furious by the shock , and seeming to revel in the uproar , the water , converted into foam , bounded over the obstacle , and fell in two columns , separated by the black point of crag ; then , springing with impetuous speed , from step to step , down a gigantic staircase , it entered a receptacle hollowed out like a shell , which received the foaming water , from whence it flowed gently into a basin edged with verdure . The torrent , quieted for a time , resumed its course , and striking against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from valley to valley , until it reached the plains , more than three thousand feet beneath . This cascade recalled to my memory one I had seen about a year before , when exploring the environs of Tuxtla , in the Terre-Chaude  --  viz. , the Fall of Ingenio  --  one which would be reckoned among the most celebrated in the world , if access to it was not rendered almost impossible by the wilderness . The sufferings of our two companions were so much alleviated by the application of water that they soon came and sat beside us . I can not describe the proud enjoyment we all felt in this wild spot . We were face to face with this unknown cascade , which we were , perhaps , the first Europeans to contemplate . Behind us the mountain sides seemed to unite and hem in the bed of the torrent . The sun bathed with its rays that portion which was bordered with large trees , among which kingfishers were skimming about . One of these birds came and perched close to us  --  its breast was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its head-feathers dark green ; its stout , thick-set shape , and its short tail , made Lucien remark that it looked like a malformed creature . Always restless , it almost immediately resumed its abrupt flight over the surface of the water , and disappeared among the windings of the ravine . Lucien pointed out to me an immense willow , the branches of which , drooping over the water , seemed to have at their ends enormous gourd-shaped fruits . I recognized in them the nests of those beautiful yellow birds , spotted with black , which the Mexicans call calandres . To convince Lucien of his mistake , l'Encuerado threw a large stone into the tree ; the missile fell from branch to branch , and more than a hundred frightened birds flew out from their curious retreats . At first they appeared much alarmed ; but when this had subsided , they skimmed over the water , or entered their impregnable habitations . Illustration : Fall of Ingenio ( from a drawing by the Marquis of Radepoint ) . We made our way down the ravine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after a long , winding , tedious course , came upon a sheet of calm water , flowing over a bed of sand . The sun was shining full open upon its transparent surface , and , close to the edge , hundreds of flies were whirling about . " Those are coleopterae , " said Sumichrast to Lucien . " Why do they turn round and round like that ? " inquired he . " To find their food , for they are carnivorous , and require a great deal of nourishment . In France they are commonly called tourniquets , or water-fleas . " Lucien wanted to catch one , but could not succeed ; l'Encuerado and Sumichrast joined in the pursuit . At first I amused myself with watching the useless efforts of my companions ; but at last , thinking myself cleverer than they , I squatted down also . There we all four were , with our hands in the water , perfectly motionless , and holding our breath , the better to remain motionless . The insects were all in a close mass , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direction without separating ; but however quickly we raised our hands , we all failed in our efforts . An hour was spent in this way , and even then we should not have given up the chase if the sun had not ceased to shine on the bank , and the insects had therefore moved beyond our reach , so as to be within its influence . Lucien , vexed at their going away , and l'Encuerado , furious at having been conquered by the agile creatures , commenced throwing stones at them with the hope of wounding one . Even in this they did not succeed , so l'Encuerado satisfied himself by calling them fools , a name which , in his opinion , constituted a gross insult . About twenty tadpoles , swimming in a puddle of water , were taken by Lucien for fish . " They are frogs , " I said to him . " Where are their feet , then ? " " Under the brown skin , which makes them look like fish ; when the time of their metamorphosis arrives , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little frog will come out of it . Look at this tadpole I have just caught ; you can see the feet through its transparent skin . To-day it is a fish , that is to say , it breathes through gills  --  those little tufts you see on each side of its head  --  and perhaps to-morrow it will undergo that metamorphosis which will cause it to breathe through its mouth . The Toltecs , the great nation which preceded the Aztecs in Mexico , counted the frog among their gods . " When putting the tadpole back into the pool , I noticed some whitish insects , which were incessantly rising in jerks to the surface of the water , and diving down again directly . Lucien , astonished at their movements , cried out  --  " But , papa , they are walking on their backs ! " " You are quite right ; they are hydrocorises , allied to the tettigones , and consequently hemipterae . " The young naturalist was more successful than in his gyrin-hunting , and succeeded in catching two or three of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " he inquired . " Why , to fly with , and to move from place to place . " " Then water-bugs are really able to fly , swim , and walk ? " " Yes ; and I 'm sure they can see in the dark , too , " said l'Encuerado , who , it may be remembered , envied animals this privilege . " We are certainly justified in thinking so , " I answered , smiling , " for they nearly always choose the night for travelling . Take care they do n't bite you , for the water-bug bites as hard as its kinsmen of the woods and houses . " A little farther on , Lucien stopped in front of an herbaceous plant , covered from top to bottom with round , flat black insects , speckled with red , and almost resembling mosaic-work . He was very proud of his beautiful discovery , and took hold of two or three of the insects ; but feeling their soft bodies give way in his fingers , he threw them down with disgust . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They are wood-bugs , " replied Sumichrast ; " only they are in the state of larvae , and have no wings . " " What has caused this nasty smell on my fingers ? " " When any one touches these insects , a very strong-smelling yellowish liquid always exudes from them . " Lucien ran off to wash his hands . He rubbed them over and over again , but could not quite get rid of the smell , which seemed to annoy him very much . I concluded from this that in future he would not have many wood-bugs in his collection . After a long ramble at the bottom of the ravine , we had to return to our starting-point , which was the only side by which we could obtain an exit . We found the cataract perfectly bathed in light . The large upper sheet of water looked like a block of azure-stone , while the spray beneath glittered as if covered with diamonds . Above our heads a rainbow spanned the stream from bank to bank . I at last succeeded in tearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met with no game , but a great part of our fawn was yet remaining in the basket . Sumichrast was still in pain , and l'Encuerado 's face continued much inflamed . We now had to ascend , and we each adopted the greatest precaution while passing the spot where we had seen the serpents . I do n't know how we should ever have got up if l'Encuerado had not thought of cutting some branches of dwarf elder for walking-sticks . Above every thing , I wished to keep Lucien from the suffering caused by coming in contact with the Mala-mujer , as the Mexicans call it , and it was with a sigh of relief that I saw him safe and sound out of this cul-de-sac . Illustration CHAPTER XII . A RELATION OF GRINGALET.  --  OUR FOUR-FOOTED GUIDE .  --  A REVIEW OF OUR PARTY .  --  THE ALLIGATOR-TORTOISE.  --  THE PHEASANTS.  --  THE MAGNOLIA .  --  THE NUTMEG-TREE.  --  THE BLUE-PLANT.  --  THE CATERPILLAR . As the sun was setting , our wisest course was to go back to our bivouac of the evening before , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the passage we had sought in vain . Upon the whole , the sight of the cataract had amply repaid us for our useless walk . Our little party , therefore , once more plunged into the forest , rather at random , though taking care not to go too far from the stream . Two or three times we seemed to have reached the spot where we left the bank ; but we soon got into the most inextricable thickets . As the time wore on , I began to think we had passed the place ; and , as is often the case in similar circumstances , opinions were divided . A fox , which appeared within gunshot , interrupted our discussion . I fired , and the animal fell . It was a magnificent specimen , and exactly like its European confrere . By a singular chance , at the very moment it was expiring , a crow just above our heads uttered a loud croaking . " There ! the crow is thanking us for having rid him of his enemy , the fox , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joke . In spite of our advice , l'Encuerado would insist upon skinning the animal , whose pelt he wished to preserve . Fortunately , he was very quick at such an operation , and the beautiful fur was soon hanging over his arm , ready to be stretched outside his basket to dry . " I hope , " said Sumichrast to Lucien , " that you have already recognized the fox 's relationship . " " Oh yes ! in its color and shape it is like the cayotte . " " You are quite right , but the cayotte and the fox are both Gringalet 's cousins . " " I can scarcely believe that , for Gringalet has short hair , is spotted with black and white , has gray eyes  --  " " Those are only secondary characteristics , " interrupted Sumichrast . " Gringalet belongs to the carnivorous type , called by naturalists Digitigrades . " " Is Gringalet a digitigrade ? " asked Lucien , smiling . " Yes , certainly ; that is to say , he walks on his toes , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fox , whose teeth , also , are perfectly similar to those of Gringalet . The principal difference between them is , that the fox has eyes which are formed so as to enable it to see in the dark , a quality which Gringalet does not possess in the same degree . " " Are there such things as wild dogs ? " " Yes , although the point has been much disputed . But the dog , the faithful companion of man , has been so long domesticated , that little similarity of appearance exists between them . However , the cayotte , the fox , and the wolf may be called wild dogs . " We had once more got into the midst of a thicket without discovering the least trace of our resting-place . It became important that we should soon find our starting-point . I noticed that Gringalet , instead of gambolling round us as he generally did , remained behind , pricking up his ears , and appearing excessively knowing . " What do you think , shall we take Gringalet for our guide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his name mentioned , he rushed towards me , and I patted him . " Come , tell your dog to lead us to the bivouac , " I said to Lucien . " To the bivouac ! to the bivouac ! " cried the boy , patting the animal . Gringalet really seemed to understand , for he sniffed up the air , and at once went to the front . I soon discovered that he was taking us back by a very circuitous path . " To the bivouac ! to the bivouac ! " Gradually the noise of the torrent became more distinct , and our guide plunged into the brush-wood . While we were cutting down the branches that stopped up our path , Gringalet waited with his ears pricked up and one foot uplifted . At last we caught sight of the hut , which was greeted with such pleasure and relief as only known by fatigued travellers . It was not without emotion that I again beheld this spot , to which I had , as I thought , said good-bye forever . The scarcely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had quite a home-like appearance . Sumichrast said he felt the same impression , and Lucien declared that his first idea had been that we should find an Indian in the hut . But what about Gringalet ? Had he then really understood us ? Those who have made a trial of canine intelligence will not doubt the fact for a moment . The word bivouac , having been so often pronounced since we set out , must have struck both the mind and the ears of the animal , so as to have become almost synonymous in his ideas with dinner and rest . The next day at sunrise we set out , gently ascending the course of the stream . Sumichrast 's hand was still in pain , and quite prevented him using his gun . L'Encuerado , though disfigured , had , at least , the free use of his limbs . The inexperienced traveller is incessantly exposed to misfortunes of this kind . Turned out into the midst of various unknown natural objects , he carelessly plucks a leaf , breaks down a branch , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is prompt and terrible , and the innocent diversion of a second has to be expiated by hours of anguish . In the wild life of the wilderness , dangers become so multiplied , that more courage than is generally supposed is required to face them . Every explorer of unknown scenes must make up his mind to endure hardships . More than one whom I have seen start full of confidence , at the end of three days have returned , wearied , bruised , ill , discouraged , and , in fact , conquered . By degrees , of course , experience comes to the help of those whose moral courage is strong enough to induce them to persevere . They soon learn to recognize at a glance the tree that it is best to avoid , the grass that must not be trodden on , the creeper the touch of which is to be shunned , and the fruit which should not be tasted . At last the requirements of the body are to some extent mastered , and it follows the dictation of the soul without complaint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the delicate susceptibility of his casing of flesh , which is bruised by blows , torn by thorns , devoured by insects , and yet , day after day , the persevering man continues to face death under its most horrible aspects  --  poison from venom of serpents , giddiness from sun-stroke , blindness from the power of the moon , want of sleep , hunger , and thirst . I had just taken a review of our situation when these reflections were suggested to me . Halting , I permitted my comrades to pass me ; their appearance , after so many days ' travel , I give . First , there was Sumichrast , tall and broad-shouldered , his features displaying both mildness and energy ; one arm in a sling , his clothes torn to shreds , and his face furrowed by five or six deep scratches ; leaning on a stick carried in his left hand , he seemed a little bent ; but his vigorous form still told of abundant endurance and determination . Behind him , his gun slung to his cross-belt , came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and determined ; his face was seamed with scratches , his hands bruised and brown from exposure . As he passed in front of me , he smiled and gave a joyous hurrah , and lifted his cap , beneath which his hair flowed down in golden curls . Gringalet , now reconciled to the squirrels ' skins , walked close by his master ; truly he looked like standing more work . Lastly , l'Encuerado , his arms and legs bare , and laden with guavas , brought up the rear . The brave Indian tried to raise his straw-hat as he passed by me , his bony visage expanded , and his smile showed a row of white teeth which were worthy of competing with Gringalet 's . Well satisfied with my inspection , I shouldered my gun , and resumed the head of the column . The cliffs of the ravine became gradually more wooded , and the descent was effected without accident . I kept along the bank looking out for a ford . At last a bend of the stream , where the water flowed calmly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I then proposed a halt . Close by us rose some enormous rocks covered with moss , which , in flood-time , must have been reached by the water ; in front of us was a gentle slope covered with turf . We were descending the slope when an object , indistinct at first , emerged from the edge of the wood , and , appearing to roll more than run over the grass , advanced toward us . It was an enormous tortoise ; but a tortoise which might successfully have raced with the hare . L'Encuerado tried to stop it , but fell in his effort . Sumichrast , quite forgetting his bad hand , dealt the animal a blow with the butt-end of his gun , the effect of which was slightly to slacken the pace of the enemy . The Indian , furious at his failure , threw down his load , and came running up . Our united efforts succeeded , about twenty feet from the stream , in throwing the animal on its back . Lucien , rather startled at this scene , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to examine it . I kept him at some distance from the reptile , who was viciously agitating its enormous feet , armed with formidable claws ; while its mouth , which was like a horny beak , opened and shut menacingly . " It is a galapago , " said l'Encuerado ; " it is of no use for food . " This creature , which is called by the savants the alligator-tortoise , measured more than a yard from its head to its tail . The latter appendage was almost as long as the body , and was covered with a triple row of scaly crests fitting into each other . The gray , wrinkled , and almost scaly skin of the reptile formed rolls round its neck of a disgusting appearance  --  one might almost fancy them unhealthy excrescences . The horrible beast turned towards us its gaping mouth with a vicious manner . The turtle-fishers much dread the galapagos , which , being more agile than the ordinary tortoise , give them sometimes frightful wounds , either with their sharp claws or their horny jaws . Their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were leaving , l'Encuerado wanted to cut off the reptile 's head . Sumichrast opposed this useless slaughter , and was inclined to replace the tortoise on its feet . But the Indian refused to assist in this good work , for he asserted that it was equivalent to leaving a rattlesnake alive . Two or three times the animal was very nearly repaying our kindness by a bite ; for , as soon as we came near , it managed to twist round on its upper shell . We were about to abandon it to its fate , when suddenly , the slope of the ground helping us , we managed to set it on its feet ; as soon as it was turned over , it rushed at Lucien . The enormous rolls round its neck , being all distended , made it carry its head very forward , so , with a single blow of his cutlass , l'Encuerado decapitated the assailant . We were then witnesses to a strange sight , for while Gringalet was furiously attacking the motionless head , the feet , continuing to move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappeared in the lake . Although we had often before seen tortoises survive for a considerable time wounds which were certainly mortal , the strength of the nervous system which was exhibited in this reptile almost staggered us . " Now , my brave friend , try and swim without your head , and take care not to break your skull against the rocks ! " cried the exasperated Indian . " The father saves your life , and then you want to hurt his child ! You hardly saw me , or you 'd have known that I am pretty well able to bite . Good-bye ! and take good care of yourself ! " We may readily see that the Indian was any thing but a generous enemy ; but the fact was , the galapagos were old enemies , for one had nearly bitten off his hand while he was bathing . The turf-carpeted bank soon led us into the thick forest again . We had been walking for more than an hour through a perfect labyrinth of gigantic trees , and over a bare and yet rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ground is covered with grass  --  when l'Encuerado heard the call of a small species of pheasant peculiar to this country . " Bend towards the left to get near the game , " said Sumichrast , in a low voice ; " and , whatever you do , do n't shake the foliage . " " We 're all right now , " muttered l'Encuerado ; " listen ! I 'll predict that we shall have a good dinner to-day . " The Indian laid down his load , which Sumichrast and Lucien took charge of , while I followed the former behind the trees . My companion soon went a little in front , and imitated the cry of the bird we were pursuing , so as to make them answer , and thus show us where they were hidden . The imitation was really so perfect that I moved towards it , thinking to find the bird , and of course came upon the Indian lying in ambush . This same mistake had happened to me before with Sumichrast , who imitated the voice of birds almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produced an answer , and at about a hundred yards from us , on the top of a not very tall oak , were perched three enormous pheasants . Bent down and crawling behind the trees , I joined l'Encuerado , keeping my eye fixed on the game , which stretched out their necks with an anxious look , and seemed to be listening . Two gun-shots went off at once ; one of the birds fell dead at our feet , and the two others flew away . One of these fugitives flew high above the tree-tops , but the other , being wounded , was unable to follow its companion ; I darted off in pursuit , making sure of bagging it . The poor bird reached the ground and tried hard to run ; I was not more than fifty paces from it , when a tiger-cat , with a black coat , bounded forward , and , seizing it , disappeared before I had time to recover from my surprise . The marauder was abused as a thief and a rogue by l'Encuerado , who had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which was almost as big as a turkey ; but its sombre plumage did not at all answer to the magnificent idea which the boy had formed of this bird . He thought that the head was much too small for the body , and its naked and warty cheeks led him to observe that the pheasant had the appearance of having put on two plasters of tortoise-skin , a remark which was certainly well founded . With regard to the beautiful and many-colored pheasant-species peculiar to Asia and Africa , Mexico possesses none of them , so far , at least , as I know . About two o'clock in the afternoon , Lucien remarked that the trees grew farther apart , which was a sign that we were approaching an open glade or the foot of a mountain . Sumichrast made the boy walk in front as leader  --  a reward for the sharpness of his eyes . Proud of this duty , our little guide led us to an opening edged with a rampart of wood at a short distance off . " Halt ! " cried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground at this order ; our hut was soon constructed , and l'Encuerado immediately afterwards busied himself preparing our meal . Illustration : " A tiger-cat bounded forward and seized the pheasant . " Sumichrast , who , from the state of his hand , was condemned to idleness , remained with the Indian , while I proceeded , in company with Gringalet and Lucien , to reconnoitre the vicinity of our bivouac . Almost immediately , a yoloxochitl , a species of magnolia , met our eyes . I called l'Encuerado , who climbed the tree in order to throw us down some of its beautiful sweet-smelling flowers ; they are externally of a pinkish-white color , yellow on the inside , and the petals , before they are full-blown , assume the form of a cross , and afterwards that of a splendid star . The Indian did not fail to remind us that an infusion of the glittering leaves of the yoloxochitl is a remedy against diarrhoea , and that its flowers , as their shape indicates , cure palpitation of the heart . A little farther on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in height , and covered with half-formed fruit . The nutmeg is not cultivated in Mexico , and the tree that produces it is rather rare . The Indians , however , use an enormous quantity of the Molucca nutmegs , either as a remedy or as a condiment  --  nutmegs , camphor , and asafoetida being the principal Indian remedies . I next pointed out to my young companion a plant named the blue herb , the leaves of which stain the water in which they are soaked with a lovely azure tinge . In Mexico a variety of this vegetable is cultivated , in order to extract from it the coloring matter commonly known under the name of indigo . " But how do they manage , " asked Lucien , " to obtain from a plant those dark-blue stones that I have seen sold in the market ? " " About the month of March , " I answered , " are gathered the fresh leaves of the indigo-plant , which is one of the leguminous family , and pound them in mortars made out of the trunks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when subjected to a heavy pressure , is of a greenish tinge , and sometimes even colorless ; it does not become blue until after fermentation in the open air . The Indians then boil it in an immense copper , and , the water evaporating , the indigo is left in the form of a soft and gelatinous paste , which is subsequently dried in the sun . " On approaching the foot of the mountain , I found that it would be impossible for us to climb it the next day , the slope being too steep . I sat down on the trunk of a fallen tree , when I detected a very decided smell of roses . Under the bark of a log esquina Lucien had discovered five or six beautiful insects of an azure-blue color , with red feet ; these insects are very common in the sandy soils of Tehuacan , and are used by the ladies of that district to perfume their linen . Delighted at this discovery , Lucien continued his search , hoping to find some more specimens which he intended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and working energetically , when he pointed out to me an enormous caterpillar . It was of an emerald-green color , and had on its back a row of little projections like small trees , symmetrically arranged . These were of a brilliant red , terminating in shoots the same color as the animal 's body . " What a curious creature ! " cried Lucien ; " it looks as if it carried a garden on its back ; what use are all these bushes ? " " It is not known , and it is a curious fact that the butterfly which springs from the caterpillar shows no trace of all this strangely-arranged hair . " " Will a butterfly come from this caterpillar ? " " Yes , certainly ; all butterflies lay eggs , from which proceed caterpillars , which generally destroy the plants on which they are hatched . When arrived at maturity , the caterpillar spins a cocoon of silk , more or less fine , in the centre of which it incloses itself . It is then called a chrysalis . In this cocoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yellow or green , and there it remains inactive and imprisoned , like a baby in swadding-clothes . In spring it perforates its silken prison , and soon makes its escape a splendid butterfly , subsisting upon the juices of the flowers obtained through its proboscis . Surely you were not ignorant of all these transformations ? " " I thought that they only took place in silk-worms . " " Well , now you are undeceived ; all caterpillars and all butterflies are subject to them ; but there are few caterpillars which spin so valuable a cocoon as the silk-worm . Moreover , some bury themselves in the earth ; while others hide in the middle of a leaf , the edges of which they curl round so as to form a kind of bag , in which they are protected from the beaks of birds ; again , some hollow out a shelter in the trunk of a tree , and line their abode with silk more or less fine . Thus , in every case , the chrysalis waits patiently for the time when it will change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ richest colors . " The subject was really an inexhaustible one , so I deferred the rest of my explanations to another day . Besides , l'Encuerado was loudly calling for us . Illustration Illustration CHAPTER XIII . THE SENSITIVE-PLANT.  --  GRINGALET AND THE PORCUPINE .  --  THE MEXICAN CHAMELEON .  --  THE KITE AND THE FALCON .  --  AN AMPHISBAENA SNAKE .  --  A COUNCIL OF TURKEYS . Lucien , seated on the grass , amused himself with touching all the plants within reach of his travelling staff ; suddenly he noticed that the branches and leaves of a small shrub shut up when he brushed them with his stick , just like the ribs of a parasol , moved by some invisible spring  --  it was a sensitive-plant . He called to us to ask for an explanation of this phenomenon , so we assembled round the shrub , which was about three feet high ; its leaves finely cut and of a delicate green color , with pink flowers in tufts half hidden among them . The leaves , touched by the stick , shrank up close to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and delicate ones , rising on their stalks , pressed against one another . In about five minutes the leaves which had been rubbed again spread out , as if they had recovered from their fright . It was , however , only for a short time ; for Lucien amused himself by rubbing his fingers over the leaves , which immediately doubled up , as if offended by the slight touch . The Indians call it the " Bashful Plant . " A blow struck on the principal stem is sufficient to make all the branches close , as if animated by a kind of modest feeling . When the sun sets , the sensitive plant spontaneously shuts up its delicate foliage , which does not open again freely until the return of day . Lucien 's first idea , at waking , was to run towards the shrubs which interested him the day before . They were covered with dew , and looked as if they were asleep , until the first rays of the sun fell upon them . Before we started , the young naturalist again tested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him was allied to the tree which produces gum-arabic . L'Encuerado 's cheek was less swollen , and Sumichrast could use his hand , although it still pained him . The mountain in front of us , which was too steep to climb , caused us some perplexity . " Let us slant off to the left , over this moist ground , carpeted with turf , " said Sumichrast , plunging into the thicket . About midday , just as l'Encuerado was declaring , in a grumbling tone , that we ought to have inclined towards the right , our little troop entered the wood . An undulating slope led us to a summit not more than twenty yards across , and in less than half an hour the opposite descent brought us into a delicious glen . " Hallo ! Master ' Sunbeam , ' " cried Sumichrast , while helping me to construct our hut , " do n't you recollect you are the one to provide the fire ? " " All right , " replied Lucien , who seemed to be lost in the contemplation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an insect which appears to be making , like us , natural-history collections , for I have just found in its nest a quantity of spiders , flies , and small worms . " " It is one of the Hymenoptera , " said Sumichrast ; " it collects all round its eggs the food the young will eat when they are hatched ; the insect is therefore full of forethought  --  a good example for us to imitate . " When the fire was ready , we started off in light marching order to explore the vicinity of our bivouac . Our position was commanded by mountains on all sides , and the glen was scarcely a quarter of a league in length . The pleasant coolness , and the presence of numerous birds , led us to hope that we should meet with a spring , which was all that was needed to convert this remote corner of the world into a perfect paradise . But our exploring only led to the discovery of a greenish pool , sheltered by an enormous rock , and which the dry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention towards the forest , and I perceived a porcupine on a tree . The animal , sitting up on its hind feet , was looking at us with astonishment . Leaving it undisturbed , it appeared to forget us , and tearing off with its claws a piece of bark , it licked the inner side , which was doubtless covered with insects . Having repeated this operation several times , the animal advanced to the end of a branch , and seizing it with its prehensile tail , let itself down to the ground . Its large black eyes , of unusual mildness , were widely opened , and its nose slit like hares and rabbits . It was just about to stretch itself , when , to our great regret , l'Encuerado shot it ; the poor beast fell over on the ground , and placing its hand-shaped paws on the wound , rolled itself up into a ball at the foot of a tree . Gringalet darted forward to seize it , and then immediately retreated , howling with pain ; he came back to us with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were about two inches long and finely pointed . The unfortunate dog rubbed his nose against the ground in order to get relief , but , of course , this only increased his pain . Lucien ran to help him , and at last succeeded in extracting them . " Have you lost your senses ? " asked l'Encuerado of the dog , while washing the poor beast 's nose and mouth . " The idea of trying to bite a huitzttacuatzin ! Upon my word , I thought you knew better than that . No doubt it 's a good thing to be brave , but you must manage to be less stupid when you are in the forests of the Terre-Chaude , unless you want to be devoured by a tiger , or scratched to pieces by an ant-eater . " After listening to l'Encuerado 's speech , Lucien scolded him for firing at the poor animal , and then joined us , close to the porcupine , which was dying . It was about the size of a fox , and its fore paws were furnished with four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slow of pace and entirely inoffensive , spreads round it a sickening musky odor . It lives on fruit , roots , and insects , and , aided by its prehensile tail , climbs trees with great skill . It but rarely tries to make its escape at the approach of the hunter , who , moreover , utterly despises such worthless game . L'Encuerado reminded us that we had now been travelling twelve days , and that it was the first Sunday in May . We should have devoted it to rest if our morning 's hunting had been successful ; but , unless we contented ourselves with a dinner composed only of rice , we were obliged to shoot some eatable bird or animal to fill our stew-pot . We heard some doves cooing , and l'Encuerado went off alone in the direction of the sound , for these birds are difficult of approach . Gringalet , notwithstanding our calls , ran after the Indian . Lucien climbed the rock which hung over the pool , and made signs for me to come to him , saying , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at this strange animal . " I also climbed up , and found lying on the top a Mexican chameleon , a kind of round-shaped lizard , with a brown skin dotted over with yellow spots , which seemed to change color in the light . Lucien tried to catch the graceful reptile , which , however , glided between his fingers and disappeared behind the rock . The Mexican chameleon lives only in the woods and among the rocks . It chiefly delights in the oak forests , where the dark color of its body blends with the hue of the dry leaves , and enables it to lie successfully in ambush for the insects on which it feeds . Sumichrast , who had succeeded in taming a chameleon , told us that the reptile 's throat , which was white during the daytime , assumed during the night a dark hue ; also , that it liked to be caressed , and became familiar enough to take from his hand the flies which were offered it . The Indians , who hold the animal in great dread when alive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an amulet against the " evil eye . " Illustration : " The kite avoided the shock , and continued to rise in the air . " From our lofty observatory we were looking at the beautiful birds which occasionally flew across the plain , when Sumichrast suddenly fired . He had caught sight of a fine magpie , of an ashy-blue color , with its head crowned by a tuft ; its throat appeared as if it were bound round with black velvet , a peculiarity which has obtained for it from the Indians the name of the " commander bird . " Lucien came down from the rock to go and pick up the game , when an enormous kite darted on the magpie , seized it in its sharp claws , and immediately took flight . Sumichrast seized his gun to punish the impudent poacher , but a falcon , about the size of a man 's fist , made its appearance , and describing two or three rapid circles , swooped down on the kite . The latter avoided the shock and continued to rise in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground , uttering a shriek of rage . Again ascending , with extreme rapidity , by an oblique flight , it a second time overtopped its antagonist , and darted upon it like a flash of lightning . Their wings beat together , and a few feathers came fluttering to the ground . The prey fell from the bird 's grasp , followed in its fall by the falcon . The kite , conquered by an enemy about one-fifth of its own size , flew round and round in the air and then disappeared . The conqueror standing about thirty yards from us , eyes glittering and foot firmly planted on its prey , magnificent in anger and daring , Sumichrast abandoned the game to it as a recompense for its courage . The bird , not at all satisfied at being so close to us , buried in the body of its victim its claws  --  so enormous in comparison to its own size  --  shook its wings and rose , at first with difficulty , when , its flight becoming more easy as it ascended higher , it carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the ground beneath had followed all the changes and chances of this combat , soon joined us . " How was it that that great bird allowed itself to be conquered by such a small adversary ? " he asked of Sumichrast . " Because it was a coward . " " But both have the same plumage , and almost the same shape ; I took the small bird to be the young of the other . " " The last is a falcon , and the other is a kite . They belong , in fact , to the same family ; but the falcon is noble and courageous , while the kite is perhaps the most cowardly of all birds of prey . Falcons were once used for hunting ; for , as you have just seen , they have no fear of attacking adversaries much larger than themselves . Added to this , they are easily tamed . " " But eagles are much stronger than falcons ? " " Eagles are birds of prey which do not at all merit the reputation which poets have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stronger , they exhibit much less bravery than falcons , and only attack animals of small size . " " Yet , surely the eagle is the king of birds ; is it not able to look straight at the sun ? " " Yes , thanks to a membrane that shuts down over the pupil of its eye . Among all nations the eagle is the symbol of strength and courage : but still the falcon possesses the latter of these qualities in a much higher degree ; it is the falcon which is the real king of birds among ornithologists . The Mexicans , as you know , depict upon their banners an eagle sitting upon a cactus and tearing a serpent . " " Is this intended as an emblem of strength and courage ? " " No , it has another origin . When the Aztecs , who were thought to be natives of Northern America , arrived in Mexico ( which then bore the name of Anahuac ) , they wandered about a long time before they settled . One day , near a lake , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the cactus an eagle was sitting . Guided by an oracle , a city was built , which was called Tenochtitlan , and subsequently Mexico . " My historical lecture was interrupted by a distant shot . We had heard nothing of the doves for a long time , and we were expecting to see our companion reappear ; but he must have made an enormous curve in pursuing them , to judge from the direction from which the report of his gun proceeded . Fortunately , from the position of the spot , there was not much likelihood of his missing his way : although we had full confidence in his instinct , we feared to what extent his ardor might carry him . We now kept on the look-out , hoping that chance would throw us in contact with some game . All at once there was a movement to our right in the high grass , and its waving about pointed out the presence of some reptile . In a minute or two we saw a serpent making its way towards the pool ; it was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Greeks , the double-headed serpent . The amphisbaena was about a foot and a half long , and its tail was swollen at the end , which gave it a very curious appearance . Its skin , covered with large scales , had a bluish metallic glitter . It crawled slowly , and stopped every instant as if to bore into the ground , but in reality to pick up insects or ants . This singular snake quite enchanted Lucien , and Sumichrast told him to fire his gun at it , so as to be able to study it more closely . He had no need to repeat his instructions ; the young sportsman , who had begun to handle his weapon very skillfully , at once placed it to his shoulder ; the shot was fired , and the amphisbaena , tumbling over , disappeared in the grass . The reptile had been hit , and we all of us clambered down the rock as fast as we could , in the hopes of finding it dead . We sought for it in vain ; the snake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would be in vain to try to dislodge it . Gringalet now showed himself , soon followed by l'Encuerado . When he caught sight of us , the Indian raised a loud " Hiou ! hiou ! " Waving his hat in the air , he threw upon the ground some dark object , which fell heavily on the turf , and then he began dancing . We roared with laughter at his grotesque steps , and Lucien ran towards the Mistec , who , after his dance , was acting the acrobat on the turf . " A turkey ! " he cried ; and an enormous bird , with bronzed plumage , was passed from hand to hand . " Ah ! Chanito , " cried the Indian , " if you had gone with me , you would have seen a whole flock of them ! I had chased those miserable doves till I was tired , without even catching a glimpse of them , and was resting at the foot of a tree , when Gringalet pricked up his ears , and running up the opposite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he saw another porcupine . I also made my way there , and heard ' gobbles ' resounding in every direction ; Master Gringalet had fallen in with a council of turkeys . " " A council of turkeys ? " repeated Lucien . " Yes , Chanito , turkeys hold councils . They generally travel in flocks and on foot , although they know perfectly well how to fly when they want to cross a stream or to make their escape ; and when one of them wants to communicate his opinion to another , he raises a cry , and his companions form a circle round him . " " And what takes place then ? " " The preacher , " continued l'Encuerado , without the least idea of irreverence , " lowers his neck and then lifts it up again , raises up the hair-like feathers on his crop , and spreads out his tail like a fan . He then addresses the assembled birds , who strut about with their wings half opened , and answer him with approving gobbles . " The Indian , carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strutted about , rounded his arms and lowered his chin upon his breast , in order to imitate the ways of the birds which he was describing . " But what do they say ? " asked Lucien , archly . " That depends on circumstances , " he replied , scratching his forehead . " The flock just now surprised must have cried out : ' What is this animal ? '  --  ' A dog , ' would be the answer of the most knowing among them . ' Fly , my friends , fly ! ' he would cry ; ' dogs are always accompanied by men , and men have guns . ' ' A gun ! what 's that ? '  --  ' A machine that goes boum and kills turkeys . ' Then I make my appearance ; they bustle about , fly away , and spread in every direction ; but my gun had time to go boum and to kill this beautiful bird . " I need scarcely say what mirth was excited by this account . While returning to our bivouac , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America , and that it was introduced by the Jesuits into Europe , where it flourished well . In a domestic state , the color of its plumage altered to a reddish , a white , and a gray and black color . But it never lost the habit of walking about in flocks , and of laying its eggs in thickets , in a shapeless nest , which the young chicks leave the second day after they are hatched . Lastly , the Aztec name of the turkey  --  totole  --  is applied by the Indians to simpletons and cowards . Lucien then told l'Encuerado about the magpie and the amphisbaena . " You killed a maquiz coatl  --  a two-headed serpent ! " cried the Indian . " I only wounded it , for it got away ; but it had only one head . " " Then you did n't examine it thoroughly ; for it would not turn round when it crawled away . " " I did not notice . I saw it leap up in the air , and that was all . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go back ; the skin of the maquiz coatl enables the blind to see . Why did you let it escape ? " " Oh ! we shall be sure to find another . " " You ca n't find them whenever you like ; they are very rare , " replied the Indian , shaking his head . While the turkey was roasting under our superintendence , l'Encuerado and Lucien went off to try and find the amphisbaena 's hole . Illustration Illustration : " It looked like an immense pedestal , surmounted by two bronze statues . " Illustration CHAPTER XIV .

The sun left us soon afterwards , and we sat talking by the fire . At last l'Encuerado took away Lucien towards the rocks , and set up one of those interminable chants with which his memory was stored . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on which they were sitting , making it look like an immense pedestal , surmounted by two bronze statues . Any traveller suddenly entering the valley would have recoiled in terror before this fantastic apparition ; and if any wild beast had been prowling near us , our gigantic shadows would certainly have made it keep its distance . We were just thinking of calling Lucien to come and lie down under the hut , when l'Encuerado shouted out to us . Towards the east , a large luminous disk was shining brilliantly above the mountain peaks . This luminous globe , lengthening out into the shape of an ellipse , appeared to move along . In fact , it was descending slowly over the wooded crests . Lucien and l'Encuerado kept plying us with questions in reference to it , which we were unable to answer . Illustration " What is it ? " cried Sumichrast . " A meteor ! " I exclaimed , struck with a sudden idea . " If I had my gun ready , I would fire at it , at all events . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the globe may contain electric fluid , and we might draw it down upon us . " Soon afterwards the meteor passed by us . We threw ourselves down flat on the earth , dreading this unknown visitor . When I ventured to rise , it was some distance away , and yet appeared to be motionless . Rays incessantly quivering sprang from the centre of it ; in the middle the light was white , but at the edges it assumed first a yellowish , then a red , and lastly a bluish hue . We were suddenly almost blinded by a flash of intense brilliancy ; a formidable explosion , repeated by the echoes , burst upon our ears , and all became silence and obscurity . While we were returning to our bivouac , Lucien and l'Encuerado pressed us with questions . " What are meteors ? " asked Lucien , eagerly . " Some scientific men , " replied Sumichrast , " look upon them as fragments of planets wandering in space . Getting entangled in our planetary system , they yield to the attraction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obedience to the law of gravitation . " " But what are they composed of ? " " Generally speaking , of sulphur , chromium , and earth . The phenomenon of ' shooting stars ' is connected with that of meteors , and any substance falling on the surface of the earth receives the name of aerolite . " " Do you wish to persuade me that stones rain down from the sky ? " cried l'Encuerado . " Yes , certainly ; and if I am not mistaken , it was in your country that the largest known aerolite was found , for it weighed no less than fifty hundred-weights . To-morrow morning we will search for the one we have seen , which must have dropped at the end of the valley . " " Are these stones luminous ? " rejoined the Indian . " No ; but they take fire , owing to their rapid flight . " " And whence did the meteor come which passed so close to us ? " " Either from the moon or the stars , or perhaps from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out laughing at what he considered a joke . He laughed , indeed , so heartily , that we could not help joining him . " Now what do you imagine the sun and moon really are ? " asked Lucien . " God 's lanterns , " replied the Indian , gravely . Our young companion was well accustomed to the artless ignorance of his friend , but still he always endeavored to contend against it ; so he set to work to teach him something about our planetary system . The dimensions which he attributed to the heavenly bodies seemed to afford great amusement to the Indian . At last , just when the young orator fancied he had convinced his disciple , the latter embraced him , exclaiming : " What an amusing tale ! Oh ! how pleased I should be to be able to read such pretty stories as that in a book ! " " Tales , indeed ! " cried Lucien , quite indignant . " Well , the very idea of saying that the earth is a ball , which moves round and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Many a night have I spent looking at the stars , and I know they are nothing but lanterns , and that 's enough ! " " But if you have observed them so carefully , " interposed Sumichrast , " you must have observed that they are constantly shifting their places . " " Yes , but that is because the angels do n't always light up the same stars , and God has plenty of them in every direction  --  " I now interrupted the conversation . " Come , let us all go to rest ! " I cried , cutting short a discussion which I knew , by experience , must end in Lucien and Sumichrast getting the worst of it . The next morning there was nothing better to do than to go with my companions to look after the aerolite . The ball of fire appeared to have passed just over us , and I fancied that we should be certain to recover some part of it . After an hour of useless wandering , we were compelled to admit that our eyes must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not help smiling incredulously on hearing the conjectures which I and Sumichrast made ; but he was generous enough not to take advantage of the superior astronomical knowledge which he assumed he possessed . On setting out I again crossed the valley , and then climbing the mountain , I led my companions up to a plateau . As far as was possible I followed the route I thought the meteor had taken . L'Encuerado was just making his way into the forest when Sumichrast noticed a broken tree , a little to the right . I leaped up on the slope , and soon remarked that the ground , for a space of at least twenty yards , was strewn with black or green stones , which had been in a fused state , and evidently bore the appearance of iron scoriae . There could be no doubt about it ; the tree which had been struck had caused the explosion of the meteor , and had broken under the shock . " These , therefore , are the remains of some of your sky-lanterns , " said Lucien to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shining like metal . The Indian shook his head without answering . The fallen tree , the burned and blackened trunk , the withered and even scorched grass , these strange-looking stones  --  every thing visibly combined to upset his theory . Each of us added to his load one of the aerolites ; then , again returning to the plateau , we plunged into the forest . One shot that Sumichrast made rendered him happy for the whole day . He had knocked down a green-colored crossbill , of a species still unknown in Europe . " What a queer bird ! " cried Lucien . " How did it manage to eat with its mouth all awry ? " " Its mouth , " replied Sumichrast , smiling , " is well adapted to its food . This bird  --  which we have here met with quite by chance , as it usually frequents mountain-tops  --  feeds on roots , buds , and pine-cones . Owing to its two mandibles being so strongly made and so curiously arranged it can cut through , as if with a pair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beak could never penetrate . " " God is mindful of all His creatures , " muttered l'Encuerado , who was helping to skin the bird . " I had always fancied that these poor creatures were deformed . " Towards midday the chances of our path brought us to the bottom of a narrow valley in the midst of a clump of shrubs ; this seemed a fit spot for our bivouac . In the twinkling of an eye , the ground was cleared of brush-wood and our hut constructed . We had scarcely sat down to take breath when a slight rustling in the foliage attracted our attention , and an animal with a bushy tail sprang down from a tree . Gringalet darted at it , but an abominable smell , which almost suffocated us , at once made him retreat . A skunk , which in shape and color somewhat resembles a squirrel , had thus perfectly poisoned our bivouac . Illustration : " Above us , the trees crossed their branches . " Nothing was left for us but to decamp as quickly as possible , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . L'Encuerado could not find enough bad names for abusing the animal , which , however , had only availed itself of the means of defense with which nature has endowed it . Each of us now resumed his burden , sadly enough , I must confess , and not without throwing a disappointed glance at our hut . Sumichrast led the way , and did not stop till we found ourselves perfectly exhausted at the entrance to a deep and narrow gorge . We still felt sickened by the horrible stench produced by the skunk , and , as we did not wish to expose ourselves again to a similar misfortune , we took care , before constructing a fresh hut , to search round the shrubs and bushes . A few birds shot on the road rendered it unnecessary for us to hunt any more , as we had an abundance of food , so we all set to work to repair our wardrobes . Our shoes first required our attention , and Sumichrast constituted himself head-cobbler . L'Encuerado 's sandals gave him a great advantage over us ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strap , and then he was well shod . But , unfortunately , the delicacy of our skin several times afforded Sumichrast cause for regret that he had not been born an Indian . L'Encuerado , full of ingenuity , managed to fix some pieces of fox-skin on some old soles , and made for Lucien a pair of buskins as strong as they were inelegant . He promised to make us some like them , and Sumichrast , who succeeded only tolerably well in his cobbling , nominated the Indian " sandal-maker in ordinary and extraordinary to our majesties . " The next morning at daybreak we entered a narrow gorge in which it was impossible for us to walk abreast . The whole morning was spent in travelling along between two stone ramparts , hung with mosses , ferns , and orchids . The moist soil rendered the temperature round us sufficiently cool and agreeable ; but the pass was so filled up with the trunks of fallen trees as to render our progress very laborious . The gorge extended to such a length that I began to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entered into a cul-de-sac . The perpendicular walls rendered any deviation in our path impossible ; above us , the trees crossed their branches and almost hid the sky . No bird enlivened the solitude with its song , and ferns were so abundant that it seemed as if we had lighted upon some corner of the primitive world ; as if to render the resemblance more complete , the reptiles scarcely fled at our approach , and obliged us to use the greatest care . Cutlass in hand , Lucien climbed nimbly over the fallen trees which barred our progress . Ere long our feet sank into a quantity of liquid mud , and I discovered a slender streamlet of limpid water oozing out between two rocks . The pass between the rocks became narrower and narrower , and if a wild beast had then met us we should have had to dispute the path with it . As a rencontre of this kind was by no means impossible , Lucien , to his displeasure , was ordered to follow in rear . The way now widened a little , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ column advanced with rather more rapidity . We walked along silently between these stern and imposing granite walls , with the constant hope of seeing them separate and open out into a valley . Every few yards some fresh turn frustrated our expectations ; and if ever any pass deserved the name of the " Devil 's Gorge , " it was the interminable fissure through which we had been compelled to walk for so long a distance . At various heights there were half-suspended rocks which threatened to fall upon us ; for several previously had fallen and now blocked up the path . At last a sudden turn revealed a wide opening ; but our joy was of short duration ; nothing but a perpendicular precipice lay in front of us . We looked at one another in consternation ; we were prisoners ! On our right and left were perpendicular walls more than a hundred feet high , and impossible to climb ; before us there was a gulf with a vertical precipice . What was to be done ? Sumichrast lighted the pipe of council , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the abyss with his eye . We were seated near a plant with slender branches and heart-shaped leaves tinged with red , concealing here and there a flower of a violet blue . I recognized in it the shrub which produces jalap , and is called by the Indians tolonpatl . I called Lucien 's attention to it , who soon dug up four or five tap-roots of a pear-like shape . Jalap , which has taken its name from the town of Jalapa , whence it was once forwarded to Vera Cruz , grows naturally on all the mountains of the Terre-Temperee . Unfortunately , the Indians destroy the plant by taking away all its turbercles , and the time is not far distant when this drug , so much used in Europe , will , like quinine , become very scarce . I drew close to the precipice , and perceived l'Encuerado more than twenty feet below me crawling , with all the skill of a monkey , over an almost smooth surface . I ordered him to come up to us again ; but he did not seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dangerous position . Sumichrast hastened to bring me a lasso , which I let down to our daring companion . But instead of ascending , he slid down four or five feet , and placing himself astride on the projecting trunk of a tree , called out to us to let go the lasso ; this he tied round a stout branch , and disappeared down the abyss . It was not long before we saw him again install himself on the tree round which he had rolled the leather strap , when he called out to us that we might descend without any great danger . " How shall we fasten it ? " asked Lucien ; " there are no thick branches just at the edge . " " The strap is a long one , and there is a bush not far off with pretty strong branches . " " But then we shall lose the lasso , for none will be left to loosen it . " " Upon my word ! " cried Sumichrast , " Master Sunbeam is right . " Then each of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less impracticable . " I 've found it out , " cried I at last , with quite as much satisfaction as Archimedes when he leaped out of his bath . Seizing my machete , I cut two stakes of a good thickness , which I drove into the ground close to one another , about three yards from the precipice . While Sumichrast with a club was consolidating my work , I cut a stick about a foot long , to the middle of which I firmly tied the lasso . I then placed it crosswise behind the stakes . I considered that when we had let ourselves down to the spot occupied by l'Encuerado , a sharp undulatory shake given to the lasso would be sufficient to disengage the stick . When our preparations were finished , we let down the basket to the man who carried it . Then Sumichrast , who was the heaviest among us , slid down the cord to the tree which grew in so convenient a position . The stakes scarcely yielded at all to his weight . Continuing his descent , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extreme ; he was enchanted with this aerial route . " Now it 's your turn , " said I , as soon as I had drawn up the lasso . " Are you going to tie me ? " he asked in a disappointed tone . " How did you suppose you would descend ? " " By holding on to the lasso , like l'Encuerado and M. Sumichrast , " answered the boy . " The grasp of your hands is not firm enough ; you must not think of it ; I have no wish to risk your neck . " " Oh ! dear father ! do let me try . " " Certainly not ; for if your trial failed , you would not be in a position to try again . " Illustration : " Then Sumichrast . . . slid down the cord to the tree . " Not without some slight vexation Lucien was tied to the lasso , while Gringalet , astonished , barked round us . " Patience ! patience ! " I exclaimed to the dog ; " it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will not seem so pleased . " I let the lasso slowly down , and the boy was soon safely lodged among the branches of the tree . With care equal to mine , and with still firmer knots , l'Encuerado tied the cord afresh . Then , leaning over the precipice , I heard Sumichrast 's voice ordering the Indian to let the improvised cable slowly down . Seeing that the port was safely reached , and relieved of a great care , I began tying Gringalet , who had n't left off howling since his young master disappeared . In spite of his terror , I launched the dog into the air ; he struggled , howled , and nearly evaded l'Encuerado 's friendly grasp ; the latter , as he again let him down , tried to explain the inutility of his struggles , and the danger of breaking loose . At length , having for the last time examined the stakes and the cross-piece , I also descended . I then shook the lasso , and at once succeeded in disengaging it . I saw below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which led by a rocky declivity down to the foot of the mountain . Soon I joined them , followed by the Indian . We had fixed the cross-bar between two stout branches , and for a long time , without loosening the stick , I shook the cord . At last , tired out , and about to leave it , the piece of wood suddenly gave way , and nearly fell on me . Walking now became very laborious , and it was occasionally difficult to preserve our balance in passing over rocks , sometimes smooth , at others very uneven . Our path lay between perfect hedges of orchids , of which beautiful race Mexico possesses hundreds of species ; we stopped at nearly every step to admire some of these curiously shaped , brilliantly colored , but often scentless flowers . L'Encuerado pointed out many plants of the lynx flower , called by the Indians the serpent-flower , the fine petals of which are dotted with yellow spots , and marbled with pink , violet , and white . Farther on , another flower , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the animal from which it takes its name . Plucking as he went along , Lucien became possessor of such a bouquet as the richest gardens could not furnish . Of course he wanted to know the names of all , but he was obliged to be content with learning that , with the exception of the vanilla-plant , the brilliant legion of orchids furnishes nothing utilized in the arts or industrial skill . We had just reached the foot of the mountain , when an immense mass of stones obliged us to turn aside . I took the lead , and an involuntary slip brought me unexpectedly to a cave . My companions came running up in answer to my call ; I took three or four steps into the entrance , and immediately made up my mind , from its thorough adaptability , to shelter there for the night . While I , helped by Lucien , was collecting some wood , l'Encuerado cleared the ground , and Sumichrast cut down two or three shrubs which impeded the view . I then ordered the Indian to light the fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cavern ; which being done , it was necessary for us to go in search of game for our dinner . Looking from the plain , I could well judge of the feat we had accomplished in our descent . Up to the level of the cave there were shrubs and brush-wood . Higher up , orchids , with their bright flowers and opal-green leaves ; higher still rose a perpendicular and almost smooth rampart , utterly impassable except through the fissure which had afforded us egress . Sumichrast guided us through the thicket , where the frangipanni-plants , covered with their sweet-scented flowers , predominated , announcing our approach into the Terre-Chaude , and of a completely altered nature of vegetation . Soon an immense mahogany-tree ( Swietenia mahogoni ) , with its thick boughs and dark-green foliage , rose before us ; a little farther on a fallen ceiba had crushed four or five shrubs . The ceiba ( Eriodendron anfractuosum ) called Pochotl by the Indians , is one of the largest trees known ; its fruit , of a pod-like shape , contains a silky down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun . I was pointing out this peculiarity to Lucien , when a formidable buzzing noise met our ears ; a whole flock of Hercules beetles had flown out of a bush and struck heavily against the branches of a tree . Lucien caught one and wanted to hold it down on the ground , but the insect got away from him and continued its flight . Illustration : " I then ordered the Indian to light the fire . " " Oh ! " cried the boy , " this beetle is stronger than I am ! " " It is not for nothing that it bears the name of Hercules , " replied Sumichrast , smiling ; " as you have just found out , it is as remarkable for its strength as for its size . It is a native of Brazil , and is only occasionally found in Mexico . " " Do they always travel in flocks like this ? " " No ; the occurrence is so rare that I shall make a note of it . " " I smell something like snuff , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beetles , " said Sumichrast . And so powerful was this odor , that it caused Lucien several times to sneeze . This was another fact to note down . " Papa , do look at them hanging one on to another , and forming something like an immense bunch of grapes . Do they bite with those powerful jaws ? " " They are horns which you mistake for jaws ; but their arrangement quite excuses your error . Look ; the upper part of their body is black and polished , and their wing-sheaths are a greenish gray , irregularly dotted with dark spots . " " Here is one which has no horns . " " It is a female . " We were examining with some curiosity all the ways of the insect colony , which was scarcely disturbed by our presence , when Gringalet , who had also taken to sneezing , suddenly set up the most plaintive howl . L'Encuerado had placed on the dog 's back three or four beetles , which had buried their claws in his skin . The Indian , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relieve the poor animal , which was rolling on the ground ; at last he succeeded in getting hold of him , but he had much difficulty in freeing him from his vindictive assailants . One beetle , indeed , seized hold of the hand of the mischievous wag , whose grimaces much amused us ; as fast as he disengaged one of the insect 's claws , the creature  --  which possessed six  --  soon found a chance to cling on with others . Annoyed at having to strive with such a paltry enemy , l'Encuerado at last tore the beetle roughly away , but the blood flowed from his bronze-colored skin . Always too ready for revenge , he threatened to exterminate the whole colony of beetles ; but , smiling at his ill-humor , I forbade his perpetrating such a useless massacre . " They are nice gentlemen ! " he cried ; " because they had just heard themselves called Hercules , they think they are strong enough to bite the hands of every person they meet ! Stupid fools , with noses longer than their bodies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bite them ! Bite them ! " cried he , setting the dog at them . But the latter , with his ears drooped and his tail between his legs , refused to obey , and , from this day forward I remarked that the least buzzing from any insect was sufficient to render him uneasy . Sumichrast , who had caught one of these large beetles , placed a stone upon it which any one would have thought sufficient to have crushed it ; but , to Lucien 's great admiration , the six-legged Hercules walked off with its burden , almost without an effort . Ere long the beetles one by one resumed their flight , and came buzzing around us , so it became really necessary to beat a retreat , lest we should have our eyes put out by their immense horns ; Gringalet followed our example . Lucien sat down so as to laugh at his ease , for l'Encuerado , instead of running away , drew his bill-hook , assuming a threatening attitude to his enemies , and , like one of Homer 's heroes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole band of beetles united and suspended themselves to the branch of a ceiba , a tree for which the Hercules beetle shows a marked preference . But we had in the mean time quite forgotten our dinners , so we set off hunting in various directions . I skirted the edge of the forests , accompanied by Sumichrast and Lucien . We had walked for an hour without finding any thing , when four partridges , with ash-colored breasts , tawny wings , and tufted heads , rose about fifty paces from us , and settled down a little farther on . Having arrived within easy gunshot , I told my son to fire when I did , and two of them ( which savants call the Sonini partridge ) fell dead on the ground . These pretty birds are rarely met with in Mexico , at least in the part where we were . I now returned towards the bivouac , taking a path through the forest . " Oh papa , here 's a great sponge ! " cried Lucien , suddenly . On our right there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three or four feet above the ground . I saw at once that it was the nest of a termite , or ant , which the Mexicans call comejen . " It is a nest of white ants , " I said to my son ; " they are insects of the neuropteral order , and allied to the libellula . " " But where are they ? " " You will soon see , " I answered . So , kicking the spongy mass , immediately out came a multitude of insects , which swarmed about in every direction , as if to ascertain the cause of the disturbance . Lucien wanted to examine them closer . " Take care , " I called out to him ; " the termites you see are nothing but the inoffensive workers ; the soldier ants will soon make their appearance , and if they bite you they will certainly draw blood . " Lucien looked at me , thinking I was joking . " I am speaking quite seriously , " I hastened to add ; " termites , like bees and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first sight , live in communities , and build nests which are often larger than the one you are looking at . This nest , skillfully divided into cells , contains a king , a queen , workmen , and soldiers . The workmen are the clever architects , whose duty it is to build , maintain , and , in case of need , increase the curious edifice which you took for a sponge . The only duty of the soldiers is fighting against enemies that attempt to disturb the peace of the colony . " " But I see thousands of holes ; does each termite have a separate chamber ? " " Not exactly ; there is first a chamber for the queen , which is the largest ; then comes the nursery , afterwards a large compartment , in which the working ants place the eggs which the queen lays night and day . " " How I should like to see all this ! " Being convinced that practical illustration is better than the clearest explanation , I again struck the nest . The workmen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to examine the spot threatened , and in a moment after the surface of the nest appeared to be swarming . I then kept making a noise at one point of the nest only , when the soldier ants soon rushed out , easily recognizable by their enormous heads ; finally , I removed a small portion of the outside of the construction , and brought to light a multitude of white specks . These were the eggs , which the workmen hurried to carry farther into the nest . After having caused all this disturbance , I led Lucien away , for the ground was covered with soldier ants , and I was too well aware of the violence of their stings to willingly expose him to them . " But I have n't seen the queen , " cried my young companion . " She keeps quite in the centre of the building , immured in a cell which she seldom or never leaves , for her bulk is equal to that of twenty or thirty working ants . Sumichrast , who has been a great observer of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eggs a day . As soon as they are hatched , the young termites are carried off into large compartments , where they are fed until they are old enough to take a part in the labor . During the rainy season , a certain number of white ants are born with four wings , which enables them to proceed to a distance and found other colonies ; but these wings are only temporary , and I have often been puzzled by finding immense quantities of them . " " How do the termites manage to build their dwellings ? " " The one we have just examined appears to be formed of earth , kneaded up with a kind of gum which the insect secretes . In the subterranean passages of a termite 's nest there are arches which seem to be composed of morsels of wood stuck together by some sticky matter . These insects are omnivorous , and , like ants , take care to lay up abundant stores of provisions . " We were now commencing to climb the mountain , and , raising my eyes aloft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seated by the fire . Illustration Illustration CHAPTER XV . OUR SUBSTITUTES FOR LAMPS .  --  FIRST GLANCE INTO THE CAVE .  --  THE ELATERIDES.  --  THE GOTHIC HALL .  --  STALAGMITES AND STALACTITES.  --  A CHICHIQUIMEC CEMETERY .  --  THE " TREE OF ST . IGNATIUS. "  --  THE OPOSSUM AND ITS LITTLE ONES . Lucien had run on in front with the two partridges ; when I arrived at the bivouac , I found an enormous mole roasting on the fire , and Sumichrast catching with the utmost care the fat which ran from it . " How did you kill this animal ? " I asked , addressing my companions ; " I did not hear you fire . " " L'Encuerado knocked it down with the butt-end of his gun , and just at the same moment your two shots brought us back to the cave . " " Why are you collecting this fat ? Is it a prophet of some new dish in preparation ? " " No ; but I intend inspecting the cave , and with this grease we shall be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I approved of Sumichrast 's idea , and , as he had discovered a colony of moles , proposed to go after dinner and catch some of them , so as to increase our supply of light . Besides , I hoped that in this walk we should meet with some kind of resinous tree , the branches of which might serve as torches . Lucien could hardly restrain his joy , and wished to penetrate into the cave without further delay . He scarcely gave himself time enough to eat , and scolded l'Encuerado for being so slow , which was an indirect mode of asking us to hurry . Having again reached the forest , we searched for a pine or a fir , the branches of which , being full of resin , would have enabled us to show more mercy to the moles . Hearing us mention these two trees , Lucien wanted to know the difference between them . " They both belong to the Coniferous family , " replied Sumichrast ; " but firs generally grow upon lofty mountains far inland , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which is , after a time , consolidated and fertilized by them . " Sumichrast 's explanation still left much wanting ; I saw this from Lucien 's numerous questions ; but without seeing a specimen of each tree it would have been difficult to better describe their peculiar characteristics . After a long and unsuccessful walk , we halted in front of a guaiac-tree with dark-green foliage , a higher tree than any we had before met with . This fine member of the Rutacean family was covered with pale-blue flowers . It produces a gum used especially by the English in the preparation of tooth-powder ; but the hardness of its wood , which would have blunted our weapons , induced me to pass it by . A little farther on , l'Encuerado spied out a liquid-amber tree , valuable on account of the balsam that oozes from its branches when cut , which is burned by the Indians as incense . He climbed the knotty trunk of this colossus , and cut off some branches , which Sumichrast split into small pieces , after I had cleared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approach of night , and we made our way to our bivouac , each loaded with a heavy fagot . As soon as we arrived , Lucien had the satisfaction of trying one of our flambeaux . The branch crackled when lighted , and , as we entered the cavern , five or six bats flew out . I led Lucien by the hand , and very soon he was the only one who could stand upright . Afterwards we entered a vast chamber with a dome-shaped roof , which became lower the farther we penetrated ; this was rather a disappointment , as we had fancied there was something more to be seen than a mere cave . A heap of reddish earth in one corner attracted Sumichrast 's attention , who examined it to see if he could discover some fossil bones . Standing all together , we must have formed , by the smoky light of our odoriferous torches , rather a fantastic-looking group . More than half an hour elapsed without discovering any results from our digging . L'Encuerado , who had tried to crawl in between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he had , in fact , all but fallen into a deep pit . In an instant I was laid down flat on my stomach and crawling towards the Indian ; Lucien , owing to his size , was able to creep on his hands and feet , and consequently soon got in front of me . We could soon see down into the bottom of the hole ; the burning fragments of our torches fell upon a heap of stones at a depth of twelve or fifteen feet . L'Encuerado threw one of the torches into the chasm , and the vague glimmer showed us a yawning opening on the left . Delighted with this discovery , we now beat a retreat , deferring a more thorough exploration until the next day . The night was dark , and during our absence the fire had almost gone out . Just below us , a tree , the outline of which we could scarcely distinguish , seemed covered with animated sparks . Lucien opened his eyes very widely indeed , not being in the least able to understand this phenomenon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which have on each side of the thorax a yellowish spot which becomes luminous in the dark . Nothing could be more curious than to see innumerable glittering spots rising , falling , and crossing one another with extraordinary rapidity ; one might have fancied it a tree bearing flowers of fire waving about in the breeze . L'Encuerado came up with a specimen , which lighted up his hand with a greenish glimmer . Lucien took possession of it , and the two luminous spots looked to him like two enormous eyes . Suddenly the insect gave a kind of shock to the boy 's fingers , who looked at us full of surprise . " The name of the insect , " said Sumichrast , " is derived from a Greek word which signifies elastic ; and it has just shown you that it well deserves the family name which has been given to it . Examine for an instant how it is shaped ; the angles of its corslet form sharp points ; added to this , its sternum also terminates in a point which the insect can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second pair of legs . The women in the Terre-Chaude , by passing a pin through this natural ring , can fix this brilliant insect as an ornament in their hair , without injuring it in the least . Now , then , place it on its back . " " It 's pretending to be dead ! " cried Lucien . " Yes ; it does that , like many other kinds of insects , in order to deceive an enemy about to seize it . " " Oh , how it jumps ! " exclaimed Lucien . " That is its only means of getting on its feet again , when it has had the misfortune of falling on its back . Look ; it pushes the point which terminates its chest against the edge of the hole situated lower down ; then it raises its head , piff ! paff ! you might fancy it was a spring going off . It did n't succeed the first time , but now it is up on its legs , and now you 've lost it , for it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dart off in pursuit of it , as the route it had taken was shown by its luminous appendages . But it was long past our usual hour for repose , so we all sheltered ourselves as well as we could , and dreamt of our next day 's adventures . Day-break found us all up , and already comforted with a cup of coffee . We had been troubled during the night by mosquitoes ; but they were only the harbingers of the legions which are before us . Lucien , full of impatience , could not take his eyes off the entrance of the cave , and followed all our movements with anxiety . A hollow stone which l'Encuerado had found was filled with fat , a morsel of linen served as a wick , and our make-shift lamp soon burned and gave forth light . As the branches which were to serve as torches were being distributed , I noticed that a yellow and transparent drop had formed at the end of each . This gum , by its odor and color , has given to the tree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last , followed by my companions , I entered the cave ; l'Encuerado placed the lamp on the edge of the pit , and the bats which had been disturbed the evening before again commenced their whirling flight . Preceded by Sumichrast , I ventured down to the bottom of the pit . A narrow passage led from it into a vast chamber , the more distant parts of which we could not discern on account of the darkness . While my friend was exploring , I returned for Lucien . The lamp , thanks to the Indian 's skill , was safely let down without extinguishing the light ; lastly l'Encuerado himself made his appearance . Passing along the narrow passage , I soon perceived Sumichrast , who looked like some fantastic apparition as he shook his torch over his head , endeavoring to see through the darkness which enveloped us . The lamp being set down at the entrance of the passage , each of us took a lighted torch , and advanced at a slow pace . Sumichrast and the Indian skirted the wall to the left , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our smoky torches gave but an imperfect light , and we could scarcely see beyond three yards in front of us . A little farther on , the ground was strewn with fallen stones ; before venturing on this dangerous ground , I cast a glance towards my companions ; they were not in sight . I gave them a call  --  a formidable clamor resounded through the chamber , and Lucien crept close to me . " It is the echo returning to our ears Sumichrast 's answer , " I hastened to tell him . " They are in another chamber ; you call them now ! " The boy , agitated , raised his voice . Immediately the dark vaults seemed to repeat his words ; and the sound increased , as it moved away , as if a thousand persons , placed at intervals , were repeating some watch-word . A sonorous " Hiou ! hiou ! " prevailed over the uproar , and the face of l'Encuerado appeared on our right before the echo of the call had died away . " Come and see a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church made of diamonds , Chanito ! " We moved towards the entrance by an inclined passage , down the slope of which we followed l'Encuerado . The distance between the walls gradually increased , and soon we found ourselves in a vast hall studded with stalactites ; in it Sumichrast arranged the lighted torches . Illustration : " The wildest dreams could not picture a stranger . . . style of architecture . " The Indian was not far wrong ; we might easily have fancied ourselves in a Gothic cathedral . The wildest dreams could not picture a stranger , more original , or more fantastic style of architecture . Never did any painter of fairy scenes imagine any effects more splendid . Hundreds of columns hung down from the roof and reached the ground below . It was a really wonderful assemblage of pointed arches , lace-work , branchery , and gigantic flowers . Here and there were statues drawn by nature 's hand . Lucien particularly remarked a woman covered with a long veil , and stretching out over our heads an arm which a sculptor 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also shapeless mouths , monstrous heads , and animals , appearing as if they had been petrified , in menacing attitudes . The illusion was rendered more or less complete according to the play of the light ; and many a strange shape was but caught sight of for a moment , to as rapidly vanish . While we were moving about the cave , some long needles , hanging from the roof , touched our heads . " They are stalactites , " said I to the astonished Lucien . " The rain-water , filtering through the mountain above , dissolves the calcareous matter it meets with , and produces , when it evaporates , the beautiful concretions you are now looking at . " " Here is a needle coming up from the ground . " " That is a stalagmite ; it increases upward , and not downward like the stalactites , through which , besides , a tube passes . Look up at that beautiful needle , with a drop of water glittering at the end of it . That liquid pearl , which has already deposited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall down on the stalagmite , the top of which is rounded . After a time the two needles will join , adding another column to the grotto , which , in the course of time , will become filled up with them . " " Then do stones proceed from water ? " asked Lucien , with a thoughtful air . " To a certain extent , " I replied ; " water holds in solution calcareous matter , and , as soon as the liquid evaporates , stone is formed . " " According to this , " interposed l'Encuerado , " the pebbles ought to melt in the rivers . " " So they do ; but they do not melt so easily as some things  --  sugar , for instance . Do n't you recollect that in the Rio Blanco the water is almost like milk , and that it leaves a whitish coating on the branches , and even on the leaves with which it comes in contact . " " That 's true enough , " replied the Indian , who had often wondered at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abound . " But the water that falls down here is quite clear , " urged Lucien , holding his torch close to a natural basin . " But , nevertheless , it contains salts of lime in solution , the same , in fact , as all water , particularly that from wells . And it is for this reason that housekeepers will not use it ; for it will not dissolve soap , and hardens the vegetables that are cooked in it . " " Now do you understand this ? " asked l'Encuerado , addressing Lucien ; " I do n't . " " Yes , I do , a little . " " Well , you are very fortunate ! The other day stones were said to come from the sun or moon , and fly about all covered with fire ; now , they are formed by water . Perhaps M. Sumichrast will tell us to-morrow that they come from the wind . " The Indian then walked away , quite indignant ; we followed him , smiling at his anger , becoming more and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , our torches gave a very insufficient light , and the thick smoke rapidly blackened the arches above us . A great polished stone now impeded our passage , and compelled us to crawl . I took the lead , and , passing through a kind of narrow corridor , made my way into a small chamber . I raised a sudden exclamation ; for five or six skulls , symmetrically arranged , seemed to glare at me through their empty orbits . " Oh father ! " cried Lucien , " are we in a cemetery ? " Illustration : " Five or six skulls . . . seemed to glare at me through their empty orbits . " " Yes , my boy ; I think this must be a Chichimec burial-place . This nation , which preceded the Toltecs and Aztecs in Mexico , were in the habit of depositing their dead in caverns . " Sumichrast examined a skull which he had picked up ; its white and perfect teeth showed that it must have belonged to a man who died young . A few paces farther @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ground ; they were inclosed in by fine stalactites , and appeared as if they were grinning at us through the bars of a dungeon . For more than a thousand years , perhaps , these skulls had reposed in the niches which had evidently been hollowed out on purpose for them . The soil of the grotto had apparently risen at a subsequent period . What revelations as to the ancient history of Mexico might be contained in this cave ! Without much difficulty , l'Encuerado broke through the upper calcareous layer , and brought to light some loamy earth , out of which he procured a small cup of baked clay . I then began digging ; my fingers soon touched some hard object ; it was a small stone statuette . I had scarcely loosened my discovery from the earth , before Lucien also plunged his arm into the hole and brought out a little fancifully-shaped tortoise , the tail of which had been used as a whistle . Enticed on by these successes , we knelt down so as to break through a wider extent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burn palely , and the close chamber , now filled with a thick smoke , was no longer bearable . Sumichrast complained of humming in his ears , and I also felt uncomfortable ; so , much against our inclination , I gave the signal of departure . The lamp was dying out , and was filling the outer chamber with a nasty smell , which gave the finishing-stroke to our unpleasant feelings . L'Encuerado and Lucien were the first to leave the cave ; from it I afterwards emerged with Sumichrast , both being quite blinded , when we reached the open air , by the overpowering rays of the sun . Shouts of laughter resounded on all sides ; we had the appearance of negroes , or rather of chimney-sweeps . It was no use thinking about washing ourselves ; the contents of our gourds were too precious ; and besides , there would not have been water sufficient . As there was water in the cave , l'Encuerado offered to go in and fetch some ; but the smoke which escaped from the hole made me feel anxious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indian 's re-descending into it . We were surprised at the time our exploration had lasted ; it had taken no less than four hours . Although we had made up our minds to continue our journey on coming out of the cavern , the fatigue we felt , added to a desire to have another look at the subterranean wonders , decided us to put off our departure until the next day . After resting an hour , we all set off to seek our dinner . I examined with much curiosity the neighborhood of our encampment . The presence of skulls in the cave proved that some Indian tribe had once inhabited this locality ; but as the Chichimec ( or Chichiquimec , in the chapter-heading ) Indians constructed nothing but huts , time had , doubtless , obliterated all trace of their former presence . I can hardly describe the pleasure I felt in again viewing the woods , the verdure , the insects , the flowers , and enjoying the light of the sun . The interior of a cave , certainly , has the effect of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silence and darkness ; for the beautiful hall , radiant with stalactites , was but little likely to cause sadness . The effect on Lucien 's mind was of a serious character , and he seemed never to be weary of asking questions . " These natural hollows , " said Sumichrast , " often occur in gypsum mountains , but still more frequently in volcanic or calcareous masses . Some , which are as old as the world itself , date from the earliest upheavals of the surface of the globe , when the fused matter which composes the centre of the earth broke through the scarcely solidified crust , and , rushing upward , formed the mountain chains we now see . " Illustration : Crater of Popocatepetl . " Then the centre of the earth has been once in a liquid state ? " " It is so still , as is shown by volcanoes ; but the period of great catastrophes is past . The molten matter solidified on the surface , as it became cool , and then water made its appearance , and transformed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thickness of which is so inconsiderable when compared with the bulk of the globe . " " What is this molten matter composed of which is burning under our feet ? " " The same substances which we see around us  --  granite , porphyry , and basalts , which are called igneous or Vulcanian rocks , as contrasted with the Neptunean rocks , such as gypsum or lime , clay and sandstone , the agglomeration of which is attributed to water . The science which deals with these subjects is called geology , a study with which , some day , you will be delighted . " " Then all Vulcanian rocks can be melted ? " " Yes , if they were subject to as great a heat as that existing in the centre of the earth , which reaches an intensity at which the imagination recoils . But to return to the subject of caves . Some have been produced by the dissolving action of water . Thus , at some future date , the spring which we saw gushing out from the fallen mountain might dry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curiosity of future travellers the sight of chambers full of stalactites such as we have inspected . " Our geological chat was interrupted by an exclamation from l'Encuerado , who had just discovered a tree which the Mexicans call " the Tree of St. Ignatius . " Its fruit is of a brown color , with a woody husk , something like small melons , which , as they hang on the tree , strike against one another with a sharp sound . L'Encuerado informed Lucien that this fruit is in the habit of bursting suddenly with a loud explosion , and that the flat beans which they contain are much used as medicine . Illustration Sumichrast led the way through the forest , where we were sheltered under the tall trees . After a somewhat long ramble , during which we met with nothing but magpies , I requested l'Encuerado to guide us back to our bivouac . All of a sudden my friend enjoined silence ; an opossum , followed by five young ones , was coming near us on our left . The animal indolently approached a tree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its prehensile tail . Its progeny crowded busily round the foot of the tree , uttering plaintive cries . The opossum then came down again , and scarcely had it put foot to the ground before its disconsolate family rushed pell-mell into the maternal pouch . Thus loaded , the animal climbed the tree more slowly , and sat herself quietly on one of the lowest branches . We could see nothing but the pointed muzzles and black eyes of the little ones , which seemed as if they were looking down from the top of a balcony . One of them at last ventured to emerge , and crawled along the branches ; soon the whole litter followed this example . Sumichrast advised Lucien to clap his hands , and I ordered l'Encuerado not to fire at the poor animal . Frightened at the noise , the little ones hastened to their mother , who set up her thin ears and showed us a double row of white teeth . One of the stupid little things , in its haste to reach its asylum , fell down from the tree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it , and turned towards us her threatening jaws ; then , finding all her treasure complete , she disappeared among the brush-wood . " Why did n't you let me shoot at the tlacuache ? " asked l'Encuerado . " What is the good of killing a poor creature which would be of no use to us ? " " You know well enough , " replied the Indian , " that this ' poor beast ' finds its way into granaries ; that it devours the corn and also fowls , without reckoning the damage made by them in other ways . " " Yes , that 's true enough ; but this animal , at least , is innocent of all these misdeeds , for it lives too far from any town . " This scene had quite delighted Lucien . I acquainted him with the fact that opossums , kangaroos , and several other animals of the kind , the females of which are provided with a pouch to shelter the young ones , are , for this reason , called marsupials . The opossum is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and deeply-divided muzzle is armed with fifty-two formidable teeth , although the animal feeds principally on eggs , insects , and birds . The young of those species which are unprovided with the pouch , as soon as they are able to walk , climb up on their mother 's back and intertwine their tails with hers , which she carries over her back for this purpose . This instinct is perhaps more curious than that which leads them to dart into their mother 's protecting pouch . Time was getting on ; it now became important for us to reach the spot where the moles were ; and l'Encuerado predicted good sport there without firing off his gun . Illustration Illustration CHAPTER XVI . THE EARTH-NUTS.  --  A WILD-CAT 'S FEAST .  --  ANOTHER EXPLORING EXPEDITION TO THE CAVE .  --  THE BATS .  --  EXCAVATIONS IN A TOMB . While making our way through the brush-wood , in the hopes of putting up some game of a more appetizing nature than the opossum , our feet became entangled in the fibrous and creeping branches of the earth-nut , called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covered with white flowers , l'Encuerado dug up the soil in which the fruit had buried itself in order to complete its ripening , and there found a quantity . The tlalcacahuatl , which is classed by botanists in the leguminous order , produces yellowish , wrinkled pods , each containing three or four kernels , which are eaten after being roasted in their shells ; their taste is something like that of a chestnut . It is now cultivated to some extent in Europe , and the nut produces an oil which does not readily turn rancid , and is used in Spain in the manufacture of soap . Lucien and l'Encuerado were the most pleased at the discovery , for they were very fond of these earth-nuts , which , on the days of religions festivals , are sold by heaps in front of the Mexican churches . " It is the day but one after Ascension-day , " cried the Indian ; " we certainly can not hear Mass , but , at all events , we can try to please God by eating pea-nuts in His honor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunger dictated to us that we should hasten our steps . I therefore led my companions towards the bivouac . We had but just started again , when five or six hares came giddily running almost between our legs . Lucien was skillful enough to shoot one , and Sumichrast knocked down another . L'Encuerado loaded with the game , we proceeded to our hut . Being now reassured as to our bill-of-fare for dinner by this unexpected windfall , I kept on walking towards the entrance of a glade , the soil of which , being quite burrowed , betrayed the presence of the moles . Each of us lay down under the shade of a tree . Chance led me under a robinia or iron-wood tree , the trunk of which will defy the best-tempered axe . In front of me stood a tepehuage , a kind of mahogany-tree , with dark-colored foliage , which will become , some day , the object of considerable trade between Europe and Mexico ; the beauty of this red wood , veined with black , renders it highly fitted for the manufacture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advised Lucien to keep silence , so as to observe the operations of the moles , who would be certain to come out of their burrows as soon as the sun set . In fact , first one , then two , and at last twenty made their appearance ; and in less than a quarter of an hour I counted more than a hundred engaged in throwing up the ground , playing about , and fighting , all the time uttering shrill cries . Lucien was much amused as he watched them squatting down on their hinder parts , making grimaces , and gnawing the roots and bark . A single gunshot would have enabled us to double our store of grease , but it would have been a waste of our powder and shot . In fear of yielding to the temptation , I was thinking of giving the signal for departure , when it became evident that the animals whose games were enlivening us were actuated by a sudden panic . All the moles , which were solemnly seated , nodded to and fro their enormous heads , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air . Suddenly they all rushed towards their burrows . A jaquarete had scattered them by springing in among them . The new-comer , a species of wild-cat , with a coat of the darkest black , left two or three victims dead upon the ground , and then set up a plaintive mewing . This call soon attracted two young ones , which darted at once on the first mole they came to . Each of them seized hold of one side of their prey , spitting just like cats , and trying to tear it with their formidable claws . The mother was obliged to put a stop to the quarrel by an energetic display of authority , allotting a separate victim to each of her ferocious offspring ; then she lay down and yawned several times , while the young ones were tearing to pieces the bodies of their prey . When they had eaten all they required , the mother gluttonously devoured all that was left , without ceasing to watch a third mole , round which the two young carnivora were prowling . Whenever they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they seemed to know the meaning of this maternal injunction , for they crouched down to the ground , and drew back , lowering their heads , as if from fear . As soon as her repast was finished , the jaquarete caught up in her mouth the untouched mole , and made off without noticing us . " What do you think of these little ogres ? " asked Sumichrast , addressing Lucien . " How very pretty they are , with their black shiny coats ! They are just like big cats . " " That 's very likely , for cats are their first cousins . " " Do jaquaretes ever attack men ? " " No ; but , still , if we had tried to touch her young ones , the mother would perhaps have flown at us . " " To eat us ? " asked Lucien , opening his eyes very widely . " She would bite and tear us with her claws , or otherwise injure us . But seriously , as a general rule , wild beasts , or carnivora , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , whatever may be their size , it is unsafe to provoke them . If one of us , unarmed , had to fight hand to hand with a wild-cat , it is probable that he would receive more injury from the contest than the animal . " Night was now falling fast ; but , fortunately , our fire guided us to our resting-place . When we were yet some distance off , we were amused at seeing the Indian prowling round , or gravely sitting down face to face with the dog , with whom , no doubt , he was chatting . Suddenly the dog jumped up , pricking up his ears , and ran out to meet us , while l'Encuerado raised over his head a burning branch to throw a light upon our path . At day-break we were awakened by the voice of the Indian . The gloomy appearance of the weather threatened us with one of those fine rains which appear to last forever . Sumichrast went off to cut some long switches covered with leaves , one of which light boughs he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to enter the cave . " What are these switches for ? " asked Lucien , in surprise . " M. Sumichrast wants to catch some bats , Chanito . " " Does he intend to eat them ? " " Oh no ; though I have no doubt they would be very good . " " Their flesh is delicious , " interposed Sumichrast ; " the wing especially is a tidbit which I can highly recommend . " But my friend could not keep a serious face when he saw Lucien 's frightened look ; so his joke partly failed in its effect . L'Encuerado entered the cave on tiptoe . The rest of us , taking up a position at the entrance , made every preparation to enrich our collections . Two bats soon fell , beaten down by our switches . Lucien examined them without much repugnance , but the shape of their muzzles surprised him even more than their wings . One of those which he examined had lips cloven in the middle and doubled back ; the other had a flat nose and still more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two enormous holes , at the bottom of which were situate its black and brilliant eyes . Added to this , the membrane of its wings was so thin and transparent that it seemed as if it must tear with the slightest exertion . The poor little animal gradually recovered itself , and showed its delicate and sharp teeth . Sumichrast took it up , and hung it by the claw at the end of its forearm , in order to show Lucien the way in which these creatures cling to the rough places which form their usual resting-place ; but it suddenly let go its hold , and disappeared in the dark cave open in front of us . The bat , apparently an imperfectly-formed creature , was for a long time a puzzle to naturalists . Fontaine makes it say : " I am a bird ; look at my wings ! I am a mouse ; the mice forever ! " Savants , also , used to describe it as a bird provided with hair instead of feathers , and with teeth instead of a bill . Geoffroy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bat are nothing but the fingers of the animal joined together by a thin membrane . I had thus another opportunity of proving to Lucien the wisdom of our Creator , and the simplicity of the means He employs in producing the infinite variety of beings which people the universe . " This is the first time , " cried l'Encuerado , indignantly , " that I have heard the devil made use of as a means of bestowing praise upon Almighty God . " " Bats have no connection with your devil , " said Sumichrast ; " they are nothing but animals , rather more curiously constructed than others . " " Oh ! M. Sumichrast , then you can never have examined their wings ? The Satan that St. Michael is treading under his feet in the beautiful picture in the convent at Orizava has wings just like the bats . And as to these caverns , every one knows that they are the residences of bad spirits . " " Let us make our way at once into it , then , " said Lucien , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As on the day before , we descended to its bottom , and , skirting the left-hand wall , entered a wide chamber , in which water fell in a continual shower . We were inconvenienced by the icy drops which ran down our clothes , and I therefore advised Sumichrast to turn back ; but instead of doing so , he pushed on into a winding passage . Before long the roof became so low that Lucien alone could stand upright . I brought up the rear , watching my guides , who kept on ascending or descending , according to the inequalities of the ground . Sometimes it was necessary to halt , to climb over a rock , or cross a pool of water . At last I saw my companions again resume their upright position ; we were now in a hall , so vast that our torches were quite powerless to throw a light up to the roof . Surrounded by hundreds of bats , flitting round the torches like immense moths , and yet always avoiding them , we had ample opportunity for observing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their shrill cries , I again proposed to beat a retreat , but Sumichrast insisted upon continuing our search . He urged that the bats , who went out every night into the open air to seek their food , would not be likely to follow the narrow winding path we had followed ; there must therefore be some other outlet . My friend and l'Encuerado set off in search of it ; but I did not dare to venture farther with my boy over the damp and sticky ground . Our two scouts , however , climbed some enormous heaps of rock many feet above us ; and we suddenly lost sight them . Illustration : " Our two scouts climbed some enormous heaps of rocks . " The bats still swarmed round us , pushing their familiarity so far as to brush us with their wings . My prudence rather vexed Lucien , who had become very intrepid . After about five minutes , Sumichrast 's voice summoned us , and we bent our steps towards the heap of rocks which had been scaled by our companions . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I would not let go Lucien 's hand . Fortunately I did not do so , for suddenly he slipped , and , while trying to save him , I dropped my torch ; and there we were , perched up on this pile of debris , in utter darkness . " Do n't move ! " I cried ; " you know that we are surrounded by precipices . " " How dark it is ! One might fancy that the darkness was solid , and weighed down upon our eyes . " " The fact is , that we are in a darkness in which the light does not penetrate , even by reflection , and , like you , I could readily fancy that I was blindfolded . Call l'Encuerado . " The vaulted roof above us re-echoed the name of the Indian , who immediately replied . The bats now ceased their flight ; but when the light reappeared the uproar began afresh . Lucien related our accident to his friend , who , in his hurry to come to our rescue , fell several times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , lighting our torches , he guided us over the dangerous ground . When we cleared the fallen rocks , we entered a chamber studded with stalactites , on which Sumichrast 's torches threw a light , and the walls of the cave glittered as if they had been covered with crystal stars . From the ground , from the roof , and from the walls , clusters of variegated rays were reflected in every direction , as if emanating from ten thousand diamonds . The beauty of this scene was quite sufficient to dazzle far less enthusiastic spectators than we were . But it was not long before a repulsive , oppressive , thick smoke compelled us to move on , and a few paces through a passage brought us into the centre of an immense hall , lighted by an aperture into the open air . I joyfully hailed the blue sky , and then closely examining the ground we were treading on , noticed that it was covered with fragments of baked clay . Removing this , it was not long before we came to a layer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ branches , which , when pointed at the end , helped us in our digging . After two hours of hard work , we succeeded in laying bare more than a square yard of black and greasy mould . Thoroughly exhausted , in spite of my curiosity being excited , I was compelled to follow Sumichrast out of the cave in order to breathe the fresh air . A fine rain was falling , and I was so devoted to the idea of my excavation in the cave , that I was very glad to use the state of the weather as a pretext for putting off our departure to the next day . My companions had hardly recovered their breath before I summoned them back to work . L'Encuerado , as the hole became larger , was quite excited , and soon fancied that he could perceive gold . The fact is , that every Indian believes that all caves and grottoes contain unheard-of treasures , either the work of nature or buried by man , and that these treasures are guarded by some malicious genius , who allows the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but never permits their being carried away . " Do n't laugh , Tatita , " said the Indian to me , with a mysterious air ; " especially just at this moment . " Illustration : " The animal continued to retreat before him , and led him to the mouth of a cave . " He then went on to tell us that a friend of his , who was tending his flocks on the mountain , ran into the thickets in pursuit of one of his goats . The animal continued to retreat before him , and led him to the mouth of a cave . The Indian , hesitating at first , at length took off all his clothes , so as to be sure that he carried no iron about him , and entered the cavern . But he soon drew back , startled by the sight of fifty broken boxes overflowing with coined money . Instead of profiting by this windfall , and taking possession of the fortune by appropriating some of it which had fallen out on the ground , the stupid fellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and communicated his discovery to his friends . That very evening five of them set out , provided with sacks , intending to convey the treasure to a safe place . They camped in the vicinity of the cave , and the night wore away in drinking to the health of the good genius . As soon as day appeared , they followed their guide . First they ascended , and then they descended ; but they never succeeded in finding the spot where all this enormous wealth lay . " He was not able to find his way back to the spot ? " said Lucien , much interested by the story . " No , Chanito ; the cave had become invisible . " " Invisible ! but why ? " " Because they had some iron about them ! " " But you have just told us that he stripped off all his clothes ? " interposed Sumichrast . " Ah ! but , unfortunately , he kept his flint and steel in his hand . " The afflicted tone in which l'Encuerado pronounced this last phrase drew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cavern , and picking over with care the layer of charcoal which had already been laid bare , I discovered a small vase of burnt clay , full of ashes . On one of the faces of the urn was depicted a grinning visage , and in the interior was found one of the so-called pilgrim 's scallop-shells with the skull of a bird . Accustomed as I was , by long apprenticeship , to such discoveries , I had no doubt whatever but that a skeleton would soon present itself , and a skull was soon discovered ; then the vertebrae and tibiae of a human being . Next we found some obsidian arrow-heads ; and , last of all , some small broken clay figures . Unfortunately , it was no use thinking about carrying away all these relics ; so I made up my mind to give up further labor . Directly after dinner we busied ourselves in putting our baggage in order , so as to be ready to start the next morning at day-break . Illustration Illustration CHAPTER XVII . A FORCED MARCH .  --  WILD-DUCKS. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rained all night , and I awoke about seven o'clock in the morning shivering with cold . It was Ascension-day , and l'Encuerado , before making up the fire , chanted a canticle , and , after the manner of Roman Catholics , piously crossed himself . We were soon comforted with some coffee , and then , each of us resuming his burden , started off to reach the foot of the mountain . Before plunging into the forest , I could not help looking back with regret at the cave we had scarcely explored , and in which so many archaeological curiosities remained buried . The sun only showed itself at intervals through grayish-looking clouds driven violently along by the east wind . The state of the earth , moistened by rain which had lasted twenty-four hours , rendered our progression very difficult , for we were traversing a ferruginous soil . Such wretched walking put the finishing-stroke to our ill-humor by smearing and soiling our clothes ; for my part , I inwardly anathematized travelling in general , more especially in rainy weather . Just as we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no doubt scented something , suddenly rolled himself upon the ground , frantically . We had proceeded some distance before he rejoined us , covered with a coating of red clay , which gave him as singular an aspect as can well be imagined . The dog ran up and down , bounded about and barked , as if he was making it a business to amuse us . Nor were his efforts without success . We now reached a small plain , in which the sun flooded us with its warm rays . This had the effect of putting us into better humor ; for our clothes dried , and with the warmth the feelings of discomfort to which we had been a prey departed . We were again entering among trees , when l'Encuerado suddenly stopped . " What is that moving down below there ? " he said . " Some deer , " I replied , after looking at them through my glass . Each of us hurried to hide behind a bush , in hopes that the beautiful animals would come within gunshot . Several times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of the plain ; but I opposed his idea , as the distance was too great . We spent more than an hour in watching the flock browsing , playing about , and licking themselves ; but not one of them ventured in our direction . Tired with this inaction , Sumichrast emerged from his hiding-place , and the deer scampered off . Upon the whole , however , this delay had not been altogether useless ; for , thanks to the heat of the sun , the ground had become more traversable , and my friend actually hummed a tune as he took the lead . The time when we ought to have settled our bivouac had long passed , yet we were still on the road . The path we were treading was flat and unpromising , and the water from the cave , with which we had filled our gourds , was so unpleasant in taste that we longed to find a spring . Being unable to get a clear view of the horizon , I directed l'Encuerado to climb to the summit of a lofty tree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , having surveyed the prospect in every direction , came down far from pleased at having failed to discern what he desired . Fatigue , however , now compelled us to halt . Our hut was soon constructed , the fire lighted , and the stew-pot filled with water and rice . Not one of us felt inspired with sufficient courage to induce him to go reconnoitring . An hour after sunset we were all sleeping side by side ; l'Encuerado had quite forgotten his earth-nuts , and even dropped off to sleep without having been able to finish the chant which he commenced . I was wakened up by the cries of the tanagers  --  a beautiful species of bird which lives in flocks . Lucien , like all the rest of us , complained of feeling rather stiff in the joints , resulting , no doubt , from our long journey the day before . On the morrow our little party started with rather a hobbling gait ; the presence of the birds seemed to tell us that we were near some stream . Our limbs began gradually to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imperceptible slope , and the vegetation assumed a more tropical aspect . As we passed along , I noticed several pepper-plants ; and next we came to bushes , round which myriads of cardinal birds were flying . Guided by these beautiful red-plumaged creatures , we suddenly found ourselves on the banks of a stream , running noiselessly over a bed of white sand . With as little delay as possible , a fire gave forth its exhilarating flame . Butterflies , dragon-flies , and birds fluttered round the flowering shrubs . There was a perfect concert of buzzing and twittering , and a gentle breeze agitated the foliage and cooled the air . Nothing seemed wanting for our comfort but game for our dinner . Fortunately , Providence rarely does things by halves . We had scarcely sat down to take breath , when a flock of wild-ducks settled near us . They were at once saluted by a platoon fire , and four victims strewed the ground and water with their white , brown , and blue feathers . " These are the first aquatic birds we have met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be long now before we are among the marshes . " " What birds are wild-ducks related to ? " asked Lucien . " To swans and geese , Master Sunbeam , " replied my friend . " All the individuals of this order , as their name  --  palmipedes , or web-footed birds  --  indicates , have their toes united by a wide membrane . Ducks , many species of which are found in Mexico , have a flat bill ; and their short legs , placed so far behind , compel them to waddle in walking , although they can swim with great facility . " " How do they manage to perch on a tree with feet of that kind ? " " With the exception of the wood-duck , this family never perch ; they pass the day in dabbling in the water , and sleep upon its surface , or among the reeds . " " Then they must always be wet . " Illustration : " They were at once saluted by a platoon fire . " " Not so ; nature has covered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ renders their plumage quite water-proof . Ducks are gregarious , and migrate from one locality to another , according to the seasons . They are so common on the lagoons which surround the city of Mexico , that sportsmen scarcely will be troubled shooting them . " While l'Encuerado was preparing dinner , I and my companions walked along the edge of the stream . Before long I discovered some water-cress  --  a lucky discovery for travellers who are confined constantly to animal food . Lucien examined the small white flowers , which have obtained for all its family the name of Cruciferae ; these vegetables contain an acrid and volatile oil , which gives them strong anti-scorbutic qualities . The cabbage ( Brassica oleracea ) , turnip ( B. napus ) , radish ( Raphanus sativus ) , and mustard ( Sinapis alba ) , are of the crucifera order . To this list we must also add the horse-radish , the colza , the seed of which produces an oil well adapted for lighting purposes ; the crysimum , or hedge-mustard , a popular remedy in France for coughs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a decoction for washing wounds ; and the Lepidium piscidium , employed by the natives of Oceanica for intoxicating fish , so as to catch them more easily . " You quite forget the cochlearia , or scurvy-grass , so useful to sailors as a remedy for scurvy ? " said Sumichrast . " You are right ; but I think I 've said enough about the Cruciferae for Master Sunbeam to remember . " A few paces farther on , while we were looking for insects under the leaves of a shrub , Lucien drew back in surprise at seeing it covered with the pretty little creatures called tree-frogs ( Hyla viridis ) . Instead of flying towards the water , these reptiles made for the woods . Sumichrast explained to the young naturalist that tree-frogs have sticky disks on their feet , and by the aid of this mechanism they could move about on leaves and even on smooth surfaces . " In Europe , " he added , " the peasants shut them up in bottles half full of water , and assert that the animal predicts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top or keeping under the water . The tree-frog , like all its fellows , buries itself in the mud during winter , and remains torpid . This lethargy , which in glacial climates has the effect of preserving it from hunger , must in Mexico have some other cause , for in the latter country it can find food all the year round . The skin of the tree-frog secretes a poisonous matter . " " Come here and look at an apple-tree ! " cried Lucien , suddenly . I hastened to the spot , and found a shrub about thirteen or fourteen feet high , covered with berries of a yellowish color , spotted with red . I recognized what is called in the Antilles the soap-tree . This discovery came just in the nick of time , and Sumichrast helped us in gathering some of the useful fruit which would assist us to give our clothes a thorough wash . Lucien tasted the little apples , which were as transparent as artificial fruit made of pure wax ; but he did not like their astringent flavor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A quarter of an hour later , we were all kneeling on the banks of the stream and trying who could perform the greatest amount of washing , the fruit of the soap-tree affording us a plentiful supply of lather . In the Terre-Temperee , a root called amoli is a substitute for soap ; in the Terre-Chaude a bulb named amolito is used for the same purpose ; lastly , in the Mistec province of Oajaca , the poor find a natural soap in the bark of the Quillaja saponaria , a tree belonging to the rose tribe . Even in Europe , a vegetable soap is also found  --  the soap-wort  --  a little plant allied to the pinks , and which adorns with its unpretending flowers the edges of ditches , and is employed by housewives for cleaning silk stuffs and reviving their faded colors . Quite refreshed with our wash , we stretched ourselves close to the camp fire , looking forward to our meal of roast ducks dressed with cresses , rice , and seasoned with allspice . On taking the first mouthful , I made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had an unbearable aromatic taste . L'Encuerado regarded us with a triumphant look . " What on earth have you put in the saucepan ? " I cried , angrily . " Do n't you think it is nice , Tatita ? " " It 's perfectly filthy ; you 've poisoned us ! " But I soon recognized the smell of a kind of coriander with which the Indians occasionally saturate their food . Sumichrast , like me , had not got beyond the first mouthful ; but Lucien , who shared to some extent l'Encuerado 's weakness for the culantro , was having quite a feast . Our bill of fare was thus reduced to a single dish , and I left the broiled duck to my two companions and confined myself to the roast . With an artlessness that approached the sublime , the Indian , thinking that we should prefer the fresh plant to the cooked , the odor of which had been somewhat softened down by the operation , presented us with several stalks . On the whole , however , he was not altogether to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ style of cookery , and he had full right to be surprised at our repugnance to their favorite bon bouche . Gringalet just tasted the rice , then retired to roll on the twigs of coriander which were lying on the ground , a proceeding which did not much improve his toilet . The sun was setting , and hundreds of birds were assembling around us . Yellow , blue , green , or red wings were cleaving the air in all directions . There were finches of a violet-black , with orange-colored breasts and heads , some blue or golden-throated grossbeaks , and birds adorned with a variety of coloring , which the Mexicans call " primroses , " while a number of mockingbirds were warbling airs worthy of the nightingale . The sun , lost amidst the golden clouds , bathed the trees and bushes with a soft light . Gradually all became silent and nothing was heard but the murmur of the stream , while birds of prey soared over our heads on their way to the mountains . The eastern sky was now wrapped in shade and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every bush animated sparks appeared to flit about . I had been asleep more than two hours , when I was suddenly awakened by Gringalet barking . I jumped up simultaneously with my companions , who were also alarmed by a rustling among the dry leaves . Silence was soon restored , and I fancied , although the dog continued to growl , that it was a false alarm ; so I was about to lie down again , when Sumichrast 's hand touched me on the shoulder . An enormous serpent was gliding over the ground beside us . I at once recognized the black sugar-cane snake , which is only formidable on account of its size ; the planters are in the habit of attracting it to their fields , to keep them clear of mischievous rodents . L'Encuerado noiselessly left the hut . The snake raised its head , and slowly contracting its rings , and throwing round a bright glance , turned towards us . Sumichrast was just taking aim , when we heard the report of a gun , and our hut was almost in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the wounded reptile . There was one moment of utter confusion ; I disengaged myself as soon as I could , at the same time protecting the stupefied Lucien , and drawing him away . When I turned round , Sumichrast was approaching l'Encuerado , who , cutlass in hand , was hacking at the serpent , to render it further incapable of mischief . Illustration : " I at once recognized the black sugar-cane snake . " At last the fragments of the black snake , blindly tumbling about , became lost in the thicket , and all was again quiet . " Well , " said Sumichrast , " if , instead of being frightened , we had only kept quiet , the snake would not have troubled us , and we should still have had our house to shelter us . " " All 's well that ends well , " I replied , smiling . L'Encuerado again made up the fire ; Lucien complimented the dog on his watchfulness , who thereupon licked his face . This undue familiarity drew upon him a lecture on politeness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear . Illustration Illustration CHAPTER XVIII . WILD DAHLIAS .  --  A PAINFUL MISADVENTURE.  --  THE EUPHORBIA PLANTS .  --  THE WASHER RACCOON.  --  SURPRISED BY A TORRENT .  --  L'ENCUERADO TURNED HAT-MAKER.  --  NEW METHOD FOR DRIVING OUT EVIL SPIRITS .  --  THE ANHINGA . The next day , which was the nineteenth since our departure from Orizava , we examined and compared our compasses , and the course of our journey was changed . Hitherto we had proceeded in a north-easterly direction , skirting the provinces of Puebla and Vera Cruz , but still without leaving the Cordilleras , the numerous valleys and forests of which are still unexplored . According to my calculations , and also those of Sumichrast , we were then abreast with the province of Mexico , and we agreed to move westward , as if going towards its capital . " Why are we not to continue to keep straight on ? " asked Lucien . " Because our journey must have some limit , " I replied . " Up to the present time we have only traversed what is called the Terre-Temperee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in three or four days we shall again encounter habitations . " " Shall we see any people there ? " " I hope so ; do n't you like the idea of it ? " " I do n't object to it ; but it will seem so very strange to look again at houses and men . " " Oh dear ! " cried Sumichrast ; " you have become a perfect little savage . " " Travelling about on foot is so amusing , that I should be glad if the journey lasted a very long time  --  that is , if I had a chance now and then of kissing mamma . " " Poor Sunbeam ! " said Sumichrast ; " I ca n't help thinking of next year when you are at school . You will then often think of your present life . " " Oh papa , if you go out for another excursion during the holidays , I hope you will take me with you , for you see I know how to walk . " " Before we think about another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem to forget that the roughest part of our work is yet before us . " " Do you mean crossing the Terre-Froide ? " " No ; we shall only take a glimpse at that ; but in the Terre-Chaude , we may meet with many trials . " " Bah ! " said Lucien , kissing me ; " the Terre-Chaude is almost like home ; I shall behave so well , that you will be able to tell mamma that I am quite a man . " The sun was up when I gave the order for starting . Sumichrast went so far as to suggest that , after such a disturbed night , it would be better to spend another day in our charming retreat . " That 's the way , " I answered , " in which effeminacy gets the better of energy , and cowardice of courage ! Let us behave with more boldness , and not be seduced into delaying our journey . " My companion accepted the reproof , and without further delay our party were en route . The stream pointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the edge of it , sheltered by the bushes and enlivened by the birds which were fluttering about the banks , we shaped our course . Sumichrast showed us some dahlias  --  the flower which would be so perfect if it only possessed a perfume . It is a perennial in Mexico , whence it has been imported into Europe , and there grows to a height of about three feet , producing only single flowers of a pale yellow color . By means of cultivation , varieties have been obtained with double flowers of a hundred different tints , which are such ornaments in our gardens . Many a Mexican , who imports dahlias at a great expense , has not the least idea that the plant is indigenous to his own soil . The roots of the dahlia , salted and boiled , are eaten by the Indians ; it is a farinaceous food of a somewhat insipid taste . Certainly , the wild potato is not much better ; and who can tell whether cultivation , after having enriched our gardens with its beautiful flowers , may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plant rendered more succulent by horticulture . The course of the stream described numerous windings , and the desire of keeping on its margin frequently diverted us from our direct path ; at last it doubled round short to the left , and I bade farewell to it as if to a friend , but , nevertheless , preserved a hope that its capricious course would again bring it back in our path . Our road now commenced to ascend , sometimes crossing glades or groves . Suddenly a wide prairie opened out before us , and Sumichrast led the way through its tall reeds . After a quarter of an hour 's walking , our guide began to sneeze ; Lucien followed his example , then came l'Encuerado 's turn , and at last mine , and ultimately Gringalet 's . These repeated salvos were received with shouts of laughter and " God bless you , " often repeated ; but a sharp tingling in the throat and eyes was soon added to the sneezing . " I say , " cried my friend , " what does this joke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and discovered that we were surrounded with euphorbia plants . But this mishap soon became a most serious affair , as the sneezing seemed as if it never would end , and our skin , eyes , and mouth commenced to burn as if in a fever . On this occasion we did not care even to construct a hut or light a fire , but were only too glad to lie down on the bare cold ground , and seek in sleep some respite from our sufferings . Lucien , although very exhausted , endured his sufferings with such courage as made me proud of him . Uncomplaining , he soon went off to sleep ; but to myself and companions such a luxury was refused . At length , almost desperate , I woke up the Indian . Our faces had continued to swell , but the Mistec , regarding me with a stupefied look , simply grunted , and turned round to sleep again . However , it became important that we should have a fire lit to enable us to prepare our coffee : as for eating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With a slowness and awkwardness which I could not overcome , I succeeded in lighting some dry branches , and at length in making the water boil . I then called my companions ; they drank the refreshing beverage , without showing any sign that they were conscious of the service I was rendering them , for immediately afterwards they again went to sleep . It was at least ten o'clock by the sun when Lucien set us the example of rising . Suffering as we were , it was no use to think of resuming our journey ; so we made a virtue of necessity , and remained stationary until we felt more fit to endure fatigue . In the afternoon , Sumichrast and Lucien complained that they were famished , which was an excellent symptom ; so we took our guns , and , following in Indian file , ascended the course of the stream . We met with several pools of water , and then rocks strangely piled on one another , which had slipped down from the mountains above . I climbed the bank , feeling disposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However , I could see nothing but some toucans , far too wary to get within gunshot of . At last a squirrel presented itself  --  a poor pittance for five hungry stomachs . Sumichrast , who had gone on in front , suddenly stopped , and signed to us to be quiet . I glanced down the stream , and , near a hole full of water , I discovered an agouara , or washer raccoon , squatted down , dipping its paws into the water , and rubbing them together energetically . L'Encuerado fired ; it gave a bound and fell over . A lizard it was which the animal was washing before devouring  --  a peculiar and inexplicable habit to which it owes its name . It had a gray coat , and a tapering muzzle like that of an opossum . The agouara ( Procyon cancrivorus ) is frequently met with in Mexico . It is closely allied to the Bear family , but is much smaller and more active , and is both carnivorous and insectivorous . It climbs trees with ease , and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes incessant raids upon poultry . It is tamed without difficulty , and will run to meet its master , and seems to value his caresses ; yet , like the squirrel , which it resembles in its vivacity , it will suddenly bite the hand of any one who feeds it . The flesh of this animal is white , tender , and savory . Illustration : " Following in Indian file , we ascended the course of the stream . " L'Encuerado had dug up some dahlia roots , which he baked under the ashes ; but either this food was not exactly to our taste , or our still irritated palates could not appreciate its delicacy . Night came on , and the sky was full of gray clouds violently driven by the wind , although just round us the trees remained quite motionless . It was now too late to construct a hut , and we all stretched ourselves , without other covering than the canopy of heaven , on beds of dry moss . I woke up perished with cold ; not a star appeared in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plants , nothing now remained but a sense of weight in the head and a slight inflammation in the throat . I tried to go to sleep again , and fell at length into a kind of painful torpor . I fancied I heard birds of prey crying , and a roaring noise in the recesses of the forest . I got up with a view of driving away this nightmare ; but it was not a dream ; the day was just breaking , and the birds were welcoming its advent with many a clamorous note . A dull roar , like that of a gale of wind rattling through a forest , resounded louder and louder . I called Sumichrast and l'Encuerado ; the latter at once shouted out in horror  --  " The torrent ! " Seizing Lucien , I carried him in my arms , while the Indian hastily gathered together all our travelling gear that lay scattered around . With powerful efforts I soon reached the top of the steep bank , followed by my companions and Gringalet . Lucien , suddenly disturbed in his sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A furious uproar perfectly deafened us , and a flood of yellowish water came rushing by ; I saw one of our coverings float off on its surface , and almost immediately , as if impelled by some superhuman force , the rocks came rolling down , dashing together under the force of the liquid avalanche . One minute more and it would have been all over with us , or , at the very least , we should have lost all our baggage and weapons , without which our position must have been truly critical . As it was , our hats only had sailed off in company with our covering ; this loss much vexed us , for none of us except l'Encuerado could walk with a bare head under the rays of a tropical sun . We should have been somewhat consoled by meeting with a palm-tree ; but in the mean time , the Mistec , like all his countrymen , knew well how to meet such an emergency . So we covered our heads with the leaves of the water-lily , often used by the Indian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapidity with which these mountain torrents will overflow . If it had been a month later during the rainy period , of course we should not have exposed ourselves to the peril of camping in the bed of a stream ; for we had remarked the evening before that the sky was obscured by gray clouds , and this ought to have put us on our guard . The furious waves continued to bear down with them , without any effort , immense masses of rock ; but the body of the water , which did not increase , showed us that it would ebb as rapidly as it had swollen . L'Encuerado was obliged to content himself with some muddy water for making our coffee ; but if we had pretended to preserve all the prejudices of civilized life , adieu to all our idea of traversing Mexico . Besides this , we had a fresh disaster to grieve over ; the remainder of the raccoon , which we had kept for our breakfast , had been lost in company with our bag of rice . Illustration : " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the liquid avalanche . " We started again , not much enlivened by this series of misfortunes , satisfied with nibbling for breakfast some morsels of totopo . All our indisposition had now fortunately vanished , but we could not help feeling some degree of ill-will against both the euphorbias and the torrent . A long march , during which we several times left and rejoined the course of the stream , brought us close to a hill at the foot of which was a vast swamp . I gave the signal for halting . L'Encuerado in our march had gathered some reeds , and set to work to plait us hats . Leaving him with Lucien , Sumichrast and I went off in quest of game . On our return from an unproductive ramble , I saw that my son was already wearing a funnel-shaped head covering . L'Encuerado offered me a similar one , which , as my friend remarked , gave me the look of a Chinese . After having rested a short time , I thought about again looking for game ; but the uproar of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This second ramble quite exhausted us , without producing any prey but a tanager , far too small to afford food for so many . L'Encuerado and Lucien , both out in the midst of the swamp , perceived us approaching . The young gentleman came running towards us , holding his newly-made hat in his hand ; but , in his haste , he forgot that the bed of a marsh is almost always slippery , and he fell flat on his face among some aquatic plants . In one leap the Indian was close to him , and soon picked him up ; but , instead of complaining of his fall , Lucien looked up at the Indian with a troubled face . The fact was , his hat held some fish he had caught with his insect-net , and at least a third of them had disappeared from his disaster . " Oh dear ! oh dear ! " cried Sumichrast , who could not help smiling at the piteous face of the young fisherman ; " most decidedly , we are all unfortunate . " This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who smote his forehead as if suddenly struck by some idea . " It is the genius of the cave ! " he cried . " Ah ! the scoundrel , after all he owes me , and the precautions I took ! " " What precautions ? " asked Lucien , surprised . " I picked up seven white pebbles , and drew out a beautiful cross . " " What did the cross matter to him ? " " Matter to him ! why , Chanito , he knows well that we are Christians , and yet he bewitches us . Wait a bit , I 'll match him . " And rearing himself up against the trunk of a tree , standing on his head , with his legs in the air , l'Encuerado kicked about with all the frenzy of one possessed . He fell sometimes to the right , and sometimes to the left , but raised himself after every fall , and resumed his clown-like attitude . Not one of us could keep a serious countenance while looking at his contortions . Lucien laughed till @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on purpose to render the scene more comical , accompanied his gestures with invectives against the genius of the cave and invocations to St. Joseph . At last I told him to resume his natural position , and to keep quiet . " Do you really think that I have done it enough ? " he asked , addressing me with imperturbable gravity . " Yes , " I replied ; " from the way in which you have shaken him , I should say he must have come out either through your mouth or ears . " " Then it 's your turn now , Chanito ! " Lucien , delighted at having to execute this feat of skill , tried several times to keep his balance while standing on his head ; but overcome by laughter , he was not able , so he fell , to rear himself up again . The more l'Encuerado cried out to him , urging him to persevere , the louder the boy laughed . The brave Indian , who was under the full belief that an evil spirit must necessarily abandon a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young master and shook him violently as if he was emptying a sack . Sumichrast at last put an end to this scene by declaring that he was sure the spirit must have taken flight . L'Encuerado then came up to my friend and proposed to assist him into the same position as he had helped Lucien . Illustration : " L'Encuerado . . . set to work to plait us hats . " " That 's enough of it , " I cried as soon as laughing allowed me to speak ; " M. Sumichrast and I have other means of expelling evil spirits . " L'Encuerado looked at me with wonder , more convinced than ever that my power far exceeded that of the sorcerers of his own country . We were now close to our fire . Lucien was gravely repeating the words which l'Encuerado had addressed to the demon , when Gringalet commenced howling . L'Encuerado had seized the poor animal by his hind legs , and was violently shaking him , head downward . " It 's all for your good , " said the Indian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the evil spirit which you have in your body will be certain to make you commit some folly ? " Lucien rushed to the assistance of his faithful friend , and at last induced the Mistec to let him go . Not the least convinced of l'Encuerado 's kind intentions towards him , Gringalet seemed to bear malice towards the Indian , and for three days was very shy of coming near him . After this scene the preparations for dinner occupied our attention . If our guns had been more successful , we should have had fat to fry our fish in . While we were deploring our ill-luck , I noticed a flock of birds like ducks flying high up in the air ; they made a wide circle and settled down on the top of a tree . L'Encuerado fired at them , and one fell . It was an anhinga , one of the most singular specimens of web-footed birds that can be found anywhere . Represent to yourself an enormous duck with a neck like a swan , a bill straight , tapering , and longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and well-feathered wings , and then know the anhinga . It dives and flies with equal facility , can swim under the water and perch upon trees , the highest of which it chooses for building its nest upon . The flesh of the anhinga is not valuable , as it is hard and tough . Perhaps a good appetite rendered me indulgent , but I found the flavor very much like that of duck . The fat of this bird , carefully saved , was used for frying our fish . The latter , I must confess , did not seem to us so nice as the dark-colored meat of the anhinga . If it tasted rather fishy , the fish themselves tasted muddy ; on the whole , however , our bill-of-fare was a tolerable one . When night-fall came on , the trees stood out in bold relief against the transparent sky , and l'Encuerado , delighted at thinking that he was now unbewitched , gratified us with one of his unpublished canticles , which materially helped to send us to sleep . Illustration Illustration CHAPTER XIX . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CHILDHOOD .  --  THE MIRAGE.  --  A FIRE IN THE PLAIN . By ten o'clock in the morning we had crossed some rising ground , and were passing through a narrow gorge carpeted with ferns . Lucien headed the party , closely followed by l'Encuerado ; and led us on to a kind of rocky staircase , down which , in the rainy season , water doubtlessly flowed . This steep path compelled us to halt several times to recover our breath . The branches of the bushes formed an archway over our heads , and their blossoms surrounded us with their rich perfume . At length a rise in the ground impeded our path , and the heat commenced to inconvenience us . The refraction of light , especially , affected our eyes , and our feet raised perfect clouds of dust . Lucien , who had become quite an enduring walker , throughout kept in front , and often gained ground while we were stopping to take breath . Just as we reached the ridge of the hill , I saw the boy , who was a few yards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ran to him , but he disappeared down the slope , crying out to me that he had shot a dragon ! I soon came up , and found the young sportsman standing in front of a magnificent black iguana  --  Cyclura acanthura  --  which does , in fact , somewhat resemble the supposed appearance of the fabulous animal described by the ancients . Its skin shone with a silvery-gray metallic glitter , more particularly on the dorsal ridge . L'Encuerado joined us when it was dying , when , rubbing his hands , he cried : " It is a guachi-cheve ; what a splendid supper we shall have ! " " You have seen them before , then ? " " It is an animal which belongs to my country , Chanito ; it abounds in the plains which slope down to the Pacific Ocean . They are beasts which can live without eating ; they are sometimes kept for two months with their feet tied and their mouth sewn up . " " The mouth sewn up ? " " Yes , Chanito , so as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , during the time of Lent , I used to go iguana hunting with my brothers . We sought them in the shallow marshes which are inundated by water during flood-time . There , in hollow trunks of trees , or in holes made in the mud , we found the black iguanas , and pulled them out by their tails . " " Then they do n't bite ? " " Oh yes , they do , and scratch also ; so we took care to catch hold of them by the neck , and tie both their feet and their jaws . Sometimes we used to pursue them up the trees ; but then , for they do n't mind falling twenty or thirty feet , they frequently escaped . " Illustration : " I used to go iguana hunting with my brothers . " Sumichrast completed this information by telling the young naturalist that the iguana , which is allied to the lizards , is generally a yard in length ; and that the female lays thirty to forty eggs , which are much esteemed by the native @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  has a flat , thin tail , and swims much better than the black variety , the tail of which , being covered with spines , is not well adapted for progression through water . Thus , meeting with a green iguana almost always indicates the vicinity of a stream ; but the black species is frequently found away from rivers . Lucien wanted at first to carry his game , but he was overtaxed by its weight and gave it up to l'Encuerado . Another hill was now before us , and the ground became at every step more and more barren , and on which there was little or nothing growing but a few shrubs with a bluish flower . When we had reached the summit of this second ridge , a boundless plain lay spread out before our gaze ; we were now on the central plateau of Mexico , in the Terre-Froide , eight thousand seven hundred feet above the level of the sea . What a change there was ! The white soil was so light and dry that it was carried away by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There were also some thorny bushes smothered in sand , and , a little farther on , some gigantic cacti astonished us with their strange shapes . The sun , reflected by the red glaring surface , much interfered with our sight , so we directed our steps to the right , where there appeared to be a greater amount of shade . " Oh , what a wretched country ! " cried Lucien . " Can we be still in Mexico ? " " Yes , " replied I ; " but we are now on the great plateau , almost on a level with the city of Mexico and Puebla . " " Are we going to cross that great plain ? I can see neither birds nor beasts on it ; in fact , one might almost fancy the very trees were thirsty . " " You are right , for it does not often rain here . Nevertheless , this ground , which at first sight appears so barren , is very fruitful when cultivated . It produces wheat , barley , potatoes , apples , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in short , all the European fruits , which can only grow in a temperate zone . On this plateau , too , grows the Maguey agave , Mexicana , a wonderful plant , which is as useful to the Mexicans as the cocoa-nut tree is to the inhabitants of the lands to which it is indigenous . " L'Encuerado had stooped down under a pepper-tree , and his glance wandered over the scene . The fact was , that we were now about the same height as that at which his own country is situated , and he might easily fancy himself near his native village . " What are you thinking of ? " said I , tapping him on the shoulder . " Oh Tatita ! why did you disturb me ? Here I feel myself almost as learned as you , and I could tell you all the names of those flowers which turn their bright faces towards me as if they knew me ! It seems as if I had often walked on that plain , and as if I had often seen these trees , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Chanito ; it 's all very well , but you 'll see ! Tatita will set me right if I tell you any thing that is not true . Look here , for instance , " continued the Indian , rising up and plucking a plant with slender and whitish stems ; " this is the alfilerillo , which mothers give their children to cure them of sore throats . Such shrubs are lost here ; for their fruit would be useful in my country . Here too , Chanito , is a mizquitl , a thorny tree on which we shall be certain to find some gum . Indeed , here are three morsels of it . You may safely suck it ; it will not seem very nice at first , but you will soon like it . Oh Tatita ! you have really brought me back into my own country . " " We are certainly on the same line , and it is not to be wondered at that you find here the same kind of vegetation as in that in which you spent your childhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sumichrast and I observed him with some curiosity , and Lucien , surprised at his emotion , looked at him anxiously . " Here is the ' angel-plant , ' " resumed l'Encuerado , suddenly . " How pleased my mother used to be when I found one of them . " " What are its good properties ? " I asked . " Oh ! it produces beautiful dreams , which seem to lift you to heaven . " The Indian again became pensive , sometimes casting a glance over the vast prospect , and sometimes pulling up pieces of the turf which grew at his feet . " It only needs a palm-tree to make the landscape quite complete , " said he , thoughtfully . In a minute or so he advanced towards the bushes , and , kneeling down , plucked a tuft of yellow marigold , which are called in this country " the dead man 's flower . " Afterwards I heard him sobbing . " Oh Chema ! what is the matter ? " cried Lucien , running up to his friend . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms . " Once I had a mother , brothers , and a country , " he said , sadly ; " and this flower reminds me that all those are now sleeping in the grave . " " Then you do n't love me ? " replied Lucien , embracing him . The only answer l'Encuerado made was pressing the boy so tightly against his breast as to draw from him a slight cry . This scene quite affected us , and I and my friend , side by side , walked back to the hut deeply sunk in thought . Hunger soon brought with it more commonplace ideas . The white and juicy flesh of the iguana was quite a feast for us all . Our meal we sat over a longer time than usual ; for in conversation we entered upon the subject of our native countries , and the theme appeared inexhaustible . I reminded my friend that , only a few days before , he had shown as much emotion as the Indian on seeing two butterflies which he fancied belonged to a Swiss species ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he so often expressed of taking up his abode in the midst of the wilderness , so as to live and die in solitude . On the great plateau the sun shines rather later than in the lower regions . As the luminary approached the earth , the sky was lighted up with a purple color , and I saw standing out on our left in bold relief the jagged outline of the Cordilleras of l'Encuerado 's country . The whitish ground gradually assumed a transparent appearance ; our eyes deceived us to such an extent that we fancied we saw an immense tract of water , above which the trees , appearing as if they were submerged , raised their green heads . The moon rose , and , far from destroying the mirage , it rendered the illusion still more striking . I resolved to descend from the hill in order to convince Lucien how much our vision was deceived . " There is no mistake about the plain being dry , " said he , as we returned to the bivouac , " and yet one might fancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water was rising behind us . " " The layers of the air , " I replied , " are unequally warmed , and their refraction , which causes the rays of light to deviate in their course , reverses the objects which cover the plain , and , on the other hand , causes them to appear more elevated than they really are . " " So we see water in a place where in reality there is none . " " You do n't take the sky into account , which is reflected on the ground beneath us as in a mirror . But the air is becoming cooler , and you will soon see the phenomenon slowly disappear , as if some invisible hand was pushing the mist back towards the horizon . " Illustration : " The moon rose , . . . and rendered the illusion more striking . " While we were looking down over the plateau , and watching the mirage gradually fade away , a distant light suddenly shone out . Loud exclamations hailed the sight of this unknown bivouac ; and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conjectures . We had not expected to meet with any habitation before the next day ; and the cry of " land ! " on board ship after a long voyage could not have made a stronger impression than the sight of this fire . The air was cool ; still l'Encuerado was not allowed to kindle a light , which would perhaps have betrayed us to foes . It was now twenty days since we had met with a human being , and our first feeling , after the instinctive joy at the idea of seeing our fellow-creatures , was , alas ! one of distrust . Illustration Illustration CHAPTER XX . THE MORNING AND NIGHT DEW .  --  THE TERRE-FROIDE.  --  WATER-SPOUTS AND WHIRLWINDS.  --  THE BARBARY FIG-TREES.  --  THE CACTUS-PLANTS.  --  THE VIZNAGA.  --  OUR HOPES DISAPPOINTED .  --  DON BENITO COYOTEPEC . The sun had not risen when we were up and ready to start . We shivered with cold , for on the great plateau which we had now reached , to which the inhabitants of the lower regions give the name of Terre-Froide , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dim twilight , afterwards by a fog , which penetrated our clothing as much as rain . " There has been no shower , " cried Lucien , " and yet we are all wet . " " It is the dew , Chanito ; it is almost as abundant as the night dews in the Terre-Chaude . " " Are not morning and night dews the same thing ? " " Not exactly , " I replied ; " the morning dew is generally of a beneficial nature ; but the Mexicans dread the other , which falls after sunset , and is said to be productive of fever . " " But from whence does all this moisture come ? " " From the air , which always contains a certain quantity , some of which it deposits on the ground , on stones and plants , as they become cool by radiation . " Just at this moment our attention was attracted by the first ray of the sun , which , piercing through a light cloud , shot across the plain like a bright arrow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obscured by a mist , which gradually rolled towards us . By degrees , however , it drew off , and the trees a short distance away showed their rounded tops ; while wide breaks opened here and there in the semi-transparent veil , and vanished as quickly as they had arisen . The telescope was passed from hand to hand , and each tried to discover if there was a hut where the glimmering fire had been descried the night before . The search was in vain ; the reflection of the sun 's rays quite dazzled us , and restricted the prospect ; but , once in the right course , we might advance without fear of missing our point , and , according to our calculations , we would meet with habitations the next day or the following . Gringalet 's tongue hung out of his mouth ; he found the journey over the nitrous soil very irksome , and the scanty leaves of the mimosa failed to screen him from the sun . What a contrast it was to the pleasant regions we had hitherto travelled through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so nice a one as mine , " said Lucien , addressing l'Encuerado . " My real native country is much more beautiful than that we are now in , Chanito ; in the first place , it has mountains and woods , and there it sometimes rains . " " Shall we see any snow fall , now that we are in the Terre-Froide ? " " No , " replied Sumichrast , smiling ; " you will not see any snow before next year , when you will be in France . The winters of the Mexican Terre-Froide are like our European springs . It is , however , never warm enough to allow tropical fruit to ripen ; but the Terre-Froide only deserves its name when it is compared with the Terre-Chaude and the Terre-Temperee . " " It seems to me to have been very badly named , for it is as hot now as the day when the south wind blew so strongly . Gringalet looks as if he was of my opinion , for he lolls his tongue out much more than usual . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Master Sunbeam 's remark shows that he is a first-class observer . You are as right as you can be , " continued he , placing his hand on the boy 's shoulder . " In the plains of the Terre-Froide the heat is much more uncomfortable than in the Terre-Chaude itself , where an insensible perspiration always mitigates the oppressive rays of the sun . A few days ' walking in this atmosphere will do more in bronzing our skins than all the rest of the journey . " My companion suddenly stopped short , and pointed to the horizon with his finger . " That 's smoke , " cried Lucien . " No , Chanito , " replied l'Encuerado , " it is a tornado . " Seeing a slender column of dust rising up to the clouds , I had , at first sight , formed the same idea as my son . It was , in fact , nothing but a whirlwind of dust , which disappeared soon afterwards . " There is no wind , " observed Lucien ; " how is it that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sand rose rapidly , whirling round and round . " " There is every cause for wonder , " I replied , " for no savant has yet explained the real cause of this phenomenon . " " If we happened to be caught in one of these whirlwinds would it carry us away ? " " No , Chanito , " replied the Indian , " it would be content with throwing us down . " " Then you 've had some experience of them ? " " Yes ; when I used to play with the children in our village , and a tornado came within reach , we were always delighted to run through it . " About a hundred paces from us , although there was not the slightest breeze in the air , the sand rose rapidly , whirling round and round . The rotation did not extend over a space of more than a few feet . There was no apparent cause for it , and the phenomenon ceased as unaccountably as it commenced . Lucien was of course dying with anxiety to run through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were quite beyond reach . " I think , " said Sumichrast , addressing me , " when it is thoroughly studied on the great plains of Mexico , we shall be able to explain the cause of this phenomenon . In a general point of view , these whirlwinds are nothing but water-spouts in miniature . " " A water-spout ! " asked Lucien ; " what is that ? " " It is a natural phenomenon very like what you have just witnessed ; but it is of a far more formidable character , for it destroys every thing it comes in contact with ! " " Did you ever see one , papa ? " " Only once , at sea . The English steamer on which I had embarked had just left the port of St. Thomas , in the West Indies , and we were still coasting the island ; there was but a slight breeze blowing , the sky was clear , and the water rippled with miniature waves , when , all of a sudden , a large tract of the sea ahead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapidly rose , and formed something like a dark and terrible-looking column . After about a quarter of an hour , the fearful phenomenon , which fortunately had kept on moving before us , remained stationary . The volume , incessantly swelling , assumed a dark-blue shade , while the column of water , which appeared to feed a cloud , was of a gray color . A dull roaring noise like that of distant thunder suddenly occurred . The column broke in the middle , and the greater portion of the liquid fell into the sea with a tremendous shock ; but the upper portion sprinkled us with a heavy shower . Half an hour afterwards we were sailing under a cloudless sky and over an unruffled ocean . " " And what would have happened if the water-spout had reached the ship ? " " We should most likely have been swamped . " " How dreadfully frightened you must have been , Tatita ! " " Yes , of course ; and I was not the only one who was in terror ; for the officers and sailors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Chatting in this way , we were now penetrating among Indian fig-trees  --  Cactus opuntia  --  commonly called prickly-pear trees . These plants , covered with yellow flowers , would , a month later , have been hailed with shouts of joy , for each of their upper stems would then bear one of those juicy fruits of which the Creoles are so fond . Lucien stopped in front of two or three of these plants , the dimensions of which were well calculated to surprise him . Sumichrast availed himself of this inspection to tell him that the cactus , a word derived from the Greek , and meaning thorny , is a native of America , and that it grows spontaneously in dry and sandy soil . Illustration : " Everywhere the cactus might be seen assuming twenty different shapes . " " You have forgotten to tell him , " added l'Encuerado , " that the tender shoots of the tunero , baked under the ashes , will furnish us this evening with a most delicious dish . " A little farther on , the prickly pears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cactus cereus of savants ) . Several of these plants were growing with a single stem , and measured from ten to twelve feet in height , looking like telegraph poles ; others had two or three shoots springing from them , which made them look still more singular . A third species , creeping over the ground , added much to the difficulty of our walking , and obliged us very often to take long strides to avoid them . In spite of all the care we could take , we scratched our limbs several times against their sharp spines . I again took the lead  --  for there was not room between the cierges to walk abreast  --  and , climbing up a small hillock , surveyed a wide prospect . Such a complete change could not possibly have taken place in so short a time in any other country . More trees , more shrubs , more bushes ! Everywhere the cactus might be seen assuming twenty different shapes  --  round , straight , conical , or flattened , and really seeming as if it delighted in assuming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there the cierges , standing side by side , seemed to vie with each other in height , sometimes attaining to as much as twenty to thirty feet , while the young shoots resembled a palisade , or one of those impenetrable hedges with which the Indians who live on the plateau surround their dwellings . Farther on , there were vast vegetable masses of a spherical shape , covered with rose-colored , horny , and transparent thorns , which displayed across our path all their huge rotundity , really exhibiting nothing vegetable to the eye but their color . Here and there , too , some creeping species , with their branches full of thorns , formed a perfect thicket ; one might almost have fancied that they were a hundred-headed hydra . " We might almost imagine we were in a hot-house full of rich-growing plants and golden-colored flowers , " said Sumichrast to me . " Yes , " I replied ; " but we must also imagine that we are looking at them through the lens of a microscope . What would a Parisian say if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointing to was at least six feet in height and three times that in circumference . " When I was a shepherd , " said l'Encuerado , " I led my goats into one of the plains where the viznagas grow . With my machete I made a cut into one side of the plant , and my goats immediately began to eat the pith with which it was filled . Gradually they hollowed out a hole large enough for two or three of them to enter at once , and this make-shift hut afforded me a first-rate shelter against the rays of the sun and the night breezes . " " Oh ! " cried Lucien , with enthusiasm , " if we have to camp in these fields , we must have such a house . " I again examined the landscape round us . There was nothing whatever which betrayed the vicinity of man . Everywhere the cacti spread out their variously-shaped flowers , which were nearly all yellowish or pink . Above us was a fiery sky , in which nothing seemed to move but a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in constant motion . The Indian led the way , followed by Lucien . " A footpath ! " the boy suddenly cried out . " A mimosa ! " exclaimed Sumichrast , whose great height towered over us all . " A hut ! " murmured l'Encuerado , stopping and holding his finger to his lips . We looked at each other ; then , bending our steps towards the spot pointed out by our companion , we each inspected the thatched roof , of which only the top was visible . With a rapid glance at my weapons I advanced carefully , followed by Sumichrast . Lucien , l'Encuerado , and Gringalet brought up the rear . We really felt some degree of emotion ; the idea of seeing any human beings but ourselves quite made our hearts beat ; for were we going to meet enemies or friends ? This was the important question to be decided . The path soon became wider ; we were now scarcely two hundred paces from the hut , and we were astonished not to hear the barking of dogs , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was now in front , came back . " This silence seems to me a bad omen , " he said ; " take care we do n't fall into some ambuscade ; I do n't at all wish to be robbed , or , worse still , murdered . " Leaving the path to our left , we made our way among the cacti . " Are we in a savage country ? " asked Lucien . " Possibly , and that is why we have to be so careful , " I answered . " Do you think any one will hurt us ? " " The mere sight of our weapons might inspire the Indians with a desire of obtaining them ; in a spot where every one can do as he likes , there is nothing to prevent them stripping us and sending us away naked . " " They are not Christians , then ? " " Ah , Chanito , they ought to be , " muttered the Indian . And , taking off his load , we soon lost sight of him among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frightened look , when he saw us take so many precautions in approaching a human dwelling , would have amused ; but , so far from doing so now , we listened anxiously for the least sound . At last we heard l'Encuerado 's loud and welcome " Hiou ! hiou ! " The hut was perfectly empty . After an hour 's rest , passed by the boy in rambling round it , I gave the word for starting again . The Indian took the lead , following the still visible traces of a footpath . The hut , hardly large enough to hold three persons , seemed more like a temporary shelter than a settled dwelling ; l'Encuerado , who was a great authority in such matters , was of opinion that it was only an offshoot to a larger settlement . After a tolerably long walk , another footpath crossed the one we were following ; on its surface we noticed prints of naked feet  --  even those of women and children . But although we carefully examined the horizon , nothing but the immense white uninterrupted plain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damped our ardor . Ever since the morning , we had been walking on in the hopes of meeting with a human dwelling . We had scarcely eaten any thing , and hunger and thirst were added to the disappointment we had met with . Lucien proposed to hollow out a viznaga to sleep in  --  a project in which he was encouraged by l'Encuerado 's telling him that we might have the luxury of a window , and could keep off wild beasts by filling up the entrance with thorny cierges . It may readily be understood how much the idea of bivouacking inside a plant pleased the fancy of our young companion ; and perhaps we should have assisted in realizing his wish , if the barking of a dog had not attracted our attention ; so we recommenced our march in better spirits . A rapid descent brought us near a number of tree-ferns , a change of vegetation which we looked upon as a good omen . L'Encuerado continued to follow the footpath , until he suddenly stopped on a gentle eminence , which overlooked a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my great joy I counted as many as six palm-leaf huts . The sight refreshed us so marvellously , that we all descended with rapid , long strides . Every now and then either a cock crowing , a turkey gobbling , or a dog barking , came as music to our ears , and I can hardly describe what pleasant feelings these familiar noises produced . As we went on , the bushes on each side of the path screened our view of the huts . The neigh of a horse attracted our attention , and a man , mounted bare-backed , made his appearance about a hundred paces from us . " Halt ! " I cried to my companions . With my gun hung to my cross-belt , and my hat in hand , I advanced alone towards the rider , who had suddenly reined in his steed . " Ave Maria ! " said I , going up to him . " Her holy name be blessed ! " answered the horseman , raising his cap , from which several locks of white hair escaped . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , a little . " " Are you the chief of the village ? " " What do you want ? " " We require water and a roof to shelter us . " " You are not alone , I see ; from whom do you come ? " " We are nothing but travellers wandering through the forests to seek for plants and animals with healing properties . " " But you are armed ? " " Well , we have a child to protect , and the brutes of the forest are fierce . " " Are you speaking the truth ? " I then called Lucien , who doffed his hat to the old man and saluted him . " Child , may God bless you ! " " Are we to consider ourselves your guests ? " " Yes , you are the guests of Coyotepec ; come along with me . " Sumichrast and l'Encuerado also approached the horseman , who dismounted and then led the way . The latter conversed with the Indian in the Mistec tongue , an idiom which Lucien alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From the way in which the old man scanned us , I imagined that l'Encuerado had represented us to him as white sorcerers of no ordinary skill . Coyotepec  --  or " Stone Wolf "  --  might have been about seventy years of age . He was born in this ravine , to which he had given the name of the " Mountain 's Mouth , " though I am ignorant of the reason for the designation . He had been taken , when very young , by one of his uncles to Puebla , but he had soon left the city with the intention of rebuilding the paternal hut , and of knowing nothing of the world beyond his own domain . His six children were all married and lived near him , and the little colony numbered as many as thirty individuals . He was an Indian of the Tlascalan race , as robust and nimble as a man of forty , of middle height , with a brown skin . He wore a hat made of palm-tree straw , and was dressed in a white woollen jacket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cotton drawers , scarcely covering his knees , completed his costume . " What is the nearest town to this ? " asked Sumichrast . " Puebla , " was the answer . " How far off is it ? " " About eight days ' journey . " As the usual day 's journey of the Indian is ten leagues a day , the distance must have been about eighty leagues . The old man could not furnish us with any other geographical information ; he had heard the names of Orizava and Tehuacan , but never having visited these towns , he knew nothing of the distance we were from them . For forty years , with the exception of the relations of his sons and daughters-in-law , who paid him a visit annually , we were the first persons who had disturbed his solitude . We availed ourselves of the trunk of a tree to cross the brook , when our guide soon stopped in front of a hut . Four naked children , the eldest of whom might have been ten years old , inspected us with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , and although we were dreadfully bronzed , their surprise was very great . A young woman , whose clothing consisted of a piece of cloth folded round her hips , saluted us in broken Spanish , and bid us welcome . The old man introduced us to his eldest son , named Torribio , a man about forty years of age . His clothing was not quite so primitive as that of his father , but consisted of slashed trowsers ornamented with silver buttons , a cotton shirt , and a felt hat covered with varnished leather . The little colony employed themselves in collecting cochineal , which Torribio carried to Puebla for sale , and this fact accounted for his more civilized costume . At length the old man asked us to come into his hut , round which a large part of his family were assembling . He called his wife , who was a little old woman , dressed in a long cotton gown ; then he addressed us , pointing to his children and grandchildren , and said : " You are my guests ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relatives are your servants . " Illustration CHAPTER XXI . BLACK SKINS AND WHITE SKINS .  --  WE HAVE TO TURN CARPENTERS .  --  L'ENCUERADO CHANTING AND PREACHING .  --  THE PALM-LEAVES.  --  VEGETABLE BUTTER TREE . The dwelling so generously put at our disposal was a large shed , divided into three rooms by bamboo partitions ; mats , spread out on the ground , formed our beds , and the remainder of the furniture consisted of nothing but two benches . L'Encuerado swept out one of the rooms , and , collecting some dry palm-leaves , made us a softer resting-place than we had slept on for the last twenty days . A troop of children  --  of both sexes , and perfectly naked  --  formed a circle round us , and watched our movements with surprise . I omitted to mention about half a dozen dogs , who were at first perfectly furious at Gringalet 's appearance , but afterwards contented themselves with growling whenever the intruder came near . When our baggage had been deposited in the shed , I went and sat down a few paces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sumichrast soon joined me . Gradually the sun went down , while the children , previously playing about , went to dip themselves in the beautifully transparent water . I told Lucien , who was dying to imitate them , to follow their example . He had hardly taken off his shirt , when the young Indians , who had watched him undress with evident curiosity , burst out laughing , and chattered together like so many young paroquets . " Why do they laugh so when they look at me ? " asked Lucien of l'Encuerado . " Of course , because of your white skin ; what else should it be ? They have never seen a human being of that color before . " " They think it so very ridiculous ? " interposed Sumichrast . " Yes , rather , " replied the Indian ; " but you must not mind it , Chanito ; for , after all , it is not your fault . " We and the young Indians now laughed in concert ; and this incident led on to a long conversation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had imagined , envied us our white skins , pitied us , in fact ; as no doubt he would himself have been pitied by Nubians , because he was only copper-colored . " Why , " said Lucien , who came up to us just as the discussion began , " are not all men the same color ? What is the reason of it , M. Sumichrast ? " " It is owing to the influence of the sun , which more or less colors the pigment of the skin . " " The pigment ? " " Yes ; a brown matter which exists under the skin , and gives to it a shade more or less dark . " " Then Europeans have no pigment ? " " Yes , they have , just like all other races of men ; only this matter does not affect the whole of their bodies . The brown spots which cover the face and hands of some people are produced by the pigment making its way through the epidermis . " " Then , " replied Lucien , " negroes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No , " I answered , smiling ; " the sun shines in Europe as well as in America , and however weak its action may be , it is sufficient to blacken the pigment . " " But if they always lived in the shade ? " cried l'Encuerado . " It would have to be perfect darkness , a thing which it is quite impossible to procure . " At this moment our host called us . On a rickety table , covered with a small cotton cloth , a bowl of thin soup , with tortilla and tomatoes , was smoking , and we all did full justice to our fare . This dish was followed by a fowl seasoned with pimento sauce and black beans fried in fat ; then some camotes ( Convolvulus batatas ) displayed the bright colors of their mealy interior , in the midst of a sirup with which l'Encuerado and Lucien regaled themselves . A large bowl of coffee put the finishing stroke to our satisfaction . Instead of bread , we ate some freshly made maize-cakes . Never had any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we had begun to get rather tired of game , which had formed our principal food since we left home . When the meal was over , Lucien ran back to join the children , who , seated on the bank of the stream , were plaiting palm-leaves together . One of them was very successful in making a grasshopper , and the boys , delighted with the praises of their guest , vied with one another in their inventions . They presented him with a bull , a fowl , a basket , and other articles , which were very curious , considering the material used and the skill of workmanship exhibited . Lucien , perfectly enchanted with these presents , and finding that our admiration hardly equalled his own , turned to l'Encuerado , who criticised the articles submitted to him with an artistic eye : " Then you , too , know how to weave palm-leaves ? " " Yes , Chanito , I can make grasshoppers , horses , and even birds . " " Only fancy ! and yet you have never made any for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were quite a little child I filled your cradle with them . But as they seem to amuse you , I will teach you to weave them for yourself . " At dark the children disappeared , and our host came to wish us good-night . I told him of the light we had caught a glimpse of the evening before . " It was Juan , " he said . " And who is Juan ? " " The eldest of my grandchildren . He is watching a flock of goats in the plain which belong to us . " The voice of the old man woke me next morning , and I got up at the same time as Sumichrast , who was still in a semi-torpid state from having slept so well . Lucien and l'Encuerado , who had risen earlier , had already explored the ravine , led by the youngest of the children ; for the elder ones worked , according to their several abilities , at collecting wood or cultivating the fields . Our first care was to unpack the insects and bird-skins we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and asked us innumerable questions . To our great disappointment , we found we could only retain the most remarkable of our " treasures . " Hitherto , the bird-skins had taken the place in the basket of the provisions we had eaten ; but , after making an inventory , I came to the conclusion that , when our provisions were renewed , it would be perfectly impossible for l'Encuerado to travel with such an increased load . So we were compelled to reject many of the specimens , though not without regret . Suddenly the idea struck me of questioning Coyotepec about his son 's annual journey to Puebla . " He will start in fifteen days , " answered the old man . " Will he go alone ? " " No ; he takes with him three of our biggest lads and six donkeys . " " And are the donkeys laden ? " " Yes ; but the boys start without any burden . " In an hour 's time ( an Indian never decides any thing without much consideration ) I arranged with my host @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could pack my valuables . Such a piece of good luck made us feel quite jolly ; for by this means we were enabled to preserve the whole of our collections , instead of throwing many of them away , as had often before happened . We were now in want of cases , and Coyotepec had neither saw , hammer , nor nails ; but he gave me some rough boards , on which we all set to work . L'Encuerado and Sumichrast smoothed the planks with the help of two woodman 's hatchets , while I cut pegs , all laboring without intermission until the next evening . A little before sunset we had succeeded in making two large and tolerably light boxes , a task which , without proper tools , was more difficult than any one could suppose who had not undertaken it . Sunday , which was Whitsunday , found us quite amazed at our performance . L'Encuerado had succeeded in weaving some mats to cover the cases , and preserve their contents from the damp . About eleven o'clock our host 's family assembled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls were dressed in red or blue petticoats , with their shoulders covered with embroidered cotton chemisettes : and the younger boys were clothed in a sort of blouse without sleeves . The grandmother was the last to make her appearance , and she had a necklace of very valuable pearls round her neck . The women wore ornaments made of bits of rough coral , and their fingers were loaded with silver rings . " We always assemble together on Sunday at the hour for mass , to say our prayers together , " said Coyotepec to me , " and to thank God who covers the trees with fruit , and preserves us in good health . " " We are Christians the same as you , " I answered gravely . Then every one knelt down , and the old man recited the Litanies and a succession of Ave Marias . After this one of the young girls chanted a canticle , assisted by the others , who joined in . The singer had scarcely finished her hymn , when l'Encuerado , perfectly electrified , entreated the audience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his favorite chants . He kept us at least half an hour in the burning sun , till , being tired of kneeling , I made signs to him to leave off . But it was lost labor , for my servant pretended not to perceive me , and only multiplied his gestures and cries , repeating the same verse three times running . " Amen ! " at last I cried , in a loud voice , getting up . Every one followed my example ; so , being at last set at liberty , I went away , while the Indians surrounded l'Encuerado to congratulate him . I had not yet paid a visit to the ravine , which , situated as it was in the midst of the Terre-Froide , yielded the same kind of productions as the Terre-Chaude . I called Sumichrast and Lucien , and , under the guidance of Torribio , the Indian who every year drove the donkeys to Puebla , we ascended the course of the stream . Our guide first led us to his hut , surrounded by Bourbon palms . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a strange and yet an agreeable appearance . From its very summit long stalks shoot out , at the end of which hangs a wide leaf , which is first folded , and afterwards spreads out like a fan ornamented with points . The Indians cut up these leaves to weave the mats , called petates , which form an article of such extensive commerce in Mexico . They are also used for making baskets , brooms , bellows , and many other household utensils . Torribio 's cabin consisted of but one room , and the fire-hearth was placed outside under a small shed . This primitive abode contained neither chairs , tables , nor benches . Sumichrast was full of admiration at this simplicity , which I considered rather overdone ; but my friend compared the life of civilization , in which luxury has created so many wants , with the lot of these men who can dispense with almost every thing , and decidedly came to the conclusion that the latter are much the happier . On leaving the hut , I noticed to our left a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which yields a pulp called " vegetable butter . " The avocado pear , called by the Indians ahuacate , is the same shape as a large pear , with interior of a light-green color and of a buttery nature ; its sweet flavor is delicious to every palate . It is either eaten plain , or seasoned with salt , oil , and vinegar . " The avocado pear-tree , I should think , has no relations among trees ! " said Lucien , smiling . " Yes , certainly it has . It belongs to the Laurel family , and is the only member of it which produces eatable fruit . Its connections , though , occupy an important position in domestic economy . First , there is the bay-tree  --  Laurus nobilis  --  the leaves of which are indispensable in French cookery ; while the berries furnish an oil used in medicine . Next comes the Laurus camphora , from the leaves of which camphor is extracted , the crystallized essence which evaporates so easily ; then the Laurus cinnamomum , the bark of which is called cinnamon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is said to be a powerful sudorific . " Our guide conducted us across a field of Indian corn or maize . Europe is indebted to America for this valuable gramineous plant . The common bread or tortilla of this country , which is a kind of pancake , is made from it . Before the maize is quite ripe , it is eaten boiled or parched ; in fact , generally throughout America , it is used instead of barley or oats for feeding horses and cattle . As soon as Torribio entered his own plantation , he bent down a few twigs of the masorcas without dividing them from the stem . " Why do you bend those poor plants like that ? Wo n't they die ? " cried Lucien . " Yes ; in the first place , because they are annuals , and our guide only hastened their death a few days ; besides , the ears he cut are ripe , and will dry hanging to the stems which have nourished them . This method is as simple as it is expeditious , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is nothing but a spring . " Behind the maize-field there was a hedge covered with long filaments of a golden-yellow color . These filaments , which were entirely devoid of leaves , grew all over the shrubs almost like a thick cloak . " What is the name of this wonderful plant ? " asked Lucien . " It is the sacatlascale , " answered Torribio . " It is a sort of dodder , " added Sumichrast , " a plant of the Convolvulus family . The European species is destroyed , because it twines round certain vegetables and chokes them . Here , however , the sacatlascale is allowed to grow , because some use has been found for it . " " What could be made of these stalks , which are so delicate that they break if I merely touch them ? " " They are first bruised , and then dried in the sun , " replied Torribio . " When they want to dye a black or yellow hue , all they have to do is to boil the paste in iron , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the banks of the ravine , Lucien availed himself of such a good opportunity by smearing his hands all over with this bright yellow substance . When we reached a certain height , we lay down on the grass . With one glance we could take in the whole of this small oasis . The stream meandered along , shaded with green trees ; here and there , among clumps of Bourbon palms , we could discern huts irregularly dotted about . I turned my eyes towards our host 's threshold , and , through my glass , perceived l'Encuerado , who was still preaching . He had evidently left off chanting , for his hearers were seated round him on the ground . Lucien took possession of the telescope , and I noticed that Torribio also seemed very anxious to try the instrument . I told the boy to lend it to him . Our guide , seeing trees brought so close to him , could not at first account for this optical effect . I then directed the glass so that he could see the group of Indians , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprise . The Indian , who appeared perfectly charmed , could not long maintain his gravity . Every time he succeeded in discovering a hut , he hardly gave himself time to look at it , but rolled on the ground bursting with laughter . Two or three times I put out my hand to take back the telescope , but Torribio hugged it to his breast , just like a child when any one attempts to take a plaything away . At last he consented to give it to me , and I felt really sorry that I had not another glass to offer him . Sumichrast led the way round the end of the ravine . Suddenly the birds , which were warbling on the banks of the stream , all flew away ; a goshawk was hovering above us in the sky . As it was flying swiftly through the air , it passed us within gunshot ; a shot struck it , and , tumbling over and over , it fell to the ground about twenty paces from us . Lucien immediately ran to pick it up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You are right , " replied Sumichrast ; " it is the Cayenne goshawk , which is characterized by having a head covered with ash-colored feathers , by a brown body , and black feathers in its tail . " " Will you skin it ? " " Yes , certainly , Master Sunbeam ; firstly , because this is any thing but a common bird ; and , secondly , during the few days we shall stay here , we must endeavor to fill the boxes which we have had so much difficulty in making . " At this moment a finch , with red , brown , and white feathers , settled near us . " It is the Pyrrhula telasco , " said my friend , " a species discovered by Lesson , the celebrated ornithologist , in his journey to Lima . Ah ! if I was n't so economical with the powder  --  " " I have some powder , " muttered Torribio . " You have some powder ! " I cried ; " will you sell us some ? " " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not ? " was my rejoinder . " Are you also a sportsman ? Besides , if you are , you will soon be going to Puebla , where you could get a fresh supply . " " I never sell my powder , " was the terse response . " Very well , then , let us say no more about it . " We crossed over the stream by means of a tree which stretched from one bank to the other . Ere the sun ceased to gild the ravine with its rays we found ourselves opposite to the dwelling of the Indian patriarch , which overlooked a hut similar to that of our guide . The sky was a pale blue , and we had a glimpse of the monotonous plain dotted over with the sombre cactus-plant ; while just below us figured the fresh oasis , rendered all the more charming by the contrast . The birds warbled in the shrubs , and one by one flew away in order to return to the trees , among the branches of which they had perhaps first crept out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when we got up to return to the village . " I have some powder ! " exclaimed the Indian , abruptly . " Yes , very likely , but I also know that you do n't wish to sell any . " " No , I do n't . " The powder is surely mine , I thought to myself ; and , after walking about twenty paces , I again took up the subject . " Even if your powder was very good , I would n't buy it of you ; I know men like you mean what they say ; nevertheless , if you like , I will make an exchange . " " What could you give me ? " replied Torribio , with affected indifference ; " I do n't want any of your birds , and my gun is quite as good as yours , if not better . " " That 's true enough , therefore say no more about it . " And I continued to follow my guide , who walked slowly on . He soon turned round again . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great effort . " Come ! now we 've got to the point , " murmured Sumichrast . " It is a bargain , if your powder is good , " said I. " Will you really give the glass to me ? " cried the Indian , his eyes lighting up with joy . " I am always a man of my word , " I replied . Torribio hurried on so fast that Lucien was obliged to run in order to keep up with us . After crossing the stream , our guide conducted us to his hut , and showed us four cases of American powder which was quite sound , and more than five or six pounds of assorted shot . I was overjoyed at this discovery ; but I maintained an indifference quite equal to that of our guide , who was squatting down on the ground with his chin resting between his knees . " Here is the telescope , " I said . His features remained perfectly motionless , but his eyes sparkled and his hand trembled slightly as he seized the object of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clean the instrument ; then , loaded with the boxes , which were so precious to me , and followed by my companions , I returned to Coyotepec 's dwelling . " Why did n't Torribio say at once that he was willing to exchange his powder for the telescope ? " asked Lucien . " The reason is , because an Indian always tries to conceal his wishes and passions . " " But why did n't you offer him the instrument directly ? " " If I had shown too much eagerness , very probably he would have refused to make an exchange , and the Indian seldom retracts what he has once said . " Of course , l'Encuerado , always the most extravagant in its use , was perfectly delighted to see our stock of ammunition trebled . We had scarcely finished our dinner , when we heard the sound of a guitar : the Mistec , after having preached , had succeeded in convincing his congregation that a dance was the proper method of winding up the day . The space in front of the patriarch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lighted , ere long the women made their appearance , in what they considered full dress , and their hair loaded with flowers . The national air of the Jarabe was played , and the dancers trod the measure with energy . Lucien , who had joined the crowd , wanted to teach the polka and waltz to the Indian children . Sumichrast stood by , laughing most heartily ; but his merriment increased on seeing l'Encuerado 's gambols , for never before had such wonderful capers been cut . He sang , strummed on his guitar , and
