IT is proposed in this article to set forth the principal views respecting the volume of the currency that have been advanced , and the main facts and arguments relied upon for their support . The first question that presents itself in the consideration of this subject is , whether or not the currency is redundant . Upon this question there is a wide difference of opinion . Able men are arrayed against each other , and appear to maintain their respective positions with equal confidence . As evidence of the redundance of the currency , we are generally referred , in the first place , to its depreciation . Some contend that its redundance is the sole cause of its depreciation , while others , though regarding this as the principal cause , admit that others are also in operation . Those who hold that the currency is not redundant do not deny that greenbacks are worth less than gold . Some speak of this difference in their value as a depreciation of the former , while others regard it as an appreciation of the latter ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is attributed by them to some other cause or causes than redundance of the currency . Several causes , some differing very widely from others , have been alleged by different persons holding this view ; and some that have not been alleged by them to the knowledge of the writer have been admitted by persons who regard the currency as redundant , as above mentioned . It is held by many that the depreciation of the currency , or the premium on gold , whichever one may be pleased to call it , is governed more or less by the state of the public credit . That such was the case to a very great extent during the war is pretty generally admitted . The credit of the Government was then seriously affected by the uncertainty that existed as to how long the contest would last , and how it would terminate , and the doubts that prevailed as to whether the debts incurred in its prosecution would ever be paid , or the greenbacks redeemed . To this has been attributed in a great measure the great depreciation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the war upon the question whether the United States bonds not expressly payable in gold should be paid in gold or greenbacks , is thought to have promoted depreciation by impairing the credit of the Government . The amount of our bonded debt and greenback currency , the latter of which has been stigmatized as so much failed paper , is supposed by some to produce the same effect in the same way . In accordance with this view , the payment of the bonded debt as rapidly as possible has been urged as a means of bringing the greenbacks to par with gold , on the ground that such payment would improve the public credit . Mr. Van Buren Dinslow maintained , in an article in " Putnam 's Monthly " for March , 1869 , that as the bonds and the greenbacks were the promises of the same Government , depending for their value on one credit , and for their redemption on one revenue , they always rose and fell together . He stated as proof of this , that whatever the rise or fall in gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the war , the bonds were quoted at the same price in greenbacks . General Butler , in his financial speech of January , 1869 , held a view of the matter similar to that of Mr. Dinslow . His position was that the value of the greenbacks was controlled entirely by the price of our bonds in Europe . The reason advanced was , that as the bonds constituted by far the largest portion of the debt , their price determined the value of the whole , including the greenbacks . This was , in his opinion , conclusively demonstrated at the breaking out of the war between Prussia and Austria . Our bonds fell in Europe 10 per cent. , and the premium on gold here increased accordingly ; and when the war suddenly ended , and the price of our bonds advanced in Europe , the premium on gold fell here in the same ratio . He said that Mr. McCulloch , then Secretary of the Treasury , adopting the theory that the premium on gold could be kept down at the beginning of the war by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sold some thirty millions of it for that purpose . But the premium advanced // and declined again , irrespective of such sales . The Secretary might as well have attempted to raise the water in the nose of a tea-kettle above that in the kettle itself , by pouring water into the nose , as to have sold the gold for the purpose he did . Commissioner Wells , however , in his repurt for 1869 , denied that the depreciath ) n of the currency could be attributed to the credit of the Government . As proof of this he referred to Italy , Austria , and Russia . These countries , he said , maintained large standing armies ; were constantly threatened with war ; their debts were larger , relatively to their resources , than our own , and were in no respect in process of extinguishment ; and their annual expenditures were in excess of their ordinary revenues ; yet in neither of these countries had the recent depreciation of paper money been more than onehalf as great as in the United States . The sales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expenditures , have been mentioned as among the causes of depreciation . They are so regarded on the ground that the gold disposed of by these sales , and the money required by these expenditures , lessen the ability of the Government to redeem the greenbacks . Some attribute the depreciation of the currency , either wholly or mainly , to the non-redemption of the greenbacks by the Government , or the uncertainty as to the time when they will be so redeemed . One of the most elaborate arguments in favor of this view was made by Senator Morton in his celebrated resumption speech of December 16 , 1868 . He referred to the greenback note as a promise by the Govment to pay so many dollars on demand , which it did not pay . The promise , he said , was daily broken , and had long been dishonored . The note drew no interest , and no time had been fixed when it would be paid . Under such circumstances the note must depreciate . The solvency or ultimate ability of the promiser never kept overdue paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there must also be certainty in the payment and time of payment , and if the payment be deferred , compensation must be made by way of interest . If A. T. Stewart should pay off his numerous employees in due-bills or notes payable on demand , and for the payment of which he would fix no time , they would inevitably depreciate , notwith standing his immense wealth and entire ability to pay , and could only be sold at a large discount . And if it was admitted that there was no legal remedy by which he could be compelled to pay , this discount would be increased . It was said in reply to Mr. Morton , that his illustration was not pertinent because there was no real parallel between the cases . The Government was in the position that Mr. Stewart would be in if the due-bills which he neglected to pay in money were received by him at his store for goods , and were taken by all the other merchants and the banks of the city in payment of debts . In that case they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very large amounts . With the view of showing more conclusively that Mr. Morton was mistaken in supposing that a currency of promissory notes necessarily depreciated from the mere fact that it was not redeemable , it was stated that during the first three years of the suspension of the Bank of England , beginning in 1797 , the issues were so moderate that they not only kept at par with gold , but actually bore a small premium . And such political economists as Ricardo , Mill , and Perry are quoted for the same purpose . It has been held by some that the depreciation of the currency has been partly produced by the refusal of the Government to receive the greenbacks in payment for import duties . To show that this view of the matter was a reasonable one , it has been said that if the Government should also refuse to receive them in payment for internal revenue , such refusal would no doubt cause a still greater depreciation . Then we are referred to the $50,000,000 of paper money issued in 1861 , which , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duties as well as other dues to the Government . The result was , that for a long time they were at par with gold , while the balance of the notes were greatly depreciated . Plans for the resumption of specie payments have been devised with this idea , which have had for one of their most prominent features a provision making greenbacks receivable for duties on imports . Senator Sherman , in one of his financial speeches , referred to this as one of the schemes for resumption . Its adoption would , in his opinion , immediately advance our notes to a specie standard . // He did not favor it , however , because he regarded it as subject to the objection that it would violate the public faith pledged to maintain the revenue from these duties in coin , as a special fund for the payment of the interest on the public debt . Senator Sherman holds that one of the causes of depreciation was the act of April , 1866 , which authorized the conversion of all the currency indebtedness of the country , except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislation was , in his opinion , to sever at once the bonds from the greenbacks . As all other forms of indebtedness were thus allowed to be converted into bonds , while the greenbacks were excluded from the privilege , the latter became of less market value than any other form of our securities . This at once checked the appreciation of the greenbacks . Gold had gradually lowered till then , when it was worth only 25* per cent . premium . For years afterward it did not become so low again , but advanced , fluctuating backward and forward . Senator Morton has recently declared that a permanent depreciation was given to the greenbacks when the Government denied that they were a legal tender in payment of the five-twenty bonds . He regarded this as a gross violation of the language indorsed on the back of the greenbacks , and was confident that if the denial had not been made , the greenbacks would have been at par five or six years ago . The Hon. Samuel S. Cox , in a speech in the House at Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 107 because the Secretary of the Treasury had been pleased to sell it at that rate . It was then about 115 . What it would be a month afterward depended mainly upon the Secretary and the surplus of gold at his disposal . The premium on gold is held by many to be owing , in a great measure at least , to the gold speculators . The high pitch to which they carried it in September , 1869 , is referred to as proof of their influence in this respect . That the premium is controlled more or less by them was admitted in the majority report of the late committee of the New York Chamber of Commerce , appointed to consider the matter of a memorial to Congress upon the subject of specie payments . The Hon. Samuel F. Cary , in a speech in the House at Washington , January 7,1868 , held that gold was in fact a mere matter of merchandise , like cotton , railroad stocks , and whiskey , and that its price was in proportion to its demand for export to settle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far as Mr. Cary , rebard this demand as having more or less effect upon the price of gold . The more cotton and other productions we are able to export , the less is the balance of trade against us , the smaller the demand for gold , and consequently the lower the premium upon the gold . Senator Morton regarded our excellent crops in 1869 as one of the causes that led to the great fall in the price of gold in the latter part of that year . The fluctuations in the price of gold , without inflation or contraction , are referred to as proof that such fluctuations do not mark or measure such expansions or contractions , and that the existence of a premium on gold does not prove a redundance of the currency . Thus we are told that in July , 1865 , the premium was down to 138 , and went up to 148k in December of the same year . It was down as low as 125 in March and April , 1866 , and rose to 1674 in the following June @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constant reduction of the greenbacks , gold did not in three years get down as low as it did in 1866 . It hung at 135-6 during January , 1869 , and at 131 during March . It was held at 140 or over during May , and having dropped to 131j in August , went up to 140 , and finally to 162k in September . And , without contraction , it was over 13 per cent . lower in March , 1870 , than in October , 1869 . Senator Schurz admitted , in his speech of January 14 , 1874 , that the amount of depreciation which an inconvertible currency suffered , the extent of its fluctuations in value from time to time , did not depend upon its volume alone . They depended in a great measure upon public opinion , upon the hopes and fears entertained by the people , especially in time of great public danger and political commotion . Unfortunate events , gloomy prospects , would increase the depreciation , and vice versa . Popular confidence or distrust in the Government would do the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combined action of speculators , the temporary currents of business , would 00. // casionally affect it . But such occurrences did not . in his opinion , refute the general principle that the issue of an inconvertible currency , in excess of the natural wants of the business of the country , iresults at once in itsdepreciation , and that such depreciation , when it steadily continues in comparatively quiet times , Un ' disturbed by extraordinary events , as it has been during the last four years , is a sure sign of its excess as to the wants of the country . Another proof offered that the currency is redundant is that we have more of it now per capita than we had before the war . The fact is admitted by those who hold that the currency is not redundant ; but they contend that we need more now per capita than we did then , and as much more at least as we have got . One of the reasons why this is the case was urged by Senator Morton in his resumption speech referred to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money consisted of the issues of local banks , and was not current except in the locality of the banks by which they were issued . Hence the payments of debts and commercial transactions between different parts of the country were largely conducted by bills of exchange and promissory notes . This form of currency , as he called it , was still used , but not near to the same extent as before the war . Now the greenbacks and national-bank notes were , to a great extent , transmitted in such cases from one part of the country to the other . The books of the express companies showed an increased transportation of paper money , the amount of which could not be accurately ascertained . But he thought it would be a moderate computation to say that $100,000,000 of our currency was now used in this way , which was before the war supplied by bills of exchange and promissory notes . Senator Dixon of Connecticut said , in reply to Mr. Morton , that there might be a case in which a bill of exchange , payable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the currency , though as a general rule it was not . It was the same as a cheek on a bank , which was not currency . " Suppose , " he said , " the Senator goes to his bank and takes out money , gives his check for it himself , and pays it out-are both the check and the money to be considered currency ? What difference does it make if he gives me the check and I get the money ? " As to the matter of promissory notes , Mr. Dixon never heard of any one who considered them as money , except Mr. Micawber , who felt his mind entirely relieved when he had given a note , the debt being then honorably settled and paid . He said promissory notes had been given , and were still , but they paid no debt which still existed . General Butler , in his financial speech of November 26 and 27 , 1867 , referred to the same matter in this way . He said that before the war the Eastern manufacturer went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six or eight months ; the merchant in New Orleans came East and bought the manufactured goods , giving his notes for from six months to a year ; and all the cash required was enough to settle up the balances . He held , like Mr. Morton , that this course of dealing was now for the most part changed , paper money being used in the place of notes and drafts , and that for this reason more of the money was now required than before the war . Mr. George Walker , however , takes a different view of the matter . In a letter addressed to Commissioner Wells in November , 1869 , he said that large payments either in bank-notes or coin had almost ceased in America , domestic payments being generally made by checks , and remittances to a distance by drafts . Another reason urged why we need more currency per capita than before the war is , that transactions requiring the use of money have greatly increased in number . We are referred to the revenue required to be collected in consequence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the increased expenditures of the Government in its general administration . Some have included in this calculation the revenue collected in coin at the custom-house ; but others who hold that the currency is not redundant admit that this revenue should not be considered in this connection , as coin is practically out of circulation except in such special cases . The internal revenue , Which is much larger thsn the entire receipts of the Government before the war , still remains to be considered . We are also referred to the State , county , town , and other municipal taxes , which are claimed to be much greater than before the war . Besides , as it requires much tin*e for the currency to pass from the taxpayers // to the different governments , and thence through disbursements to the circulation again , a large amount of it is constantly withdrawn in this way from business transactions . There has also been great increase in the general business of the country . Trades and transfers of property are much more frequent than before the war . By means of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ productive wealth of the country has multiplied faster than population , and the annual production has greatly enlarged , while individual expenses have increased accordingly . It is not denied , in replyto the foregoing , that the business , production , and wealth of the country have greatly increased since 1860 . But Commissioner Wells held , in his report for 1869 , that this increase had not been in proportion to the increase of the currency . Then it is contended that an increase of business , etc. , does not require a proportionate or even approximate addition to the volume of the currency . As this increase goes on , money is more frequently passed from hand to hand ; and the more frequently it is so passed , the greater the amount of business that can be transacted by the same volume . Then the use of money is more and more economized by bank deposits , checks , and the clearing house . This is said to be the case to such an extent in this country , that not more than one fifth of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house of New York alone for the last ten years made daily exchanges to the average amountof $96,000,000 , which were all settled with a daily average of three and a half millions , and even this was mostly paid in checks and clearing-house certificates . As evidence that the demand for money does not keep pace with the growth of business , etc. , we are told that while the total bank-note circulation of Great Britain in 1844 was $198,352,985 , twenty-four years after , in 1868 , it was only $196,000,000 , showing a decline of over $2,000,000 . The highest point it touched in this period was $210,000,000 . Yet , we are assured , in this period the wealth of the kingdom doubled , and the volume of foreign and domestic trade more than trebled . We are also referred to Massachusetts , New York , and our country at large . In Massachusetts , from 1850 to 1860 , the bank-note circulation increased only 22* per cent. , while bank capital increased 74 per cent. , population 24 per cent. , and the property , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York , during the same decade , the increase of circulation was only 15 per cent. , against an increase in bank capital of 101 per cent. , in population of 25 per cent. , and in property of 71 per cent . The circulation of all the banks of the United States increased only 35*l per cent . from 1837 to 1861 , while from 1840 to 1860 the population increased 82 per cent. , and property , according to the census valuation , 329 per cent . That the volume of currency was sufficient to transact the business of the country before the war , is regarded as conclusively shown by the fact that , although the system of banknote. issues was essentially free and unrestricted , the circulation could not be carried above certain limits . The issues being unrestricted , except by the necessity of redeeming the notes in coin , the amount floated was governed by the laws of trade . The highest circulation which the banks ever attained while they continued specie payments was $215 , OOO , O00in 1857 . But that figure was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terminated in the crisis of that year . For several years prior to 1857 the banks had pushed their discounts to a dangerous point , for the sake of securing circulation . Loans were made in bank bills to distant customers , especially at the West , to railroad and other corporations , to contractors , and to banks , with a distinct agreement that the bills should be kept in circulation till the paper matured . In other cases the agreement was that the bills should be locked up in the safe of a borrowing bank , to constitute the reserve of Eastern exchange , which was required to be kept by the laws of the Western States . It is claimed , therefore , that the $215,000,000 , of bank-note circulation in 1857 was in excessof the legitimate wants of the country . And yet it is said to have been far less than the banks had authority to issue . In Massachusetts banks were allowed to circulate bills up to the amount of their capital , but the circulation never came near to that limit . In July @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintained a circulation of only // each bank could issue as many bills as it could secure at the banking department . The amount issued therefore depended on the means of the banks to pledge securities , and the demand of the public for bills . Yet in 1857 , with a capital of $96,000,000 , the circulation of the New York banks was only $34,000,000 . In the whole United States the bank capital was $371,000,000 , while the total circula*tion was $215,000,000 . The circulation of the country was , in short , far within its statute limits , which , it is held , can only be attributed to the absence of a demand for more . The fact that the total bank-note circulation of Great Britain did not increase from 1844 to 1868 is not regarded by some as proof that no more was needed . It is claimed that more was needed , but as it could not be lawfully obtained a resort was had to a device , not recognized by law , by which their circulation was practically and largely increased , in addition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was in extensive use a paper circulation in the form of individual bills of exchange or promises to deliver money at a future day . Large quantities , estimated as high as $1,000,000 ,  - -  000 , were in constant circulation , return . ing finally to their payers covered with indorsements , sometimes fifteen or twenty or more , and performing the duty of bank notes during the time they were out . The arguments drawn from our own currency on account of the smallness of the increase of its volume from 1837 to 1861 , and the amount of circulation before the war , have also been assailed . It is claimed that the currency in circulation at the time mentioned was no evidence as to what was needed . Free banking was not a universal thing . The circulation was greatly limited bylaw , and still more so by credit . Hundreds of banks rested upon their individual credit , and though perfectly solvent , their bills were worthless a few miles from home . For this and other reasons , such as the individual folly of bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law , paper money was in many communities an object of scorn , and scouted as shinplasters , rags , and trash . With this view of the matter , it is held that a test has never been applied to the business of the country as to the amount of paper money actually needed , and never can be with mere local banks . Another reason urged why such an increase of the currency is required , is that the South needs more of it now than before the war . The planters had occasion to use but little then . The slaves received no wages , for which , therefore , no currency was required ; and the ordinary custom of the planters was to consign their crop and draw upon their consignees at the North . Matters , it is said , are very different there in this respect at the present time , and a large amount of currency is in demand . Other reasons are , that the area over which the currency is scattered has been increased at least one-fifth since 1860 ; that commercial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while they were formerly upon long time ; that the amount of money in the hands of the people and carried about with them is much larger than it was then ; and that the amount of money we must have-in the purchase of the necessaries of life and other articles of constant and daily use , which constitute the greater portion of all the exchanges for which money is employed-has increased in consequence of the increase of prices . This increase of prices is the last evidence offered of the redundance of the currency that we shall mention . It is regarded as such evidence on the ground that prices always advance as the currency is inflated . But it is denied by some that any such increase has taken place , except in cases where it is clearly attributable to other causes than inflation . Representative Coburn of Indiana assumed this position in one of his financial speeches delivered in 1870 . He said that New York flour bore the same price on the 1st day of January , 1861 , that it did on the same day in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1870 . Wheat was 5 cents a bushel higher in 1870 than in 1860 , and 10 cents higher than in 1861 . Hops were the same in 1870 as in 1861 . He said that hay was 25 cents a hundred higher in 1870 than in 1860 , and 5 cents higher than in 1861 ; but according to a table of prices embodied in his speech , it was 25 cents higher in 1860 , and Scents in 1861 , than in 1870 . Leather in 1860 was 20 cents a pound , and in 1870 , with 35 per cent . duty upon it , which nearly made the difference , it was // Wool , which was 42 cents a pound in 1859 , 40 in 1860 , and 30 in 1861 , was 48 in 1868 , 57 in 1869 , and 51 in 1870 , and had upon it at the last date a duty of 10 cents a pound , and 11 per cent . ad valorem . The price of corn was higher owing to the failure of the crops . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5 cents a bushel of the price of 1 . Whiskey was 24* cents , 26 cents , and 19* cents a gallon in 1859,1860 , and 1861 , and 98 cents in 1870 , the difference being just about the amount of the tax . Pork and its products had risen on account of scarcity occasioned by the hog cholera . Many articles entering into daily use in the family had their prices increased by the tariff , but unoffending greenbacks should not be forced to bear the blame . Mr. Coburn also referred to the fact that the prices in 1870 were in greenbacks , while those before the war were in gold . This , he claimed , would reduce the former prices , and put many of them below the latter . It will be observed that most of the articles mentioned by Mr. Coburn are farmers ' products . Amasa Walker , in a recent letter , admitted that these products were no higher now than before the war , while , as he said , all other commodities have advanced from 25 to 50 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in consequence of the excessive volume of our currency . The farmers ' products did not sell for as much as these other commodities , for the reason that the country produced a surplus of the former that must be sent abroad for a market , and consequently must be sold for what they were worth in gold for that purpose . This would be the price in gold plus the little gold premium , and must determine the price of the whole crop . Commissioner Wells held in his last report that these products did not bring as much as stated by Mr. Walker . The cost of transportation , elevating , storing , and managing was greater than it would be under a normal condition of the currency . And as it was doubtful whether the gold received sixty or ninety days afterWards would exchange for as much currency as it would at the time the purchase was made , the exporter of necessity insured himself to the extent of one , two , or four per cent. , as the case might be . Whatever these charges might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the producer , and not charged to the foreign consumer . Those who regard the currency as redundant are divided into two classes , one class advocating a contraction of its volume to the amount required , while the other is in favor of permitting it to remain undisturbed . Many of the points urged against contraction appear from the statements already made . There are others , however , the principal of which we will now present . It is contended that the currency should not be contracted , because so far as it is contracted a stringency in the money market is created which restrains business , lessens the profits of industry , and retards the development of the country . It is replied to this objection that a redundant currency , as ours is claimed to be , tends to produce the very stringency and its consequences that are so much feared as the result of contraction . It does so for the reason that it is not only attended by an increase in prices , but it stimulates speculation . As prices adjust themselves to the volume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it with existing prices to transact the business of the country . Then as speculation is also stimulated , still more currency is required for speculative purposes , which creates a greater demand for money than before inflation , and renders it more difficult to be obtained . Or* the other hand , a reduction of an inflated currency causes a reduction of prices and discourages speculation . The result is that the demand for money is not so great , and it can be more easily obtained . Besides , inflation tends to diminish industry , which is the great source of national wealth , and thus to inj nra and retard rather than benefit and advance the legitimate business and real prosperity of the country . This anticipated reduction of prices by contraction is one of the reasons urged against it . It is supposed that such a reduction would produce a disastrous effect upon trade by lessening profits and the money value of property , and perhaps precipitate a financial crisis . The contraction ists have never considered this objection a very serious one . Holding that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they have contended that a reduction ought to be made so far as a removal of the cause would produce that effect . If such reduction should be adiiitted // to be an evil , an inflated currency is held to be a greater one . Senator Fenton says : " There are also compensations ; at least the reductions in some measure balance each other . If prices decline , so in part does the cost of living . if the merchant loses in what he sells , he gains in what he buys . " Commissioner Wells , according to his report for 18 ( 9 , regards this reduction of prices as a great good to be attained on account of the effect it would have upon our foreign trade . It would , in his opinion , have a favorable effect upon that trade , for the reason that the prevailing high prices caused by inflation prevents us from competing with foreign nations in the markets of the world . Amasa Walker insists upon this reduction of prices as required peculiarly by the farming interest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are lower than other commodities have already been stated . While these products are sold at gold prices plus the little gold premium , all the farmer consumes must be purchased at currency prices , from 25 to 75 per cent . higher , on account of the excessive volume of the currency . lie regards this as one of the chief causes of the depression of the farmers ' branch of industry . It is held by others , however , that the farmer does not suffer any substantial evils on account of the condition of the currency , on the ground that he both receives for what lie sells , and pays for what he purchases , the gold price plus the gold premium , so that he neither gains nor loses by the process . The reply to this is substantially the same as what was said by Mr. Wells as to the increased cost of transportation , etc. , and the exporters ' insurance against loss by change in value of the currency , as above stated . The indebtedness of the country is urged as another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , comprising State , county , city and other municipal debts , corporate and individual debts , has been carried by estimate into thousands of millions . The foundation of this objection is , that if the currency is contracted , and prices and the value of property decline accordingly , more labor and property will be required for the payment of this indebtedness . Bankruptcy , ruin , and other frightful 53 evils have been confidently predicted as the result . It is said in reply , that though this might be a great hardship , as credits are constantly expanding and this indebtedness is steadily increasing , delay will only enhance the difficulty . Amasa Walker holds that , so far as the farmers are concerned , contraction would , in this respect as well as others , be a benefit rather than a hardship . While it would lessen the prices of what they have to purchase , they would obtain just as much as they now do for what they have to sell . Their profits , therefore , would be greater , and their debts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the currency is redundant , but are still opposed to contraction , are in favor of waiting for the development of the country and increase of business to bring the currency to par with gold . It is supposed that this development and increase of business will have this effect by creating a necessity for what currency we have , so that it will no longer be redundant . To this it is replied , that the retaining of the present amount of currency in circulation tends to increase no business but what is speculative , and to check the very development which is expected to remove the difficulty . It tends to check this development by ita effect upon the farmers ' interest and our foreign trade , as already mentioned . Then , should the demand for currency increase no more rapidly than from 1835 to 1860 , which was at the rate of 4.30 per cent . per annum , it would take at least forty years from 1860 , or until 1900 , to bring tho wants of the country up to the present supply , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , irredeemable or inconvertible . This last argument has , of course , no weight with those who believe that the character of the currency from 1835 to 1860 prevented it from being a test as to how much was actually needed . The next and last branch of the subject before us to be noticed is , whether or not the currency should be expanded . An expansion is demanded on the ground that more than we now have is required to transact the business of the country . One of the points insisted on as evidence that such is the case is the prevailing high rate of interest , which is attributed to an inadequate supply of the currency . // But those opposed to expansion regard this high rate of interest as evidence of an excess rather than a deficiency . They do so on the ground that the increased demand for money , which is held by them to accompany redundance as above mentioned , causes a corresponding increase in the rate of interest . As proof of this we are told that interest has always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Those well-known periods of expansion , 1837 and 1857 , are referred to ; and it is said that interest rose as high as 30 per cent . in the Tormer period , and still higher in the latter . Mr. Coburn , a zealous advocate for expansion , admitted , in his speech mentioned above , that " too great an excess , " as well as " too great a scarcity , " made high rates of interest , money becoming in both cases a mere tool for speculation . But he claimed for that time , 1870 , " too great a scarcity , " alleging as a reason for the claim that , although speculations were infrequent , money could not be had at any price to handle the crops of the West and South . As *further evidence that the present volume of the currency is insufficient , we are referred to the prosperous times during the war , when " everybody was making money . " Though most of the currency was confined to the Northern States , there was more of it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is claimed , no evidence that the currency was redundant then ; and if it was not , there can not be enough of it now . It is said in reply that during the war a great deal of money was expended all over the country for munitions of war , stores for the army and navy , and pay and bounty for the soldiers . The currency ramified every branch of industry , wherever soldiers were to be obtained and food and clothing procured . Thus business was stimulated in every community in the land . But an additional issue at the present time would not flow into the same channels and produce the same effect . It would be put into circulation by the purchase of bonds ; and as the bonds would come from the money centres of the country , it is to these centres that the additional issue would go . Those who need it so much could not obtain it , as they have no bonds to give in exchange . The generally admitted fact that we have less currency per capita than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have not enough . Th3 answer is , that we do not need so much per capita as either of those countries . England has double the wealth that we have . Not only is there a preponderance of personal over real property in the country , but the real is productive property to a much greater extent than it is here . Wages is the greatest absorbent of money , because paid in small sums , at short intervals , and to many persons ; and England , far more than ourselves , is a payer of wages . England is eminently a trading nation , buying and selling not only for herself , but for all the world , while this is not so much a trading as a producing and consuming country . The exports and unports of Great Britain are nearly three times as large as ours . Not only is the balance of this trade settled in gold and silver , but the trade itself is a sure index of the domestic trade , of which no corresponding record is kept . As to France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country than here , on account of the people being more slow and sedentary . The French are behind us in commercial usages , and especially slow to adopt those substitutes for money by the use of which oar business is simplified and cheapened . They have only few banks in France . The number was stated in 18*8 to be only 50 , while we had 1 , *00 . While , therefore , the men of business here almost universally keep bank accounts , and make all hut the smallest payments in checks or drafts , in France they keep their money by them and make large payments as well as small in bank notes or coin . The aggregate of these individual reserves of the French is supposed to make the largest item in the circulation . Then the insecurity to property in France , resulting from political disquietude and changes of dynasty , has led to the hoarding of money there to a much greater extent than here . In addition to all this , both the wealth and the foreign trade of France are much greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , that we need more currency than either of those countries , for various reasons . One of them is , that a much larger proportion of the business is done in the way of bank credits and bank deposits in both of those countries than here ; which , so far as France is concerned , is directly opposed to the statement as to banks , etc. , in that country , just men- 4 // tioned above . This state of things is said to be caused , in a great measure at least , by our country being so much more sparsely settled than the others , so that a large l ) art of the people are deprived of banking fiLcilities . The extent of our territory , as compared with the population , also lessens the opportunity of the people to make those mutual exchanges of labor and property , or of credits for either , which constitute the process of set-off in business transactions ; and where this process of set-off can not be resorted to , money is required . The land tenure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exchanges of real estate here , is held to furnish another reason why we need more currency than is needed there . Besides , the landed estates of England require comparatively little to keep them up and improve them , while the case is very different with us on account of the great extent of our unimproved lands , forests , mines , etc . It is said further that while England and France are old , with all their resources developed , our country is new and its resources undeveloped , which is urged as another reason why we need more currency than either of them . Still another , and the last that we shall mention , is the amount of money required here , more than in England or France , on account of higher prices , for the purchase of the necessaries of life and other articles of constant and daily use . As further proof that more currency is needed than we have , we are referred to the fact that when a national bank goes under , its notes are sold at a premium of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Ingersoll , in a speech delivered in the House at Washington , June 9 , 1870 , maintained that without exception periods of expansion were periods of activity and progress . After referring to the history of other countries and the world at large , he came to that of the United States . While the currency was expanding from 1830 to 1837 , the country was blessed with a period of commercial activity and general prosperity . The same was said of the time intervening between 1843 and 1857 , 1861 and 1865 , when the currency was also an expanding one . He said that periods of expansion had ended in financial panics , not because of expansion itself , but because the paper money was issued on an unsound basis . Though it professed to be convertible into coin on demand , there was not one dollar in coin to ten of the paper for the redemption of the latter . So , when confidence in the system was shaken by any disturbance , a run was made upon the banks , and they , being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of coin , or even of paper , when the latter is issued upon a sound basis , in a proper manner and for a legitimate purpose , ever produced a panic or a crash , or ever would . He regarded the greenbacks as a kind of paper money the expansion of which " to an amount equal to the legitimate demands and wants of our entire people ' could not possibly produce a panic . He would make them so plentiful that they would be seeking borrowers at from three to five per cent . Another reason urged why the currency should be expanded is , that maintaining its present volume while the population , wealth , and business of the country is constantly increasing , is attended by the same results as would flow from contraction itself . As population , wealth , and business increase , the demand for money increases also ; and if this demand is not supplied , a stringency in the money market , which is the great evil apprehended of contraction , will be inevitable . The grounds upon which an expansion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from what has already been stated . We will mention only one point more , which is , that such expansion would be a violation of the pledge contained in the act of March 18 , 1869 , " to make provision at the earliest practicable period for the redemption of the United States notes in coin . " This point is made upon the ground that a further issue of paper money would cause a still greater depreciation , and thus add to the main obstacle in the way of its redemption . The reply is , that a moderate increase would restore prosperity throughout the country ; and that as a result of such prosperity the currency would be gradually brought to par with gold . Expansion , according to this view , instead of being a violation of the pledge in question , is the best measure that can be adopted for redeeming it . It is denied , of course , on the other hand , that even a moderate expansion would produce any good effect , by the restoration of prosperity or otherwise , for reasons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
