LIVING IN LONDON . M* search for lodgings in London ended in my fixing myself in Maddox Street , which runs from Regent Street near its upper end across New Bond Street . Here I had a parlor , bedroom , and dressing-room on the second floor ; and , although they were not handsome , perhaps hardly cheerful , I was very comfortable . I did not mind it that my little sideboard , my sofa , and my chairs were old mahogany of the hideous fashion of George IV . s day . They were respectable , and there was a keeping between them and the street into which I looked through chintz window-curtains that reminded me not unpleasantly of those that had hung over my mother 's bed in my boyhood . They were much more grateful to my eye than those which formed the canopy of my bed , // which were heavy moreen of such undisturbed antiquity that they made the room somewhat stuffy . But I liked the old bedstead , which was a four-poster so high that I ascended to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me in the recollection of a dreadful fall which I had from just such a pair , which I had mounted to blow a feather into the air , in defiance of parental injunction . The low French bedstead long ago drove the four-poster out of American bedrooms , in the Northern cities at least ; but the stately and , to uneasy sleepers , somewhat dangerous old night tents still hold their own , not only in London lodgings of the higher class , but in great country houses , where they have stood , many of them , for more than a century , some of them for more than two . English beds are , in the day-time , among the few things in England which I did not find pleasant to look upon . This is because of the fashion in which they are made up , which I found to he invariable . The coverlet is drawn up over the pillows ; and the curtains , hanging from the canopy or pushed up to the head-posts , are then drawn across the upper part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other . To an eye accustomed to the sight of white pillow-cases and of the upper sheet turned down over the coverlet , the effect of the English arrangement is gloomy , stuffy , and forbidding . But at night , when the maid has released and half drawn the curtains and turned down the coverlet , and has prepared everything for your night toilet , an English bed-chamber , even in lodgings , has a very attractive and sleep-provoking aspect . The bed , too , keeps the promise to the eye . English beds are delightful to sleep upon , and are something in feeling between a hair mattress and a well-stuffed feather bed , soft upon the surface yet firm beneath . I found all English beds so , even in hotels in small provincial towns . The locality in which my rooms were had a little interest for me , and would have had more if I had been a woman , from the fact that they were within a few yards of St. George 's Church , Hanover Square , where the marriages of which accounts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My fair readers I believe have wondered , some of them I know have wondered , why the Lady Arabella must always be married at St. George 's . The reason is simply this : that St. George 's is , or till lately has been , the westernmost parish of London , the " West End " parish , that which is nearest the quarter known as Belgravia or May-Fair . Now an Englishwoman of position is married , as a rule , at her parish church ; if from her father 's country-seat , at the little old stone building which has stood just outside the park perhaps for centuries ; if in London , at St. George 's , hanover Square . The church is , however , not upon Hanover Square ; not nearer it , indeed , than Grace Church is to Union Square , or than the " Old South " is to Boston Common . It has its designation , after the London fashion which I have mentioned before , because it is in the neighborhood of Hanover Square . The church itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built in the last century ; but it is somewhat imposing from its large portico , over which is a handsome pediment supported by six Corinthian pillars . Inside , however , it is mean and frivolous , almost vulgar . It is remarkable that this portico stands out over the pavement or sidewalk , the steps rising abruptly from the edge of the road , so that pedestrians walking upon that side of the street must go in to the road , or mount the steps and pass within the pillars as if they were going to church . The effect is somewhat that of a huge ecclesiastical trap set to catch wayfaring sinners . When I took these lodgings , I was struck with another manifestation of that confidence which I have already mentioned . One day , as I passed through the street , I stopped and looked at the rooms , attracted by a neat little card in the lower window , announcing that there were apartments to be let . Three days afterward I came unannounced in a cab with my luggage , and , finding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would take them for an indefinite time between 18*T9. 507 // a fortnight and six weeks . I was made welcome , and my luggage was taken upstairs . I had not yet given even my name ; but now I presented my card , the name on which I am sure my landlady had never seen before , and asked if I should pay a week in advance . The answer was , " Oh , no , we do n't want that , sir . " Inquiries were then made as to how I would like to be taken care of , at what hour I should breakfast , and so forth . For the rooms I paid a guinea and a half a week , exclusive of fire and candles . For breakfast , and for luncheon when I chose to take it there , I was to pay just the cost of what was furnished to me . I found the bills for these " extras ' * very moderate ; and from the time when this arrangement was made I never saw my landlady , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her existence , except by her bill , which appeared , with every item carefully priced , weekly upon my breakfast table . I was expected to pay for every article that I asked for , no matter how trifling . An extra candle appeared in the bill ; and I remarked , when the arrangement as to my occul ) ation of the rooms was making , that Mrs. - said , " As you wo n't dine at ome , you say , there 11 be no charge for kitchen fire . " It seems that the cost of heat expended in making breakfast is counted in the room rent of London lodgings , but that for every dinner that may be served there is an extra charge for kitchen fire . I paid also for the washing of my bedlinen , towels , and napkins . My own clothes were sent out for me to the laundress , of whom I knew nothing but the wonderfully written bills on minute scraps of paper which came with the returned garments . The price of their lavation looked very small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price bore any proportion to purification ; for it seemed to me sometimes , when they came back , as if the smoke and dirt of London , which was upon them in streaks and patches when they were sent out , had been merely dissolved and diffused through them , and fixed in them by heat and starch . For once I sympathized heartily with that selfish snob , George Brummell , - the sufferance of whose impudent vulgarity by English gentlemen and gentlewomen was always a marvel to me , - in his insistence upon country washing . Was his charm a singularity in being clean in his person and neat in his dress ? Country washing in England is as fine as can be ; the clothes come to you as white as snow , and seeiiiing to bring with them a suggestion of daisies and lavender . But London washing seems to be done in a dilution of grime ; and how , indeed , could it be otherwise ? This homely subject leads me to remark upon the relief of the En*lish housekeeper of middling rank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corre5pon ( lin* condition of life . In no English household of a station above that in which washing is done as a means of livelihood is any washing done at all . The weekly wash which is the ever-recurring torment of most American housekeepers is unknown in England . Everything is sent out to a laundress . I think that the effect of this is one element of the greater serenity and repose of English life . Nor would English kitchens - and I saw not a few , in full operation , in houses of all grades - admit of the laundry work that is carried on in so many American kitchens where there is no separate laundry . The English kitchen in the houses of men of moderate means - for example , professional men and merchants not wealthy - is not half so large as that in corresponding American houses . A set of standing - tubs would more than half fill it . And that Moloch of the American kitchen , the great mass of heated iron known as a range , is almost unknown in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is open , and although there is the hob and the hot closet and the boiler , the whole affair is much less formidable than our range , which looks like an ironclad gun-boat stranded upon the hearthstone . I dined , when not at the house of a friend , at restaurants of various grades . Eating and drinking is such serious business in England , and is taken so much to heart by everybody , that one expects // to find ample and worthy provision for it in the great capital . But although a stranger need not go hungry in London if he has money in his pocket , he is not sure of being able to breakfast , lunch , dine , or sup to his satisfaction , at short notice , if he is at all fastidious as to viands , cookery , or table service . There are eating-houses in great numbers and variety , at some of which you may fare sumptuously , and at many of which excellent cold beef and hot , tender chops may be ha ( l , with good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at which you may order from a copious bill of fare to your liking , there are very few . I did not find one that would compare favorably with half a dozen that I could name in New York , or with Parker 's in Boston . At most of the London eatinghouses of the first class there is a set dinner at set hours , or rather two or three set dinners of different grades , which are served at corresponding prices . The courses , few or many , are placed before you in due order , and the cooking is tolerably good ; but you can not travel out of the record ; and as to coming in at your own hour and making up your own menu , the preparation of which begins while you are dallying with oysters and soup , that is almost out of the question . Of course , there is good reason for this ; for it need hardly be said that London can and will have anything that it wants ; and I find the reason in the habits of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and as a rule have a liking for the simple and the solid , and are not inclined to be fanciful . Notwithstanding the introduction of French cookery and dinners * la Russe among the luxurious classes , the average Englishman , even if he can afford to be fanciful and luxurious , has a liking for his joint , and is satisfied with that if it is well cooked , juicy and large enough . Lord Palmerston used to tell his butler , when people were coming to dinner , to get what he pleased for the rest , but to be sure to have a good joint of roast mutton and an apple-pie for him , - and " Pam " was a typical Englishman . Moreover , the Englishman generally likes to eat his dinner at home , even if he is living at lodgings ; if not at home , at his club ; if neither at home nor at his club , then at some eatincr-bouse , where he goes regularly and takes the regular course of things , content if his dinner is plentiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mild , but reserving the right to grumble , with good occasion or without . He is not inclined , like the Frenchman , to take his wife and children to a restaurant and make his dinner * work of art , more or less varied and rich in design and costliness , according to the condition of his purse or the festivousness of the occasion . Such , too , if I mistake not , were the habits an ( l tastes of Yankees , until the Delmonicos introduced into New York , some thirty or forty years ago , I believe , the French restaurant system , which has gradually exercised a modifying influence upon habits of life in this respect throughout the country . It may be questioned whether , all circumstances and consequences being considered , this influence has been in every respect benign , even upon cookery . The joint is still dominant upon the average English table . Its rule is visible , tangible , almost oppressive . It appears in various forms , even at breakfast . That greasy Juggernaut of many American breakfast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not hot , is almost unknown in England ; at least , I had the pleasure of never seeing it , even at a hotel ; but mighty cold sirloins , and legs of mutton , and hams , and birds in pies , and mysterious potted creatures weigh down the buffet at all the great hotels . Your eggs and bacon , your sole or your whiting , with your muffin kept hot by a bowl of hot water beneath the plate , are set before you upon your special table ; but to yonder mountainous holocaust of cold heterogeneous flesh you may take your plate at pleasure , and carve for yourself , and cut and come again . In private houses the same arrangement obtains , but modified and gently tempered to more fastidious eyes and delicate appetites than are generally found in the coffee-room of a hotel . 1879. 509 // In the windows of the middling restaurants , soon after midday , placards begin to appear , announcing in large letters , " A hot Joint at 2 o'clock , " and a like announcement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It seemed to me as if there was a degree of solemnity about this , and I am sure that the word joint in reference to the table is uttered with a notable unctuousness and emphasis by the average Englishman . At a restaurant of high class just out of Regent Street , at which I dined twice , the worship of the joint was impressively brought home to me . The room was a handsome one , and the service rich , almost elegant ; the diners seemed to be all of such a condition in life as one would expect to find in such a place . In due time I was asked whether I would have roast beef or roast mutton . I chose mutton , of course . Whereupon my waiter disappeared , and presently returned , slowly followed by a man clothed in a white garment and with a white cap upon his head . In one hand he bore a huge blade that looked like a sabre , in the other what seemed to be some pronged instrument of torture . Behind him came an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark wood , which was solemnly set before me . I looked in amazement , but not with apprehension ; for was I not in the land of Magna Charta , and trial by jury , and the Bill of Rights ? It was in truth not a block , and the man in the white cap was not a headsman who had come to take my head , although upon the seeming hlock was a charger large enough to have held that of John the Baptist if he had been as big as Goliath of Gath . But it was already occupied by a huge roast saddle of mutton , and the man in white was only the carver . The blade gleamed in the air and ( lescended upon the joint , and the only result of this solemnity was that there lay upon my plate a large slice of mutton so delicious that the eating of it marks an era in my gastronomic life . I shall date my dinners back and forth from the day when I ate that mutLon . In no other eating-house that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the joint as this , which I found was peculiar to the house where I saw it . But in all others , and particularly in those of a somewhat lower grade , . I observed that the joint was spoken of with a certain deference and unction , much as , for example , when it was said that Mr. Blank was particularly engaged ; " Lord Soandso was with him . " The manager of the place where the joint was solemnly sacrificed to the god of Philistia had but finely apprehended and boldly conformed to the spirit of the public , one of whose priests he was . His carving performance was a little above and yet closely akin to that of the grill-rooms , the attraction of which is that your chop , or your kidney , or yom* steak , is broiled before your eyes . You may pick out your chop , if you like to do so , see it put upon the gridiron , and stand by while it steams and smokes and hisses and sputters before you , and , hastening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hissing , and sputtering down your throat . The smell of cooking is one of the aensuous miseries of life ; and the sight of a gashed and dismembered joint , with its severed tendons and fibres , its gory gravy , and the sickening smell of its greasy vapor , is , it would seem , what any man not a Fijian of the old school would gladly avoid . But in England , eating , with us a necessity , with the French an art , is a religion , and the joint is , like some other fetiches , at once god and sacrifice . The devouring of hot , red , half-roasted flesh is high among the duties and the beatitudes . I said that when asked to choose between beef and mutton of course I chose mutton , and that I was richly rewarded for my preference . Much as English mutton has been praised , not half enough , so far as 1 know , has been said of its excellence . As to the roast beef of Old England , it is good enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eating the best that could be had , I found it no better in flavor or in fibre than that to which I had been accustomed . On the whole , I think that although we . have nothing better , one is rather more // sure of getting very good beef here than there . I found the beefsteaks decidedly inferior to ours . But with English mutton eaten in England there is none to be compared . Canada mutton , and even English eaten here , is inferior in every respect . I had such a distaste for inutton , particularly when roasted , that I had often said , to the discomfiture of the domestic powers , that I should be glad never to see it again upon the table ; but in England I ate it always when I could obtain it . There it was mutton which was mutton , and yet was not muttony . For tenderness , juiciness , and flavor , it was beyond praise . It was merely to be eaten with thankfulness . To return to my lodgings : for my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed almost entirely , dependent upon a maid-servant who took care of them and of me , and who was always ready when I touched my bell . Emma - for that was her name - was a typical specimen of her class . I have said that the prettiest women I saw in England were , with few exceptions , among the chamber-maids and the bar-maids ; and Emma 's fine figure , bright eyes , and ever pleasant and respectful manner of course enhanced the agreeable effect of her careful and thoughtful service . They even caused me to be somewhat disturbed by the consciousness of the fact that she cleaned the shoes which she brought with my hot water in the morning . I did not quite like to feel that a woman , and a pretty young woman , performed that service for me . The freedom , innocent and unconscious , of the English chamber-maid was also a surprise to me . When at the house of a friend , in one of the suburbs of London , just after myarrival , Iwas awakened by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue-eyed , fair-haired young woman , of that type of English beauty which is not tcvo often seen in England , walked into my bedroom with a can of hot water . I was startled , although I did not find the shock at all unpleasant . She set out my " tub* ' and my rough towels , and disappeared with a pleasant " Good morning , sir . " One reason for this 511 agreeable ceremony is that bath-rooms are very rare in English houses ; and in households in which men-servants are not kept , the maid-servants perform all such offices . For that a " gentleman " should do anything for himself , even in the preparation for his own toilet , is not to be thought of , except in some great emergency . The care with which one is looked after by these good creatures - and they seemed to me to be the perfection of good nature and of thoughtful kindliness , and made me wish that I had sovereigns to give them instead of shillings - was illustrated to me on my return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was after midnight when I came in . In the passage below stoo ( l a lighted candle , and against it leaned something , I forget now what , which showed that it was meant for me . I found the door of my sitting-room wide open , with a chair set against it to keep it so ; for , like all the other doors in my rooms , it was hung upon beveled hinges , which caused it to shut gently of itself . Upon the table directly in front of the door stood two candles unlit ; between them were the letters and cards that had been left for me during the evening . The door between my sitting-room and bedroom was also wide open , and was stayed back , as also was that of my dressing-room . In both bedroom and dressing-room everything was prepared for my night toilet , even to the laying out of my night-shirt " in a wow " upon the bed , like Dundreary 's dozen . This careful setting open of all the doors did indeed suggest to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which I might possibly return from dinner ; but that I readily forgave her for the forethought . Briefly , there was nothing that I could wish or reasonably expect to have done for my comfort that this good girl did not do for me , generally without my asking it . After I had been in my rooms a day or two , she seemed to understand me , and to know what I *should like , and to set herself to making my stay as pleasant as possible . And like most of her class that I saw , she added to her ministra Living in London . // tions the grace of cheerfulness , while at the same time , although she was not without the capacity of enjoying a little complimentary chaff , her manner was perfectly modest and proper , mingling respect for herself and for me with an ease of manner very uncommon in the Hibernian maid-servant of America . She illustrated to me one day a superstition which had quite faded out of my memory . I had asked for a fire , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some ill condition of the air , smoldered in blackness . I went into my bedroom for a minute , and , returning , found the open tongs laid over the top of the coals , and Emma standing over the grate watching it intently . " What is that for ? ' * I asked , pointing to the tongs . " To draw up the fire , thir , " replied the irl , who added a little lisp to the charm of her soft English voice ; and then I remembered that I had read of this superstition , but I did not suppose that it still held its own in England , and that I should ever see it acted upon in simple good faith . But the blaze came up , and the girl lifted off the tongs with a little look of triumph at my face , which I suppose showed some of the amusement and the doubt I meant to conceal . With all their respectfulness and deference , English servants and people in humble life indulge in a freedom of speech of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day to day ; they were greater in number and in bulk than in value , and one day , being a little annoyed hy the clutter which they made upon my table and sofa , when Emma brought in an addition to it which had just come home , I cried out against them . " And yet they keepth a-comm ' , thir , " said the girl , as she turned to go out . Another time , being very much vexed at a mistake that I had made , I.exclaimed , " I do sometimes think that I act like a horn fool ! * ' " I thuppoth tho , thir , " demurely said Emma , who entered from my bedroom just as I spoke . I looked at her a moment , and we both laughed , - I heartily , she shyly and blushing . And yet in all this there was not the slightest lack of respect ; she never forgot her place , and I could not but think in regard to her , as I thought in regard to others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intercourse was , how much more human , than an absolute interdiction of all communion between the server and the served , and how much it might do to smooth and sweeten life for both . I was witness to a scene of freedom between the server and the served in which the conditions and the sexes were reversed . One morning I went to take an early walk in Hyde Park . It was not later than nine o'clock , which for London , and particularly for that end of London , is very early . And indeed , as I walked at my will through path , or over lawn , beneath great trees , with that perfect freedom the consciousness , or rather the unconscious possession , of which adds so much to the charms of an English park , the rays of the sun slanting through a golden mist , the cool freshness of the turf , and a moisture yet upon the leaves made the landscape seeii* like one seen soon after dawn in an American summer . I had crossed the Serpentine , and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road , when I saw coming towards me a young lady on horseback . She was riding alone , but at the usual distance behind her I saw her groom . Till then I had found the park as deserted as if it were midnight ; and now I and the two distant riders were the only living things in sight ; and sound there was none exceRt a gentle murmur faintly coming from the town , as it slowly wakened into life . The riders walked their horses , and as we gradually approached each other I saw that my horsewoman was a large , fair girl , some twenty years of age . She rode a handsome bright hay , remarkably tall and powerful , as indeed the horse that carried her had need to be ; for she herself was notably tall , and her figure was full to the utmost amplitude of outline consistent with beauty . Plainly neither she nor the groom saw me , and as I wished to have a good look at her without seeming rude , I withdrew myself into a position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as she passed within a few yards of me . Her face was not beautiful , and pretty would have been too small a word to apply to it in any case , but she certainly was a fine , handsome girl ; her face breathed health and sweetness and good nature ; she was very fair , with glowing cheeks , and teeth that made me tbank her for smiling as she passed . She wore a blue riding-habit that fitted very close , and of course a chimney-pot hat . As she drew near to me , I saw that the groom gradually shortened the distance between them , and spoke to her , he speaking first . She answered , and they began to talk , he bringin his horse step by step nearer hers . Looking at him attentively , I found him one of the handsomest men I had ever seen . He was tall , and strongly although sparely built , with fair skin , dark hair and whiskers , steel-gray eyes , and a firm yet persuasive-looking mouth . He was in complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and striped waistcoat , but these did not seem able to subdue a certain distinction in his bearing . Perhaps , however , he was only a fine , handsome animal , and would have been vulgarized by being put into a dress-coat and a white neck-tie , - that crucial test of a man 's ability to look like a gentleman . Nearer and nearer he came to his young mistress , closer and closer his horse sidled up to hers , till when they had just passed me he was only about a head behind her ,  --  just en**gh to say behind . He spoke earnestly now , leaning over toward her from his saddle ; and she did not lean the other way , but turned her head sli0htly , and looked down with a sidelong glance upon the around . I could hear her voice as well as his , and although I was not able to distinguish the words of either , and the sounds became fainter with the slow stepping of their horses , I felt somewhat ashamed of my position . And yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see an English lady ride past me . Gradually I lost the sound of their voices , but I still saw the groom leaning toward her and her head not turned away from him . At length it seemed as if their saddle-girths must touch , and I almost expected to see him put his arm around her , as she sat there , except for the blue woolen surface , Lady Godiva from the saddle up . But he was discreet , and merely held his place ; the blue outlines of her noble figure became indistinct , the great gleaming knot of her golden hair waned and faded in the distance , and they rode out of my sight , leaving me to wonder what might come of all this . Another of my early walks was to Covent Garden market , where I went soon after sunrise to see the early traffic . Covent Garden , with an adherence to the signification of its name , is a market for flowers and vegetables only . It is not much frequented by private purchasers , but is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Half London gets its supply of garden stuff from Covent Garden . I found little peculiar in the place , except its size and the filling of this vast expanse with ve*etable produce . I arrived in the height of the early business . All around the place were the little carts of the little dealers , waiting to be filled , or just filled and hurried off at that break-neck pace with which such people think it necessary to drive as well in London as in New York . Even the donkey-carts went off with rapidity . The number of these was amazing and amus* log . I never saw so many donkeys on four legs before , nor shall I ever see so many again . There were ears enough there to have stretched in a straight line through London . The hurry and bustle was bewildering . Ever ) - dealer seemed to think that his fortune for the day depended upon his making his purchases and getting off with his load five minutes before his neighbor . But in the midst of all , here and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were called . For it has long been tile strange custom to sell vegetables and flowers every morning by auction at Covent Garden ; hut the sale is called an auction because the offered price does not increase , but diminish . The things are put up at a certain price , which is grad-513 // ually lowered by the crier , until they are taken at the rate named . When this so - called Dutch form of auction came in I did not learn . The vegetables were much what may he found in American markets , but seemed fresher , perhaps because I saw them earlier in the morning than it is my wont to see anything . I took note of no novelty except the vegetable marrow , that fruit of the soil which Mrs. Nickleby 's admirer cast at her feet . On eating this vegetable , I thought it most ill adapted to the expression of an ardent passion , in which it might yield to the pretensions of a pumpkin . It looks like a long , smooth squasb , and , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it tastes like squash and water . The fruit at Covent Garden , some of it , was fine and fair to the eye ; but in this respect I found in England much to be desired . I shall not say with Hawthorne that I never tasted anything there that had half the flavor of a New iF*ngland turnip ; but , excepting grapes , I found the taste even of wall fruit and hot-house fruit comparatively tame . Apples were small and tough ; pears , mostly from France , were better , but still inferior ; peaches were often fair to the eye , yet at best rather greenish in tint , but within always an almost tasteless , watery pulp . Indeed , the climate of England is not well adapted to the growth either of fruit or of grain . For both there seems to be required a drier and long , er continued heat than her skies afford . The hothouse supplies this in part for fruit , but only in part , except , I am told , as to the strawberry ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in season . The melons , even those which came from Spain , were poor , flashy tliin0s , far past the help even of pepper and salt . Yet it is poor melon the flavor of which is not spoiled by condiments . As to grain , it remains to be proved , and will probably erelong be tested , whether England might not better abandon its culture , and depend , for wheat at least , upon other countries . To this end come the corn laws . It is not very far from Covent Garden to Seven Dials . This place is so called from the fact that by the meeting of seven streets seven corners are formed , at each of which there was once , it is said , a dial . This place has a reputation like that of Five Points in New York ; and it is remarkable that the meeting of many streets should in both cities have been followed by a degradation of the neighborhood . But Seven Dials , although I found that it richly deserved the ill odor in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or was , the lowest and most wretched part of the town . There are neighborhoods in London which are to Seven Dials as Seven Dials is to May-Fair . These are regions which stretch away to the east and north from the city proper . They are a city in themselves . The formation of a nest of slums one can understand ; but it was inconceivable to me how this vast area of wretchedness and vice , and of moral and physical filth and gloom , could have been formed in a civilized country . I went into the innermost recesses of it , into quarters which I found few London men knew of , and where I was warned by those who did know them not to go , for the danger of it . But although remarked and gazed at , I was not molested ; and although I had nothing with me for self-protection but an umbrella , I came out unharmed . Indeed , I have found that a man may go almost anywhere and among almost any people , if he will only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them ; and the only way of doing that is neither to fear or to hate . I found here nothing to provoke hate , nothing ludicrous , nothing amusing . The sadness of it weighed heavily upon my spirit . The houses were high and without any character whatever ; plain brick walls , lead-colored for the most part , and pierced with modern windows . Indeed , all this part of London is quite modern . In one little court , however , that I penetrated runnin , , out of Whitecross Street , ( a street named twice by Defoe in his History of the Pla , , ue in London , once as the street in which a shop-keeper lived who was summoned to the closed door of his deserted shop to pay money , and who , with death in his face , told the 514 April , // messenger to stop at Cripplegate church and bid them ring the passing bell for him , and died that day ; next as the scene of the burning to death of a plaguestricken citizen in his bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own hand ) , I found a remnant of the old city , a relic of the great fire which so closely followed the great plague more than two hundred years ago . It was the rounded corner of an old peaked-roof stone or plaster house , only two stories high , which had escaped the burning , and although not more than about twenty feet square of it had been left , this had characteristically been preserved , and was built into the modern building . From the quaint windows of this ancient habitation two girls , not more than twelve or thirteen years old , but with pallid faces and a hideous leer , began to chaff me as I stood in the little court . I felt that to be the most dangerous place that I had ever been in , although I had walked under the walls in Havana more than twenty years ago ; and I turned away and got out of it as soon as possible , but went leisurely , and nodded good-by to the girls . And in these streets there were shops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! But they told that even these people buy and sell and get gain , and live upon each other . It would seem that they must live altogether by thieving and burglary . One business was a strange one to me . Cooked food was sold at stands , at not very remote distances from each other . A board or two was stretched across two trestles or two barrels , and on this were a few potatoes , bits of bacon , and other viands . I saw no one eating , at which I did not wonder . There might have been much of interest to be learned from the people in these houses , but upon that I could hardly venture ; externally , they but oppressed me by the seemingly endless sameness of their dull and formless misery . The mention of the great fire reminds me that one day 1 passed the place where it was stayed . This is Pye Corner , and the fact is recorded in a little inscription on one of the houses . It had an interest to me beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the place where Mrs. Quickly tells us that Falstaff came continuantly to buy a saddle . Most unexpectedly I came upon this memorial of the old London of Elizabeth 's and Henry V. 's days ; and I confess that by the help of Mrs. Quickly I felt myself nearer to Shakespeare there than when I stood in his father 's cottage in Stratford , or looked upon his signature in the British Museum . The scene of Falstaff 's continuant shopping for a saddle is also celebrated by Defoe , who tells us , in his History of the Devil , that the fact that Satan had a cloven foot is certified by " that learned famihiarist Mother Hazel , whose writings are to be found at the famous library at Pye Corner . " Did the circulating library spring up at Pye Corner to flower into Mudie ? What proportion of intelligent Londoners know that there is such a place as Pye Corner , and such a street as Whitecross Street , I shall not undertake to say ; but I think that the number must be very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about places of interest , but not of celebrity , which is not peculiar to Londoners , I was much impressed by the Englishman 's ignorance of everything that did not concern him , if it were a little out of his daily beat , even if it were daily before his eyes . I was walking , one day , with an elderly London friend through precincts where he told me he had passe ( l his boyhood and his youth . Going from one charmingly secret and mysterious court to another , as much in private , it would seem , as if we were going through a succession of back yards , I saw just on one hand a great gate-way with square posts surmounted with balls ; it must have been twelve feet high . I asked my friend what it was . He hesitated a moment , an ( l then said , smiling , " Indeed , I do n't know . Strange to say , although I ye seen it all my life , I never did know . " Just then another elderly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into another , and my friend exclaimed , " Oh , here s A- ! He 11 tell us ; he s 515 // lived near here all his life . " But Aknew no more about the gate-way than my friend did himself , and they were not such Philistines but that they laughed at each other for their common ignorance . Not only did I find this sort of ignorance , but actual ignorance of their own neighborhoods , of the principal streets , great thoroughfares , and public places . The very cabmen were not to be trusted ; and I had to set one right when I had been in London only a fortnight . I found that it was much better to trust to my own general knowledge , and to my feeling for form and distance , than to ask direction from any one but a policeman . They were always right , always attentive , always civil . Before I left London I came to look upon every policeman that I met as a personal friend . I was lost but once , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trusting to my own instincts , I was misled and misdirected . I was on my way home from dinner at a suburban house ( it was the occasion when Emma set all the doors open for me ) , and found myself set down , or turned out , at the Victoria Station about twelve o'clock . I had been there only once before , but I wanted the walk home ; and , confident in my ability to go back over any road by which I had passed one way , I called no cab , and set out to walk to my lodgings by way of St. James 's Park , St. James 's Street , and Regent Street . To my surprise , as I was turning into the street leading , as I thought , to Buckiugham Palace Road , I saw all the cabs going my way turn off at another street . I waited a few moments , and , seeing that they all went that way , I inferred that I had at last gone wrong , and I followed the lead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before I thought that I must be astray . That was not the street I had come through before ; everything was strange to me . But I reflected that the night was very dark , and I kept on for a while , the impression , of stran0eness and of lengthening distance still increasing on me . The cabs were out of sight and out of hearing loncr ago . Just as I was about stopping to reconsider my ways , I saw a young man - a gentleman he seemed - come out of a house just ahead of me . When we met I asked him if this was the way to St. James 's Park . " Oh , yes , " he kindly replied , " quite so , quite so . You 11 keep on for about off a mile , and then go straight through it . " The distance , half a mile in addition to what I had walked , struck me as too great , and I asked if he was sure , and mentioned again that it was St. James @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he replied , " quite sure , quite so , quite so . " I thanked him , and walked on . But at every step I was more and more impressed by the feeling that I had not been driven through that street on my way to the station , and after walking full " off a mile " 1 saw no sign of the park , or of anything of its surroundin*s .. I did , however , see a policeman , and glad I was of the sight . To my inquiry how far it was to St. James 's Park , he replied , " Why , bless your art , sir , I dun know ow far it may be the way you re goin ' . You re a-walkin ' halmost right away from it . You must turn back for near a mile , " etc . In a word , I was to go back to where I had first turned off . I started , but before I got there along came a belated cab , which , thinking I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took . It was well that I did so . My cabman astonished me by the route he took ; so much so that I turned and called to him , " Maddox Street , Maddox Street ! " " All right , sir , " he answered , and on he drove , up and down , through ways unknown to me . At last I recognized my street through the darkness , and was set down at my own door . " Why did n't you come by Buckingham Palace Road ? " I asked . " It s much shorter . " " 1 knows it , sir . llof course . But the pok was shut up this afternoon , sir ; mendin ' the road , sir . " And this was the reason that the cabs had turned off into another street , to my misleading . Another little experience of this kind amused me and made me wonder . A gentleman had asked me to his house on Sunday morning . He lived in Knightsbrid0e , and was an author of high re 516 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I had never been to Knightsbridge ; did not even know where it was ; but I found out that it was to be reached through Piccadilly , and I set out to walk there . I had come , I was sure , pretty near to the place , and I thought that I would ask to be directed to this gentleman 's house ; less that I felt in need of direction , than for the sake of tryin0 an experiment ; for the ignorance of these London people about London had become a matter of observation to me , and of amusement . I looked about and saw a gentleman descending the steps of a very handsome house near Albert Gate , Hyde Park . I went to him and asked if he could tell me where my friend lived , mentioning the celebrated name , of course , and adding that I was sure it was very near there . The gentleman was not only polite , but kind , as I always found people in England ; but he hemmed and hawed , and said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to confess that he did n't . " But come , " he said , " we 11 find somebody to tell you . Here s a crossing-s weeper ; he 11 be sure to know , if it s near by . " But the old sweeper was as ignorant as the gentleman , and touched his hat and looked at us with a lack-lustre eye . I had a delightful inward smile , said good morning , and in less than three minutes I was at Charles Reade 's door , which was not much more than a hundred yards off , and in five minutes more I was sitting with him in a pleasant parlor ( not a drawing-room ) before a sea-coal fire , talking fiddle , - a subject which he understands better and warms up about more than any other except one ; and what that is no woman need be told who has read his novels , from Peg Woffington down to The Cloister and the Hearth , and onward through the brilliant list .

He is tall , distin * uishe d in person and in manner , yet easy and simple in sp ) eech and bearinn with no more vanity than he has the right to have ( and this I mention only because he is credited with more ) ; and as to his companionableness , I only wished for greater opportunity of testing it . I did not tell him that his near neighbors did not know where he lived ; but I wish that I had done so , for the sake of the hearty laugh that we should have had together .
