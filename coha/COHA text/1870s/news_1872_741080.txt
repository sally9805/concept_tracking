txt We do not need to recur to the unhappy fate of Mr. PUTNAM to prove that travel on our street-cars is dangerous to life and property to a degree that is simply shameful and intolerable in a City like this . On some of the lines , to enter a crowded car during the day , or any car late at night , is to run a fair chance of being robbed if not assaulted . We do not mean to say that robberies and . assaults are of constant occurrence in the cars of any line . We do mean to say , that on some lines they are so frequent and so rarely punished , that the passenger at all times feels an uneasy apprehension of possible trouble . If travel is to be safe anywhere , it ought to be in a public conveyance , whose proprietors are paid . to make travel safe . It is a comfort , at least , that the Courts are beginning to enforce this proposition , and . to hold . the companies responsible for violence inflicted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . It is not enough that the injured passenger should have at hand . a remedy . The state of : things which permits him to be injured , which keeps him in continual peril of injury . ought to be impossible . It is no very great consolation to a passenger on a Third-avenue car , let us say , to know that if he is robbed or beaten during the trip he may recover damages from the Company . Litigation is costly and uncertain , and . a majority of sufferers prefer to pocket their loss , or put up with their injuries , rather than incur the expense of a suit . What is wanted is that the passenger should . feel that he is in at least no more danger of being beaten or robbed in a car than in a public street . This end , of course , is to be mainly attained by a more vigorous enforcement of the laws , and by the repression of the spirit of crime and violence so long rife in the Metropolis . But something , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and . we may expect will be done . when the Courts have made it clear that it is to their pecuniary interest to do it . Such protection as the company can afford , independent of the Police , devolves wholly upon the conductor , as the driver has usually all he can do to mind his horses . Considering the pay that conductors receive . the sort of work required of them , and the corrupt temptations that surround them , it would be unreasonable to expect that they should be always either faithful or honest . In too many cases , ithe conductor has been more than suspected of being in league with ' the thieves . Indeed , under the system of appointment followed on some of the roads , it was not so very difficult for a thief to get the post himself . But , even in the best case , where the conductor has been both honest and faithful , he was but one against many . If he attempted Ito interfere with the thieves , they would be certain , in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fix him . " He could rarely count on effectual aid from his passengers , and he knew that if he attempted to interfere , he must carry his life in his hands . What wonder if , with the disposition and the courage to do what was right , he should , especially if a man of family . shrink from the enormous odds against him ? All the more praise , then , is due to the conductor , who , in spite of the danger , resolutely does his duty . Such a man appears to be CHARLES CoLBY , of the Dry Dock and . Grand-street line . He warned his passengers , the other night , against a gang of thieves on his car , and was soon after attacked by the ruffians and badly beaten . If the Dry Dock and Grand-street Company appreciate the extent of their responsibilities to the public . we think they will reward this man in some way for his fidelity . Grant that he did but his duty ; that is so rarely done nowadays that its rare performance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in cases like this the companies , so far from rewarding a faithful conductor , will not even pay his doctor 's bill , or even Ins wages during the absence ? resulting from injuries thus received in their service . This seems incredible meanness . Conductors of CoLBY 'S stamp are rare enough now . They will entirely disappear if they find that fidelity and courage , so far from being appreciated , only work them bodily injury and pecuniary loss . This much the companies can and should do toward remedying the present state of things . It should be considered , also , whether , as we have suggested , conductors might not safely be clothed with some of the powers of special deputy sheriffs . They could then keep thieves or other objectionable persons off their cars , or upon any overt act arrest them at once without waiting for a policeman . Such authority . ' however . should be given only after mature deliberation . and to ' men of proved discretion.Last- ly , the public may help essentially tower the desrred reform by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on their ' selves , or at least by vigorously backing in and " in turn protecting the officer , who lik COLBY , dares to do MS duty at his persons peril .
