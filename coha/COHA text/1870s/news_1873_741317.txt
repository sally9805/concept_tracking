txt The Board of Health , with the vigor which has characterized . their administration from the first , took measures , some time since to compel the street-car companies to pay more attention to the comfort and safety of their passengers . They passed an ordinance requiring the abandonment of the filthy and disease-propagating cushions , and the proper inclosure of the front platforms so as to prevent egress or ingress . As compliance with the latter provision threatened to_the in- 1 volve a little expense , the Presidents of nearly all the City railway companies appeared . on Wednesday before the board , and remonstrated against being compelled to adopt the requirement . The reasons they offered in support of their protest are entitled to be beard with attention , and they were so received by the board . But they do not appear to be conclusive , and we trust that the essential part of the ordinance will still be carried out . The grounds of the opposition , briefly summarized , are these : First . The adoption of platform-gates , such as are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the introduction of turn-tables at either end of the route  --  a plan that , at the City Hall terminus , for example , would be clearly impracticable for want of space . Second . The . two of gates has been found to increase rather then to diminish the number of acci ' dents . Third . If the front platforms were left empty , the crowd on the rear platform would so overbalance the car as to cause it to run off the track . Fourth . If but one door were left open for entering and depart- ing passengers , at the terminus much inconvenience and delay would inevitably result . ' Fifth . The closing of either platform would require an additional number of cars , and otherwise increase expenses to an extent which the companies , at present rates , could not afford . These reasons do not seem to be sufficient . The third and fifth indicate that the companies look tranquilly forward to an indefinite continuance of the present system of overcrowding and packing which makes ' travel on our street cars at present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very different and pleasanter anticipations . We do not despair of seeing the time when it shall be forbidden by law to receive , or at least to exact , pay for car passengers for whom seats can not be provided . Such regulations have been passed elsewhere with good result , and time and the gradual advance of civilization may bring us equal fortune . Then the difficulty about overbalancing will vanish , and with either platform clear of any but the driver and conductor , there will be no danger that the car , from this cause at least , will run off the track . In Cincinnati , the proposition is under discussion to permit every standing passenger on a street car to ride free , and to fine every conductor who exacts fare from such a one $10 and costs . Some such measure would wonderfully simplify the terrible overcrowding about the platforms . As to the alleged necessity for turntables consequent upon the addition of platform-gates , we fail to see how it would arise . More than three years ago we suggested that both platforms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " apron , " or end of the car , when not in use , as either platform become front or rear . What is to prevent the adoption of such a plan , and how , in that case , would turn-tables become needful I The gates might , moreover , be latched. in such a way as to open only- with a key in the possession of drivers and conductors . Thus no accidents could occur from passengers unlatching the gates themselves , and at the end of the route , both platforms could be left open for unimpeded egress and ingress , until the car had started . For the assertion that the liability to accident is increased by the use of gates , we have seen no proof , and we shall decline to believe it without very unmistakable and authentic statistics . The reforms that are imperatively demanded in street car management we take to . be these : 1 . Seats either of wood , or cushioned in such a manner as will not be detrimental to cleanliness and health . This improvement , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Board of Health received on Wednesday the assurance of President BUTLER , of the Sixth Avenue Company , that in a year 's time there would not be a line in the City retaining cushioned seats . 2 . Sitting-room for every passenger who pays fare . 3 . The proper inclosure of the front platform . 4 . The strict enforcement of a regulation that cars shall be stopped . a reasonable time for passengers to get on or off . If these and kindred changes entail trouble and loss on the companies , that is not a matter which concerns the public . The question is not if such reforms will be expensive , but whether it is just and necessary that such reforms should be made . That being established , the companies , should they be put to loss , will receive , we are sure , the exact measure of public sympathy they have merited by their past attention to public convenience and comfort . What that measure will be , our readers perhaps can fairly estimate .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
