txt Democrats who have taken so much delight in reading the soft things that have been printed about them in the Tribune , during the last five months , and who , in their gushing thankfulness , have not only brought themselves to the sticking-point of supporting GREELEY for the Presidency , but have come forward liberally with their subscriptions to save his paper from bankruptcy , will be taken somewhat aback by the leading article in yesterday 's Tribune , in which the philosopher announces the result of their labors . Before the smoke of the battle had . cleared away sufficiently to enable him to ascertain anything beyond the fact that he was badly beaten , and could never be President , we find the petulant and passionate GREELEY rushing back to his old tripod in the almost defunct Tribune establishment , and denouncing the whole army of his followers as a pack of dirty , venal , cowardly , unprincipled scamps . Opening his tirade of abuse with the truthful , but needless and inopportune , declaration that " there is scarcely a parallel to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resulted from their misbehavior , he goes on to show how the battle has been lost and the leader brought into disgrace by the sordid , mercenary , and . pusillanimous character of his troops . " The Liberal movement , " he exclaims , " was at one time formidable , and had a prospect of success ; " but the Venal scamps on whom he relied to achieve success scented the money-bags of the enemy afar off , and forthwith deserted in droves to the other side . Commencing with the first skirmishes of the campaign , " thousands of voters , " he says , " in North Carolina , Vermont , and . Maine were convinced by money that they might better vote the Administration than the Liberal ticket , and . that , if they could not so vote , it was their interest to stay at home on election day and not vote at all . Thus the Liberal Republican strength inthose States was nearly neutralized by Democrats who would n't eat crow when they could get five dollars to twenty dollars each for not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Verthont , Maine , and North Carolina was imitated on a still larger scale in Pennsylvania , where the Tribune boasts of a weekly circulation of 21,246 . " There was nothing purchasable in the Keystone State avers Mr. GREELEY , " that was not bought , whether of voters , - electioneerers , or inspectors and canvassers . Thousands who had been perspiring with zeal for the Liberal cause sdently dropped into the swelling torrent . ' ' ' in a word , Mr. GREELEY accounts for ' his defeat by , declaring that his followers , and . particular-VI/le Democrats , whether captains or privates , were bought up , singly and in vompanies , regiments and battalions , like so many cattle . Well , it may have been so ; we are not prepared to dispute it . In fact , we have all along said that they were a vile set of scallawags , totally destitute of principle , mere soldiers of fortune , looking for a ohance to market themselves at the highest price . If they had n't been of this character they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place . It is not for us to defend . them ; but we will say that the rank and file of the Liberal army have been no worse than their leader ; in fact they are to be praised for the fidelity with which they have followed his example . He sold out his principles and the record of his whole life for the glittering prize of the Presidency , which he fancied he saw in the distance ; why should not they sell out for a little ready cash to save them from starving ? No army could endure the fatigues of a campaign on a diet of " boiled crow , " and no General who had a proper regard for his troops would ask them to do it . Those 21,216 subscribers to the Tribune in Pennsylvania , for instance . What lesson could they have imbibed from a perusal of that journal for the last twelve months , except that of bargain and sale ? of treason to principle and desertion of party for a price They saw their leader repudiating all his past teachings and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not sell him when they had a chance I There is no good reason why they should not , and we have no doubt they did it . Indeed , the 21 , - 246 Pennsylvania subscribers to the Weekly Tribune just about make up the uumberthat are charged by GREELEY with selling out at the October election in that State . There can be no doubt in the mind of any reasonable . man that the traitors and the Tribune subscribers were the self-same parties . How ineffably mean , therefore , it is in Mr. GREELEY " to denounce and abuse his disciples for doing the same thing that he did himself . In the same issue of the Tribune in which he insults and vilifies his late followers , he prints a laudatory article about himself . in which he has the audacity to declare that " he has sacrificed no principle ; he has in no way compromised his selfrespect , or used doubtful utterances to win votes . " There is but one interpretation that can be . given to this language which would lift it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in type ; and that is that Mr. GREELEY never had any principles to sacrifice , any self-respect to compromise , or any capacity of uttering his real thoughts . The first two ' propositions , in view of his recent conduct , appear quite plausible ; as to the last , we fear that his late Democratic supporters will have occasion in the future , as they have had in the past . to wish rather than to believe that it were true .
