txt The able Convention of free-traders which gathered at Steinway Hall on Thursday evening could with equal justice have designated themselves " revenue reformers " or " revenue tariff " supporters . With the exception of two or three extremists , probably not one of the whole Convention would advocate absolute free-trade ; " that is , the buying and selling wherever we prefer without any more let or hindrance than " free travel " has , or than is encountered by trade between the different States of the Union . In a purely theoretic view , the collecting of taxes personally , by assessing each individual , is undoubtedly the most just and equitable method . But the experience of the whole civilized world is , that under this method , the masses are too painfully conscious of what they are paying , and therefore become discontented under taxation . But if all classes pay their taxes  --  though a considerable portion maybe lost to the Government in the process ? in the prices of commodities , but few perceive the burden , and do not charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dealers , or " the times " in general . Taxing by customs on imports , is one of the most convenient methods ever devised for a Government to take money out of the pockets of the people . If , for instance , at the present time every clerk or mechanic paying $1,500 annually for " house expenses " were suddenly informed , by the- Secretary of the Treasury that hereafter- be ? should be compelled to pay no more duties on any commodity and no more internal - taxes , but they should be commuted to SOO per annum , paid directly to the Government , he would feel himself the most oppressed and .. wronged. man on the face of the earth , and- he and his class would soon join in a revolution - against such an oppressive Government . And yet , probably , taking all his current expenses , this mechanic does pay fifty per cent . more for every commodity , owing to the tariff and internal taxation . For a tariff like ours , with an average of forty per cent duties , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every article , not merely imported , but produced in the country . It unquestionably raises all values , even more than the forty per cent. , as a profit must be asked by each dealer on every import before it reaches the customer . And so skillfully and thoroughly are all " raw materials " of manufacture taxed and overtaxed that every branch of production in this country is bur- dened fully , its fifty per cent . Throughout the country , living expenses are at least fifty per cent . greater than they ought to be , under a better revenue system . Now it is very clear to the most entbusias ; tic-free-trader , that direct taxation could never be . resorted to in this country . We have an enormous war debt to pay , besides the current expenses of the Government We must meet our budget by taxes on imports and a few internal taxes . The economical question for the country is , " How shall this best be done ? " In so far as the tree-traders support a tariff which " shall press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for revenue , they will be iu accord with the Convention of Philadelphia and the Republican Party . The conviction grows each day in the ranks of the regular Republicans , that amid the conflicting claims of the Western agricultural interest , the New York commercial , and the Pennsylvania and New-England manufacturing interests , no human government is competent to exactly apportion the burden which each should justly bear , or the bounty which should be offered to each . Experience shoWs , as in the case of the wool duties . that , so complicated are the relations of different branches of production , when we lay a duty to " protect " both the wool-grower and the menu : facturer. we have in fact broken up the business of the one and ruined the other . No one can tell beforehand what " ' protection " will do . We may , as in this-instance , or as in our case of American machinery , ruin the interest we sought to shelter . The popular opinion ' is inclining more and . more to the view that " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing to be sought for in a tariff , and that this should be obtained as far as possible by taxing luxuries . The people see clearly that the best things to tax are superfluities , ? so that , if a man will have champagne , and burgundy , and French brandy , and Havana cigars ; or a woman demands silks and satins , and jewelry , and foreign carpets , and handsome furniture , they . shall , in purchasing them , pay heavily for the national taxation . By such a budget the temperate , and frugal , and poor do not pay so much . and . all pay in proportion to their consumption of luxuries and . from their own superfluous income . There are eight or ten articles of luxury imported , here , which could pay almost the whole amount we now collect from hundreds , and which comes from the pockets of the poor and laboring classes . Equally so with in- . ternal taxation . Whisky and tobacco could give us an enormous internal revenue , not ? burdening any class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is evidently to be the victory of that party which shall lift the crushing burden of our taxation , and which shall frame a tariff , for revenue alone , collecting our whole income from taxes on a few luxuries .
