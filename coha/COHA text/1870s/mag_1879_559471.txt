THE RAILWAY PROBLEM . Fon several years past our railway system has been operated in a manner that has attracted widespread attention , and has created a demand , not only from persons interested financially , but from the country at large , for some decided reform . The competitive struggle existing during many years , and which still exists , resulting in irregular , unfair , and improper dealings with the public and with its vast business interests , has awakened a feeling that can not be longer ignored , and which can only be quieted by the adoption , promptly and firmly , of integrity of purpose and action by those who control these immense railway properties . The public has come to regard as insincere and almost farcical the repeated socalled trunk-line conferences , held as they have been from time to time with the avowed object of stopping the cutting of rates , with all the consequent demoralizing evils and destructive effects . The leading railways of the country may be thus grouped the great trunk lines , which control the territory from St. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Atlantic seaboard , comprise the main arteries ; while the numerous Northwestern , Western , and Southwestern roads connecting with each of the trunk lines are essential adjuncts . No one doubts that , in case of unitcd and effective action on the part of the trunk lines , the cutting of rates would cease within a brief period ; and that , without such action on the part of the trunk lines , these roads will continue to act irregularly and with continued disastrous results . Let the tributary companies be separately and vigorously treated , and desired and valuable results will be secured . If , however , any connections are permitted to cut , and the trunk lines share in this cutting and loss , the entire system is disordered and a failure . Keep the fountainheads pure , and all the currents can beyond doubt be properly controlled . It is admittedly the interest of the trunk lines to preserve // rates intact , and agreed schedules are adopted at irregular intervals , only to be broken , involving conference upon conference , culminating usually in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arises , Why , if agreed rates are generally restored and accepted , do violations occur with such frequency ? To answer this question , the condition of the Western connections and the difficulty of holding them to their agreements must be examined . Many of these roads , being in the hands of managers who have no direct interest in their securities , and who are not held to any direct responsibility , have been operated by them to their own personal advantage and to the advantage of friends . The only influence brought to bear to compel them to join the conferences and agree to the restoration of rates thus far , has been the moral power of the managers of the trunk lines . There are exceptions , where judicious railroad men of large experience operate bankrupt roads to advantage ; but these cases occur only when the lines are advantageously located . In addition to the bankrupt roads , there are others operated almost exclusively at the expense of the stockholders . Their interest has been for years in default , and they are managed shrewdly in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be ultimately forced under the control of the courts , and meanwhile reap as rich a harvest as possible . Such is the character of many of the lines beyond the territory controlled by the great trunk companies and feeding them . The remainder desire the maintenance of regular and paying rates , and labor to secure them ; but find their efforts are abortive , and are forced to compete for traffic or allow the business to go to other channels . Looking to an ultimate settlement , and the formation of a pool , so that they may obtain a fair proportion of the traffic , they fear to fail to secure tonnage even at unremunerative rates . In dealing with this question , through rates have been exclusively considered . The trunk lines get the bulk of their through business from connecting lines ; and , under the system which has heretofore prevailed , when these connecting lines cut rates they have accepted their pro rata of the reductions . One of the trunk lines accepting such cut rates from its connecting lines , all others are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lack of faith on the part of the railroad managers in each other has also had much to do with the nonmaintenance of fixed rates . One of the chief difficulties in maintaining rates arises from the fact that many officials interested in Western lines , as well as in // some of the trunk lines , have a separate pecuniary interest in the cars running upon these lines , for which they obtain a certain mileage , and which consequently they desire to have kept in motion continuously . If business can not be had at schedule rates , and these parties have no paramount interest in preserving them , the incentive for making a cut can be readily seen ; and , if the officers interested in the cars are possessed of sufficient influence , the necessity for cutting rates can be so explained as to prevent their correction . In fact , to the power of these and other interested " institutions " may be traced the greatest difficulties which the trunk lines have had to encounter-difficulties which , up to this time , have proved to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competition , which , owing to obvious circumstances , is not so subject to these influences . The West-bound pool has during its existence been the most successful commercial organization , considering its character and the difficulties besetting it , that has ever been known in America . Continued already for more than two years , with every indication of a long life , and no responsibility attached to its membership other than the mere pledge of the parties upholding it , it may well be regarded as a phenomenon in railway history . That its primary objects have been secured its age clearly demonstrates ; and there are few who will doubt its usefulness and uniform success , passing as it has through periods of business depression and commercial inactivity greatly calculated to open up extended competition between the trunk lines . Again , the enemies of the pool both in the East and West , who had profited in former years by wars of the trunk lines , saw that an avenue to large revenues at the expense of the latter was about to be closed , and therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Street and other operators resorted to many devices , and endeavored to stir up personal feeling and antagonisms between the managers of the trunk lines , based on statements invented for the purpose of effecting a break . How nearly successful the many hostile influences were is well known to those managers . The results of the pool , however , have so clearly demonstrated the wisdom of maintaining it , that all influences inimical to its stability have been resisted , and the trunk lines enjoy to-day from a secure position the discomfiture of their enemies , and see that " in union there is strength , " and are likewise conscious of a marked endorsement of this policy by the public . They recognize fully that their interests on this subject are identical , and that the // pool must stand . Undue competition in East-bound traffic is brought about by the absence of a stable agreement , and the trunk lines are forced into it by the character of their connections . If an effective agreement relating to East-bound traffic could be made , cutting be altogether stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as of the trunk lines be conducted according to business rules and principles , under the renewed confidence as to the continued development of this country and continuous emigration , an era of general prosperity would be witnessed such as is anticipated by few . Having traced the causes of the evil , we see that the whole trouble may be attributed to a lack of responsibility in those exercising the great authority described . Agreements are made , schedules adopted , but what penalty is there for any violation of them ? It is true that nominal charges are decided upon sometimes by certain railroad associations , but they are not enforced by subscribing lines , merely because there is no sufficient authority to apply the penalty . This being the case , why should agreements be subscribed to at all ? The only answer is , the belief that the moral influence of the trunk lines is good . This to a certain extent is true . Had it not been for this influence , things would have been decidedly worse . To this lack of responsibility , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence for evil of the railroad system , can be traced at times the threatened collapse of the Westbound pool , and the complete failure thus far of all efforts to establish at the leading Western points similar pools controlling Eastbound traffic . It appeared some time since as if these pools would be successfully formed , and several began to operate . Chicago , however , it was claimed , could not be pooled ; and those who wished the pool system to be a failure seized upon this as a pretext for breaking up pooling at Cincinnati , Indianapolis , and other centers . A temporary agreement has since been made to pool the business of Chicago for the control of East-bound traffic , and it is hoped this will lead to the formation of similar pools at other centers . Passenger associations are in nominal existence , and from births under pleasant auspices , with a brilliant future before them , have so steadily degenerated that there are now very few companies which deem them of sufficient importance to allow their passenger agents to attend the periodical meetings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efforts to the contrary , rates have been cut and fares reduced lower and lower . Affecting , as // these organizations could , so beneficially the revenues of the corporations , their only good thus far has been to secure at times a restoration of rates for a brief period . As to the effect on the roads themselves , no difference of opinion exists in reference to the disaster and discredit to all concerned . They are compelled to do the same amount of work and employ the same equipment as though their traffic were remunerative . The damage to their rolling stock and roadway , considering the increased rapid transit demanded during the period of excessive competition , is greater than when they are operated under ordinary conditions , and their entire expenses are proportionately increased , while their revenues are lessened . While this is the result of competition in through freights , the local traffic and that to and from non-competing points are forced to submit to unreasonable discrimination ai* the hands of the railway companies ; for , although the volume of business is greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indirectly bear a disproportionate share of the expenses of the entire line . This has been the case for years , and formerly the people were content with protests ; but recently they have assumed a more determined and aggressive attitude , and their efforts to secure a recognition of their claims by the railway companies have culminated , as known , in appeals to State legislative bodies for relief from the alleged discriminative policy . While members of the State Legislatures comprehend that there should and necessarily must be a difference between the proportions of rates from competing points and between long and short distances-that is , between through and local rates-they , for obvious reasons , unite with the extremists in endeavoring to secure the passage of such acts as will compel the establishment of rates to satisfy local demands . The facts stated show but a portion of the very serious evils growing out of unregulated railroad management . What shall lie the Remedy ? It is generally believed that a legion of theories can be applied by which relief could be afforded ; but the subject , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The mere fact that a system is in operation in the United Kingdom of Great Britain which is successful would lead to the supposition that it could be advantageously inaugurated here ; but , as is the case with // many other European national measures , it would be inoperative under our republican institutions . The English system , however , offers many useful suggestions , and is well worthy of attention in this connection . It has been the subject of national legislation in that country for years , several successive Parliaments having been called upon to improve it . The acts of 1854 and 1873 appear to embrace the most important legislation in reference to railways . The act for " the better regulation of railways and canal traffic of 1854 , " of the British Government , provided merely that railroad and canal companies should extend facilities for receiving and forwarding freight and passengers without improper discrimination or partiality . The higher Crown courts were fully authorized to receive and investigate complaints as to violations of this act , with authority also to issue injunctions against the respondents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against one or more of the directors of any such company , or against any owner , lessee , contractor , or any other person disobeying ; and the courts were empowered to impose a fine not exceeding two hundred pounds per day for every day that the injunction was ignored . The companies were further liable for damage to stock or merchandise occasioned by default or neglect , notwithstanding any notice , etc. , of the company limiting their liability ; but not denying the right of the carrier to make such conditions , subject to the decision of the Court as to their justice and reasonableness . The act specified limited damages to live-stock except in special cases . This act was succeeded in 1873 by " An act to make better provision for carrying into effect the railway and canal traffic act of 1854 , and for other reasons , " which created a Railway Commission of three persons and two assistants . One of the Commissioners was to be experienced in law and one experienced in the railway business . Provisions were made for the removal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ armed with an official seal recognized by the courts , and were authorized to act regardless of any vacancy in their number . They were compelled within three months from the period of appointment to dispose of all moneyed interests in any railway or canal company ; were not allowed to accept during office any such interest , and could not exercise jurisdiction in a case where they were directly or indirectly interested . All complaints of discrimination , etc. , made by the Boards of Trade or individuals under the former act were transferred to them , they being invested with all authority formerly // reposed in the courts , which ceased to exercise jurisdiction in railway matters except to enforce the decisions of the Commissioners . On the receipt of a complaint the Commissioners were directed to notify the respondents , and to act in cases of arbitration under general or special acts . In the matter of through rates the company desiring to forward freight over other lines was required to notify the latter within ten days of the proposed through rate and route and proportions . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was considered accepted ; and , if objected to , was referred to the Commissioners for decision . If the demurrer was to the apportionment , the rate went into operation and the subsequent decision was retrospective . In any other event the rate was suspended until the decision was obtained . In deciding the apportionment of the rate the Commissioners were required to consider all of the surrounding circumstances , including any special expense in the construction , maintenance , or operation of the proposed route or any portion of it . No line could be compelled to accept a less mileage rate than at that time received by a competing line . These throughrate provisions also applied to steam-vessels operated by the railway companies interested . Municipal or other public corporations , local or harbor boards , could lodge complaints without proving that they were aggrieved , it being necessary to accompany the complaint with a Board of Trade certificate . The companies were required to keep a list of special and schedule rates in a place of public access , and to furnish any required information regarding their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not fixed by national legislation . The railway and canal companies were not permitted to consolidate without the Commissioners* consent , and only after the terms of agreement had been thoroughly published . Differences as to transportation of mails were referred to the Commissioners . The Assistant Commissioners possessed similar authority , but acted under instructions from their superiors , who were empowered to employ clerks , officers , scientific and other experts to decide all questions of law and fact , and were clothed with all the authority of a civil court . Any of the civil courts were instructed to enforce the decisions of the Commissioners , and , in an appeal , to decide any question of law without costs to them , their decisions not to be stayed pending the appeal . They were also empowered to sit collectively or individually , and in open court or secret , and required to make annual reports to the Government . In 1874 an amendment was adopted transferring the voiu* . CxxIX. - No. 275. 25 // authority in questions concerning transportation companies from the Boards of Trade to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was with a view to regulate , not so much the general policy of the roads , as to protect minor corporations , and the people whose money is invested in them , a thing that is so desirable in this country . The act of 1854 appears to have been intended as an experiment , in which the matter of extending facilities to persons and corporations without discrimination , prejudice , disadvantage , or partiality , is specially provided for , and the question of through rates , although implied , is not specified . The enforcement of this act was left altogether to the superior courts ; but in 1873 the later act was issued , defining particularly the matter of facilities as applying to through-freight traffic and the apportionment of charges for the same . To carry out the provisions of this act , which evidently contemplated a speedy settlement of all railway differences , authority was transferred from the courts to a Railway Commission created by it . A competent lawyer and a competent railway man were necessary as members of that Commission , strengthening their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were well able to assume a settlement of any question . The law was cast iron and the tribunal was all-powerful . One clause especially of the act is adaptable to a like commission or pool in this country , viz. , the provision demanding in a question of apportionment the consideration of any extraordinary circumstances or expense surrounding the construction or operation of the road at issue ; and in no instance could the proportion be made less than that received by a rival line . Access by the general public to schedules and rate lists was also a good provision , as well as that making any individual or corporation an informant in charges of violations . The first duty of the Railway Commissioners was to simplify the methods of procedure on applications , dispensing with certain forms and placing a company on its defense without delay . Among the first cases before the Commissioners the railway companies were charged with discriminating in favor of themselves against carriers , in not deducting from a through rate , including delivery , a proper amount for goods carted by the complainants* @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order to show the proper amount for cartage . In the other case the complainant compromised and was made an agent of the company , thus demonstrating that the railway companies were not only not allowed to show partiality // to themselves but also not to discriminate between customers . In another ease a railway company was defended in discriminating in favor of a corporation and against private individuals , it being shown that the general public were benefited by having the price of the product of the corporation reduced in consequence . All of these were under a section taken from the act of 1854 regarding the extension of uniform facilities . Under the section of the act of 1873 providing for the reference by arbitration of differences between railway companies , a case occurred in which a company as lessee failed to account for receipts for terminal expenses to the leased line , which were decided under the agreement to comprise a portion of the general receipts . Another was where it was found necessary to adapt the gauge of one road to the cars of another running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respective rights of the two companies and fixing a table of rates . This ease was adjusted after several years ' litigation . Questions as to divisions of through rates according to mileage also arose , but were settled by the companies preliminary to a general hearing by the Commissioners . During the second year the Commissioners were called upon principally to decide upon questions of discriminations on the part of the railway companies between customers . Rates were proved to have been charged higher and lower than those fixed by the schedules , and the schedule rates were restored . Abatements in charges to persons agreeing to patronize a certain company were discovered on complaint and stopped . Rebates for terminal service performed by customers were stopped on complaint of parties at a corresponding station where an opportunity did not offer for the performance of similar service . A number of cases of disagreement in reference to through rates and routes were submitted to the Commissioners and equitably adjusted . In one or two cases the jurisdiction of the Commissioners was contested , but , this being decided in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There were no appeals allowed from the decisions of the Commissioners , inasmuch as the exceptions were not based on questions of law . No national legislation has been seriously presented on this subject in the United States except in the " Reagan Anti-Freight Discrimination Bill , " which , while it is impracticable , suggests some good points . This bill , as modified and amended , provides against discriminative freight rates in interstate traffic , forbids the issue of rebates or drawbacks , or the formation of pools or agreements between competing lines , prohibits delays or interruption of traffic , concessions // in rates and charges , and exempts broken car-loads . This is the bill in brief ; and while its author 's objects are probably good , if it should be adopted and put into effect , it would be liable to lead to complications from which it is doubtful whether even he could suggest an effectual plan of relief . The burden of its reformatory feature is to prevent unfair discrimination , and nothing is more patent than that the trunk-line managers themselves would do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a practicable form ; but even after benefiting by the experience incident to the opposition to the original bill , it is plainly demonstrated that Mr. Reagan is still largely at fault in pressing it in its present shape . The measure aims to cure the effects without treating the cause . Nothing can be more beneficial than the stopping of the rebate and drawback system , under cover of which the principal cutting is successfully carried on ; but , while the interests of the roads are in securing a great bulk of business rather than an equitable division of profits , their ends can not be accomplished if agreements and compacts are prohibited . Fluctuation in rates , consequient discrimination , etc. , are not the result of legitimate competition , but the consequence of ruinous warfare , treachery , and dishonesty between the various roads . The Reagan bill does not prohibit competition , but indirectly encourages , while ostensibly discountenancing it . The greatest injustice is that the bill does not cover water transportation or water and rail traffic ; as , between the seaboard and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connections would be exempt from the penalties of the bill . The interstate clauses , which are the burden of the measure , are also unjust . A road beginning and ending in a State , as in the case of one of the trunk lines , would have an unfair advantage over its competitors , and , although a through line , could break freight bulk at the borders of the State in which it originates , and thus evade the provisions of the bill . For obvious reasons , the placing of local traflic on the same basis as through business can not prove operative . If rates were equalized or local schedules reduced by pro rata arrangement , the railways could not pay expenses ; and no sane person will argue for a moment that freight transported from station to station and over short distances should pay as little revenue per mile as that carried to distant points at greatly decreased comparative expense . Any measures brought before Congress constructed to meet popular feeling may be expected to be crude , as in the case of the // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand and appreciate the railroad situation , they must necessarily be incomplete . Generally , behind such movements in State Legislatures are local influences and local shippers , with arguments as to the effects of the so-called discriminations against local patrons , quoting the difference pro rata between through and local charges , and making a showing which excites the sympathies of the congressional representative , as it had previously worked upon the inhabitants along the line of road , who perhaps are not directly interested in the question of railway charges , but enjoy the privilege of the elective franchise , and whose influence in common with that of their fellow citizens is courted and secured . The representative then proposes a bill which is calculated to correct the discrepancies complained of , and perhaps if passed would not really work much damage to the railway companies . But , when the bill gets before the Legislature , other agencies develop , and not only are sweeping and radical measures ingrafted on it , but its condition is so altered that its author would fail to recognize it . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are entirely superseded by impracticable sections . This is the immediate result of friendship for the railway interests , of lobby and other influences , and of the peculiar views of individuals who have ideas on every subject which they must ventilate . Thus the measure is crippled and burdened ; and , if perchance it pass one branch of the legislative body , it is so encompassed by fallacious features that the other branch will not lend itself to enacting its absurdities . It appears that Congress alone can not be relied upon to correct the evils of the railway system , and for similar reasons the State Legislatures can not treat the subject successfully . Where can and must the remedy be found ? To an unbiased mind conversant with the details of the subject , the inquiry can receive but one answer . The remedy lies first with the railway companies themselves , and secondly with the national and State Legislatures . But how is this to be effected ? The railway interests must propose the necessary measures , and , in ease of their failure in putting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and must be called upon to assert and apply its power in a matter where one of the greatest and most important moneyed and business interests of the country is involved . While Congress is authorized and empowered to act in questions of interstate commerce , it can not control or regulate commerce within a State , and here a strong feature of the subject // becomes most prominent . It has been demonstrated why through traffic must apparently be conducted to some extent irrespective of local interest , because of competition ; but if competition be removed , and laws be framed exclusively to regulate through traffic , the question of local rates would be entirely changed , and influences and evils more difficult to be dealt with than the former ones would be developed . Therefore , while Congress solves the problem from a national standpoint , the c&amp;5peration of the State Legislatures with the railway interests must be secured on local questions . In the general discussion , the subject of water transportation and its relations to the railroad lines demands especial attention . This is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one of the most important , as shaping the policy of the railroads with reference to freight traffic at certain periods . Water lines , or part rail and part water lines , can not be governed in common with " all-rail " lines , but must be separately classified and controlled . In treating them the attendant circumstances must be regarded , and concessions made on general grounds of differential rates . As regards dispatch , facilities for accommodations , and working , the railroads are vastly superior , and " odds " should be given to the weaker and less favored competitors . Determined opposition will be encountered , but the urgency of combining this interest with that of railroads must be appreciated . Another important factor of the subject is the question of passenger traffic , which has for years been notoriously irregular and unsatisfactory . A review of the entire passenger traffic of the country , say for five years past , will demonstrate that there has been no comparative yearly increase during this period , except at the time of the Centennial Exhibition , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revenues were disproportionate with the increased bulk of business . This important railway department should exhibit a steady growth . Much has been done to contribute to this end , and yet all efforts to afford a healthy impetus have failed . The result can only be attributed to the unfavorable condition of the present railway system , combined with the general depression of business produced by the panic of 1873 . The Westbound trunk line pool has been applied exclusively to the working of freight traffic , and here it is claimed a great mistake has been made . Whether this be so or not , the fact remains patent that , in the effort to reform the system , the passenger traffic must not be neglected , but should receive the attention of those who are // to take the matter under effective control . The West-bound trunk line pool was organized experimentally . Its success has exceeded the greatest expectations of its founders , its history having been one of uniform victory in the face of almost insurmountable opposition and difficulties . A recapitulation shows that the evils @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the irresponsibility of a large number of them , and the lack of good faith in making agreements and in sustaining them . All of these culminate in the cutthroat policy and unprincipled dealings assuming the respectable title of " competition . " It is competition after a fashion , but it involves extravagances and lack of honesty , which not only affect the offenders , but permeate all railway companies , and necessarily injure the respectable corporations and those which desire to operate under an honest policy . It entails disaster to all interests involved , excites the disgust and contempt of the people , and opens up avenues for movements calculated to work great mischief and loss . The pernicious effects are witnessed in the large number of bankrupt roads throughout the country , in others struggling to maintain their existence , and which , unless there be a prompt change , must sooner or later end in a more general financial ruin ; stockholders ' money recklessly squandered in keeping up false policies , and the entailing of immense losses and injuries upon the stockholders of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being engendered in every community , which will inevitably result , if not remedied , in unwise legislation , calculated to work inestimable damage to the railroads and country at large . The only safe , expedient , and practicable remedy , in the judgment of many thoughtful and patriotic citizens , lies in the organization of a competent and reliable pool through the instrumentality of the combined railway and commercial interests of the land , under a commission with final authority , and composed of persons with no other interests at stake than to perform faithfully their duties as arbitrators . The success of the West-bound trunk line pool would indicate , although it has not been surrounded by the same difficulties , that a general pooling of all the roads in the country is feasible . The recent appointment , with fixed salaries , of Messrs . Charles Francis Adams , Jr. , David A. Wells , and John A. Wright , as arbitrators , furnishes such a commission as , with full powers upon all points , should ultimately succeed in bringing about results which will meet with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ railways , but of the country at large . The character of these gentlemen is a sufficient guarantee to the public as to the value of the Commission , in case they be clothed with such ample powers as will enable them to enforce their decisions . It is understood that they have been invested with power to make their decisions final and obligatory , and that they have been requested to present a plan under which those decisions can be made absolutely operative . It has been urged upon many railway managers recently that the best manner to arrange this power will be for each governing line to deposit a large sum with the Board of Arbitration , subject to distribution to the aggrieved parties by them in case of infringement of contract , and this fund , whenever diminished , to be reinstated under orders from the arbitrators . If experience , under the supervision of a permanent board of such high character , should show that State and national legislation will be required in justice to all interests , such legislation can doubtless be obtained as will prove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people . If reasonable and proper rates of transportation can be thus established and maintained , the requisite capital for the additional railways that will be necessary to aid the growth and progress of the country can then be obtained , and so equitable an improvement will be effected in the control and management of railways that it will prove as valuable to the public of the United States as the system adopted in Great Britain has proved for the people and for railway properties there . Legitimate competition would not be suspended ; but the reckless system of forcing enormous business at irregular and unremunerative rates , as at present , for the advantage of the few and at the expense of the many , would be brought to an end . All legitimate agencies to develop and foster trade would be utilized , illegitimate and costly agencies would be dispensed with , and rates would at the same time be sustained at a reasonable and proper standard . These statements , though imperfect , will , it is hoped , serve to present for public consideration the principal causes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ management for many years past , and to aid in effecting a solution of the great railway problem .
