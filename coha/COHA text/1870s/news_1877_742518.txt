txt There is evidently a concerted movement on the part of a large number of manufacturers , to influence tho action of Congress with reference to a revision of the tariff . On Wednesday last thorn worn presented in Congress petitions and memorials to the number of some one hundred and twentyfive , relating to this subject . They came mainly from Massachusetts , Now-York , and Pennsylvania , but some were presented from Virginia , some from Kansas , and some from Maine . They were , doubtless , the forerunners of a flood from every State in which the manufacturing interest is at all large . Tho memorials of Wednesday wore all identical in form . They stated the business of their signers , and the number of workmen employed by them , and the petitions asked " that Congress will take no action concerning a revision of the tariff duties , until after it shall have ascertained by official inquiry the condition of tho industries of the country , and the nature of such tariff legislation as in the opinion of practical business men , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Those petitions came from employers of some 70,000 workmen , and principally from those engaged in iron and woolen industries , though they worn also signed by silk , cotton , lumber , chemical , and other manufacturers . Tho primary object of the petitioners is obviously delay . If Congress is not to act at all on a revision of the tariff until an official inquiry has boon made , it will hardly act at the present session . Such an inquirpas is requested by the manufacturers could not very well be made by tho Committee on Ways and Means during a session of Congress ; occupied , as the committee must be , with its routine work . If made by a commission , or by the committee during the recess , no report of the results of the inquiry could be had before the next seasion . That will bo a short one , and except in extraordinary cases , tariff legislation is not accomplished at a short session . What the manufacturers ask , therefore , is , practically a postponement of the question for two years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word-. ing of the petitions that the signers do not so much desire to secure a judicious revision as to stave off a revision that appears to them injudicious . They wish the work ? to bo undertaken with ' especial roforonce to the industries of the country , and to , be guided by the views of " practical business men . " This is natural , and to some extent just . But it is probable that in their sight the industries to be considered are principally those benefited by the protective features of the tariff , and not those on which those features impose serious hindrance , and the " practical business men " referred to , if wo may judge by the occupations of the petitioners , would probably be confined to much the , same class , But we think it will be conceded by those who have made any careful study of the operation of our present tariff , first , that there are many of its provisions which are obstructive , wasteful , and injurtous to general business interests , and which are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second , that there are items of so-called pro , tective legislation which are either excessive , or misapplied , or are a burden upon Industries which are as much entitled to 3Onsidoration as those which are now protected ; and third , that , in the present condition of the country , it is important , that a revision of the tariff should be made in the interest of the revenue , and that whore duties are too high for revenue , they should be reduced as low as can be done without too great and too sudden a shock to the interests which have hitherto been enjoying benefit from them . A revision of the tariff , keeping these facts in view , might be made , not only with justice , but with great advantage . The difficulties in the way of such a task are very groat . In the first place , as is evident from this concerted presentation of petitions , manufacturers who are , or who think that they are , protected by any one feature of the present tariff , will unite against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  that they are perfectly safe so long as the law is untouched , and that when a revision is once begun , absolute Safety is. no longer to be counted on . In the next place , there is no similarly united sentiment on the part of the business interests to bo benefited by a revision . These are only indirectly concerned , and they have little motive and less opportunity for concerted influence . Finally , there is but very languid interest in the matter in Congress , the members of which necessarily reflect the general condition of public opinion . Tho tariff is not so bad as it was night or ton years since ; there is not a surplus revenue to make reductions obviously safe and easy ; the protected industrios are unquestionably depressed and in a position to excite sympathy rather than criticism ; and the possibility of increasing the revenue or helping trade by reducing duties is one which appears very vague and " visionary " to the average Congressional intellect . Tho tax on tea and coffee has been out off , and its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious reduction of other duties , will bo resisted with great tenacity . The tendency is rather toward " stimulating " trade by steam-ship and railway subsidies than by removing from the laws the provisions which obstruct and embarrass it . Under these cipmnstances , the work of revision is plainly a very discouraging one , and Mr. Woon 's committee will have to push it , not only with great tact and patience , but with a degree of energy , which is not a common characteristic of any of the committees of the present Congress . If they , succeed at all , however , it must be by co-operation with the practical business men , who in fact , if not in the sense in which the petitions refer to them , are the best judges of the proper processes . If the committee can elicit any general interest in their work on the part of the class who know , because they have felt , the effect of the errors in the present tariff laws , they may accomplish something , in spite of the obstacles in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
