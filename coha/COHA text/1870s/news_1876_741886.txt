txt There has been considerable discussion concerning the succes-. sor of Gen. Belknap . No selection has been made , but it is reported that several names were discussed in Cabinet . It so they are not disclosed . Outside the Cabinet the name of Judge Hoar , of Massachusetts , Its been spoken of , and it is believed he could be prevailed upon to accept the position as a matter of duty . . There is a false report that Mr. Bass , night before last , told Mr. Conkling of the disclosure about to be made against Secretary Belknap , and that the latter went to the President that night and gave him the information . This would have been a breach of confidence with the committee on the part of Mr : Bass of which he is incapable . The House Committee on the Judiciary are unanimously of the opinion that the resignation of an officer does not remove him beyond the reach of an impeachment and trial by the Senate . The old French arms investigation is now recalled by the evidence in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that investigation , who appeared to have made propositions to New-York parties to procure contracts for a consideration . She professed the power to secure anything she desired at the War Department . There was a great deal of difficulty in finding the witness , but finally a woman came before the committee and testified to general and unimportant affairs , and the impression was created that some woman had attempted to get money from the New-York contractors under false pretenses , and had really gained nothing . The next year after the investigation it became the current belief that the real woman in the case had been concealed . A Senator on the committee was named as authority for this story . It is now suggested that the same lady who disposed of trading posts dealt in guns tor the French Army .
