txt Philistinism is a word we do not hoar very often on this . side of the sea , although we have a good deal of the thing which the word defines . We may not be overrun with it as they are in Germany  --  whence we get the term ; but we have far more than it is pleasant to confront , and we must goknowledge that it is steadily increasing . Philistine ( Philister ) was first applied by the students of the German universities to the townsmen whom , with the egotism and intolerance of their class , they chose to regard as external and irredeemable barbarians . But the word has come to have a juster and broader significance . It means a common-place , prosaic , pretentious , conceited person , who wishes to palm himself off on his acquaintances for something he is not . Ho may not be wholly to blame for his ignorance or dullness  --  nature marks the utility of blockheads by putting them in the majority  --  but he is to blame for his assumption and invariable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say the more determined he is to say it , and to say it over and over again Until patience itself turns to exasperation . He is also intolerant of the smallest opposition , even of any difference of opinion ; for lie claims for his narrowness little less than omniscience . Incapable of thinking himself , totallyinaccessible to ideas of any sort , he tries to believe ? and by dint of persistence ho succeeds in believing  --  that his limb and narrow horizon bounds the world . The Philistine , let us be thankful , is not the typical American . If he had been , we should not yet have outgrown our swaddling-clothes ; we should still have been debating what we might do , instead of doing what we could . He can not be a leader ; he hates and traduces leaders . His forte is in staying at the rear , and pulling back until events drag . him along , and then he tolls in scattering platitudes bow he has shaped events . He is not even a consistent conservative . He denounces radicalism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lid plays the radical , and is inwardly recalcitrant . His pretense and conceit make him false to the few dim convictions which lie owns . He is unwilling to have it thought that things can go on without his co-operation , and as everything goes on except himself , he is compelled to be untruthful for the sake of appearances . The Philistine is always wise after the tact . Though generally . wrong , he has a weakness for being thought right . He is full of prophecies which are never verified ; but when they are not , he wonders that anybody could have made them . He recalls the fiction that he foretold exactly the opposite . and every man of experience and acute discernment , ha adds , ought to have known that he could not have been mistaken . Usually he takes a dolor-. ous view of affairs , and intimates that , while other countries are singularly prosperous , this Republic is gravi- , tating rapidly toward Satan . The great want is in proper counselors and directors of the nation , ( the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in his mind , the proporest man , ) and in the incapacity of such as it has to interpret the signs of the times . When he rises to this height of assertion lie is something of a Goliath in speech , though an idea is the stone in the sling of any David which shall bring him to the ground . There are different degrees of Philistines ; for there is nothing so small that has not its smaller . Some of them look up to others who possess the force of inertia , the permanence of stagnation , the influence of vapidity . It is a curious sight to see a pigmy marshaling the dwarfs , and heaping platitudes on emptiness . There is no elevation ; but there is a vast spreading which , with all its thinness , has the power of obstructing the diffusion of ideas , and the growth of individuality . We Faye Philistines in polities  --  nowhere so many  --  in office , in literature , in the professions , in business , in society , in the family . Their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They ' are every one pretenders , shallow , vain , pompous , thickskinned . They have the audacity of unintelligence , and the density of perception , which debars them from seeing their own ridiculousness . In politics , they harangue their listeners to flight or to slumber ; in office , they clog the wheels of affairs , and exhaust resignation ; in literature , their oracles are self-evident ; the professions they turn to satire ; in business , they occupy one 's time , and charge for it in the bill ; in society , they attitudinize and bore ; in the family , they profit by their position to repel their wives and disgust their children . They represent the mankind who , CATO said , was created for the laughter of the gods . The greatest men feel their littleness painfully ; the Philistines , who are the least of mon , feel only their greatness . They are the bloated beings who feel tempted to doff their hats when their name is mentioned ; who might greet the sun by taking out their watches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
