THE SADDEST OF ALL IS LOVING . I. " TIJE 'S angry with me . " Spoken by Miss 11 Randall , with the slight drawl and indifferent manner which had from the first proved so attractive to Richard Franklin . Quite her match in nonchalance , however , Dick merely glanced at his pretty partner and said : " Shall we go back to the ball-room and try that waltz again ? It is not always one can dance after Strauss music , and perhaps we are hardly wise to lose so many moments . " " Are n't you sorry for me ? He was in a dreadful passion . " Who ? " " Why , Barry Harwood . " " Was he ? " They were whirling away in the giddy dance . Dick-always too fond of waltzing to think of much else with such a partner and such music-at this particular time was so absorbed in the fascinations of the dip , which he had but recently accomplished , that he did not notice the upturned face , with its sweet eyes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lips had spoken . It did not , however , pass unobserved . Across the room stood Barry Har*vood , frowning upon the young naval officer who for the past few weeks had won many of the smiles he had thought all his own . Louise Randall felt " COD aazss *nz DEAR OLD FLAG . " // her heart grow cold as she saw the look he cast upon Dick , and clung closer to her companions arm as they left the hall-room , walked down the stairs into the parlor , through the long windows out on to the wide piazza which overlooks the Rapids of our grand old Niagara . Many of the dancers had taken refuge here , and the piazza was crowded with faces , young and old . Light-hearted girls laughed and talked merrily with handsome men ; mammas conversed in low tones with one another ; lovers quarreled and cooed in corners ; some walked uneasily up and down , while others , *veary of the gay scene in which they had no share , sought the billiard-rooms below . All were finding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , while few were entirely happy , perhaps none were altogether miserable . Louise was restless and ill at ease . her evening with Richard had been at best unsatisfactory , and her lover was angry with her . " Delicious waltz , " said Franklin . " I hope Miss Louise enjoyed it as much as I did . " " I sometimes think you are not capable of any kind of enjoyment . " " Because I have failed to appreciate Miss Randall 's society ? Surely you are unjust . " " I do n't want to be unjust . You did seem to enjoy it , and to me it is the one waltz ever to be remembered , for-her voice fell- " it is the last . I promised Barry I wouldu't dance with you again . " " Nonsense , Miss Louise , how absmii*d ! Barrv does n't mind me . " He minds my dancing with any one hut him . " They were leaning over the railing now . " I never thought Harwood an exacting man . I shall express @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the morning . A duel on a small scale might furnish excitement for you Peol ) le . Even the Falls themselves must have grown tame to those of you who have spent the summer here . " She laughed a faint laugh , which quite died away as Harwood 's form emerged from the darkness , and Harwood 's voice said : " I have been hunting you every where Miss Louise . Madame Mamma wants you , and I am sent to escort you to her , or " - with an attempt at hauteur- " I should not claim that privilege . " Left to himself , Richard stood leaning against a pillar with folded arms . He was thinking over the last few weeks and the evening he had just spent . He had but recently returned from a voyage in the Mediterranean , and , having a letive of two or three months , he had come to Niagara , expecting there to meet some old and valued friends from the South , who had intended there to take up their abode for the summer months . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed their plans , and gone instead to a more quiet place in the northern part of New York State , where the- mother , a delicate womnan , could breathe the fresh air from the mountains , and be more secluded than at Niagara . The night of his arrival he chanced to fall in with Barry Harwood , whom he had known some years before , and was persuaded by him to stay over just long enough " to see the sights , you know . " Ilarwood was a good kind of a fellow , and pleased to find so congenial a companion as Dick . Next morning , after presenting him to his beautiful fianede , Miss Randall and her mother insisted upon his giving up his rooms at the International , coming to their hotel , and considering himself one of their party . How pleasantly the days had passed since then ! Was it any wonder that in the society of Miss Randall he forgot all else ? Forgot the summer he had promised himself with Ruth Heaton-dear little Ruth !  --  the ideal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fondly all the long years away from her ? Forgot even Barry Harwood , and stayed on and on , unmindful that the bright days were slipping away , and of the little heart up in the mountains that longed so earnestly for his coming ? To-night , for the first time , it all came hack upon him , and he was too honest not to admit to himself that to stay longer where he was would be worse than folly . He was not a vain man . Nature had , indeed , liberally endowed him in mind and person . One seldom looked upon his length of limb and breadth of shoulder without feeling that there must be a corresponding strength and beauty of heart and soul . But , though not given to overrating his own charms , he could not fail to discover , by the light of to-night 's revelation , that Louise 's preference for himself was as positive as though she had been free to confess or he willing to ask it , and was compelled to acknowledge that he had been unpardonably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer think unreasonable the gloomy fits of jealousy in which Barry had of late so frequently indulged . His eyes were opened now , and from his heart he despised himself and pitied Barry , who , through him , had lost all that made the world brightest . Unwittingly he had done him the deepest injnry-* poor return , indeed , for all Barry 's friendship from one whose pride lay in his appreciation of and gratitude for a kind act ; and now he felt that when on the morrow he should meet him face to face his punishment would be indeed begun . Dick was a true-hearted fellow , with more refinement and delicacy of feeling than fall to the lot of most men ; and as the conviction that Louise looked upon him with partial eyes stole over him with md-easing force , he resolved that after to-morrow he would go away out of her life , cost what it might . After all , the sacrifice would not be great ; for , as his thoughts went back to Ruth-a journey they took but rarely in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charmed with Louise , he did not love her . There was a fascination about the girl before which most men bowed . The far-off look in her eyes , the coquettish mouth , and the very touch of her hand had brought sad days into the lives of other women , and seemed likely now to ruin the happiness of Ruth Heaton . Yet Louise was not heartless , and seemed half unconscious of the power she held . She was flattered and courted long before her schooldays were over , and knew not what it was to have men pass her by unnoticed . Nearly a year before , she had engaged herself to Barry Harwood , because he was considered a desirable parti , and she liked no one better . Until she met Franklin she had worn her engagement lightly ; but for the past few weeks not only had Harwoods society been a bore to her , but his very presence an annoyance . She did not ask herself why this was , nor did she seek to have it otherwise , but allowed herself to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that each day found the tall figure by her side , and the blue eyes looking down into hers with undisguised admiration . Yes , day after to-morrow Dick would leave them . To-night he would write to Ruth and tell her of his coming ; his heart beat quicker at the very thought . To-morrow the remittance he had been daily expecting must come , and he could no longer have that excuse for delay . If not , Barry would , no doubt , be glad to furnish him with any sum requisite to his departure . This was Tuesday , and he should not stay a day longer than Thursday . Having come to this determination , he sbook himself as if to get rid of his perplexing thoughts , and walked back through the deserted parlors and off to his rooms , resolving not to write the letter , after all , but to give Ruth a surprise . II . Meanwhile a scene had been going on bet*t'een the lovers which neither had anticipated , but which events had predicted must take place as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mere convenience on the one side and a mad infatuation on the other . Turning away from Franklin , Barry said , " It requires very little penetration , Louise , to discover that you find Franklin a very pleasant companion . " Well , I do n't know why I should eternally talk to you , Barry , simply because we are engaged . I had always hoped I might be spared from marrying a jealous man . " " Jealous man ! That 's quite a joke ! As repeatedly as I 've been called a fool ' for allowing so many flirtations to go on without a single prohibition . Upon my soul , Louise , this is hard ! " " What but jealousy , or some other equally small virtue , could induce you to bore mamma with complaints of my coldness , and all that sort of thing , in the tiresome way you have for the last two or three days ? " " Has Mrs. Randall complained of my being tiresome ? ' She seemed to agree with me in all that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in disapproval of this latest affair of yours . " " Well , I do n't know that mamma herself was particularly bored , but I know I was when she talked to me about it . " She finished this sentence with a yawn , and added , " Come , take me up stairs now . " " Not until you have answered me , Louise . Has your mother been wearing one face to me and another to you ? Is she not still my friend ? " " Of course she 's your friend , Barry , and so am I. Only do n't be stupid , or make a quarrel with me , or get mamma put out with me , as you certainly will if you tell her any snore tales of my perfidy . " " Now you are trifling . " " Oh , well , call it that if you will . Only let me go to bed , for I am unconscionably sleepy . " Barry stopped suddenly . His short , rather thickset figure grew quite majestic as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a determination which scarcely ever marked his appearance or manner when Louise was by , said : " Louise , are you cold and heartless , or are you what I have loved to think you-what I will think you yet , if you will let me ? Perhaps you do not care to hear all I have suffered since you met Franklin ? " Louise 's heart pronounced her guilty , and she longed to ease her conscience by one of those concessions which never failed to soften her lover , and which none knew better than she how to make . Laying her hand upon his arm , she said , softly , " Forgive me , Barry , that I have made you suffer . It is the same old story of my thoughtlessness and love of variety . Shall I ever make the good fiancee I ought to be ? Will you forgive me this once , Barry ? " " That I will , Louise , and love you the better for having asked it of me . And now I will take you to your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this state of things is at an end , that I may once more lie down in peace . " " What state of things do you mean ? " withdrawing her hand , which he had takems into his own . " This flirtation with Franklin . I do n't like to use harsh terms , but you compel nine to do so by purposely misunderstanding what I say . " " It is not a flirtation , Barry , and I do n't like you to say such things to me . " " Then , I swear it is something more ; " and his voice grew low and husky as he added , " And , on my soul , I believe you are the unprincipled flirt I have tried not to think you . " " Barry ! " imploringly . " And what am I but one of the poor , miserable dupes who have followed in your path ! Franklin comes next in order , and may the Lord pity him , for he will find no mercy at your hands . " // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " His lips moved . " No appeal is necessary . You have insulted the woman you professed to love ; and whether she has a heart or not , she has the sensibility to be deeply wounded by your words , and the strength to tell you that all claim to her affection or regard ceases from this moment . " " Louise , darling- " " Hush ! You have no longer the right to address me so . I shall never forget what you have said to-night . Here is the ring I have worn for your sake , and whatever else you may have given me shall be as faithfully returned . Good-night ! " And without the slightest falter in her voice , or tremor in her frame , she swept by the stunned Barry , and left him to look his trouble in the face , and fight it out alone . He never knew how the night passed . Something brought conviction to his heart that all was over , and that any thought of reconciliation was hopeless . But not till long after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him , hut her love for Richard , which had made the step she hnd taken so easy for her . When Louise , upon reaching her room , had replaced her white dress by her soft blue wrapper. she threw herself into a lo*v chair by the win ( low and b to over egan think what she had done . She had liked Barry well enough , and nothing had been further from her thoughts than to dismiss him as she had done to-night . She had been contented-yes , quite happy-in the thought that some day she should be sole mistress of Harwoods home , and the wife of a man whom all men esteemed . Her mother had desired nothing better for her daughter . 1-ler friends were warm in their congratulations , and the envy she saw on many sides added to the enjoyment of her triumph . Until Franklin crossed her path all had been well ; but bow could she see him day after day and be the one woman to fail to acknowledge his superiority ? She was sorry for Barry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up without a pang all her plans for the future , when she should be the wife of a man rich enough to gratify every desire of her heart . But her cheeks burned as the insulting words he had used to-night came back to her , and she clinched her hands in indignation that a man should dare speak to her as Barry had done . Then her thoughts turned to Franklin . Suddenly the fact that it was him she loved , and not Barry , en me upon her with a startling conviction that sent the blood into her fair face , dyeing it with crimson blushes . She had a bard struggle with herself that night ; but before she slept came the resolve to make it all right with Barry the next day . IlL It was with well-assumen indifference that Franklin entered the breakfast - room next morning ; and he saw , with some surprise , that Voa . XLIII. - No. 254. -i 6 Louise was not in her accustomed place , and that Mrs. Randall had been breakfasting alone . Rising as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of questions : " Where is Barry Harwood , Mr. Franklin ? Why has he gone away ? have you seen Louise this morning ? Did she know last night that lie was going ? It is very strange , and I can not at all understand it . " " Barry has n't gone ? It must be something very sudden . lie had no such intention last night . " " Well , I must find Louise immediately , and see what light she can throw upon this peculiar step of his . " In a thoroughly uncomfortable frame of mind Dick took his breakfast hastily , left the hotel , and walked down the road toward the bridge . As he pursued his way alone he tried to put out of his mind the recollections of last night , and the unpleasant discovery of Barry 's departure this morning . So he swung his cane , whistled , and even contrived to get up a cheerful expression of countenance as he thought that in a few days he would be with Ruth , where the remembrance of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Sterlings , were at the Clifton house , and he had promised-he did n't care to think how long ago-that he would see them in a few days . lie was almost ashamed to go now , even to carry the excuse she was so well versed in creating ; but he put a bold face on the matter , and , on reaching the hotel , met Mrs. Sterling and her three daughters with the air of an old friend whose visits had been frequent . here he remained all the morning , and was wonderfully entertained by a whole bevy of girls , who were altogether too nice to have been neglected all this time , without endeavoring in some measure to make up for it by staying just long enough to make the younger ones hope they should see him again , and the older ones secretly wish they had never met him at all . Back at the " Cataract " o twe more , he was passing through one of the Ii alls , on his way to his rooms , when he caught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boa jour , Miss Louise ! You are looking for something . Can I help you ? " " Thank you ; yes . A ball from my coral is missing , and I think I must have lost it here last night after I left you . " " It could not be lost in a *vorse place . " Her eyes had never worn so sad a look , and it was evident she had been crying . So he studiously avoided looking at her , or seeming to notice in any way her altered appearance . He succeeded even in controlling his manner , which he feared might be too sympathetic , as he stooped to pick up the coral ball which his keen eyes had at last discovered , saying , " Harwood did n't tell me he should go so early this morning . I was quite depending on him to assist me in getting away from this enchanted spot . My banker still fails to honor : // qwq any other time . The night of that day neither of them could ever efface from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Dick asked for one more short walk , one more talk about the Rapids-they meant so many things to him  --  and one more long look from their favorite stand-point . " And now good-night , and good-by . " Louise gave him her hand . " I wish I could feel it was just a little hard for you to go . " " It is hard , Louise , " unconsciously using her name thus for the first time . " I have never known a woman at whose side I would rather linger . It will be hard to put you out of my thoughts when I am gone . I wish you would tell me I need not try . " " I should be very miserable if I thought you would forget me . Now I know you will not . Oh , what a month this has been There was silence for a few moments . Then , releasing her hand , which she had given him in farewell , Dick said : " Good-bys are horrid things . Let 's play I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usual good-night . 1 shall be off in the morning long before you are up . " Was her happiness , so nearly completed , to he taken from her in this way ? She could not have it so . She must understand him more fully before he left ; so she spoke " I like good-bys . One 's whole heart goes out in them , and one is left with sweet memories to live upon during the dreadful separation that follows . " Bending down , he imprinted one kiss upon her lips . " Good-by , darling And then , drawing her arm hastily through his , without another word , took her back to the brilliantly lighted parlors ; and , having said a few words of parting and thanks for her kindness to Mrs. Randall , he left them . always recalled a form passing and repassing the bay filled from early spring with white waher wherever she might chance to be-unmind- ter-lilies. qwq how it would be when he came , she sometimes doubted if she could be more contented when he really should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last few weeks she had often grown restless and tired of waiting , and thought , with a pang , that the beautiful summer was slipping away , and he had not come to her . It was strange , too , that he did not write . His last letter had contained the promise of another in a few days , and had declared his intention of making his visit at Niagara a short one . Was he not impatient to see her once more ? He had said so , and she was only too glad to believe any thing to which her own heart responded so fondly . She had waited very patiently all the three years of his absence , living on his letters , which came with regularity , and were fond , though never lover-like . Playmates from their youngest days , they had been taught to believe that as they grew to manhood aud womanhood their lives were to be dependent upon each other ; and , though no engagement had been entered upon , each knew that such was the dearest wish of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strongest intimacy and friendship . Three years before , Ruth , then little more than a child , had said good-by to Dick with her arms about his neck and her voice choked with sobs ; and when he made one final effort , and rushed from her , she could not see the brave young midshipman 's retreating form for the blinding tears that filled her eyes . Since then her studies and her play had always been more improving or amusing , according to the amount of interest Dick had seemed to take in her written accounts of each . And her loving ambition had been to become such a woman as he would most desire to have her . While she longs to see him once more , she never asks herself why he does not come , and not one reproachful thought does she have . It was a lovely evening . Mr. Heaton had just returned from the village , and had called Iv . out " No , " in answer to Ruth 's upraised hand , as she stood in her boat to signal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon his arm , and heard a voice say , " Mr. Ileaton , you have not forgotten Dick ? " Turning , he beheld Richard Franklin , older by three years than when he last saw him , more pleasing in his maturer beauty , and very fair to look upon . " Dick , my dear boy , you have come at last ! Taller and bigger than ever , aren t you ? I do n't believe Ruth will know you . " " Shall I see Ruth if I go into the house ? " Up in the northern part of New York the village of Wells lies nestled among its many hills , as beautiful a spot as the most romantic lover of nature could desire . Here it was that Ruth Heaton had come , with her father and mother , to spend the summer months . They had taken one of the three pretty cottages that lie along the shore of the lake , which forms the chief attraction of the place , and is the most frequented by the summer visitors . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around , with its shaded banks , its island in the centre , and , at the further end , // " No ; there she is , out on the lake . You had better stay here until she turns to come in , when you can meet her down by the boathouse , and give her as great a surprise as you did me ; or , if you choose , you can take one of the boats and row out to her . " " I think I will see Mrs. Heaton first , Sir . " But he had only a few moments for a warm greeting from that quarter , when Mr. Heaton called out from the porch : " Run , my good fellow ; she is near the boathouse . " And he reached there in time to find her just coming in . " Sha' n't I help you ? " Her hack was toward him . " No , thank you , Sir . " She had only partially turned her head , and had evidently taken him for a stranger . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she guided the boat carefully to its moorings , secured it fast , leaped on to the steps , and mounted to the platform . " By Jove ! This is a pretty welcome to give a fellow ! " " Oh ! why , Dick ! " As her musical voice once more fell on his ear her words seemed like a chord from some old half-forgotten strain , the three notes expressing surprise and joy and complete satisfaction . She gave him her hand and looked down upon the ground , and Dick did not dare claim a more affectionate salutation . In an instant however , her eyes flashed up at him , and her saucy lips looked very tempting as she began to rattle on about her not expecting him-how changed he was-how blue his eyes had grown - was it being at sea made them so ? - how glad mamma would be " I have been to the house , Siebling . " " Not before you had seen me , Raed ? how could you ? " " How was I to know you were n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He watched the quiet smile creep around her mouth . The affection between himself and her mother was beautiful , not only in her eyes but to all who ever saw them together . " I think she will soon be right well now . " The last word was emphasized hy look and tone as she folded her right hand over her left , which already rested on his arm . " Is n't this a sweet place to live in for weeks and weeks ? How could you wait so long at Niagara , when we were n't there ? " Little dreaming that he had chosen to stay away , the nnconscious child did not catch the slight shadow of his frown as she continued to chirp along at his side , too happy to think of any thing else than that Dick was hers , and she was Dick 's , and that they both belonged to papa and mamma . They had taken the long way back to the cottage , which they reached at last , and found Mr. Heaton still waiting at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " whether Ruth would come hack in her right mind or not . " " I thought you looked a little dazed , daughter . " " So I was , papa , for a few moments at least , " she said , with a caress ; " and now for tea . Dick is very hungry , and so am I. " The evening was a pleasant one . They all sat out on the porch , and Dick , leaning back in his chair , with Ruth on a low seat at his feet , looking shyly into his face , talked in his own easy way of his life at sea , and his travels and adventures in foreign lands . Later , Ruth slipped away from them , and presently through the open window came the soft tones of the piano . Ruth was too fond of her music to he kept long from it , even by Dick , and , besides , she wanted to get away by herself , where she was not dazzled by the sight of him , and think for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clapped her hands , and screwed her mouth into comical little shapes-her favorite mode of expressing the intense delight which just then was dancing in her eyes . As for Dick , long before the evening was over , he fell to wondering how he could have staid so long from her side , and , except when his farewell to Louise would force itself into his mind , he was very happy and contented ; and when at last the little party separated for the night , he could not fail to see that his coming had brightened the three faces that were as dear to him as any in the world . Next morning Ruth wanted to take Dick out in her boat , that he might see how well she managed her oars , and was impatient because Mrs. Ileaton could not spare him till she had had a motherly talk with him , and had asked the many questions which her affection and interest prompted . It was the first of many days spent upon the lake . Dick grew to look eagerly each morning for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dress of dark blue , should call to him to prepare himself for his row ; and often , as their boat glided across the water , he teaching her to keep time with his longer and more even strokes , he would catch sight of the face half turned to his for approval , of the sunny head , with its pretty braids , and think , with a feeling of fond pride , that no other woman was ever just like her , and none ever so lovely . She had a half-playful way , all her own , of beguiling the hours for him , and was so full of vivacity and change that he had never a chance to grow weary . Each day found him more in love with Ruth , and the knowledge of this brought him the purest happiness he had ever known . Their relations to each other did not require that he should ask her hand in a formal way ; and so , one day , soon after his coming , as they walked together , he spoke a few simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of his visit at Niagara he said little ; and , in fact , but little remained in his memory . He had spoken of Louise ; and once , as he lay on the grass at Ruth 's feet , puffing out great clouds // of smoke from his pipe-Barry Harwood 's gift - he hadsaid : " She was very beautiful , and had it not been for somebody farprettier , she might have worked my destruction , as she has many another man s . Ruth smiled and said , but not as though speaking of the subject in hand , " I do n't think , Dick , that you could be charmed by a simply beautiful woman . She must be good , too . " " I fear , Ruth , I should have been quite like other men , and doue a score of foolish things , had it not been for your memory , which is always before me . " He could say these things now , for only when alone was he troubled with thoughts of Louise . With Ruth his whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save the parts in which she had some share , seemed never to be remembered . Once in a while he did ask himself if away from her dear presence he should always be true to her , always feel that she was the one being on earth to whom his heart would turn with that unswerving allegiance which characterized it now . One day , toward the last of August , there came an order not altogether unexpected , but none the Thss un*velcome . Dick was to go to Portsmouth ; and while Mr. Ileaton felt sanguine of having him ordered to Washington , where they were all to pass the winter , yet the quiet , blissful times were over , and they felt that Dick was , after all , subject to the government he served , and not to the warm hearts whose loving behests he loved to obey . " In these few months at Portsmouth I shall learn to do without you when I go on a cruise again , darling , and you shall find , in your gay winter at Washington , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you . " " Oh , Dick , I ca n't bear to think of your going to sea again , and what sort of a winter can Washington give me if von are not there ? " Parting thus , Ruth took up her life where she had left it when Dick came . Father and mother saw no change in face or temper , which were always bright and gay ; and if there was any difference in her winning ways , they were only more tender and more unselfish . Dick , *n the other hand , evinced unwonted restlessness and discontentin every one of his daily letters ; and , in fact , he was as amazed as he was delighted to find that his loneliness was even greater than he had anticipated , and he fairly reveled in the consciousness of being as thoroughly miserable as any one of the devoted lovers he had known aboard ship . Nothing pleased him more than to have his old comrades , who had known so well how fickle he used to be , nag him about his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty girls were discussed , and declare that it must all be owing to the fact that he was anchored somewhere at last . He paid a few official calls , and the rest of his time-when he was not sleeping or dining , or occupied with his duties , which were almost nominal-was absorbed in smoking and thinking of Ruth , ox impatiently stroking his mustache , and writing to her . V. But this state of affairs was not of long duration . October found them once more together . Mr. Heaton had gone to Washington , not only to see about a house fit for entertaining , but as much to see about Dick 's orders as any thing else , and had secured , besides a removal to the Observatory at Washington , a delay of two weeks , " to be disposed of as you like , " he wrote to Dick ; " but I would suggest that two dear women are still at Wells , without a man to look after them . No slur upon our faithful old servant , Mose ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more acceptable . I ca n't go for ten days at least . " And Dick had not been slow to take the hint . He met Ruth with , " I have only learned that I ca n't do without you at all , Ruth ; and the probability is , mother , " turning to Mrs. Heaton , " that I shall resign when an order comes to go to sea . " One week of the precious leave had already gone , when there came a day into the life of each which neither ever forgot . Ruth and Dick had had a pleasant ramble that morning over some of the neighboring hills , and had returned with their arms laden with flowers , which were to decorate Mrs. Heaton 's room . As they entered the parlor , Ruth saw upon the table a letter addressed to Dick , and snatching it hastily , asked , with a merry laugh , if she might be the first to read it . Dick , who had thrown his flowers down upon the sofa , and was lighting his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an unpaid bill , do n't scold . " " If you have any such things you have been sailing under false colors . " How her thoughtless speech came back to her in after-days . She was slowly breaking the seal . Presently Dick started as a cold , unnatural voice half whispered , " Take your letter , Dick . I ca n't read it . I do n't understand it . " And turning , he saw Ruth very pale , with a strange , bewildered look upon her face . With a dread presentiment he took the letter from her hands , and read the words : " Am I to live forever on the memory of those few weeks ? You are very cruel not to come to me when you must know how utterly miserable I am , with all kinds of jealous fears taking possession of me . Why should that other woman keep you from my side ? You can not be to her what you are to me . And oh , Richard , is it not enough that I love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had never been put to such a test as when he , with apparentcalmness , folded the note , put it carefully into its envelope , and , turuing to Ruth , said : // " How far did you read , dear ? I wish I might have spared you this . " " I-I am sure I am very stupid , for I can not think what she means " - putting her hand to her forehead , as though trying to comprehend it all . " XYhat is it about being miserable without you ? " " Ruth , this is something I can not explain . Another 's honor is at stake , and you must trust me . " " Must trust ' you ! Another 's honor at stake ! ' Do you mean that Miss Randall would not wish me to know ? It ca n't be that youthat she- Oh , Dick , I 'm afraid I am beginning to understand . " " Would to heaven you had never seen this ! " His voice and words seemed to bring her back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have read enough to know that I am not the only woman who claims your love . I know too , now , that you lingered weeks with her at Niagara when you might have been with me , and perhaps gave her every right to send such words to you as she has . " " If you were not greatly excited you could not say that . Try to listen calmly to what I have to say . " He led her to the sofa , and Ruth never forgot how tender his voice sounded as he stood before her and said , " You are the only woman I have ever loved , and no other has power to take me from you . Miss Randall is a beautiful , fascinating girl whom I met for a few weeks , and whose society I enjoyed at the time , but to whom 1 have given scarcely a thought since . " " how does she dare , then , write you as she has , knowing , too , that you are here with me your promised wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love to her ; one word to lead her to write as she has ? " He could not lie to the truthful face before him . He felt that a confession must be made , which was becoming every moment more difficult , and so he told her all-withholding nothing , and throwing no blame where he felt that it was not deserved . As he finished with the scene on the piazza the night before he left , she shuddered slightly . Then she spoke calmly : " Thank you for being frank enough to tell me the whole truth . Further concealment could have done no good . It would have been better for both had I known it from the first . Very little need be said now , and we must speak no words that we shall regret hereafter . Of course it is all over between us . You have no right to expect any thing else . " She had risen proudly as she finished . Dick 's voice startled her as he exclaimed , " Ruth , you ca n't mean that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be otherwise after what you have told me . At least , in your calmer moments , you will not doubt the course I shall take . " She had been unnaturally quiet thus far . It had cost but little effort to maintain perfect control of voice and manner , for pride had sustained her throughout . But now as she looked up at Dick , standing pale and motionless , with a hopeless , helpless woe in his face , all his devotion to her and all her love for him rushed over her , and , in an agony she had never known before , she threw herself upon the sofa and burst into tears . Perhaps it was best for Dick that he should turn comforter , and thus lose in some degree a sense of his own grief . Kneeling by her , he folded the little figure in his arms , and *vhispered words of love and comfort until Ruth almost smiled through her tears . 11cr mood had changed , and wounded pride and indignation had given way to better feelings . A deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands , with the cry , " Oh , Dick ! you have baca mine so long , how can I give you up ? " " Ruth , I shall not go away from you . You told me once I might always stay . " " But then I did not know how that could make another suffer . Oh , Dick ! if she loves " oti as I do  --  but she can not . " " No , darling , she can not . And I do not love her . If you send me away from you , I shall not go to her . " " Not ifl ask it ? " " When our engagement is broken , you will have no right to ask any thing ; least of all , this . " " Oh , Dick ! I fear I am doing wrong in listening to you . I am not doing as I would be done by-I ca n't tell-am I ? " Her weary , puzzled look and tear-stained face touched him beyond expression . He had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and his tone was grave and earnest , as he continued to urge . " Ruth , you know what your influence has done for me , and I tell you now that that woman will rouse the seven demons in my heart . I wo n't go back to her . Oh , Ruth ! keep me good and pure by letting me go on loving you . " And what was the poor tired child 's answer , but to clasp her arms tightly about his neck and whisper , " You may stay . " The next day Dick 's manner with Ruth wa* more than ever tender . Not alone because soon he must leave her for a while and go back to his lonely life , but because his eyes never once turned toward her that he did not think how very , very near he had come to losing her altogether . Louise 's note he had tossed aside , thinking more of the harm it had done than of the answer it required . He did not dream that , having performed its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which would coatplete what the first had begun . Two days after Louise 's note reached him came one from Mrs. Randall , which , on opening , he took at once to Ruth . " I fear this means more trouble , and I have // come to my good angel to ask her to meet it with me . " Together they read the singular communica-tion : " BoSTON , October 15 . " Mv DEAR Ms .. FRAs.xane ,  --  It is only lately I have learned you were my daughter 's accepted lover . She has hitherto concealed it from me in the strangest way . I write to inform you that she is very ill , and if you can possibly come to her it certainly is your duty to do so ; though I acknowledge I had hoped you would never cross our pathway again . " You may have seen the accounts of the heroic way in which Barry Harivood lost his life in rescuing a child from a burning building . One paper actually alluded to his having had an affair of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the one which my poor child read before I could prevent its falling into her hands . That night this high fever came on which has been raging ever since . In her delirium she calls piteously for you . And , much as I dread seeing you , I must beg you to come . L. LE L. RANDALL . " " had you heard of Mr. Harwood 's death before , Dick ? " Ruth asked , with something of l ) recision in her tone . He looked at her inquiringly . Was this the only thought she had in this moment of acute anguish to himself ? He could not know the lesson she had learned in the suffering of two days before . She comprehended now very quickly what her own duty was , and as quickly determined to go about it in the best way that she might help Dick faithfully to perform his . Her firm , quiet manner and reassuring look made him answer as directly . " No . Poor Barry ! Love never brought him much happiness , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am glad he died that way . " This was a man 's view of it . Ruth told him so , and added , " I want you to go to-night , Raed . Papa will come back to-morrow , and we shall not be alone . " " Go where ? " " To this poor mother who wants you . You can solve this mystery- " He interrupted her by covering his eyes with his hand , and muttering , " I can not see that woman . It will be more than I can bear to witness her suffering . " " You mean- " " I mean Louise . Ruth , my courage is not equal to this . My darling , can not I write to Mrs. Randall ? " " Dick , I must ask even this of you . " She was still so completely her old self-talking just as if she were urging him merely to go to the village against his will-that he looked down at her and tried to smile . But he could not . Turning from her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stifle the sobs that shook his frame . Ruth could hardly refrain from going to him then , and clinging to him , and beseeching him only to stop , and she would concede every thing . But she sat down and waited for a few moments . " Dick , if this were your sister you would go to her . " " But she is not my sister , and the woman loves me . " Again she feared her calmness might leave her . " Raed , will you come and sit down by me ? There-so. " lie had thrown himself on an ottoman at her feet , and she had taken his face in her two hands , and was looking down at him , as he ever afterward loved to remember , with a blessing of pence in her eyes . " If I , your own Ruth , can ask you to go , is it too hard for you ? " lie took her hands in his , rose to his feet , and with something of his natural tone of voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready . I do this simply because you ask it , though I confess I should be ashamed that , as a man , my sympathy and honor are no more aroused by the appeal of this letter . Your words have inspired me with both . " " Mamma must not know what has called you away , Dick . " She was stowing some lunch away in his bag . " This will be the first time we have deceived her , Ruth . " " Do n't call it deceiving . " She looked at him reproachfully . " She has n't known about Miss Randall , and it would be useless to *vorry her now . I think you could be back before your leave is out . Mrs. Heaton pitied him , but wished him boa voyaqe , and bade him hurry back . " I shall go to the staliou , mamma , " Ruth called from the foot of the stairs , " and Mose will see that I come back all right . " They had n't much time before the train came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ruth said . Their good-by was in the carriage . " I go for your sake , Ruth . " " Oh , Dick , you ought to go for your own How she trusted him now ! A smile of satisfaction broke over his face at the thought of it . As the train whizzed off he caught one glimpse of a sunny face at the carriage window , and could not tell whether she had thrown a kiss to him or had held out her hand in benediction . VI . Dick had been gone three days , when a telegram came a ( ldressed to Ruth . It ran thus : " I am ordered to sea at once . Sail from Boston in the Constitution on Saturday . Will try to come to say good-by . It . F. " Ruth was frightened , and read it aloud . " I should like to know , " cried Mr. Heaton , " if this is the way they keep their promises at the Navy Department ? " Oh , papa- " The grief in her face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of present indignation could not postpone Dick 's departure now , and the old gentleman gave vent to his feelings in an expression which sounded very much like " By thunder ! " " Do n't papa . " It was almost like a waiL // " Ruth , my own darling little Ruth . " He had taken her on to his knee , and laid her head upon his shoulder . " Tell me now , sweet , why did the boy go away before his leave was out , anyhow ? I 've thought it a little strange all along . " She was tired ont with worrying all these days alone , aud this , with the thought of that other woman so near him now , made her tell in broken sobs the whole story . " This is a grievous case , daughter , " he said , as she came to the end . " Father must manage it for you . " " You do n't blame Dick , father ? " She lifted her head from his shoulder . " He ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and if he has not already gone out of yours , so much the worse for us all . " He carried her up stairs to her mother 's room , and went off to telegraph Dick not to come , even if he had time , and then wrote him why . Franklin had found Mrs. Randall eagerly looking for him , and the torrent of abuse from that good lady 's lips was not less than he had expected . Louise 's delirium was over , and her physician and old friend , knowing well the true cause of her illness , felt that it was better she should see Franklin at once ; and on being told by Dick how the matter really stood , he had said , with almost a father 's tenderness , " My good fellow , she ought to have known this long ago . Tell her now , in the fewest words possible , and leave the rest to me . " So their interview had been very short . As Dick came down stairs the doctor met him , and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dick interrupted him : " Gracious Heavens , doctor ! That woman face will haunt me to my dying day . Tell me before I go that I have not killed her . " " No , my lad ; bless you-no , no . " Dick wrung his hand , and went quickly out of the house to breast a driving storm of wind and rain back to his hotel . Here he met one of his Portsmouth friends , who told him of his orders , which were probably traveling around after him . Next morning he telegraphed to the Navy Department to know what they were , and sent the substance of the message when it came to Ruth . Mr. Heaton had wisely calc*lated on Dick 's having to go to Portsmouth , and there his letter found him . And so Dick , with no time to go to Wells , and a command from Mr. Heaton not to communicate with Ruth in any way , left the country which had become so dear to him in these summer months , because it was hers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the one heart he would have given all the world to have had place in , he took a sad pleasure now in thinking that the little hand from the carriage window had been extended in blessing , and his young , buoyant nature responded to every suggestion his fancy could make of a blissful going home and being forgiven . Louise , as health returned , became the hardened woman one dreads to meet . Every softer feeling seemed dead forever , and only the harm she did lived on . Ruth , in the busy round of gayety at the nation 's capital , watched for Dick in her heart , and for all naval officers with her eyes , while papa believed she was forgetting the past in the brilliant triumphs of the present . There were night-watches at sea , when the old tars , if they had cared to listen , might have heard a song which sometimes ran this way : " And thus forever , throughout this wide world , Is love a sorrow proving ; There are still many sorrowful things in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
