" The investors in these bonds are denounced as an E ' untaxed aristocracy , " " eoupon-elippent , " : " . nests of . thieves , " endeavoring to bring - " wide-spread misery , disaster , and ruin " upon the people . And all this is said under : Mi . Tzwaitax 's very nose , and not one word of objection or remonstrance do we hear from him . These " coupon-clippers " are , says Mr. CART , plunderers of the people . And , as we have seen , Gov . Awn ' expresses the same view , although a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have paid the full value ofthe bonds which they hold  --  paid for them above their par value in gold  --  is a statement which these Democratic leaders carefully . conceal from their followers . Gold , for instance , yesterday was at 112S , while the " New Fives , " the buyers of which Mr. CARY attacks as " thieves " brought 115% . Thus , then , the buyers of these bonds not only pay the price of gold for them , but 2 ; . /i per cent . above that price , and that , is about the general rate .. Now , why is a man who has paid say $1,130 ? to take a round sum  --  for a bond worth $1,000 in gold to be stigmatized as a thief ? In what . way has he committed a fraud ? He has invested his earnings or his savings in that pin-denier security , because its safety is guaranteed by the United States . It Is just as honest an investment as if he put the money in a farm , or in land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Senator THURMAN tell 118 The . Government says , " here is a bond upon which we agree to pay five per cent . interest . If you buy it we pledge you our faith that you shall receive the interest . " It can not be bought except at a premium . And yet the man who buys it is a thief . So says Mr. CARY , so echoes Mr. ALLEN , and Senator THURMAN hears them do it , and . never opens his mouth . And : now see in what a position this places the whole country . At this very moment the United ' States , through their Government and its agents , are making atropin:ma efforts to sell these very bonds , not only in the United States , but all over Europe . Everything has been done to induce people everywhere to place the utmost confidence . in them . They form a security which ' fathers and mothers are tempted to buy and lay aside for their children . As we have shown , they can only be bought at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while the Government is endeavoring to sell them , for the sake of causing a great saving in the interest on our debt , the Democrats of the vast State ot . Ohio are exciting popular clamor against all who buy them as " coupon-clippers " : and " thieves . " They argue as if these bonds were given away to a " moneyed aristocracy . " If the people generally took up this crY , what could be said or thought of us except that we were a nation of swindlers i For here we should be , selling a security to-day under the most solemn obligations of good faith , which we had deliberately made up our minds to repudiate to-morrow . Pray , who would be the thief in such a case as that  --  the buyer or the seller ? A more infamous course than that which is being pursued by the two chief candidates'on the Democratic ticket in Ohio is not . recorded in political history . It is worthy only of footpads . The canvass in Ohio ' is no longer one between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and honest men . If the Democrats . triumph in that State , we may safely bid farewell to the national credit and good name for years to come . " COUPON-CLIPPERS . " We should be very glad . to see good grounds for the conviction that a policy of repudiation would never be seriously proposed by any great party in this country . Yet what are we to make of the attitude taken by the Democratic Party , especially in the West ? Only last year , Gov . HENDRICKS presided over a convention in Indiana at which a resolution recommending a distinct form of repudiation was inserted in the platform . This year , Senator THURMAN has been present at a convention of Democrats in Columbus , Ohio , at which a wild policy of inflation was recommended , and he is to-day taking part in the canvass side by side with speakers who advocate repudiation in its most unequivocal form . Now there are no two stronger men in the Democratic Party to-day than Mr. HEzirducxe and Mr. THURMAN . They are among its very foremost leaders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the party . If they are unable to induce their followers , even in their own States , to follow the path of common honesty , what can we expect from men whose responsibilities to the country are far less serious 1 How can we assure capitalists and investors , at home and abroad , that their money is safe here when we find some of the ablest meu in the Democratic Party assisting avowed. repudiationists Inflation is one thing , and repudiation another ; and yet both have a great tendency to approach each other . The man who begins with inflation is very likely to go on to repudiation . Thus , Gov . ALLEN , of Ohio , practically preaches both doctrines in the same breath . If the currency is good for anything , he told the people of Ohio the other day , it is good enough to pay the bondholders with . " The- bondholders , " he added , " have a great advantage in holding this immense amount of property , and at the same time paying no taxes and getting their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , he declares that a majority of the members of Congress " are bankers . bond-holders , stock-jobbers , or persons vitally interested in making laws for their own benefit , so that the rich may become richer , and the poor poorer . " All this is , of course , intended to answer no other purpose than to increase the popular prejudice against bond-holders , as if they had dome dishonestly into ? ' possession of their bonds . . The insinuation is that the bOnd-holderi are a conclave of villains who contrived to plunder the country , and then met in secret one dark night and di. : vided the plunder among ? themselves .
