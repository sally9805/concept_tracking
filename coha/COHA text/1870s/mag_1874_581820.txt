RECOLLECTIONS OF CHARLES SUMNER . MR . SUMNER was a man of regular habits . He rose about seven o'clock and , without regarding weather , took his cold water bath in his hat-shaped tub ; then shaved with cold water , and got to work as soon as he had dressed . Until he commenced housekeeping he took his simple breakfast in his study , from a tray . No meats or fish found a place in this meal . Tea from his own caddy , toast , eggs , a little fruit , in its season , or a salad , constituted the repast . When in his own house , and liable to have others with him , the meal was more elaborate . The breakfast was served invariably at nine o'clock . He ate nothing more until dinner , which was usually at six o'clock . This abstinence from eating between meals , may possibly account for his excellei*t digestive powers , which remained unimpaired through life . After breakfast he returned to his desk , where he was occupied until he went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and on other days at twelve . He made it a point to be in his place when the Senate was called to order , and to stand during the chaplain 's prayer . Before the war , it was deemed indecorous for a Senator to absent himself from morning prayer ; and Mr. Sumner was never obnoxious to criticism in this matter . The session having commenced , he re-. mained in the Chamber until adjournment . No court business , no visiting friends , no // engagements of any kind could draw him from the Senate while the session lasted . Up to the time he received his injuries , an inspection of the " Globe " will indicate few absences on his part when the " yeas and nays " were called . The Senate having adjourned , Mr. Sumner would , if it were early , return to his desk ; but if it were near the dinner hour , would walk for a short time-that is , if his long , quick stride could be called a walk . As his mantel was generally shingled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dined alone ; but when he did , it was at a neighboring restaurant , from a single dish . After dinner , he might make a call or two ; but , as a rule , nine o'clock found him again in his room and at his desk . Now came the time for solid work . Reading he thought recreation rather than labor . During those late hours , when his brain was at its best , when he had rested from the fatigues of the day , and had gotten his second wind , as the athletes say , he wrought at those ideas which fill his works . His power of labor knew little of limit . XVhen preparing for a great effort , he would seldom leave his desk before two in the morning . He has been known to write the long night through , to be surprised by daylight at his desk , and to resume work again immediately after his bath and his breakfast . He has said that when he could change his clothing completely , retaining no article that he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he felt sufficiently refreshed to_the go on with his labors , even though he had sat all night at his desk . He thought faster than he could write . He always had some special work on hand , in addition to the current business of the day ; but he was always ahead of his public duties . No committee waited for him to finish a report or draft a bill , or draw a resolution . He was rather in advance of time . He constantly anticipated actual necessities ; but it was this very power to meet emergencies , this forecasting the nature of requirements , that kept him so unflaggingly busy ; and hence he was always ready . This habit of work followed him through lifewhile in the doctors ' hands , while suffering from great physical exhaustion , and even when feeling nothing of the spur of immediate requirements . In his latter days , when sitting with no committee , and prohibited by his physicians from speaking , he still kept up his habit of midnight toil . In speaking of the limitations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he would confess , that the most irksome was that which required him to retire by midnight . The Senator seldom denied himself to visitors . He was the most accessible of men . No matter how busy , unless he was working against time , he would receive those who sought to see him ; but when actually working he would leave the conversation to the caller , greeting him with " How are you ? Sit down ; " and , unless spoken to , he was liable to forget the presence of his visitor . Unless the conversation called for earnest thought , he was apt , especially when writing letters , to continue his work while listening or speaking . Often the embarrassed visitor would say : " I see you 're busy ; I 'll call again , " when the Senator would reply , " But I 'm always busywhat is your point ? " and the visitor , under this pressure , would condense his statement into a five minutes ' explanation , when he had expected to talk perhaps for hours . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but , unless in a quiet mood , was little inclined to conventional conversation with casual visitors . He would seldom refuse to answer a card sent him in the Senate , but he would rush out upon his visitor , making him feel the value of each minute , arid taking him into the lobby would , by force of will , compel him to condense his ideas into few words . His power of condensation was great , not only as to his own thoughts , but as to those of others . He would listen , with pen suspended , to a query , make his reply , return to his paper , and complete his unfinished sentence without glancing at its beginning . As to losing the thread of his discourse , whether in conversation , in writing , or in debate , this seemed to be impossible to him . His correspondence was enormous ; but the word fails to give any adequate idea of the letters he wrote and received . It was the business of his secretary to open his letters and arrange them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , as he often did , at his breakfast or dinner table . Few men have been such slaves to their mail . He would often receive over a hundred letters at a time , and each was read at the moment of opening . His ability to take in a mass of manuscript was peculiar . A four , even an eight-page letter , was read with such rapidity that an // observer would suppose he had but glanced at it ; and yet he would indicate on the corner , in pencil , if it were one of routine matter , the disposition his secretary should make of it . But he reserved to himself scores of letters , and wrote with his own hand , with almost lightning speed , answers short or long , as necessity required . Of these letters he never retained copies . They were enveloped , addressed , franked , and then thrown into the mailing basket , all by himself , as fast as they were completed , and the answered letters were pigeon-holed or destroyed , according to their importance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred was saved ; and yet one hundred and twenty-four volumes of Shipman 's Patent Letter Files , containing from 250 to 500 letters each , were packed and sent to Boston to his literary executors after his death . These letters probably represented the correspondence of a couple of years . The letter books prior to that time were already in Boston . There were , however , among these , the books containing all the letters from certain personal friends , such as Howe , Longfellow , Motley , Whittier , Felton , and his blood relations . His biographer will find material for his life in these letters , and those he wrote in answer to them . In fact , they contain his biography . Of late years the Senator had a movable book-case behind his desk , where he had at hand the books needed for immediate reference . They were usually his dictionaries ,  --  English , German and Classical ,  --  and the Statutes at Large . On the shelves of his writing-desk , immediately before him , were a line of pigeon-holes labeled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal friends ,  --  " Foreign Letters , " " Business Letters , " " Applications for Office , " and two labeled " Drafts . " Of late years that labeled " Applications** was usually empty . On the single shelf above these pigeon-holes were stacks of pamphlets , House and Senate Bills , and similar matters . Six books , however , were on this shelf within reach of his left hand , usually arranged in order of size . First , was Hazlitt 's " New Elegant Extracts from English Poetry . " This he had at college , as his name and the date on the fly-leaf gave evidence . The book had been twice rebound while he was in the Senate . Then came his Shakespeare-also a college book , as the tide-page and notations show . This , by the way , was found opened , face down7 on his desk on the day of his death . Curious to see what had interested him at this point , I scanned the page . It was the passage from Henry VI. , and a part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pencil with a heavy hand. * Next it on the shelf usually stood his copy of Hickey 's " Constitution of the United States . ' 7 This book would fall open at certain pages . It , too , was heavily marked in pencil . Words were underscored in single , double and triple lines . Marginal letters and figures referred to the collocation of the words , and the book was much strained in its binding from the many marks which had beea placed between the leaves . Then came Roget 's . " Thesaurus of English Words , " and it also bore marks of frequent refer .. ence . The fifth book was " The Rules and Usages of the Senate . " Its condition ac* counts for the Senator 's thorough knowledge and skillful use of this arsenal of Parliamentary weapons . No man knew these rules better than he , for he was forced to study and employ them with the utmost skill in the old days , in order to obtain even a hearing before the Senate . His French dictionaries were generally lying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was curious in dictionaries . He had five of the English language among his tools . His Webster and his Worcester were presentation copies from the authors . Walker , Pickering and Johnson were often brought down from the Congressional Library . It was no unusual thing for the Senator , when in full tide of work , to call to his secretary to look up a word in Worcester and to read the secondary meanings and quotations . Then to refer to Webster , then to Walker , then to Johnson , then to Pickering , and finally the word was used or thrown out , according to the weight of authority . It was hardly safe for him to examine a dictionary for himself ; for if he once got started , especially in Johnson 's , he would read on by the page . There was found by his bedside , with his watch , his glasses , and his mother 's Bible , his pocket edition of Webster , the latest issue , which he was accustomed to carry with * To whom God will , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Would I were dead ! if God 's good will were s* For what is in this world but grief and woe ? O God ! methinks it were a happy life . To be no better than a homely swain . King Henry Vi . Part III. , Act a , Scone V. // him as one might carry a pocket diary . Its cover shows the hard usage it had sustained . The remaining book , and the one nearest his hand , was another Bible . The copy which he brought with him to Washington was given him by his mother ; but it was transferred from his desk to his dressing-table when its place was supplied , in 1865 , by the copy given him by Miss Fannie Seward shortly before her death . From it Dr. Sunderland , the Chaplain of the Senate , read when conducting religious exercises at his house on the day the Senator died . This copy , as well as the other , shows wear . The Senator had large knowledge of the Scriptures , as his speeches show . While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of reference , he had none , and apparently needed none , of the Bible . He could find in it a desired passage with a quickness surprising even to clergymen . His book , the non-completion of which he so mourned on his death-bed , was the edition of his speeches , letters , etc. , now in course of publication . The eighth volume was on his table ; the ninth has since been published . Material for the twelfth was found in his desk , which brought the work down to i866 . Provision was made in his will for the expense of finishing the work ; and the material , which he had carefully gathered , was so arranged that , though the form may be crude , his literary executors can finish the work on his own plan . Their labor will consist in editing the immense mass they will find ready to their hands . He gave much patient labor to this matter . All his public letters , in fact everything necessary to the work , he had carefully collated in chronological order . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even his classical allusions were traced to their source , credited , and , in many cases , quoted in foot notes . Reference has been made by the daily papers to the employment of the learned Mr. Nichols , of Cambridge , to assist in this labor , but even his severely critical work underwent the additional scrutiny of the Senator 's austere taste . He would correct the corrections , and revise the revisions as long as time would permit . In one of his great speeches , that on " The War System of the Commonwealth of Nations , " Mr. Sumner alludes to the strange ceremony of drinking their blood in wine , by which the old chevaliers became bound as knights-companions ; and though sure such a rite had been practiced , he was rather discomfited to find no reference to it in any book in his library . He was so anxious to have his text correct , even in such minutiae , that this failure at verification disquieted him ; and he vainly sought information from several of his intimates , better versed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the height of his trouble one of his friends , Mr. William D. O'Connor , in whose conversation he took great pleasure , came in , and it was delightful to see the boyish eagerness with which Mr. Sumner welcomed the new-coiner . With one hand he clutched his proof-sheets , and gave the other to his caller , while he exclaimed , " Now we shall see-I 'm so glad you 've come ; " and , to the exclusion of the four or five persons present , and sitting so close that the dark hair of the poet almost mingled with the Senator 's grey locks , the two plunged into an animated discussion on several points in the proofs . Finally , with an air of nat ) ' anxiety , the Senator broached the point of the blood drinking . His satisfaction was quite evident when O'Connor said he was right in his recollection , and that full account of the custom would probably be found in St. Palaye , or the an .. notations of Nodier , or in Menestrier , or , perhaps , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Senator took in these suggestions was delicious to see ; and he at once declared he should ransack the Congressional library the next day . Meantime , O'Connor , on going home , bethought himself that the reference would most likely be in Du Cange , where , in fact , he found it . The next morning , armed with the book , he laughingly came into the breakfastroom , where the Senator sat at table , chatting with the Marquis de Chambrun and several other friends , and " here 's your blood-drinker ! " he joyously exclaimed , brandishing the old volume . Mr. Sumner started up with a great " ha ! " seized the book , and , forgetting his guests , and their demands on him , or rather taking them with him in his triumph , read out in sonorous tones , in his rich rhetorical manner , the sounding old French of Du Cange . It is impossible to over-state his intense and boy-like gratification at finding himself right , when he had begun to fear that he had been wrong . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it is given as a specimen of the untiring manncr // in which he hunted down his authorities . * In this edition of his works he weighed his words well , and frequently changed them , but the ideas are preserved intact . He always sought laboriously for words to express the exact shade of his meaning . His study had been carried so far that the expression used conveyed to others one shade of meaning , while to himself it had another ; hence offence was sometimes taken when none was meant . In his speeches , thus edited , he has here and there translated the language at first used into words which convey the meaning he intended . Sheets were found among his papers , covered with several trial phrasings of the same thought ; and the one finally adopted differed decidedly from the rest in its crispness and nervous strength . But no reply made to him will lose aught of its force , because of verbal changes in his collected speeches . Mr. Sumner 's nature was inexpressibly sweet , gentle , genial and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loved him . His personal wants were few , and were , as far as possible , supplied by himself . His servants felt their work to be a labor of love , and they were so seldom called upon , and , as one of them expressed it , were so sweetly thanked , that they were on the alert to supply his wants , and often used artifice to accomplish what they felt was necessary to his comfort . They were sometimes hurt especially during his feebleness , that he would suffer alone and unattended when they were within call . * Warriors like Du Gueselin , rejoiced to hail each other as brothers . Chivalry delighted in fraternities of arms sealed by vow and solemnity . According to curious and savage custom , valiant knights were bled together , that their blood as it spurted forth , might intermingle , and thus constitute them of one blood , which was drunk by each . So did the powerful Emperor of Constantinople confirm an alliance of friendship with a neighbor king . The two monarchs drank of each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ princely example , caught their own flowing life in a wine-cup , and quaffed a mutual pledge , saying , " We are brothers of one blood .

The same attempt at Brotherhood appears in the " Loka-Lenna , or Strife of Loc , " quoted by Sir walter Scott in his . Notes to the Metrical Romance of " Sir Triatrem , " p. 350 . " Father of Slaughter , Odin , say , Remember'st not the former a when in the ruddy goblet stood , For mutual drink , our blended blood ? " He would sometimes , in warm weather , sit a little at twilight in the beautiful square ,  --  a gem of a park ,  --  opposite his house . Here many little folk would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a curly head between his knees , or a small hand playing with his fingers . He did not play with them , nor did he seem really sensible of their presence , but he would pat their heads and toy with their curls in an absent kind of way , as one after another would , without his summons , steal up to his seat , and look up into his eyes . So , too , was lt among the families he visited . He seldom lifted a child to his lap , but if there was one in the room , it was apt to be found near his chair . One of his secretaries , who had returned to the city after a long absence , came by appointment to see him , bringing with him his wife and a little girl of two years . The Senator showed them through his house , among the paintings , books and autographs for hours . The child , a patient little thing , toddled about with them , but at last began to show signs of uneasiness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her cuddled up against him . " Is n't this child hungry ? " said he , and then he rang for a servant ; and when the tup of milk he ordered was brought , he gave it to the child himself , but in the most matter-of-fact manner , without at all interrupting the conversation . After this she remained with him till they all left . It was curious to notice the ways of dogs when near him . After circling round him they would lie down near his feet . Once , when sitting alone , reading , on the piazza of Prof. Longfellow 's cottage at Nahant , there were four dogs , each from neighboring places , posted around him . One shaggy water-dog had laid his head on the Senator s knet* . Yet he had been in the place less than twenty-four hours , had never called them or noticed them ; but somehow they seemed to know that he took pleasure in their presence . When in the country he always had a dog or two at his heels . He loved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think more of blooded cattle . He had many pictures of the latter and none of the former , except the Dray-horses , by Herring . Farmers have said they could learn more of him than he could of them about their own business , but particularly as to cattle . Mr. Sumner 's language in ordinary conversation was free from the blemishes which , // disfigure the talk of so many men . During twenty years ' acquaintance I never heard from him a single coarse or profane word . He used to say that " to swear was neither brave , polite nor wise . ' No heat of indignation , no great or petty vexation , could draw from him any word obnoxious to criticism . What many repressed , he simply lacked ; it was not in his nature . He c6nstantly respected and was tender of the feelings of others , when they did not conflict with his ideas of what was right . When conversation took such a turn that one present must be hurt , he was apt to so tone down an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to its maker a mild rebuke . One Sunday morning two young men met in his room . When the bells rang , one said he must take his leave , as he was going to church . The other sneeringly said : " Well , if you must go , pray for me . " The Senator , looking between rather than at either of them , repeated , in a reverential tone , Hamlet 's words to Ophelia : " Nymph , in thine orisons be all my sins remembered . " The one guest , conscious of the rebuke , apologized to the other5 who left the room with tears of gratitude in his eyes . It was in 1859 that I last saw Mr. Sumner at church . He had gone to the Unitarian Church to hear Rev. W. H. Channing . Coming in late , when the building was quite full , he had taken the first vacant seat , which , it happened , was in one of the pews reserved for colored people . There were already two blacks in it , and shortly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senator , conspicuous by his tall figure , in the middle of the pew , supported on either hand by two of the race for whom he was doing so much . The city papers cornmerited unpleasantly on this purely accidental grouping , as they did on most matters personal to Mr. Sumner . Mr. Sumner had an inveterate dislike to ostentatious secrecy . When any one whispered to him he was sure to speak in reply louder than he would had he been addressed in a conversational tone . Still , he was himself reticent on those matters on which he did not choose to speak . While he was opposed to the theory of secrecy in executive session , no Senator was more rigid , in fact , than he , as to keeping within the spirit of the rule . Always open to the visits of the members of the Press , they could learn nothing from him he was unwilling to tell , for , when *o minded , he would simply make no reply to their questions or remarks . As this was his rule , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar course toward those who asked questions on any subject he did not choose to discuss , put upon them the necessity of retreat and of a change of subject . But his manner was not that of rebuke ; he simply ignored the question to which he thought it improper to reply . He was as genial as before when the tabooed subject was dropped . Since the war he had availed himself largely of his privilege of paler sena/us , and more especially of his condition as an invalid , to avoid what was always unpleasant to him-paying visits of ceremony and returning formal calls . While he made his friends welcome at his own house , it was tacitly understood that their calls would not be returned . But he never dropped his habit of going to those of his friends who were sick or in prison , whether they were of high or low degree . Captain Drayton and his fellow-prisoners , the New Bedford slave rescuers , felt their confinement lightened by his frequent presence in their cell , and they owed their pardon to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood-hounds was brought about by his foresight and liberality . It was he who threw their hunters from their track , and who provided the private conveyance which took them to Baltimore . When Thaddeus Hyatt was thrown into the old Washington Jail for refusing to answer Jeff . Davis 's questions as to the John Brown raid , Mr. Sumner was his most frequent visitor , and it was on Mr. Sumner s motion that he was at length set at liberty . When Messrs . White and Ramsdell , of the New York " Tribune , " were imprisoned in the Capitol for refusing to answer certain questions relative to the publication of the Treaty of Washington , Mr. Sumner was an almost daily visitor to their apartments , and a jealous critic of the conduct of their jailors , as well as a frequent protester against their continued confinement . Each of his several sedretaries who have been ill while in Washington have been visited by him . Indeed , sickness on the part of any one near him , be he colleague , friend or servant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many a sufferer has been soothed by remembragces in the shape of flowers , fruit , wine or delicacies from his own table . He was as curious in teas as in wines ; and seemed to have as many and // as choice kinds . A little package of choice tea has often been sent with a kind message to the sick wife or daughter of a friend . 1-us own house was seldom without flowers that came from friends . Fruits in the season and various table delicacies found their way to him from those who had received like gifts at his hands . Little girls who , when ill , had received oranges or lears from him , sent in return baskets of berries of their own picking . Loaves of brown bread , quaint preserves , curious jellies , new-laid eggs , all manner of similar delicacies , would make their appearance at his table from those who had been obliged by him , and these little things , indicative of such personal kindness , always touched and pleased him , and he was never slow to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not hesitate to speak of measures and matters in which he had borne a leading part , but he had none of the offensive forms of egotism . He spoke of himself as of any other actor in the scene he described . Like ATheas , he could speak best of scenes he had himself witnessed , and in which he had borne a large part . He never spoke of what he had done , been , seen or said , except to answer direct questions or to illustrate some point in the best manner . He would no more violate the truth of history , by leaving out his own share in any transaction , than he would by making his own part too prominent ; he spoke of himself as of a third person . But he could not speak of public matters , or of the progress of ideas among us for the last quarter of a century , without speaking of himself , so large a part had he borne in our affairs . Senator Thurman well said , in the eulogy he pronounced on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , tried by the standard of modern manners , he was egotistical ; but tried by that standard with which his learning had made him so familiar , compared with Demosthenes or Cicero , he was a modest man . Mr. Greeley was not more opposed to " having something for nothing " than was Mr. Sumner . He was constantly desirous to make a return for whatever he received . If an author presented him with ais book ; if an engraver sent him a proof of his last picture , he made haste to acknowledge the courtesy by a letter which could be , and generally was , published . But no one could venture even upon his friendship to present to the Senator any VOL . VIII. - 31 article of value , as he would decline to receive it unless he were permitted to return its money value . This peculiarity was noticeable in the most trifling matters . Did he chance to share a carriage with another , he would insist on sharing the expense . Did a friend pay the fare of both in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may have been so far educated in the European custom in such matters that it had become a habit with him . It was evident that he did not know he was singular in this , as he spoke of it as odd that others should make it difficult for him to do as he desired . In one case , when he had gone some distance to speak in a doubtful district , by invitation of a Member whose re-election was pending , and was entertained at the Member 's house , he persisted in paying his part of the expense of the carriage to the depot ; and when his friend refused to receive from him the amount paid for the railroad ticket he procured for the Senator in advance , Mr. Sumner returned him the price of it by post the next day . Mr. Sumner so ordered his affairs that he always lived within his means , no matter how small those means were . Without having any rigidly arranged plan , without , apparently , giving the matter particular attention , he made income and outgo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dollar he had not the means to pay . In his latter days , when walking was painful , and locomotion was still a necessity , he did not keep a carriage simply because he could not afford it , or , rather , he could not afford it unless he denied himself the books and pictures of which he thought he had a greater need . But when he looked forward to returns from some of his investments , he wavered between the picture-gallery he wanted and the carriage he needed . He once had on his desk a tabular statement , compiled by himself , of noteworthy men who , having done much brain work , died between their 65th and 66th years ; and he seemed to lay out his work as if he expected to live to a similar age . But his affairs were kept arranged as if he supposed he might go on any day . He spoke of such a contingency without emotion , and as he might speak of a journey . But when such references would occasion emotion in others , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did to General Wilson , that were // his book finished , and the Civil Rights Bill become law , he would welcome death more gladly than any other visitor . He used to say that he omitted the prayer against *udden death from his readings of the Litany . His physicians , who were constantly protesting against any such effort on his part as a public speech , could not prevail with him by saying that death would follow such exertion . But when they threatened him with paralysis , or with loss of mind , he was more amenable to reason . After acute attacks of pain , symptoms of the anginc* pctoris , he would , for a while , keep perfect faith with his medical advisers . But , as strength came back , he would again become unmindful of their directions . This pain he described as a cold hand feeling about , and then compressing his heart . Sometime , " he said , " that hand will close , and that will end my life . " Little can be said of the Brooks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it which may be touched . The assault occurred May 22d , 1856 , the second day after the speech on " The Crime Against Kansas . " On the day before , Brooks , of South Carolina ; Keitt , also of South Carolina ; and Edmundson , of Virginia , came into Gautier 's about six in the evening , and , after carefully scanning the faces of the people at the table , walked out without having seated themselves . Gautier 's was then the Delmonico 's of Washington . It was at this restaurant that Mr. Sumner frequently dined . These persons had evidently looked for him there , and , failing to find him , and being tired of waiting , it chanced that their act took on , as it were , a more historic character , by being committed in the Senate Chamber . The Senator was busily engaged writing when Brooks stole in upon him . He was sitting at his desk in the Senate , which was held down jby angle-irons screwed to its legs and secured to the floor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the desk that his legs were confined under it . Brooks approached from the front ; but , as the Senator had his face very near his desk , being rather near-sighted , his assailant was almost as much protected from view as if he had approached from behind . According to the Senator 's sworn testimony before the House Investigating Committee , Brooks spoke and struck so nearly at the same moment , that the Senator lost consciousness before he heard the end of his sentence . The blow was given with a gutta-percha cane about an inch in diameter . It broke in three pieces ; but enough of it remained to form a bludgeon like a policeman 's club . During the Mexican War Brooks had served with the dragoons , and the scar on the Senator 's head , V-shaped , with the apex toward the spine , shows that Brooks struck with his cane as he would have struck with his saber . The first blows deprived the Senator of consciousness , but not of power . He instinctively sprang at Brooks , fettered as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the screws of one leg of the desk were wrenched from the floor , those of two others were broken off , while the clamp on the left front leg brought out a short piece of the yellow pine flooring with it . The horrible wrench of the muscles of the loins , which accompanied this tremendous feat , must have told on his frame throughout his future life . But the great strength used and the plunge forward , shows what would have happened , could he have reached his assailant . While the unconscious body was hanging across the uprooted desk , and while the legs were held down by the overturned chair ; while Sumner was thus in a position of helplessness , Brooks , as if infuriated by the sight of blood , continued to mangle the victim he had apparently killed , until he was forcibly drawn away by his own friends . Finally the limp , unconscious body was placed on a sofa and taken to an anteroom , when the nearest physician , who had been hastily called , did what seemed at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his lodgings , at the house of the Rev. Dr. G. W. Samson , on 6th , near E. street . He had lost much blood ; his clothes were drenched with it , and he presented a ghastly spectacle . When I came to him , about an hour after , consciousness had returned . He was lying on his bed and the physician was still with him . He was now able to converse ; but he was quite reticent on the subject of the assault . He seemed calm and unexcited . His only expression referring to the matter , which I can now recall , was a reply to a sort of an " I-told-you-so " remarkwhen he said , " I could not believe that a thing like this was possible . " I have often heard him speak of the matter , but this is the strongest phrase I ever heard // him utter . He never denounced or spoke ill of his assailant ; he never characterized the assault . He often spoke of his injuries , or referred to the period when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a railroad accident ; if the assault had been made by a mad bull in the street ; if he had been knocked down and run over by a runaway team , he could not have spoken of the direct cause of his hurts with less feeling . He betrayed no resentment toward Brooks by word , written or spoken . When friends , by whom he was immediately surrounded , threatened vengeance , he said nothing , or else gave them so unequivocally to understand that he would have none of it , that such talk ceased in his presence . He would take no part in the legal proceedings instituted against the conspirators . When subp*-naed to attend the Court before which they were tried , he replied from Silver Spring , Francis P. Blair 's country-seat in Maryland , that he was not only unable to respond , because of his physical condition , but that he declined to take any part in the prosecution not legally required of him . It was not that he did not comprehend the extent of the injury done him . Far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burden . Previous to the assault , he had scarcely known a day of illness ; after it he scarcely knew a day of health . It was not that he was of a peculiarly forgiving temperament . It was rather from the sublime austerity of his nature . It was Slavery that had done this . Brooks and his confederates were but tools in the hands of Slavery . For them he had no more feeling than for the weapons they carried . But for Slavery , their inspiration and their moving power , he felt a hatred so intense that it left no room for any petty resentments . They were lost sight of in the grander feeling with which he was possessed . And here it may be well , as far as possible , to dispose of some of the ridiculous stories still current . It has been said that the coat , stiff with blood , worn by the Senator when assaulted , was preserved . One touching statement details the awestruck appearance of Old John Brown , of Harper 's Ferry , when the coat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rounds of certain papers , stating that the bloody shirt was once on exhibition at Exeter Hall , and that it is still preserved by the English *Abolitionists as a holy relic . It has been also asserted that the desk and chair the Senator occupied when assaulted were kept in his study . No person could be more averse to the preservation of such souvenirs than Mr. Sumner . The facts are that the coat went within the week to the cleaner , and the shirt to the washerwoman , and both into immediat* use . The desk is still in the Senate Chamber , and is now occupied by Senator Ferry of Connecticut . The chair is used by another senator . They have never been taken from the Capitol . On June 14 , i86o , Mr. Sumner spoke in the Senate , for the first time , after the injuries inflicted by Brooks . His speech on " The Barbarism of Slavery , " described by John Bigelow as " the best arranged , and by far the most complete exposure of the horrid rite of slavery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " produced a tremendous effect . It was known for some time previous that the speech was to be delivered ; and it was charged that in it the Senator would show his scars , and dilate upon his sufferings . But his enemies were disappointed , for he did not make in it any allusion , not even the most distant , to any matter that could be considered as personal to himself . The Southern Congressmen had , however , determined that whatever was said they would not again appeal to the bludgeon . Their policy was stated in the short rejoinder made by Senator Chestnut , of South Carolina , in which he said : " We are not inclined again to send forth the recipient of punishment howling through the world , yelling fresh cries of slander and malice . These are the reasons ** * * why we can take no notice of the matter . " Mr. Sumner , in replying , said : " I exposed to-day The Barbarism of Slavery ; ' what the Senator has said I may well print as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publicly given , that " no other notice would be taken , " could not be carried out . There were those who emulated the example , and panted for the plaudits received by Brooks , and who were not to be controlled by theii party leaders . On the fourth day after , while Mr. Sumner was sitting alone in his lodgings , on F. street , near the Treasury , a person was shown in who announced himself as a Southerner , and a slaveholder , and one of the class slandered in the recent speech ; and he demanded " an explanation , " or he would hold its author responsible . The Senator simply ordered // him out of the room . The man then became abusive , when the Senator quietly told him if he did not go at once he would be thrown out of the window . The intruder dropped his stilted tone , and , while retreating , threatened . vengeance . Among other things , he said he was one of four who had come from Virginia for the express purpose of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposed to do it at all costs . This person had been gone but a few moments when I came in ; and it was not until I had spent some moments at my desk , that the Senator , in a calm and almost indifferent manner , told me what had occurred , and suggested that I had better tell General XVilson , and ask him to step in if he were passing that way in the course of the evening . Naturally much moved , I started at once ; when it occurred to me to offer the Senator my revolver . Mr. Sumner looked at it curiously , and asked how it was worked . When it was explained , he declined to accept the pistol , and when urged , on the ground that his visitor might return with others to back him , replied that he thought he could do better with the poker than with the revolver , for he was used to the one , and strange to the other . General Wilson was easily found , and he quickly joined his colleague . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other congressmen in the room of Hon. John Sherman . On being told why he was wanted , he at once informed the others , and they all but one went directly to Mr. Sumner 's rooms . From that one spread the news that the Senator was again in danger , and , in consequence , there was a constant succession of calls and proffers of service , only ceasing when the house was closed for the night . While General Wilson was with Mr. Sumner , and before the arrival of the others , a person came to the door , and asked particularly to see Mr. Sumner alone , but , when told who was with him , declined to enter . His manner was so singular that the door-girl was alarmed , and declined to answer the bell again that night . At about nine o'clock , and while several friends were in the rooms , three persons came to the door , and they also asked to see the Senator alone . On being told that others were with him , they sent this word by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends called to see him privately ; but , not finding him alone , they would call again in the morning for a private interview , and if they could not have it , they would cut his damned throat before the next night . " Mr. Sumner laughed at this as the vaporing of drunken men ; but his friends viewed it more seriously , especially when they found that three different parties had called on the same errand at three different times . Hence they remained . Mr. Sumner had returned to his desk , after going through his evening mail , and , though chatting at intervals , was occupied in writing , and from time to time urged his friends to leave him . He had no apprehensions . He felt there was no danger . But they knew the public mind better than he . They knew what was in the atmosphere , and felt that , while there might be no danger from Southern Congressmen , there was danger from those who had the brutality to follow Brooks 's example , without sufficient reason to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the South , in following it . So , in spite of the hints to go , they stayed . At last , the Senator excused himself , and , though it was much earlier than his accustomed hour , went to bed , leaving his friends in possession of his study . Then Mr. Burlingame took charge . It was arranged that four of us should remain in the house that night , and that the rest should reserve their strength for future needs . A mattress was placed in front of the bedroom door , and on this Mr. Burlingame and myself slept , while Mr. Dawes and Mr. Gooch each attempted to sleep on M/e-i-te*te sofas , too short for either of them . Mr. Sherman , now chairman of the Senate Committee on Finance , and Mr. Dawes , now chairman of the House Committee of Ways and Means , were then both members of the latter committee , and they utilized the time spent in the room in going over the details of some matters belonging to their committee as methodically as if in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a plan of defense in case of a concerted attack on the house , but with little success . At about ten o'clock Mr. Sumner had so far prevailed on his friends , that they had agreed to leave him , on condition that he would permit Augustus Wattles , a stalwart Kansas lover of freedom , who had fought with old John Brown at Ossowattamie , to remain in his apartments , and be responsible for his safety . The next thing was to find Wattles . He had attached himself to Thaddeus Hyatt , who had // done so much for Kansas , and who was then confined in Washington Jail , for refusing to tell the Senate Committee , of which Jefferson Davis was chairman , what he did n't know about John Brown 's raid on Harper 's Ferry . Our man was in lodgings near the Jail . Mr. Dawes undertook , with my aid , to find him , in what was , to us , an unknown part of the city . The adventures we met , in the dark and the mud , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principles , the negroes , who mistook us for slave-hunters , and the policemen , who could not be persuaded that we had any legitimate business in that part of the city , at that time of night , we remember to this day . But suffice it to say , though we could not find Wattles in person , we found his lodgings , and left a message which brought him to us in good time . There was no disturbance during the night , but our beds were not sufficiently inviting to make it pleasant to sleep late in the morning , so we were early at the windows , when our attention was attracted to several people on the other side of the street , who were walking up and down , apparently without concert of action , except in that they did not pass from the block . Their course was so unusual that we connected them with the mysterious callers of the previous evening , and began to consider what was to be the next step , when one of them was recognized as the very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When this was understood , the congressmen went home , feeling that they left the Senator in safe hands . But , before going , they told me that they would return whenever needed , that these new comers were at my orders , and that I should be held personally responsible for the Senator 's safety . The rest may be . better told in Mr. Sumner 's own words. * " The friends of Mr. Sumner did not feel entirely relieved . Among them was his private secretary , A. B. Johnson , Esq. , afterwards Chief Clerk of the Light House Board , who , untiring in friendship and fidelity , without consulting him , arranged * The Senator wrote this paragraph , not only to record a fact , hut to gratify one who took pride in his service . This has been brought to my knowledge , since his death , hy the friend to whom he read it when fresh from his pen . It may seem like egotism to quote such words from such a man , hut I can not refrain , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shows something of the warmth of his attachments , and the kindness of his heart . protection for the night , and a body-guard between his lodgings and the Senate . The latter service was generously assumed by citizens of Kansas , who , under the cap* taincy of Augustus Wattles , insisted upon testifying in this way their sense of his efforts for them . Apprised of Mr. Sumner s habit of walking to and from the Capitol , they watched his door , and as he came out , put themselves at covering distance behind , with revolvers in hand , and then ? unknown to him , followed to the door of the Senate . In the same way , they followed him home . This body-guard , especially in connection with the previous menace , illustrates the era of slavery. * ' * Mr. Sumner , who was never fully persuaded of the actual necessity of these efforts for his safety , was only prevented from putting an end to them , by being reminded that if he had listened to the warnings of his friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the assault of Brooks might have been prevented . As it was , when he found that friends were determined to follow him , he gave them no assistance . He ignored their existence , and if he had actually intended to escape their shadowing , could hardly have been more successful . There are many ways by which to leave the Capitol ; so he frequently eluded his guard , much to their discomfiture . On leaving the house for evening calls , he made no statement of his purpose , as was usually his habit ; so , to keep him in view , his guard had to be constantly on the alert . Though they were much annoyed , they were never angered . Notwithstanding Mr. Sumner* s wish to keep the matter from the papers , it soon became public . The then Mayor of Washington , Dr. Berret , came to the Senator 's house to inquire into the matter , and invited him to lodge formal complaint . The Senator declined , saying that he and his friends had no inducements from the past to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his efforts to get at the bottom of the matter . Finally he ascertained who it was that had personally insulted the Senator , and he brought the man , a well known Washington officeholder , from Virginia , to Mr. Sumner s rooms , where the culprit apologized for his conduct , charging it to the effects of drink , and denied all knowledge of the visitors // who , later in the evening , left the brutal message . This affair grew out of a dinner party given by a Department clerk , just fallen heir to a small estate , of which some slaves formed a part . The newly fledged slaveholder felt that his class had been insulted by the speech against " The Barbarism of Slavery , " and he was forced to attempt to carry out his vaporings about calling the maker of the speech to account , by his comrades , who were delighted at the prospect of a row of any kind . There is little doubt that those who came to the house after his call , were of the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they were very ready to make such amends for their conduct as were in their power . The foregoing , at this distance of time , seems a small matter to cause so much stir . But this speech had been long expected , and there had been many threats as to what would be done if it were offensive ; and these threats had been duly ( : onsidered by those who were determined that there should be at least free speech at the Capitol . The feeling was stronger at the North even than at Washington . The letters which came to the Senator , to his private secretary and to his colleagues , showed that bodies of armed men held themselves in readiness to come to Washington in his defense . They were only kept away by the knowledge that others were before them , and that a systematic plan for defense had been organized and was being carried out . Had the Senator prevented the operations of this plan , which positively pained him , he would possibly have precipitated the revolution which followed within the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a letter under date of June 9 , from his friend Hon. Edward L. Pierce , saying : " We have just heard of the threat of violence made to you last evening . Dr. Howe and others meditate leaving for Washington forthwith . " * * * Messrs . Thayer and Eldridge , book publishers , wrote at once from Boston : " If you need assistance in defending yourself against the ruffians of the slave power , please telegraph us a/once .. . . There is strong feeling here , and we can raise a small body of men who will join your Washington friends , or who will alone defend you . " In reply to an inquiry from home , Hon. James Buffinton , then and now of the House of Representatives , from Mass. wrote : " The Massachusetts delegation will stand by Mr. Sumner in his late speech . There will be no backing down by us . " See Sumner 's Works . Appendix to speech on " The Barbarism of Slaveiy . " Vol . V. , page 128 . The following account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter to the nearest relative of the deceased , written before the funeral obsequies had been performed . On Monday morning , March ioth , as I came down from my room , Mr. Sumner called from his bed , and after asking the time , remarked that he had experienced a slight return of his old trouble during the night , which had kept him from sleep until four in the morning . On Monday evening , about ten o'clock , he sent for the doctor , lest he should have another sleepless night . He told the physician , on his arrival , that he was suffering somewhat , and feared he should suffer more , unless he found relief in sleep . The usual remedy , a sub-cutaneous injection of bi-meconate of morphia , was administered , when he immediately became more quiet , and soon fell into a healthy sleep . He slept well during the night , and felt less of reaction than was usual , after this remedy . At breakfast he was more than usually genial . It was his custom to occupy himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning it failed to come for nearly an hour after its usual time . Of all the breakfasts we had together in the past years , I remember none so pleasant . Waiting for the mail , his conversation was naturally desultory . It touched on many topics ; he spoke of many persons , of various events , and always in a kindly , genial , pleasant tone . Indeed , such had been his manner since the Massachusetts Legislature had rescinded the resolutions of censure . That evening I was spending at the house of Dr. Taber Johnson , the Senator 's physician . About nine o'clock we were startled by the announcement that Mr. Sumner was ill . We at once went to him . The doctor found him lying on the bed , suffering , but as a man might suffer with a violent toothache . He was advised to go to bed , as it would be unwise to attempt , as he intended , further work that evening , and he reluctantly obeyed . The hyperdermic of the before mentioned preparation of morphia , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pain increased , and the remedy did not act as it usually did . In about twenty minutes the Senator asked for another dose ; and as the first had been but light , the doctor gave him a second . As the pain continued to increase , the doctor ordered a foot-bath of mustard and hot // water . This appeared to relieve him . He presently said , " There now , I have , closing the door , and awaited evidence that he was asleep . During this time he had often groaned , and he frequently spoke to himself rather than to us . We could understand but little he said , but we plainly distinguished the words " My book ! my book ! If it were not for my unfinished book , I should not regret this ; " referring to the volumes of his works , for the twelfth of which he had been preparing matter that very day . These words , " My book ! my book ! " were frequently repeated while he was writhing in the most acute pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But the great account is closed ; " and then he never mentioned his book again . Before the narcotic began to act , he only used disjointed sentences ; after it began to dull the pain , he spoke in a more connected manner . But the Doctor discouraged all conversation , as it was not good for him . While sitting in the study we waited anxiously , but not more so than on many previous occasions , and finally his regular , full breathing gave assurance that he slept . But it so happened that the Doctor and myself remained chatting longer than customary . Some twenty-five minutes had elapsed when , just as the Doctor was about leaving , a groan came from the sick room . The Senator had awakened . On speaking to him it was found that the pain had returned . The Doctor now gave him another hyperdermic , and his limbs were chafed to assist his circulation . Presently he became more quiet , and sink into the stupor produced by the narcotic . This quick recurrence of the attack gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat by the bedside holding the pulse of the Senator , at twenty minutes past ten announced that the usual reaction had not taken place , and that his patient was in serious danger . The pulse was so faint that it could scarcely be felt . He sent at once for the most powerful restorative , and called another physician into consultation . Mr. Hooper and Mr. Pierce , of the Massachusetts delegation , and two other friends were sent for . The consulting physician fully approved of the treatment , and could suggest no change or addition . Meantime bottles of hot water had been placed at the extremities , and under the arms . His limbs , which were becoming cold , were separately wrapped in flannel . Mustard plasters were applied to the chest and abdomen . Others were tied to the wrists . The breathing had become more regular . To all appearance the patient was easier . The only indication of his alarming condition was the weakness of the pulse , and the clammy coldness of the extremides . At half-past one o'clock the consulting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends who had been called in . All of us , possibly excepting the doctors , hoped for recuperation with the morning . Stimulants were administered at short intervals during the night . At five o'clock A.M. on the * as no change had taken place , a long telegram was sent by the attending physician to Dr. Brown-Sequard , at New York , in which the condition of the patient was minutely described . He was requested to come on by the first train , and also to prescribe by telegraph . The physician in charge now called another consultation . At eight o'clock , AM. , Dr. Barnes , SurgeonGeneral of the United States Army , and Dr. Lincoln joined him at the bedside . After a careful examination , and a short consultation , the three concurred in the opinion that the patient was in a hopeless condition , and that no change in the treatment was advisable . But while life lasted hope remained , and every proper effort was made . Nourishment was administered in various forms ; iced champagne was given when thirst was indicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the mustard plasters were renewed , as there was no indication that the first had taken effect , and these simple efforts to assist nature were continued to the end . The news of the Senator 's condition had spread throughout the city , and many of his friends hastened to his house . In order that I might give my whole attention to the sick-room , I placed his long time friend , Major Ben . Perley Poore , in charge of the first floor , and his colleague , Hon. Henry L. Pierce , of Boston , in charge of the second floor , that no one might be allowed to approach the sick room whom they could prevent . Major Poore summoned to his assistance two of the Capitol police ; but the concourse of friends ,  --  among them the most noted people of the land ,  --  was so great , that they filled the rooms and the passages . Governor Boutwell was unable to leave his sick bed , but the ladies of his // family came to the house offering services . Lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other ladies , several of whom offered to take charge of the sick room . It was , however , considered that the strong , loving and familiar hands then about the Senator , and the persons to whom he was accustomed , were sufficient , and so these kind offers were declined . At an early hour two colored men , Mr. Wormley , proprietor of the Hotel in this city , bearing his name , and Mr. Downing , the famous New York caterer , came to the sick-room , where they remained as nurses . They were both fully competent , and had proved their devotion in other days . The Senator , in recognizing them , expressed pleasure at their presence . They were of much service in lifting his great weight , and in aiding him in various ways . From time to time other friends , who would not be denied , made their way to the room . Senator Schurz was often by the bedside ; so was Judge Hoar and Mr. Hooper . Other friends came in at intervals , but as far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desired to keep the room quiet . Up to ten in the morning the stupor continued . After that the patient would , from time to time , recognize friends with a word or two of greeting . On one occasion , when we had changed his position , my arm had been caught under him as he was laid back on his pillow , and to make my position more tolerable I had kneeled by the bedside . With his eyes on mine he said : " Do n't let the bill be lost . " Supposing he referred to some household account , I replied in a way to quiet him , when , with a motion of his hand toward the other side of the bed , where Judge Hoar was standing , and whose voice he had just heard , he said to me , " You mistake ; " and , after a pause , he called , " Judge ! " Then he said : " Mv bill ! - do n't let it fail ! " The judge said ; " Certainly not ; " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain he had made himself understood : " The Civil Rights Bill-do n't let it fail ! " The judge assured him he would do his best for its passage . At another time , hearing the Judge 's voice , he called to him , " Judge , my billCivil Rights-save it ! " and again he was assured that all that was possible should be done to carry out his desire . About two hours before his end , when his sight and much of his strength had returned , and when Judge Hoar was sitting on a low chair by his bed , chafing one of his hands . the Judge said , " I am trying to warm it , " and the reply was , " You never will . " His eyes were now fixed on the Judge 's face with a look of painful and growing intensity , and he began to speak slowly , and with a certain effort , as if he were struggling with a known indistinctness , and in a voice full of the most piteous entreaty* he besought him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let it fail ! " His friend* s*cong man as he was , broke down com* pletely ; he sobbed like a child ; but he said through his sobs , in words like those of a solemn vow , and in tones that carried conviction to the soul already within the shadow of the dark valley : " IT SHALL NOT FAIL ! " and , as he spoke , he lifted the cold hand to his lips , and kissed it . The Senator was satisfied . He never mentioned the matter more . A peaceful look overspread his face , and he sank to sleep again . While the dying man was pleading for the Civil Rights Bill , Wormley and Downing were in the room , and Frederick Douglass , trembling with emotion , and supporting himself on a chair , was standing in the next room , but within the sound of his voice . The study was now crowded with senators and members , among whom was Speaker Blame . These utterances when repeated to them produced a sensation which words could not express . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew that the Senator was dying , and they felt that his words were to them as well as to him who was specially addressed . He spoke to Senator Schurz , for whom he felt much affection , many kind words at various times , but in short broken sentences . His sight had failed him , but he recognized his friend 's voice , saying , " I hear you , Schurz , but I can not see you . " He spoke many other words , which might have seemed of little moment , but for their manner . He manifested pleasure , also , when Mr. Hooper was present , and when he knew Mr. Pierce was near ; but he showed impatience at seeing other than familiar faces in the room . He frequently asked the time , and once said he must soon dress and go to the Senate . Once he expressed a fear that news of his illness would get into the papers . Toward one o'clock he regained much of his strength , and his sight , in a measure , came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in bed and move about easily , though an hour previous we had to lift him . But voluntary movements gave // him so much pain , he would ask to be lifted as before . He complained of great fatigue , but of no pain , except when he moved of his own strength . He was , he said , tired in every nerve and muscle , even in his bones . He wanted rest , and he begged for more morphine to allay his weariness . By this time the opinion became prevalent that reaction was taking place . Senator Schurz now went home to his wife with the good news ; other friends went to lunch , and I was left to care for the patient , with the two colored men . The Senator now became more restless , and frequently asked to have his head and shoulders raised . I found the easiest way to lift him was to pass my arm behind his shoulders , and , kneeling on the bed , exert my full strength . On laying him back , my arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while in this position , his head resting on my shoulder , he seemed to be conscious of my uncomfortable position , and , as he had at other times , deprecated the trouble he was giving ; but this time in these words " My poor Johnson You must be very tired ; but you can soon rest . " Soon after he said to Judge Hoar , who had come , and who now stood on the other side of the bed : " Tell Emerson I love and revere him . " Judge Hoar replied , repeating the Senator 's words , that he might be certain that he understood them : " I will tell Emerson you love and revere him ; for he told me that you had the whitest soul of any man he ever knew . " The Senator 's head , still on my shoulder , had turned toward me , and in response he said , so indistinctly that I repeated it for the Judge : " I always loved him . " In a moment after he changed his position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hooper appeared by the bedside . Some one said ( Wormley , I think ) : " Mr. Hooper has come to see you . " The Senator motioned toward a chair , and said , somewhat indistinctly , " Sit down . " Mr. Hooper did as he was asked , but quickly retired , as the Senator had now sunk to sleep again . These were the last words Mr. Sumner uttered . Let me here remark that I am firmly convinced that the Senator at no time knew he was dying . The words uttered meant no more , to me , than utterances during former attacks . His words concerning his cold hands meant , to me , no more than that they could not be warmed while the attack lasted . His message to Emerson was such as he might have sent from his dinner table . But I am principally convinced of this , from the fact that he said no word of his sister , to whom he was tenderly attached ; he sent no message to any friend , except Emerson ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me no word of farewell . I lay stress upon this last fact , because I had never , of late years , parted with him , even for a short journey , without a hearty " God bless you , " and an affectionate " Goodbye . " I feel assured that , had he known his condition , some word of this kind must have escaped him . Hence I think that no friend , no relative , however dear , has reason to feel slighted or forgotten . Each friend may believe this the reason hat the Senator sent no word of farexvell . Had I not been with him so much during the last twenty years ; did I not know so well the meaning of his words and his ways ; did *I not know much of his mental processes , I should not dare say this in view of the contrary opinion held by others who are themselves so competent to judge . When the doctors announced the hopeless condition of the patient , I asked that he might be informed . One of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thousand ; to excite him would be to destroy that chance ; " and they absolutely forbade the disclosure . I then asked permission to call in a clergyman ; it was due him and the people who sent him here that the voice of prayer should be heard in the house . It was decided , however , that to hold religious exercises of any kind at the bedside would be equivalent to telling the patient of his condition , and , therefore , could not be allowed . Finally it was decided that the chaplain of the Senate should be sent for , and that services could be held in another part of the house . The idea was carried out ; Rev. Dr. Sunderland came . After seeing the dying man he went to the library , where were gathered as many friends as could be crowded into the room , while in the hall and in the drawing-room others were assembled ; and there he read the xiv . chapter of John , and made a fervent and touching prayer . This was , under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was so far under the influence of narcotics that waking moments were infrequent and short . But , after all , no more was needed , except for the consolation of the sorrowing friends . He for whom they // mourned had long been ready ; he had longed to go hence and be at rest . At about half-past two o'clock , Dr. Lincoln , one of the consulting physicians , dropped in . The Senatoi was sleeping calmly , lying on his back , with his head and shoulders well raised . The Doctor , after watching him a few moments , came to me at the further side of the room , and was speaking of the hopeful symptoms lately exhibited , when the patient slightly stirred . The Doctor sprang to the left side of the bed , and I to the right . The Doctor placed his fingers on the pulse and I passed my arm under the Senator 's head to steady the pile of pillows supporting him . He . opened his eyes ; then came one strong convulsion ; the right hand closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had grasped it ; and then the Doctor , whose ear was at the heart , announced that all was over .
