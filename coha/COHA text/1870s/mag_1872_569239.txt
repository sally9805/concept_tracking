ARTICLE I.-* -- TilE ANTAGONISM OF RELIGION AND CULTURE . Culture and Religion in some of their Rektt ions . By J. C. SHAIRP , Principal of the United College of St. Salvator and St. Leonard , St. Andrews . New York : Hurd &amp; iloughton . THE attention of the reading public on both sides of the Atlantic has been recently called to the relations of culture to religion , by a book of rare merits characterized by comprehensive thought , rare beauty of style , and purity and elevation of devout feeling . We see not how any devout man can read this book without a feeling of deep sympathy with the spirit and aim of the author , or without accepting his statement of the fundamental relation of religion to culture . If religion is anything it is everything . If it has any authority at all it has authority over the entire man . It rightfully claims to propound to every man the highest aim of human life , and to furnish the highest motives to all human endeavor . If this is so , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without the influence of religion as he might have attained with it . The culture VOL XXXL 14 // of the man whose thinking and living are without religion must necessarily lack the very highest and noblest elements*to which it might have attained . We should be far enough indeed from asserting that all men who are under the proper influence of religion are of course men of high culture . Such an assertion would be contradictory , not only to experience , but to common sense . Culture implies the development of the social , esthetic , and intellectual , as well as of the moral nature ; and there are many persons whose lives and characters are in a high degree influenced by religious considerations , who are deprived of all time and opportunity for such cultivation . The hard necessity of incessant toil for the means of subsistence deprives them , for the most part , of social pleasures , of the enjoyment of the beautiful , and of all time and opportunity for the cultivation of the intellect And yet one of the strongest proofs of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence on men whose lives are spent under these hard conditions . A truly religious man who has always been shut out from the pleasures which are proper to his intellectual and esthetic nature often exhibits a gentleness , a sweetness , a tenderness , a benignity of character , not only not attained by his class without religion , but not even by those who have had free access to all the fountains of culture , religion alone excepted . We often find in the humblest walks of life , in the children of povcrty and toil , under the influence of religion , that ornament of a meek and quiet spirit which is closely akin to the highest culture , and which no improvement of the intellect and no combination of favorable influences , without religion , can ever impart . There have been men in every Christian generation nobly endowed with all the native gifts of mind and heart , " But knowledge to their eyes her ample page , Rich with the spoils of time , did neer unroll ; Chill penury repressed their noble rage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and yet , under the influence of religion , they became truly wise men , and those who had trodden all the paths of secular learning might well sit at their feet and receive the lessons of wisdom which dropped from their lips . The existence of such examples // is undeniable ; and they prove beyond controversy that religion has a powerful tendency toward the noblest culture of which man is capable . It can and often does produce , in the most unfriendly and forbidding circumstances , developments of character higher , nobler , and better than the best which the schools , without its aid , have ever produced . It can not , however , be denied that in this age , and in ages that have preceded the present , many of the most highly cultivated minds have rejected the religion of Christ with aversion and even disgust , and that at the present time there is much to impress one with the belief ; that high culture is antagonistic to religious faith . Certainly not a few narrow-minded religious men regard culture , especially scientific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not a few men of the highest intellectual refinement ( though it is a fair question whether after all they are not as narrow-minded as their religious antagonists ) believe themselves too wise to accept Jesus of Nazareth as the Christ of God . There are not a few religious men who fear , and not a few scientific men who hope , that the forces of science are too strong for the forces of faith , and that what is revered by devout men as the very ark of God is about to fall into the hands of the uncircumcised Philistines . It is , therefore , highly proper to inquire what are the causes of this unnatural antagonism , and by what means it may be terminated , and harmony restored between the intellectual and the moral world . One cause of the aversion of men of taste and culture to religion is the fact , that the religion which actually prevails is partial , inadequate , and therefore to a certain extent untrue . It may be asserted , without any fear of exaggeration , that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world will be , fully to comprehend the lessons which Jesus Christ taught , and fully to apply them to man 's individual life and his social relations . In every age , perhaps in every sect , there are those who discern some truths of the Christian religion . But to a great extent they are truths wrenched away from those relations to all truth which they sustained in the conception of the Great Teacher , and are therefore divested of their full and proper influence in the formation of character ; or they are cumbered // with misconceptions and falsehoods so gross , as to rob them of a part or *ll of their saving power . For example , the divine Author of Christianity taught the doctrine of self-denial , and illustrated it in forms of speech and action the most striking and impressive , and his teachings and life have made a powerful impression on his followers through every age for a period of more than eighteen centuries . And yet to what a fearful extent have men misunderstood and perverted the lesson ! The critic of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the life or teachings of the founder of Christianity . But age after age men have misunderstood him . The notion that God may be pleased by suffering self-inflicted , and endured without any providential necessity , has flowed down the stream of Christian history for ages , and imposed upon millions of believers in Christ a yoke grievous to be borne , and infinitely degraded the doctrine of self-sacrifice from that exalted position on which the divine Master placed it . Even as late as the seventeenth century , Blaise Pascal could vie with Torricelli , Galileo , and Newton in discovering the hidden laws of nature , but he could not disentangle the Christian law of self-sacrifice from the rubbish with which in his age it was overlaid ; and therefore wore an iron collar next his flesh as a means of religious discipline and edification . So long as the religion of Christ is thus distorted by wrenching aw*iy its greatest truth from its true position in the system , we have no occasion to wonder that thoughtful , cultivated men are tempted to regard it with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that so enlightened a man as Pascal-so gifted above ordinary mortals-did not understand that religion of which he was , with all his follies , so illustrious an ornament ? And who that had been emancipated from the then ruling spiritual despotism , and trained to free thought , could help regarding such a doctrine of self-sacrifice with aversion ? In like manner every distortion of the doctrines of religion must tend powerfully to array men of liberal culture and free thought against religion itself . Matthew Arnold has made the supposition that Virgil and Shakespeare had made the voyage to America with the Puritan Pilgrim Fathers , and suggested the question whether they // would not have found their company intolerable . There are other reasons why they would have found the company of these God-fearing men intolerable besides superiority in culture , which it is our purpose to suggest under a subsequent head . But the character of the Puritans was faulty in respect to the very matter of which we have just been speaking . Macaulay 's hard saying , that " the Puritan hated bear-baiting , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave pleasure to the spectators , " is neither in strictness true , nor worthy of the grave historian of the English Revolution . The Puritans of those times had a high and just abhorrence of that and many other demoralizing public amusements ; and the writer who has represented them as purely and simply malignant hypocrites has not only violated Christian charity , but degraded himself from the position of an impartial historian . And yet this sarying contains a half-truth . There was an element of asceticism in the Puritan charactei* They were too ready to suspect sinfulness in anything that afforded amusement and pleasure . They were too much disposed to make war on whatever ornamented the person , or gratified the taste . And if on this account the Pilgrim Fathers would not have been agreeable companions to such men as Virgil and Shakespeare , it was not because they were sincerely and grandly religious men , but because their religion was on one side partial , distorted , and inadequate . Principal Shairp asks whether Virgil and Shakespeare would have fared better in the company of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we see no reason to suppose the same repelling force existed in these ancient representatives of Christianity which certainly is found in English Puritanism . If the two poets mentioned could not have enjoyed Paul 's speech on Mars ' hill , that fact would certainly afford no proof of their high culture . There are few fields of thought more worthy of the best powers of the Christian thinker than the inquiry , how far and wherein the peculiar aspects and teachings , the creeds , the governments , the ceremonies , of the religion of the present age are repulsive to men of thought and cultivation on account of their failure adequately to represent the great conception of the Founder of our religion . So long as we persist in our present // arrangements for subjecting that kingdom which he expressly declared not to be of this world , to legislatures , judicat*ries , and executive authorities devised , constituted , and administered by men ; so long as we continue to cover over the face of nations and the world itself with rival governments , each exercising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claiming jurisdiction in the name of the one divine Ruler and Head over the same territory and the same individuals , and thus destroying the religious unity of Christendom , and filling it with confusion , conflict , and anarchy , we shall have little reason to wonder that men of cultivation are little attracted toward the Church , and feel little admiration for that which claims to be the kingdom of God among men . If the Founder of Christianity conceived of such a state of things as now exists in Christendom , and deliberately planned it as the normal condition of that " kingdom of heaven " which he came to establish , we could surely have little respect for his wisdom . If we are ever to bring to an end the long antagonism between religion and culture , it is high time for all devout men to set themselves in earnest to bring the Church , as it presents itself to the inspection of thoughtful men , into closer agreement with the original conception . To say that the present factious condition of the Christian Church is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jesus Christ founded anarchy and confusion without* end . But the cause of this antagonism is not found alone in the inadequacy and imperfection of our religious ideas and lives . It is equally found in the partial and imperfect character of our culture . Our religion has chiefly to do with the moral nature , and seeks to rectify our relations to the universe by setting us right with that God who made and governs it . Our culture has chiefly to do with our intellectual and esthetic nature ; and leaves the moral too often neglected and dwarfed , and therefore ill-prepared to appreciate those high truths which religion reveals , or to submit to those obligations which religion imposes . Principal Shairp says " Goethe , the high-priest of cUlture , loathes Luther , the preacher of righteousness . " Can any one familiar with Goethe as he appears in his autobiography , or even in Lewes ' Life of Goethe after an accomplished scholar // has done his best to vindicate this " high-priest of culture " against his own representations of himself fail to see why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much th1t*t the Reformer 's religion was at fault , as that the poet 's culture was one-sided and imperfect ? How could a man over whose heart and life moral and religious considerations exerted so little influence enjoy or even tolerate the intense religious ear nestuess of Luther ? That definition of culture , according to which Goethe is its highest and best specimen , is certainly a one-sided , inadequate , and therefore false definition . No man can duly consider what the great German poet and philosopher admits to be true , and what the partial advocate , who has so zealously labored to defend Goethe against Goethe , relates and confirms of his indifference to the moral relations and influence of his own life ; of his cruel and unprincipled treatment , in several instances , of the beautiful and lovely women who had been won by his personal attractions , and the fascination of his conversation and manners ; of his conduct in his domestic relations to the woman whom he ultimately married ; and of his cold and selfish indifference to the destiny of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one can duly consider the admitted and unquestionable facts of his life in these and a great many other particulars without being convinced that the highest and noblest part of his nature  --  the moral part-was not cultivated , but a neglected and barren waste . When such a man withholds his sympathy from religious men and religious truth , we refuse to admit that it is any proof that true culture , rounded and complete on all sides , has any natural antagonism with religion . This man hated earnest religion because he bore along with him , from youth to old age , a neglected and corrupted moral nature , and lived in the practice of loathsome and hateful vices . When we have said so much , we have said all which this case requires or permits to be said . What we have said of Goethe is true in greater or less measure of multitudes of otherwise cultivated men , who have manifested their aversion to religion . They have lived out of the universe where God governs , and where moral character is recognized as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is clustered , and on which immortal destiny hinges ; and in a little world of art and beauty and poetry and song . In that little world they have sought and thought they*found a heaven ,  --  a satisfying portion for a human soul , with little thought of moral obligation any farther than relates to the regulation of the social amenities of the little circle in which they live . Religion would intrude into this paradise of art , and pro . claim to its selfish inmates their relation to universal , toiling , sinning , suffering humanity . It would teach them the necessity of preparing by the cultivation and renovation of their moral natures for an immortal destiny under the moral government of God . It would teach such a man as David ilume , that he had something to care for besides the acquisition of literary fame , and to live for besides the enjoyment of his own " growing reputation , "  --  and not only him , but all others who have pursued culture in a like selfish spirit , though they have not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scenes of his life . The men of exclusive devotion to a literary and artistic culture do not like such an intruder into their earthly art-paradise . The reason why they do not , is not because she is not of beautiful and comely form and lovely spirit , not because her message is not true , but because she does utter truths which grandly and irresistibly rebuke the selfish and earthly life they lead . The men who lead such a life have given it out that they are the men of culture , and to no small extent this giving out has been accepted by the multitude , and their aversion to religion is the antagonism of culture and religion . Let us speak the truth ; it is only the aversion of a narrow and one-sided and selfish culture to a religion which is as comprehensive as humanity , and would teach us and teach them to emulate in our lives the self-sacrificing philanthropy of the man Christ Jesus . For such a life the " high priest of modern culture " had no taste , and therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He is imitated in this age by a host of followers who have small partnership with him in his genius . It seems to be commonly assumed that men of genius are perfectly acquainted with any subject of which they choose to speak ; especially that they are of course to be presumed to // have a perfect understanding of a subject so much upon men 's tongues , and so familiar to their ears from their very cradles as religion . And yet it is true of men of genius as of other men , that they must remain ignorant of every subject to which they have never given earnest attention , on which they have never candidly thought . For this reason it often happens that men of high intellectual cultivation live in enlightened religious communities in profound ignorance of religion . They are ignorant of it for the reason that they never make it an object of earnest thought and enquiry . They live in their art-world just as the devotee of wealth lives in his money-world , and give no earnest heed to anything which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gain give little thought or care to anything which can not be converted into money . To this latter class of men , learning , religion , social pleasures , all pass for little or nothing , unless they can be coined into cash . We have no difficulty in estimating such a man . He is narrow-minded . The absorbing love of money has belittled himshrivelled him to dimensions too small for the proper capacity of a human soul . Just so the culture which leads a man to treat religion with neglect and contempt , and produces a character on which moral considerations make little impression , and moral obligation sits loosely , is a narrow-minded culture : it shrivels the soul : it deprives a man of tine proper dimensions of his manhood . When we notice that Tacitus , surrounded by the disgusting superstitions which made up the hoary paganism of Rome , handed down to posterity the Christian religion branded as an " exitiosa s*perstdio , " we are astonished that a man so enlightened should fall into an error so egregious . But a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : he had never thought Christianity worthy of a serious examination . In instances well nigh innumerable , the sneers of men of genius and learning at religion have precisely the same import . They do not imply that these men have given the subject their earnest and candid attention , and after such an investigation have thrown the weight of their great intellects against it ; but that they have neglected to think of it , just as Tacitus did , and condemned it in utter ignorance of what they condemned . // The Christian religion has never suffered greater injustice in this world than from the great , and in other respects cultivated minds , that have rejected and contemned it without examination-rejected it just as the man of avaricious life rejects both religion and culture , because they belong not to his little universe of money-making . We seek in vain to reconcile such culture with religion . It is no more reconcilable than the supreme love of money , or insatiable ambition is reconcilable with it . Such culture is essentially false , narrow , selfish . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end to the antagonism is to substitute a true cub ture for a false one , a culture which comprehends the whole man for one which excludes and neglects his highest and noblest endowments . Thus far we have been traveling a plain path ; we must make our culture and our religion more perfect , and in proportion as we do so , we shall bring them into more harmonious relations with each other . But there is a third cause of antagonism between them more difficult to deal with . Especially is this true of culture attained by the pursuit of science . Religion and science have different aims , and pursue different methods . Religion seeks to find in nature a personal God : science interrogates nature in the pursuit of general laws , in uniform accordance with which the forces of nature act ; and her achievements in this direction have been truly wonderful . It will not be strange if at length she has become a little conceited and arrogant . She has succeeded in tracing laws of order and harmony in regions which , through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accident . She has risen from one generalization to another still more comprehensive , till at last she has become impatient of the necessity of a Creator , and proposes , by an extension of the domain of law , to dispense with the function of a lawgiver . It has come at length to be true that every cultivator of science meets some temptation to engage in this rebellion against the reign of a personal Creator . Religion and Science differ too in their methods . Science knows no method but observation and experience , and the use of logical induction in interpreting the facts thus furnished . Religion soars higher , and listens for the voice of God himself // speaking in the ear of his needy children , and manifesting to them his will , and their duty and destiny , in modes not compre ; hended in any of the laws which science has discovered . These higher modes of manifesting divinity , of which religion informs us , may still be strictly in accordance with the general laws of the universe : but if so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and verify them . They are laws of which our limited knowledge of the whole system never permits us to see more than a single application , and therefore that application seems to us an event without law ; and such an event is always distasteful to the mind of exclusively scientific habit . Such a mind approaches religion under the influence of a strong prejudice against it . In dealing with this part of the subject , Principal Shairp concedes , or seems to concede , to unbelief more than truth either requires or permits . He says : " it is well we should be convinced on rational grounds that science , simply as science , can never reach God . " He quotes with approbation from IDr . McLeod Campbell , " No telescope will enable us to see God . No finest microscope will make Him visible in the act of working . " Certainly not . But neither will any telescope make us see gravitation . All which the telescope can disclose to us is the existence of phenomena , which can only be satisfactorily accounted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telescope can indeed make us see Gxl ; but the universe around us is full of phenomena , open to universal experience and observation , of which the existence of a designing Creator and righteous moral Governor of all things is the one only adequate explanation . Science as truly gives us God as it gives us gravitation . The apostle Paul was not mistaken when he wrote : " the invisible things of Him from the creation of the world are clearly seen , being understood by the things that are made , even His eternal power and Godhead . " If it is said man is finite and God is infinite , and the finite can never understand the infinite , we answer , the prattling babe is quite incapable of comprehending his father . The thoughts , the designs , the activities , the works of that father are as truly incomprehensible to his child as the mind of God is to our limited vision . But does not that child know his father ? his existence ? // his presence ? his power ? his love ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his attributes , but their reality he does know , admire , and love . And in precisely the same sense does short-sighted man know God , and this is the only sense in which it is needful that one should know him , in order to lead a devout , religious life . Certainly science does not reveal God to our senses . But neither are space or time or power or cause revealed to our senses . They are intuitions which transcend sense , and to our intuitions equally the phenomena of the universe reveal a creating God . If it be said that in order to know God our moral nature must be sound and in healthful activity , we answer , certainly : the glory of God ,  --  his Godhead is not his mere creative power , but his moral attributes ,  --  his righteousnes* ,  --  his wisdom ,  --  his love ; and this true Godhead no being will ever know that is not in moral sympathy with it . A being without virtue can no more know virtue or a virtuous being than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The want of such moral vision is the one blinding cause which produces all the atheism there is among men . In this high and only religious sense , the man of science , if proud and selfish in spirit , never can by his science know God , any more than a man of the greatest genius could ever by science understand the laws of light without eyesight . But no one would think of saying that the science of optics can not teach the true doctrine of color , because one must have vision in order to understand it . If the mind is healthy and sound and active in its highest powers and functions , nature-science-does give us God ; and science gives no truth to any one , in whom those mental powers , by which that truth is to be discerned , are not in a state of healthful activity . To this law the relation of science to God and religion forms no exception . This is the all-sufficient explanation of the striking fact that both John the Baptist and Christ himself began their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think that whenever they will they can turn their thoughts to religion , and solve its problems and settle its claims by the mere action of the intellect , as in astronomy , or chemistry . There is a previous question of infinite moment and importance , which // each one of us must answer for himself Is the soul in health ? Is the moral nature sound ? And a true solution of this ques*-tion will bring us all back to the point from which Christ and his great Forerunner begun their labors . Repentance must be our first work . We must begin with moral healing , just as the man blind from birth , if he would understand optics , must begin with a surgery which should unseal his eyes and let in the light of heaven . This is not only an unwelcome truth to men of culture , provided that , as often happens , they are proud and selfish in spite of their culture ,  --  but to all the multitudes who are living without God in the world . Such antagonism between culture and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of true virtue . He who attempts the solution of the problems of religion without taking into the account the sanitary condition of his own soul , is certainly destined to a miserable failure . The disposition so to extend the domain of impersonal laws as to exclude from the universe the active agency of a personal creator and ruler , is the very tap-root of that unbelief to which the exclusive pursuit of physical science tends . No man , who in his inner soul believed in such a personal creator and ruler , would hesitate to believe in the supernatural in such a case as the introduction of the Christian religion into the world . He would feel the full force of the argument of Paul before Agrippa : " Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you that God should raise the dead ? " To a believer in God this question carries along with it its own answer . And yet the atheistic negations of unbelief rest on no basis of argument . No originate in , and depend upon , a personal creator . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show that the action of the soul of universal humanity in recognizing God in nature is not a true intuition , as worthy of implicit faith as the intuition of matter , or of existence , or of moral freedom . And yet how many men are found at present scoffing at the credulitv of those who , behind all the skill and order and harmony and beauty of the universe , see a personal creator , an architect and builder of the heavens and the earth , scoffing where angels // adore , and yet setting up themselves as examples of the highest culture of the human soul ! We have good reas*n to pray to be delivered from such a culture . It is the culture of pride and arrogance ; a culture which neither makes men more modest or more virtuous . There is yet another tendency of an exclusively scientific culture which we can not pass over in silence . It is its tendency to beget mental habits unfriendly to the proper influence over the mind of that sort of evidence which must necessarily be our guide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence of testimony , or more generally of what logicians distinguish as probable evidence . Physical science can admit of no other evidence than that of rigid demonstration and the testimony of the senses . And yet these kinds of evidence bear but a humble part in solving the real difficulties of practical life , whether of the individual or of society . The practical questions we are called to determine are such , that we can rarely have the evidence of our own senses , or of* demonstration . Their decision depends , by the necessity of the case , on balancing opposing probabilities . And yet on their right decision bang issues of the greatest moment to ourselves , our friends , and our country . True practical wisdom consists in determining rightly and safely in cases where we can not walk by sight-for sight is impossible-nor by demonstration , for of that the case does not admit . On such wisdom our success in our own private affairs , the well-being of the State , and the political well-being of the world , depends . Exclusive devotion to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but to disqualify the mind for such affairs . We say exclusive devotion , for we admit that the study of physical science has its place , and should play a certain part in the formation of every man 's character . lit is one of the factors of every good education . But it should not be pursued exclusively-cannot be without making the mind weak , one-sided , and incapable of dealing successfully with all the complicated difficulties and unavoidable uncertainties which surround human life . No wise man would think of giving a youth an exclusive education in material science , to fit him for the law , or for a judicial career , or for a law-maker , or a statesman . // One of the most eminent advocates of scientific culture has objected to the study of the classics , because , in the pursuit of these , the youth is constantly obliged to rely on authority , for the meaning of words , and for the interpretation of particular grammatical constructions . lie might as *well object to that appointment of Providence , or law of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ childhood at all By the very fact that we begin life in infancy and spend so many years in feebleness , ignorance , and dependence , we can not but form those very habits of relying on the authority as well as on the strength of others , just as we do in the study of the classics ; and Mr. Herbert Spencer 's quarrel , after all , is not with the study of the classics , but with an inevitable law of nature . In the consideration just suggested , we have the true explanation of the reaction at present manifest in many quarters against classical study . In common with the very conditions of our lives in childhood and youth , it does form in us the habib of healthful reliance on authority ; it does teach us to rely , with such faith as the conditions of humanity require , on evidence which is merely probable , and to make our way as safely as possible amid all the uncertainties of this our earthly existence . With such mental habits , the man of exclusively scientific cul. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he refuses to believe at , all , unless he can have certainty . Rather than balance opposing probabilities and believe doubtingly and yet act as though he believed certainly , he prefers to stand on what he chooses to consider the proud eminence of sneering scepticism . And yet to take such a position is to unfit oneself for any of the practical realities of human life . Religion is a practical thing : he who imagines that it is not , who places it in the regions of speculation , has committed a fatal error . It is as truly a practical thing as any of the common affairs of the present life . Wisdom in respect to religion depends on the same conduct of the understanding as wisdom in respect to the affairs of our every day-life . All depends on fairness and candor , on the control of the appetites and passions , and the subjugation of the whole man to the governing power of reason and conscience . There is need of the same faith in // evidence which is only probable , the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is not strange , therefore , that a habit of mind which sets many scientific men against the study of the classics as an important part of education , and which ought , in logica.l consistency , to set them in rebellion against that law of nature which dooms us all to pass tihrough the helplessness and dependence of infancy and childhood , should also disqualify the same men for religious faith , throw them out of sympathy with the Christian religion , and lead them to adopt , with a fervor proportional to their zeal for their favorite sciences , a creed of anti-religious negations . What might have been * priori expected has certainly in many instances actually happened . For such an antagonism between religion aud culture we know but one remedy . Such scientists must go and sit for once at the feet of Jesus of Nazareth , till they can learn from him one of his most characteristic lessons . Let them not take the alarm too hastily ; we do not ask that they believe in his supernatural powers , or his resurrection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That is not by any means the first lesson which we propose . We only ask that they sit at his feet long enough to learn that other lesson , which is quite independent of his miraculous powers , " Except ye be converted and become as little children , ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven . " There is a " kingdom of heaven . " For our present purpose it matters not whether Jesus of Nazareth founded it or not . It is a fraternity of Christ-like souls of all climes , and all nationalities , and all worlds . No man can gain admission to it who has not learned this lesson of Jesus . He may have the genius of a philosopher , the learning of a sage ; but he must still have the heart of a child . He must have learned " to esteem others better than himself " " to look not on his own things , but on the things of others . " He must have so modest an estimate of his own powers in presence of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in comparison with the whole range of possible knowledge , as to feel himself to be but a child , and to listen with reverence to any words that fall from the lips of any superior in wisdom . If any one has not this spirit in him , he has not the temper of mind which is suited to // this our humanity . He can not belong to the fraternity of humble and modest and loving ones . He is proud and must dwell in that solitary isolation which pride always produces , till he is converted and becomes as a little child . Then shall he enter the kingdom of heaven and know its blessedness . Till then he may despise it , but it in return must sorrowfully disown him as deficient in those qualities which form the basis of all virtuous character . The antagdnism is not between such a man 's intellect and the doctrines of religion , but between his heart and the only true moral standard of the Universe . If there are prevalent among us such conceptions of culture , and modes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , we can not too earnestly deprecate their influence , or seek their amendment They are not alone unfriendly to religion : they are no less hostile to those loving subordinations which make domestic happiness possible , and render the State capable of freedom without anarchy . There is nothing which we as a nation have more reason to dread , than an education which awakens the mind to activity , and opens to it the fountains of that knowledge which puffeth up , without training it to modesty , to humility , to faith , to subordination . This is a serious subject , which can not be too thoughtfully considered by a great people engaged in the laudable endeavor to provide for universal education . We are no enemies , we are earnest friends of the cultivation of the physical sciences . But we regard the exclusive claims set up for them in some quarters , not only as arrogant , but as eminently dangerous to mental soundness , to subordination , to virtue . We can not therefore avoid the conclusion , that the causes of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inadequacy of our religion to express the sublime conception of its founder , and in the one-sidedness and incompleteness of our culture . And the remedy must be sought in hon*t efforts more completely to interpenetrate the practical religion of the time with the thought , the heart , the spirit of the Divine Master , and to round out all our systems of culture , till they shall comprehend not merely the intellectual and esthetic , but the moral nature of man . We can not help thinking that just in proportion as such efforts are earnestly put forth , on both sides , the din of the long conflict will die away , and the " lion and the lamb will dwell together . " // We think this subject worthy of the most serious consideration of all the leaders of our religious thought . What man of sense did not see the folly and madness of the a*ttempt to impose upon the world as an essential article of the Christian faith , the doctrine of infallibility ? And yet are not Protestants often guilty in greater or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our sects-ought we not rather to say all ? - contending for some things , either in modes of stating faith , or in forms of organization , which are really as indefensible as infallibility ? And how much the tenacity with which we hold such things , and the attitude of conflict with one another into which we are thus brought , expose religion itself to the cutting and damaging sarcasms of unbelief ! There is but one way in which religious men can rid themselves of all responsibility for the long antagonism between religion and culture . They must consent to relax their hold of every foreign element which has attached itself to Christianity in its progress through the ages , and realize to the utmost possible extent the conception of the Divine Author of Christianity in the actual religion of the present hour . Much has been accomplished towards the attainment of this end in the last three hundred years . Much , very much , yet remains to be done . Here is noble work for all the talent engaged in religious thought in our age , far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are divided from each other , o* to defend with any argument however ingenious the peculiarities by which one 's own sect is distinguished . We can not close without expressing the wish that Principal Shairp 's book may have a wide circulation , and that it may be candidly and prayerfully read by young men in pursuit of liberal culture . We could wish indeed that he had been more felicitous , than we think he has been , in stating the real relation of science to religion . His language in reference to this subject is certainly not well guarded , and has , we regret to say , exposed him to unfriendly criticism in some highly respectable journals in this country . But the aim of the work is excellent , its spirit admirable , and its style is so clear , chaste , and truthful as to be quite refreshing amid the sensationalism which so shockingly abounds . We rejoice to know that young men are trained in the Scotch universities under influences so pure , truthful , and dQvout.        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
