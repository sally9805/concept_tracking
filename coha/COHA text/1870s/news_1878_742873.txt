A bill to accomplish this object was introduced yesterday in the Senate , and one of like character was introduced in the House to-day . Judge Kelley resisted the motion to refer the bill to the Committee on Commerce , and claimed that as it contemplated modification of the Revenue and Tariff laws it should go to the Committee on Ways and Means . After some debate on the question of a reference , the bill was referred to the Committee on Commerce by a vote 94 to 66 . This may be regarded as a victory for the advocates of free ships , inasmuch as the opponents of this principle struggled to make the reference to the Committee on Ways and Means , upon the theory that the bill could be retained in that committee .

There can be no doubt that the bill will be reported favorably from the Committee on Commerce , but its prospect for passage during the present session is by no means encouraging . At the meeting or the Committee of Ways and Means to-day , Mr. Gibson moved the appointment of a committee of three to confer with Secretary Sherman in relation to the proposed modifications in the tariff on sugars , with authority to make an investigation of the entire matter , and report to the full committees such recommendations as may be ( teemed advisable . Mr. Wood thought the subject was too important and comprehensive to commit to three persons , and suggested that the entire committee enter upon the investigation .
