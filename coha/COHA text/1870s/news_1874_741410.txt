txt The testimony of Ex-Secretary BOUTWELL before the Ways and Means Committee with reference to the Sanborn contracts , has a certain value . We regret to say that its value is not very great , and . that it is not in the direction we could wish . Mr. BOUTWELL is a gentleman who enjoys , so far as regards his integrity and truthfulness , a remarkable degree of confidence on the part of all who know Aim . He has been accused of being headstrong and crotchety , given to small theories , and proof against enlightenment ; it is even known that he is a professed politician , and makes no secret of doctrines touching patronage which a healthy public opinion is gradually coming to condemn . But every one believes Mr BOUTWELL to be a truthful and candid man , with a high standard of personal honor . What he says , therefore , to relieve the Secretary of the Treasury , either himself or his successor , of tfhe severe blame that has fallen upon them in connection with this miserable Sanborn business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong impression in the public mind that : the Sanborn contracts resulted either from a careless , inefficient , and extravagant system of doing business in the Treasury Department  --  a system in which the precautions taken to protect the interests of the Government were few or none  --  or else that they resulted from the connivance of the responsible officers of the department in a scheme to divert the public revenues to the pockets of individuals . It is impossible to deny That this impression has considerable foundation in the testimony that has been given to the public , in the way it has been given , and in the contradictory and confused character of that portion of it - which came from Treasury officials . Mr. BOUTWELL 'S statement tends to show that all that wasdone by the two Secretaries might have been done in innocence of any wrong , and without any intent to allow the Government to be injured . He confirms the theory of Mr. RICHARDSON , that it is a physical impossibility for the Secretary to be informed of the nature of all the documents he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ executed in a perfunctory and relatively irresponsible manner . For ourselves , we must say that this explanation of the matter is a very unsatisfactory and humiliating one . It admits , it is true , of the opinion that the badness of the system is such that the chief financial officer of the nation Can sign away the right of the Government to hundreds of thousands of dollars without knowing what he is doing ; but who is responsible for the badness of the system itself ? Is tin Secretary to be held entirely blameless , and especially a Secretary who , like Mr. BOUTWELL or Mr. Iticnaunsox , at the time of executing this class of contracts , bad been for a long time in the department , and had ample opportunity to study the operation of its methods . It is not difficult to see that there has been a great deal of ingenious twisting of the evidence in this affair . The order of Mr. BOUTWELL to the Collectors and Assessors of Internal Revenue is a ease in point . We have been treated to columns of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was assumed that the order opened to the contractors the books of the revenue offices , that they might find out what taxes were due to the Government , and proceed to Collect them . But , as we took occasion to point out , long since , the order admits of a precisely opposite construction , viz. : That it was an order to allow the contractors to see what taxes were " of record " in the revenue offices , that they might not collect them . Tho latter was undoubtedly the sense in which the order was issued , though it may have been abused , and , we think , was . This is but a specimen of other unfair and perverted views of the case . But , after allowing for all that ought possibly to be allowed for , there is enough to make out an ugly case  --  one that has already shocked the public , and one that tends to undermine the confidence of the party in its executive servants , and to alienate its members . The public can not help seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought to be held responsible , and.ought to be dealt with for his failure to protect the Government . The making of the contracts was in his hands . He , and no one else , had the power to say what compensation should be given the contractors . It was not " routiue " business . It was in every sense extraordinary , and it was his duty to see that it was commenced rightly , if it was to be commenced . at all , and to take the precautions necessary to bring it from time to time to his attention . It is useless to say that his subordinates framed the contracts . The question of importance is , ' Who dictated their terms ? If the Secretary did not , he ought to have done so . It was his duty , and it was illegal for any one else to perform it . It was also his duty to see that the taxes turned over to the contractors were with reasonable certainty not collectable by the ordinary agencies . He had ample means to ascertain that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furnished him with an entirely satisfactory report on that point . But that officer was not asked . Neither this nor any other precaution was taken . The public money - was simply thrown away . . If the defense is to be that this was done by subordinates  --  which , as we have pointed out , is an . inadmissible defense  --  let us at least , know who the subordinates were , what were their instructions , and why they were relied upon to do this particular business . No such facts are furnished . When we seek to know how the Government was so grossly abused , we are driven about in an exasperating circle . The Secretary relied , on the Assistant Secretary and , the Solicitor , the Solicitor on the Assistant Secretary and . the Secretary , but nowhere can we lay our hands on the man who took a responsible part in the affair . And we are compelled to conclude that , through a bad system and negligent and helpless heads of department , and probably by the connivance of one or more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the money of the people has gone , not into the Treasury , but into the pocket of Gen. BUTLER 'S friend . The conclusion is one painful and . humiliating to reach , but we can not avoid it . The people share it , and our , " leaders " may as well take notice that it is , along with other things , doing a great deal of mischief .
