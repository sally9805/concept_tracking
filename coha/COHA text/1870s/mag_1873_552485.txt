DanisA Socie/y and i/s Revival . DANISH SOCIETY AND ITS REVIVAL . A RIDGE of hills and the sea on both sides , - that is Denmark . Both the peninsula and the islands are modelled after the same plan ; but although this plan is very simple , it involves an infinite variety of landscapes , from the sweet , almost voluptuous idyl in the wood , under the midsummer suns to scenes of the wildest horror , when the roaring surges , towering over the sandbars , break the large , stronglybuilt ship like a toy , and scatter her remnants on the strand , or when the hurricane catches the sand from the banks and hurls its terrible hail-storm over the country , often burying many acres of land , many years labor , many men 's hopes , under a drift which no sun will ever melt . Partly from actual experience , but mainly through the works of their poets and painters , the Danes themselves have acquired a very keen sense of the true though often latent character of their land . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lurks beneath the sungilt , serenely rolling waves , or the place where the charming idyl sleeps among the snow-covered trees . But the foreigner who travels through the country will hardly see more than the general simple and uniform configuration of the land , - the ridge of hills with the sea on both sides . The hills are low . The highest " mountain " in Denmark , " The Mountain of Heaven , " is only four hundred and eighty feet high , and it swells so gently that I doubt whether the farmer from the Catskills would notice the difference between its ascent and descent . The ridges all run from north to south . ' Towards the east the hills slope downward , undulating in gentle but often characteristic curves , and the land is studded all over with rich woods treading so near to the sea that with one more step they would dip their feet in the waves . Towards the west the hills are almost steep , leaving a broad margin of flat land between their walls and the sea . Near the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away it is heath , interspersed with swamps and meadows . Along the sea runs a strip of salt-marsh or a wall , of sand-banks , without trees , with only a few dwarfish and sickly shrubs here and there in the swamp . The two poplars watching the place where the road through the heath makes a sudden turn , they are not trees ; they are only a sort of resurrected broomsticks , and would look odious but for their modesty . The willows which guard the little orchard and garden behind the farmhouse are trees ; but they are strangers here . Generally they are low and stunted , and even when they rise into the air with some thrift and vigor , they all bend their crowns towards the east . Every bough , every twig stretches eastward , and the branches which have to face the west drop their withered leaves in the beginning of July . For here reigns the west wind . Only one wind blows in Denmark , the west wind . When the others try , it is a calm . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it always blows a gale . When the other winds come , they come either as weak breezes bringing rain , or as short blasts bringing frost . The west wind is the ruler of the air , and there is something kingly in him , not because he wrecks a hundred ships every year , not because he makes the trees bow under his sceptre , not because he can send , on a hot summer day , a sudden mist which makes one shiver with cold - 0 no ! in spite of this , there is something truly magnificent and generous in the Danish west wind . It does not sweep whistling over the ground as if it were pressed through a steam-pipe . It does not nip the skin as if it were filled with ice-needles . It 1873. // blows with a volume immense like that of the ocean from which it comes . It bursts into the air with full , round notes like those of an organ . It pounces down upon the earth in broad furrows , frisking and frolicking like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The country-people of Denmark consist of three different classes , - the nobility , the peasantry , and the tiers d/a/ , which with a sneer for both the aristocracy and the peasants , calls itself the educated people . I will speak first of the nobility , not so much from deference as because there is so very little to say about this class . The Danish nobility is rich in proportion to the general standard of wealth in the country . An income of twenty thousand dollars a year is not rare among them , and some have more than two hundred thousand . But they have no influence , or at least very little . They are not highly gifted by nature , and they are not well trained by education . Furthermore , they have no political or social privileges . There is no difference between the legal position of the nobleman and that of the peasant , except that in some cases the nobleman 's estate is inherited by his eldest son ; while otherwise , when a man dies in Denmark his property is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the other half is divided in equal parts among his children . The chief reason , however , why the Danish nobility stands somewhat isolated , without partaking in the social development proportionately to the wealth of the class , is historical . The old , genuine Danish nobility formed a powerful and enormously wealthy aristocracy . But by a singular mistake of the other classes , and by some secret intrigues of the court , this aristocracy , which contained the germ of true popular freedom , was crushed in the year i66o , when Denmark was made an absolute monarchy ; that is to say , when the government was made a completely arbitrary despotism . In the year i66x no clock in Copenhagen dared to strike until the court clock had struck ; and this little trait , communicated with much humor by Lord Molesworth , shows with sufficient cTharness how matters stood . The noblemen retired to their mansions in the country , where they lived in a corner of their splendid palaces ; for the king often imposed such heavy taxes on their property @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arbitrary - that they sometimes had to give up their estates , leaving the king sole master . Meanwhile the king , who still feared the old nobility in its sullen and impoverished retirement , built up a new nobility consisting mostly of German vagabonds , whom he ennobled , installed in military and civil offices , and provided for in a very high-handed manner . He assumed the right to dispose of the hand of every heiress in the kingdom ; and in that way the new nobility , little by little , crept into the estates of the old that died away . But this new nobility , which was simply a court aristocracy , had no other relation to the people than a reciprocal hatred . Only two or three persons out of the whole swarm have acquired an honest name in Danish history ; the rest are mercifully forgotten ,  --  f6rgotten together with the court where they danced and drank and flirted and gambled . When , in 1848 , the Danish people became a free people , and every citizen was called upon to partake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miserable insignificance . The whole artificial structure of the society which alone gave the noblemen any influence broke down . Their privileges were lost ; their rank was gone ; and , to make their misery complete , there was no longer any court . The king , Frederick VII. , had married a milliner , who was too famous before her marriage ever to become the centre of an elegant circle ; and it must be said to.the praise of the ladies of the Danish nobility , they were visited , but they were not found at home . During the twenty years , however , which fol 68o June , // lowed , a change apparently took place in the position of the nobility . In dheir elegant retirement , the noblemen seemed to give up the German idea of a court paradise , and began to imitate the English aristocracy . They began to take the lead in many local affairs of importance , especially in agriculture . They introduced machinery and all modern improvements in the cultivation of their . estates ; they instituted races , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the best specimens of domestic animals ; and in these and many other new ways channels seem to open up for a beneficial influence from the noblemen upon the other classes . To the second class , the educated people , Denmark is indebted for its free constitution and for the first endeavors towards making this constitution work successfully in practical life . They now form the kernel of the people . They have the influence . All great ideas originated with them , and were by them introduced in actual life . The ideas and manners of this class are the ideas and manners of the Danish people . As this class comprises families many of which have an income of only one or two thousand dollars a year , while some have an income of more than ten thousand a year , there is a great difference between the social circumstances in which the members of this class live . Three different stages may he noticed . In the first stage a family eats with silver forks , and has a piano . It would be very hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belonging to the society of educated people , if it ate with iron forks and had no piano ; that is to say , if it could not afford to give its life a certain appearance of elegance , or if its life lacked some important element of a liberal education , for instance , music . An educated Dane will eat pork and beans twice a day all the year round , and think himself very well fed , if he eats it with a silver fork ; but if he is compelled to eat his meat with an iron fork , he will weep over his forlorn condition . A Danish family , when utterly reduced by some misfortune , will look on with comparative indifference while the chairs and tables go to the auction-room ; but when the piano is shut up and carried down stairs , a darkness will overcloud the room as if the sun were eclipsed , and a terror will seize upon the heart as in the days of the plague , when all the birds dropped dead to the earth and the woods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carpets make their appearance , and the family keeps a close carriage . Carpets are in Denmark not so generally used nor so highly appreciated as in England and America . A family , of course , finds its rooms cosier and more pleasant when in the fall the carpets are spread over the floors ; yet in the spring , when the deep gray tinge of the sky brightens into * * ht blue , when the sunshine grows warm , and the west wind blows balmily , every member of the family , from the grandmamma to the children , is glad to get rid of the dusty carpets ; and , indeed , the bare wooden floor , often a costly mosaic , or tastefully painted , and always washed in the morning with cold water , gives the room , through the hot summer days , a very agreeable freshness and airiness . A close carriage , on the contrary , is highly appreciated , and the delight given by such an increase of a family 's comfort is almost ludicrous . For a whole year every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see " our new landau , " and the best argument for a new dress is , " You would not have me sit in the new landau with this old thing ! " In the third stage , the chandelier is hung from the ceiling , and the footman keeps guard in the anteroom . The ladies of the house can not be seen until after three o'clock , and the master has a title , which , the more barbarous it sounds , the better it is . Some of these titles are composed of one German , one French , and one Danish word ; and when a man has such a lictor to bear axe and rods before his name , and ten thousand dollars a year to 1873. 68i // finish up the procession , he feels very happy . A title is a good thing ; it acts upon the mind like a good conscience . When a man is Gelieirne-itats-raad , he may say to himself that he can not be so very bad . But these differences of social circumstances , however great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrown into the background , if not wholly forgotten , on account of the community of education , of ideas , interests , and manners ; and it is quite common to find a family which never gives a dinner-party and never treats its guests with anything more than a cup of tea living in great intimacy and on a perfectly equal footing with a family whose footmen at every supper serve dainty dishes on silver plates . The community of education is always and everywhere a power stronger than old habits , stronger than in-grown prejudices , stronger even than incidental antipathies , but I doubt whether there is another place in the world where it exercises so noble and so lovely an influence as in the country life of Denmark . Community of education must not be understood , however , to mean that all the members of the class are actually possessed of the same kind or of the same degree of education . This is not the case . Here , for instance , is a man who can neither read nor write . Thirty years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a talker , and his success in business was so extraordinary that people were a little slow in putting confidence in him . He bought geese , lambs , calves , pigs , and fat cattle of the neighboring peasants , and transported them to Copenhagen , where he sold them . He gave a fair price , however , and paid promptly . He was always true to his word , even when it was sometimes a little rash ; and people soon understood that he was a great convenience to them . The farmer , who formerly had some trouble in finding a buyer for his lambs and calves just when he wanted , could now send for the pig-broker , as they called him , and get money at any time . Little by little people began to like and respect the man . He was money to them . Many a peasant who formerly raised only twelve geese a year and ate them all himself now raised , without any greater outlay of money , a hundred geese , and laid away , every fall , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that cattle-feeding and raising of lambs and calves and pigs increased , nay , d6ubled , in every county to which the pig-broker extended his business ; and soon he was looked upon half as a blessing and half as a wonder , - the more so , as he , who could neither read nor write , and did a business of more than two hundred thousand dollars a year , was never known to make a mistake . In the mean time , the man himself grew silent , overburdened as he was with his enormous business , and the richer he grew the more modest he became . But he delighted in hearing " learned people " talk . He felt the pleasure of intercourse with educated people , and longed for it . The first door he knocked at was the clergyman 's of the parish , and it so happened that the parson was a man of very refined manners , of strong literary sympathies , and the centre of the high-life of the whole neighborhood ; yet he soon understood that the seat where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupied it was very silent . The calm , gray eyes , always thoughtful , always attentive , often told more and better in a conversation than several gossiping mouths ; and people of true and genuine education soon felt that , in spite of all differences , there was , in a social respect , an essential and noble sympathy between them and him . The pig-broker was received among the educated people ; and if the difference between the members of this class is very great with regard to the degree of their education , it is still greater with regard to its quality . The Danes are by nature very apt to confine themselves to a specialty , and this national trait is , of course , most apparent among the educated portion of the people . I know one farmer who has a passion for // dramatic literature . The dunghill and the stage ! the combination is certainly a little singular . His library consists of over twenty thousand volumes , and gives a fair representation of what mankind has produced in this line . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sanskrit on palm-leaves , and I suppose it contains , also , a fine edition of those English plays which bear the late Mr. Robinson 's name on their title-pages . It is unique in its kind , and its owner is unique too . He is a diamond edition of his own library , and talks drama always and everywhere , even on the dunghill . I know another farmer who has a passion for antiquities . In his hall great cases with glass doors stand along the walls , and a complete collection of all the stone weapons and utensils which the ancient Scandinavians used before they learned to work metals is arranged systematically on shelves , each article being provided with a label telling where the specimen was found , what it was originally used for , how it was probably made , etc . The great label to the whole collection is the farmer himself . Ask him how he enjoyed himself in Copenhagen , or how he likes his new coat , the answer will invariably end on some one of the shelves . A third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles to see a new kind , and he will become feverish if he can not come into possession of it , as he becomes feverish when he can not ingraft his passion upon other people . But he generally succeeds . The whole county in which he lives has become famous for its roses . It is called the land of the roses , and the farmer tells with a certain complacency that in June he can smell the smoke of his hearth when eight miles distant . A fourth has a passion for meerschaum pipes , and falls in love with every pipe of uncommon size or form . A fifth has a passion for politics ; a sixth , for mesmerism ; and so on . But if any one . would infer from this difference , both in the degree and in the quality of the education of the members , that there was no real community of education in the class , he would be much mistaken . In a society to which money opens the door , it is by no means necessary , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own a certain amount of money ; it is enough if he can onlyspend it . And in a society to which a certain education has the key , it is by no means necessary , in order to be admitted , that a man should actually possess this education ; it is enough if he only respects it . In the class of the Danish nation called the educated people there are certain general ideas regarding the moral , intellectual , and social acquirements which make an educated man ; and every one who understands these ideas and respects them is admitted into the society of the class , - which is certainly proper , as he has truly attained the first and most essential element of the education . Of course , as it is best to do what is good and only second best to leave undone what is bad , so it is best to be an educated man ; but it is next to the best to have that veneration for education which guards one from giving offence . What , then , is the Danish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draw the outlines of this idea , considered , however , only from a social point of view . One condition is that the man shall be able to express his opinions , even when the conversation assumes the character of a passionate debate , in such a manner as does not hurt anybody 's feelings or make the conversation disao*reeable by personal excitement . It is an intellectual duty to form opinions in perfect harmony with our individuality on all subjects which concern us ; and it is a moral duty to adhere to those opinions , to defend them to the utmost of our ability , to assert them with the whole strength of our personality . But in fulfilling this duty there may sometimes be shown an indifference to authority and politeness which in Denmark is never mistaken for true independence of opinions , and convictioa 1873.1 683 // of character . It is simply considered as stupidity and roughness , and he who has once or twice displayed this sort of independence will hardly have occasion to do it the third time . Another condition is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his behavior towards other persons ; that he shall be able , so to speak , to shade his manners into perfect harmony with the circumstances . It is demanded of a man of consummate education that he shall have a different shade of manners for the prime-minister of the country and the tax-gatherer of the village , for the head of the Danish Church and the schoolmaster of Asmindrup , for H. C. Andersen and the printer 's boy who brings the proofs of his tales . Perfect education enables a man to value correctly each number in the long scale , from the eminent merits which confer great benefit on a whole nation to the drowsy drudgery which plods along towards its bread and butter ; and it ought also to enable him to show this valuation honestly and gracefully . There is a levelling and equalizing plainness of manners which in Denmark is never mistaken for true manhood , but is simply considered and treated as impertinent arrogance . Persons before whose eyes all differences vanish into insignificance are , in good company in Denmark , always surrounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third condition is that the man shall possess a certain amount of knowledge ; that is to say , that his consciousness shall be widened so far beyond the spot of existence which denotes his own personal life , that on all sides it meets the infinite . Among educated people some have an eminently wide mental horizon , others a comparatively narrow one ; but it is always a token of perfect education when the consciousness at no point is pained or dulled by the barriers which ignorance and self-conceit raise around it . As the sailor feels at home on the vast plains of the ocean , and understands the changing expression in the face of the sea long before June , the passenger detects any change at all , the educated man must feel at home in the vast realms of human civilization , and understand whither the main streams come and whence they are going . Or , to go a little into details , according to the Danish idea of an educated man , he must have in his mind a picture of life in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in the democracy of modern times ; and this picture must , in some of its details , be painted in full , giving clear and well-defined notions of the tendencies , religious or moral , scientific or artistic , political or social , which have been acting in different periods , or are acting in the present . Or , to go still more into details , a girl who had never heard the names of Socrates and Columbus ; who had no idea of the difference between a picture of the Italian school and one of the Dutch school ; who thought that Romeo and Juliet and The School for Scandal were written in France , or by the same author , or in the same century ; who believed that Goethe wrote the libretto of the opera which Gounod composed , - would give pain in a Danish company , and nobody would know what to do with her . It is always supposed that the great peaks , of civilization must have been visible to her from the hearth of her home , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at them and to love them . Where this ideal of education is generally acknowledged and striven for , life among educated people can not fail to have both richness and sweetness . And these it has in Denmark . When on a winter evening the lamp is lit , and the ladies of the house gather round the table , one mending stockings and another mending laces , one reading the newest book and another making artificial flowers , one embroidering a smoking-cap for her brother and another making him six new shirts , the scene has a peculiar charm , like that of a breeze sweeping over a rose-bush , or that of a note struck on a well-tempered instrument . Although the sam eper Danish Sociez*y and its Revivat ? * // Sons find each other at the same place every evening through many years , there is no monotony in their intercourse . Their intellects are conversant with a multitude of different interests , their minds stored with a multitude of different ideas . Even the smallest incident awakens a long train of new and interesting associations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volubility of tongue ; and although neither Shakespeare nor Goethe is named or thought of during the whole evening , yet they seem not to be absent . Even the slightest remarks have , like summer clouds at sunset , a golden tinge , which shows that the person has been touched and is attracted by ideas far beyond the actual reach of his own personal life . Once or twice a week this uniformity may be enlivened by the presence of company , for the Danes are exceedingly fond of social intercourse . The hall-doors are thrown open and many lamps are lit . The diamond edition opens and tells how the play , which some of the company are going to give next week at an amateur performance for the benefit of a poor widow , originated on the sunny plains of Castile as a great romantic drama , brilliant , luxurious , and overwhelming to a Northern imagination ; how it then wandered through every town in France , until , worn out and torn to pieces , it arrived at Paris , where some rags of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set out on a journey through Germany , where it was patched over with sentimentality , until , at last , the Danish Mr. Robertson laid hold of it , and redressed it after his own taste . The great label explains that his collection gives ample evidence of the manner in which Scandinavia was peopled by the Gothic immigration . The parson advances another theory . Maps are unfolded , peculiarities of dialects searched , other documents examined , weighed pro and contra and the explanation of the great label is found to be correct . The pigbroker , who seems to be a great friend of the young ladies , is seated among a cluster of beauties , and gives a halfhumorous , half-awkward description of the latest fashion in the metropolis , - a woolsack on the back of the neck , and a half-pint pitcher on the top of the skull , which description never fails to excite immense laughter . The supper is served by the young ladies , even in families where footmen are in attendance , and it is served through all the rooms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a glass are passed to each person wherever he happens to stand or sit , and so are the dishes , the dessert , the wine , and the punch . After supper there is singing , a little dancing , and a little smoking , until the carriages drive upbefore the door , and the whole company , amid preparations for the long drive through the frosty night , breaks up in the most amusing confusion . When they are wrapped up in their furs and shawls , the husband does not know his wife , and the mother can hardly recognize her children . The general cry of " Good night , come soon and see us is every moment pierced by the still louder cry after Lise and Peter ; and while Peter is sure that he has conducted Lise safely to the carriage , Lise is strolling about through all the rooms in search of Peter . During the summer people do not visit each other much at their homes . They meet in the groves , where large and elegant pavilions are built for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with colored lamps , while a tolerably good orchestra is playing . In places , however , where no pavilion has been built , the scene is always more pleasant and more romantic . Where the forest opens on the sea , a great fire is made close by the strand , - a huge beacon , whose long flames leap high in the air , painting the waves with gold and the trees with bronze , and sending up towards the sky a column of gilded smoke . Here the families spread their suppers around the beacon , with the waves for orchestra and the sky for a pavilion , and soon the whole air rings with songs and laughter . // This ideal of education and these manners of life , which , as above mentioned , have here been sketched from a social point of view only , are open to much criticism , as the Danes themselves know very well . During the last thirty years changes have taken place , both in the position of the Danes as a nation and in their organization as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education . During the last generation the German people , with Prussia and Austria at its head , has pounced upon them twice , and bloody wars have ensued . The true cause of these wars was the necessity that the German princes should supply a temporary vent for the democratic fermentation in the German people ; but the reasons given publicly were so subtle that foreign diplomatists hardly understood them , and so insignificant that foreign nations could hardly be expected to take any great interest in them . From these wars the Danes learned , that , in order to vindicate themselves as a nation , they must be prepared to transform their whole land at any minute from a home into a camping-ground , and that , for many years to come , every man must sleep with his weapons under his pillow , - an idea which was very foreign to the ruling education . During the same time they became a free people , and this also led them to understand that their ideal of education was , in many respects , incomplete , and its realization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequent and more intimate intercourse between the different classes of the people , especially between the peasantry and the educated class , which the free constitution brought about , made it natural that this class should exercise a great influence on the peasants . But this influence proved to be bad . That which the peasants needed was not possessed by the educated class , and what they took from it was its faults , not to say its vices . The first peasants who , under the freer constitution , entered into public life generally made a very unfavorable , even offensive impression . They were stubborn , overbearing , and seemingly insensible to arguments . They were radical as far as their egotism reached , but beyond that they were very aristocratic . They irritated by their behavior , and when the irritation subsided they were laughed at . It is stupidity , was generally said . But it was not stupidity . It was half imitation , half revenge . The educated people had not succeeded in moulding their own manners to the circumstances . They had started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above them , and arrogant to those beneath them ; and the peasant , who now addressed them in an overbearing , almost slighting manner , simply imitated them ; while at the same time he probably vented an old ill-feeling . It was evident to a close observer that that by which the peasant gave offence was just that which he had learned from the educated class ; and it could be said with truth that the peasants held before the eyes of the educated class a mirror in which its vices , its faults , and its failures were mimicked in the most hideous manner . It was for several years a serious question how to educate the peasants . They were a drowsy , sluggish race , and utterly unintelligent . " We will have rain to-morrow , " the peasant would say , " the sun sets big and red . " This might be all right ; but if you had tried to explain to him that the sun looked bigger and redder than usual because it was seen through a dense mist , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cloud and give rain the next day , he would merely have looked at you with the void glance of a dog , not knowing whether you were trying to fool him or whether you really explained the mystery . Nevertheless , he gave ample evidence that he was not dull by nature , he only lacked education . He was stupid as he trudged along behind the plough ; but he often showed himself a shrewd observer both of natural phenomena and of human character , and in the small business he had to transact he always exhibited con-686 June , // siderable tact . Many of the greatest Danish merchants of this centuty were either peasants or the descendants by one generation from peasant stock . Th* pig-broker is by no means the only one among them who has shown a high degree of mercantile talent . In all sorts of exercise and games they were awkward and clumsy , and singularly afraid of trying anything new ; yet they make excellent soldiers , quick in their movements , undaunted , cool , and resolute before the mouths of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing seemed to make any vivid impression upon them ; and yet they had a very strong sympathy for animals , and for old and sick persons . I knew one who whipped his wife - literally whipped her - at least once a week ; but when she was ill , he nursed her with a patience and kindness not to be surpassed ; and when she fell very sick , and he was told that she must die , the cold sweat sprang from his forehead , and with many tears he asked her if there were anything he could do for her before they were separated , " for I have loved thee truly all my life through . " The worst , however , was that they had no sense of honor and no self-control . When a man stole , they gave him a nickname , - for instance , Theft-Lars ; and they called him so , not only when they spoke about him , but also when they addressed him , and he was none the worse for that . Nevertheless , even in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not nature , had made them so . As a rule , they were very honest , and , when trusted , perfectly reliable . Only when a vice-for instance , drunkenness - took hold of them , they were lost . They did not drink till they were tipsy , but they drank till they were dead . A peasant once made a bet that he could waltz for twenty-four hours , and it was necessary to send for the police in order to prevent him from waltzing into his grave ; and peasants often made the bet of drinking twenty-four " snapses " in twenty-four seconds , standing on one leg . Tb ere was generally a wildness and impetuosity in their faults and vices which showed that there was a latent energy concealed behind their drowsiness . The important question was , how to awaken this energy and direct it into a proper channel . It was generally hoped that life , under a free constitution , in connection with a better school - education , would do this work . But both failed utterly . A coinpendium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of some of the most striking features of the history and philosophy of nature were introduced into the schools . But , generally , the schoolmasters did not understand how to work with the new materials , and even where they did , even where seed was actually sown and planted , there came forth no fruit . How the free constitution influenced the peasants I have hinted . It seemed at the start merely to let loose what every man wished to see tied up as securely as possible . The situation grew worse instead of better . Efforts were made to influence them through their homes , but without success . A peasant 's home in Denmark , twenty years ago , was very poor . His house consisted of four thatched buildinbs , united in a square , enclosing " the farmer 's goldmine , " where the hogs dug out the treasures , and which made neither the most wholesome nor the most agreeable neighborhood . Behind the house was a garden with one or two fruit-trees , which grew wild , and one or two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . The dwelling itself consisted of three rooms , - the kitchen , the room , and the farther-room . The last was very seldom used ; it was furnished with at least one feather-bed , sometimes three or four , which could be reached only by help of a ladder , and were hung with immense blue cotton curtains , which made each bed a separate room . Under the windows stood immense chests with brass handles , and between the windows were two or three seats . That was all . In " the room " the parents and children , and servants of both sexes lived , 1873.1 687 // together with the poultry , the sick lamb , and the pet pig . In this room one generation ate , drank , and amused itself ; while another was born , and a third died ; and , to make the picture more impressive , I will add that the window - sashes were nailed to the frames , so that the windows could never be opened . In this home the peasant rested after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corresponded . A burial was one of his best pleasures . When a man died the whole neighborhood gathered together in the house of mourning early in the morning on the day of the burial , men and women eating , drinking , and feasting round the corpse : I have seen them play cards on the top of the coffin ! Of course , it was not difficult for the clergy to make such roughnes ses vanish ; but though in the course of a few years the male servants were moved to a room in another building , though a separate sleeping-room was built for the parents , though the floor was laid with wood instead of clay , and though the windows were sometimes opened , yet the change which took place in the peasant 's home-life was really only a change from roughness to vanity . The prospect was sad , nay , it was even dangerous ; for the peasantry formed the most numerous class of the people , and , consequently , within a short time they would constitute the majority in the legislation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in less than a year , made the slow , sullen peasant-lad a quick , enterprising , man , communicative , eager to learn , and acting from the most liberal and generous impulses ; that powerful change which within two or three generations will make the peasantry the kernel of the Danish people , and will alter the whole ideal of education by placing it on a much broader basis ; that blessed change which will produce the future of Denmark , if any future she has , by showing to the world - what the world at present is somewhat liable to forget - that small nations may have a right to live because civilization may find offices for them which the great nations are unable to fill . That final perfection which art has never attained since the days of Greece , whence did it come ? It came from the uniformity of the public which art addressed , from the happy circumstance that , in the Greek societies , all citizens stood on the same basis of education , with no other difference than that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all essential ideas upon which life was based which gave their art its wonderful ripeness and consistency . In societies where there are forced together such discrepancies as the monk torturing himself in his cell and the knight gluttonizing in his hall , art will never reach far beyond the sickly affectation of a coterie . And not only art , but science and business , and every sphere in which human life develops , demand a certain uniformity among the different classes in society . But at present this uniformity is attainable by small nations only ; and for this reason I hope that the Danes still have a future before them . This revolution , or rather revival , is due to one man , Nicolas Frederik Severin Grundtvig . He was a bishop , and was about ninety years old when he died , a few months ago ; but although drooping , with a feeble gait and weak eyes , he still rendered the impression of a mighty personality , even upon strangers who could not see the halo which his grand life and many men s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one continual battle ; but not so much against external adversaries ; for , although every second line in his writings is polemical , his polemics are not especially noteworthy . His genius had no power ofdestruction . The ground on which he built was cleared and prepared by History herself ; not by him . But he had to struggle against the impetuosity and turbulence of his own mind . As early as i8o* he wrote out and published the ideas of popular education which , half a century after , when put in practice , brought a new bloom upon 688 // the country . But on their first appearance these ideas were very little heeded , not only because the soil was not yet prepared for them , hut also because they were obscure in themselves . And so were all his ideas when they first appeared . His obscurity is not that which characterizes Tauler and Japob Bdhme . They retreated into obscurity , into the obscurity of the infinite ; their minds found rest in the romantic twilight of a pious mysticism ; he struggled out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effervescent mind , towards the simple clearness of practical life , and he succeeded . His old age was an unclouded , majestic sunset . In the earlier days of his life the variety of his gifts seems to have distracted and impeded him not a little , though later on this many-sidedness proved to be the very condition for fulfilling , the mission which was given him . He was a great linguist , a scholar not only in Latin and Greek , but also in Icelandic and Anglo-Saxon . His edition of Bjoeoulf 's Drapa has made his name celebrated among English scholars . He is a great historian . In spite of a number of whimsical ideas which they propound , his two great works , - the Myths of the North , and the World 's Chronicle - rank among the first in Danish literature on account of the broad and elevated views they contain . 1-us judgments of characters and tendencies and his prophecies as to the practical consequences of certain incidents , were very much laughed at when his World 's Chronicle first appeared ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He wrote a grand drama giving a picture of the struggle between Christianity and the Scandinavian heathenism . It was written at that period when Goethe 's Faust and Tieck 's dramas had loosened and almost dissolved the dramatic form . It lacks unity and concentration ; but it has one quality in common with the greatest poetry , - it grows upon the reader , and becomes more and more interesting after every perusal . Besides VOL . XXXI. - NO. iSS. 44 this drama , he wrote a great number of ballads and hymns ; and , as a poet , he is best known to his countrymen by these minor poems . They are very different in character , though they are equally excellent . His ballads breathe a passionate patriotism , and in some of them , for instance , in one called Niels Ebbeson , in which he mastered the Danish language as seldom had a language been mastered before , the passion is heightened to an almost overwhelming degree of excitement . His hymns , on the contrary , give the sweetest expressions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in faith and hope ; and they show that , through the long and hard struggle of his life , one thing , at least , was always settled and sure . It was , however , neither as a linguist , nor as an historian , nor as a poet that Grundtvig became the reformer of the Danish civilization . It was as a theologian and as a clergyman . Of course it could not be otherwise ; no power but religion can straighten a soul distorted by vicious passions ; no power but religion can awaken a soul dulled by thraldom . The rule is the same for nations as for individuals . No*hing but religion can save a nation when bad habits and bad passions have brought it to ruin ; nothing but religion can lift a nation when it begins to sink by its dead weight to the bottom of civilization . Good schools and a free constitution are great influences in the life of a people , if they work on a foundation of religious feeling ; if not , they are null and void . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not make him grow . In Denmark two different forms or conceptions of Christianity  --  the rational and the speculative - followed one after the other in this century , both orioinating from a similar movement in the German philosophy , and both equally barren and useless in practical life . They both agree in considering the Bible , not only as the regula fidel , but as the only source of true Christian knowledge ; but while the former interprets the contents of the Bible till it // becomes consonant with human reason , the latter mythifies the contents of the modern consciousness till it becomes consonant with the Bible . But in both cases religious life is made an intellectual process entirely indifferent to the wants of the volition , - a discussion between science and revelation entirely indifferent to the demands of practical life . What did the peasant care whether reason found a natural explanation of the miracles of Christ , or whether a higher speculation saw fit to dispense with the laws of nature ? He slept , and was about to lose his soul in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His first thesis is that the Bible is a book like all other books , - infinitely better because it teaches us how to save our souls , but still a book only , which , like all other books , demands to be read in and with a certain spirit , in order to be understood . His second thesis is that the way into Christianity is , consequently , not through the Bible , which demands that you shall be a Christian before you can read it , but through baptism . In baptism you make a contract with God ; you promise to believe in the creed in which you are baptized , and to act up to your faith ; and God promises that he will save your soul for the kingdom of his glory if you redeem your words . I can not here undertake either to explain to the reader the great consequences involved in these theses , or to give any idea of the immense learning , linguistical , historical , and philosophical , which Grundtvig and his disciples have brought to bear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one thing is evident , namely , that Christianity by these theses is transformed from an intellectual process into an act of the will , from a discussion into actual life ; and this transformation was all that was needed . Its effects were wonderful . During his long life Grundtvig made a great number of disciples . Indeed , to make disciples able to propagate and develop his ideas was the proper work of his own personal life . Many of these were theologians , and rose , little by little , to the highest dignities in the Danish Church and at the Danish University . Others occupied very different positions in society . The queen and the old maids in the hospital where he was chaplain , some merchants , some noblemen , some peasants , and a considerable number of mechanics gathered every Sunday in his church . In spite of their very different social circumstances and very different education , all these people looked very much alike . A strong hue of religion and as strong a hue of nationalism characterized their every word and action . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , drank wine , and enjoyed life as freely as other people ; but the manner in which they did all these things was new . They carried religion with them everywhere , not in the form of a prayerbook , but in the form of a certain innocence and frankness which ennobled the amusement , and which was heightened in effect by the unflinching indignation with which they assailed all frivolity . In their speech and *vriting ; they laid much stress on the purity of the language . Wordsofgenuine Danish stock , which had been supplanted by foreign importation and were now living only in the dialects of the peasantry , were drawn forth , and often gave their utterances a peculiar pith and raciness . Even the most quiet and unpretentious among them were very different from other people ; and as a great mental agility and great eagerness for practical enterprise characterized most of them , it was no wonder that they very soon made a sensation . It was thought , however , that the movement would be confined within comparatively narrow limits and soon die @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when all at once the party arose and took the lead in nearly every field of civilization . Most wonderful and most beneficial was the effect on the peasantry . Winter schools were established , where the young peasants , male and female , spent // the winters , when there was very little to do at home on the farm . Here they learned to love their Bible and their hymn-book ; their native tongue , its verses and its tales ; their fatherland , its liberty and its history ; and here they learned why a big and red sun indicates rain , what to do to get animals and trees to grow , how to live in order to live long and in good health . It is impossible to tell in detail what they learn and how they learn it ; for there is no system either as to the materials or as to the method of instruction . This , indeed , is the invariable objection of all old fogies in Denmark against these schools , - that they have no system . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or by system . XVhen the inspiration is used up , the system must follow ; but as long as the former is still alive , there is no need of the latter . And inspired these young teachers are who , with a full heart and two empty hands , go out in the country , hire a farther-room in a farm , and open the school . Their deeds speak for them . It was an evening in July when I came home , after the absence of nearly a year . The village in which I was born is situated on the west side of the hills , and as I drew near the broad plain lay basking in the warm sunset . On the top of the hills the church stood , all in one blaze of splendor . The panes of the large windows in the steeple caught the beams of the setting sun , and reflected them as if a new sun was lit within the choir . Half an hour later , when the sun sank deeper , the panes of the farmhouses were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hills . On Sunday , at this hour , the peasants , male and female , used to gather around the village pond , amusing themselves as best they could . But generally the chief amusement was the arrival of the cake-pedler with his basket ; for while he sold cakes to the women , he sold spiced rum and other " sweet drinks " to the men ; and in the evening the place around the pond often rang with indecent talk , with brawls and uproar . The sun sank below the horizon just as I reached my birthplace . The night was perfectly still , and the great bell in the steeple lifted up its solemn booming , telling over hill and valley that night was come . There were many people assembled at the pond , but there was no noise . They stood in groups under the old willow-trees , and when the last boom of the bell died away in the night , they all burst out in a beautiful hymn . I stopped amazed . When the hymn was over , they shook hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and family after family walked away , each towards its home . For a little while some children 's laughter was heard , then the echo of some footsteps afar off then the shutting of a window , and then nothing . I walked over to the pond . There were seats around the old willow-trunks , and the seats were painted . The pond was set with cut stones , and behind it was erected a shooting-gallery . I was still more surprised . What did it mean ? Was there to be a feast ? No , the change was not for the sake of one day . The houses were whitewashed . The doors hung straight on their hinges . Trees were planted behind every house , and a smell of roses floated in the air . I sat down and looked around , dimly feeling that this change foreshadowed the future of my fatherland .
