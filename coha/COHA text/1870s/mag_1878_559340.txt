PESSIMISM IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY. * WE have ingenious and satisfactory methods of measuring the fall of the rain and the speed of the wind , the weight of the atmosphere and the temper of the weather and the blood , but we have no instrument or calculus for measuring the pains and pleasures of a human life or of a century . We have sufficient reason , indeed , for thinking that some lives are happier than others , and that some ages bear a whiter mark in history than the ages that are called dark ; yet new developments are constantly disturbing old associations , and the last and greatest of our surprises comes from the dark views of our own proud nineteenth century which are taken by the most conspicuous and original school of philosophers of our time . The great word upon the lips of the people and their orators , and upon the pens of authors , whether poets , naturalists , moralists , or theologians , has been Progress ; and it has been very pleasant to hear and to read how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sweep of our observations of Nature , the minuteness and power of our mechanism , the grasp and efficacy of our humanity , the light and vigor of our * " Pessimism : A History and a Criticism .

What shall we say of the undoubted fact that this halcyon age of ours , so full of cheerful theology , has produced the gloomiest of all philosophies , even the pessimism , that regards life as in itself a curse , declares birth to be damnation , and welcomes death as the only salvation ? How shall we account for the fact that the hell which has been dismissed by some of our leading preachers is restored by our freethinkers , and made out to be the centre of this actual world ? Radical , common-sense leaders may turn away from this statement in impatience of a new folly or indignation at a fresh imposture ; but no earnest , thoughtful man will be indifferent to any opinion or tendency that has sincere and able followers and is making a decided mark upon the literature of our time . We must confess to being frequently provoked by some of the speculations of pessimists , and to being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these men reason carefully enough and write well enough to claim a hearing ; and even if their leaders had less learning and eloquence they would call for attention from the guardians of public opinion on account of their great and growing influence upon current thought and speech . This view of the movement is evidently taken by the leading thinkers of Europe , and we could make out a catalogue of works against pessimism that would form a little library . Solid octavos , thick pamphlets , popular lectures , and learned and brilliant reviews , have gone into the fight , and the cry is , " Still they come . " That master of Christian apologetics , Dr. J. H. A. Ebrard , of Germany , does not refuse to set the pessimist philosophers , Schopenhauer and Hartmann , in the front rank of the enemies of the faith which he defends , nor does he fail to bring to bear upon their system the heaviest guns of his orthodox philosophy . In the winter of 1876 , Dr. Paul Zimmermann seems to have won the presence and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gay capital of Austria to his thoughtful and eloquent lectures in defense of ideal theism against the new treed of despair ; and this protest of South Germany against the Berlin pessimist school is now repeated at Munich by the noted oracle of art and *esthetics , IMloritz Carriere , in his able and fascinating book on " The Moral Order of the World , " which begins with thanksgiving for the downfall of Kapoleonism , sees love everywhere in the harmony of the universe and the hopes of the // nation , and traces out the benign power that unfolds itself in the All , and finds the all in the One . From Stuttgart , a serious and cogent treatise has just reached us from the pen of the distinguished and lamented statesman Von Golther , who deals with pessimism in its bad effects upon education . Holland sends out a prose essay from the old Society of the Hague in face of the new enemy of religion . The French Academy is represented in the conflict by such powerful men as Paul Janet and E. Caro ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a host of champions , most ponderous of whom , although not quite the most brilliant , is James Sully , the author of the " History and Criticism of Pessimism , " which heads our list ; and most earnest and eloquent of them all is Baring-Gould , whose little book closes the list . It is certainly for us Americans to open our eyes to this goblin , and thus far our daily press has been in advance of our literary reviews as to this matter . Our aim is to illustrate some of the conditions and characteristics of the movement , to consider its essential principles , and to estimate its probable influence . I. Perhaps the very surprise , and even horror , with which this creed of despair is received by the ruling public sentiment may do something to explain its origin . Extremes meet , and one extravagance is sure to meet another . Why , then , be astonished that the age which has rejoiced in the most thoroughgoing optimism should be startled by the apparition of the most dismal pessimism , a theory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same speculative spirit ? We may understand to a certain extent how this transition has come if we bear in mind the personal traits , the general position , and the universal tendencies of thought and life , that have marked the leaders of this school . All men are probably pessimists at some time , and with some men the gloomy temper tends to be habitual , and they are almost always looking on the dark side of things . In fact , every strong emotion tends to generalize itself , and the heart is more fond of the absolute than the head . If a child has an ache in the stomach or the teeth , if the little fellow is scratched by the cat , stung by a bee , or if he tumbles down-stairs or does not get the expected cake or toy , he is fond of saying : " It is always so ; you always treat me in this way . I never have a good time . " Perhaps the next minute some sudden turn of luck may change his mood , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ April shower of tears ; but that passing cloud noue the less shows what our human nature is , and much of the gloom that clouds literature and life proves that we are but children of a larger growth , and that we insist upon making a perpetual curse out of a flitting trouble . Most of the strongest quotations which the pessimists make from the great poets and philosophers of ancient and modern times may be explained in this way , and the despairing words which they speak for themselves or for their heroes are not to be taken as professions of faith so much as utterances of emotion . It is not a fair interpretation of the author of the book of Job to quote the sentence , " Let the day perish wherein I was born ; " nor do we do justice to the wisdom of Solomon by taking from the book of Ecciesiastes the words : " Therefore I hated life ; because the work that is wrought under the sun is grievous unto me : for all is vanity and vexation of spirit . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greeks in life itself by harping upon such sayings of Homer and Sophocles and Plato as these : " There is nothing more wretched than man ; " " Not to be born is the most reasonable , but , having seen the light , the next best is to go thither whence one came as soon as possible ; " " If death is the privation of all feeling , a sleep without a dream , what a marvelous gain it is ! " These Greeks none the less rejoiced in life , and sayings like these are but passing shadows upon their sunshine . It is quite a memorable fact that the very year 1818 , which is the date of Leopardi 's acceptance of his gloomy philosophy in the weary solitude of IRecanati , brought Schopenhaner to Italy , after having finished his great work on " The World as Will and as Presentation . " The two men never saw and never probably heard of each other ; yet how they are named throughout the world together , and the delicate Italian is now seen with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Drama of Despair " which the burly German has followed up with his drum and trumpet ! Schopenhaner was then thirty years old . He was born in 1788 , at Dantzic , and passed his youth at Hamburg in the banking-house of his father , a position so little congenial to him that , upon his father 's death , he left it for G*5ttingen and the study of philosophy , then under the instruction of the skeptical professor Ernst Schulze . After a residence at Berlin , and // attending the lectures of Fichte , he wrote his able thesis upon " The Fourfold IRoot of the Principle of the Sufficient Reason , " and he took at Jena , in 1813 , his doctor 's degree . From 1814 to 1818 he lived at Dresden , and there wrote the book upon " The World as Will and as Presentation , " upon which his fame rests and from which he apparently expected immediate notoriety , when he started for Italy in 1818 , leaving his manuscript in the hands of a friend for publication . No such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taught in Berlin in virtual obscurity , doomed to see Hegel , whom he stigmatized as a charlatan , at the head of the philosophical schools . In 1831 he retired to Frankfort , where he died in 1860 , having lived long enough to see the turn of the tide against Hegelianism and the worship of the Idea , and in favor of his own philosophy , which set up the Will as the supreme fact , and assailed the prevailing idealism with a bitterness and wit more acceptable to the mass of readers than the author 's logic . Schopenhauer 's personal characteristics and experience undoubtedly had much to do with his philosophy . He professed to have received his misanthropical temper from his father and his intellectual gifts from his mother , who was a distinguished novelist . His attempt to be a man of business in spite of his tastes for study probably did little to sweeten his disposition , and undoubtedly the view of human nature which he got from the competitions of the market and the pages of the ledger , combined with the skeptical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not lead him to see much sense in the masters of Berlin philosophy who made the world and man depend upon the Idea . To this irascible youth Berlin idealism was all moonshine , arid , cynic as he always was , and given to barking from the outset , he wanted teeth to make him bite , and the teeth that he needed came to him with his theory of " The World as Will and as Presentation . " His philosophy is founded upon Will as the supreme force ; and he belongs to this age of ours which is accepting the reign of Force after its bitter disappointment under the reign of the Idea . Hartmann , who completes the trio of pessimist leaders , came of quite another pedigree ; and in the very interesting and instructive sketch of thirty pages which introduces the volume of studies // which we have placed at the head of this article , he traces his development to the end of the year 1874 . He was born in Berlin in 1842 , the son of a captain of artillery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is somewhat odd that this predestined pessimist claims to have had two mothers , because after her father 's death his mother 's sister came to live with her , and all of the military father 's strictness was needed to offset the petting of the only child by these two kind souls . After a good schooling in literature and in the classics , as well as in music and drawing , the youth at sixteen entered the army of Prnssia , and gave himself to the scientific instruction and the manly discipline required of a soldier . But an accident in 1861 , which lamed his left knee , brought his military career to an end , and toward the close of 1864 he showed the drift of his new experience by beginning his work , " The Philosophy of the Unconscious , " which was finished in 1867 and published in 1869 , and which is the most conspicuous philosophical treatise of our day , and may probably be called with truth the most popular book of metaphysics that was ever published . There is something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his dashing career as a soldier to his quiet chamber , and sometimes for months to his weary bed , that tempts us to explain his gloomy philosophy by his personal disappointment ; yet he disclaims any such inference , and rather ascribes to his forced seclusion his freedom to think without being overpowered by book-learning ; and he finds in his hard-won patience important help in his effort to lighten the gloom of human destiny by resignation and fellow-feeling . He , moreover , utterly denies that his system tends to make men unhappy ; but maintains that it leads them to peace by expecting little good from this world , which is not only the worst that is possible , but the best that is possible ; the only world that is possible , and worse for us than if there had been no world at all . We do him no wrong , therefore , in connecting his experience with his philosophy , as we complete this rapid survey of the personal life of the three pessimist leaders , and add the portrait of the lame soldier of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of the saucy cynic of Frankfort . These men evidently felt the influence of the general tendencies that were acting upon opinion and life in the nineteenth // century , chief among which we specify the decline of church authority , the unsatisfactoriness of speculative philosophy , and the insufficiency of the spirit of trade and luxury , which supplanted the old ambition and loyalty . Take what view that we please of the cause and the cure of the movement , there can be no reasonable doubt of the fact that the old ecclesiastical authority lost its power over the thinking men of the age ; and that sensitive , aspiring souls like Leopardi , who inherited all the religious sentiment of the old Catholic Church and carried its fervor in their very blood , suffered deeply when they found nothing to take the place of the old faith and communion . So profound a thinker as Gioberti goes to the root of the matter when he quotes from St. Augustine the dominant thought under which Leopardi was educated : " Thou hast made us , Lord , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in thee ; " and then speaks of Leopardi 's exposure to the general skepticism of the south of Europe , and to the sway which Locke and Condillac and Dc Tracy wielded over the mind of Italy . He had lost the old belief and worship , and he had not found the new culture and humanity . Put even as great a soul as Dante into his place , and would not he too have been tempted to despair ? Where would the " Divina Commedia " have been , with no true emperor or pontiff to fill out its visions , no hell for the doom of the traitor , and no paradise where the lost Beatrice could lead the enraptured poet to the Queen of Heaven and to the beatific vision of God ? The sickly bard of IRecanati knew the charms of woman only to be scorned or jilted by her ; and he could look up to no gracious Madonna with her incessant watch to comfort him for the fickleness of the pretty girl whose face had driven him mad . He wanted a faith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its place . The age of Dante and of Pascal had gone , and to him the new day-spring had not come . The philosophy that rose in England and Germany , and found disciples in France and in time in Italy , and which sought to give rest in ideal convictions instead of church standards , was not sufficient to meet the wants of the people , or of an important class of thinkers to whom Schopenhaner , the founder of the pessimist system , belonged . The philosophers of Berlin , Fichte , Hegel , and Schelling , gave him little comfort ; and when he published his // first treatise on the Sufficient Reason , and began to study his philosophy of the Will , he laughed at the folly of those schoolmen who were forever prating about ideas in a country which Frederick the Great had created by his sword , and which Napoleon was now conquering by his bayonets . Say what we may of Schopenhaner 's extravagances , we must allow him the credit of seeing , as no other abstract thinker saw , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that Nature herself has no opinions , but deals only with facts and forces , and to a certain extent she plays into the hands of pessimism . If not the devil in a strait-jacket , as Coleridge called her , she is not the gentle , pitying mother that the sentimentalists represent her to be . She has a will , a terrible will , of her own , and she strikes without a word . Hence came a reaction , which for a time took a practical form in the spirit of the 6ourgeoisie , which has been so strong since 1830 under the rule of Louis Philippe and the second emperor , and in Germany since the death of ilegel and Goethe , and in England and America since the rise of the new industries . With all the advantages of this money-making age , there have been limitations and evils , especially the egotism that looks first to its own pocket and its own pleasures , setting up self in over-conscious pride , and ignoring the nation and the race in the luxury of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in enterprise , and its hedonism in the plan of life , goes far to explain the motive and the reason of Hartmann 's philosophy , especially his view of the power of the unconscious , and the folly of pleasure-seeking . To a certain extent Northern Germany has gone with him , in his protest against self-sufficiency and enjoyment , and not without a certain ground has it been said by South German spite that Hartmann is Bismarck in philosophy , and Bismarck is Hartmann in statesmanship . But , in addition to the particular and the general tendencies that have favored the rise of pessimism in our century , there are causes more universal in their character , which concern the root of the matter . If love may be called by eminence the old , old story , sin and death and all evil follow hard upon it , and the great question of all faith and all philosophy is : " What shall we make of the evil in the world and in ourselves , and who will show us the true good ? " The reconcillation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great problem of mankind ; and the nineteenth century , in its search for the absolute , began with a general disposition alike among the people and the philosophers to make light of evil , to give the devil his ticket-of-leave , or to ignore him and the power of darkness utterly , and to enthrone optimism as the creed of liberty and humanity . This roseate view came undoubtedly in part from the new popular freedom which professed to cure the old ills of society by enlightened law and popular education , and in part from the new science which recognized only perfect order in Nature , under the lead of thinkers like Spinoza , the geometric theosophist , who discerned only unerring thought and harmonious extension in the universe ; and like Leibnitz , who put the Newtonian system into theology , and made the music of the spheres chant the theodicy of the world . The optimists of our century have followed in the wake of Spinoza or Leibnitz ; and IRoussean , the democratic apostle of Nature , has in his marvelous eloquence put the doctrine into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rising nations . But Time has been writing sad glosses upon that roseate confession . The ballots and the bullets of democracies have not brought the old evils to an end , and the Utopias of philosophers have not won the calm order of heaven to this troubled world . The new science itself has shown , and is showing , that there is something more than exact geometry and peaceful law in the universe , and the realm of conscious existence is seen to be less peaceful than the unconscious cosmos . The study of organic life , and of the history of Nature and man , has opened our eyes to the existence of warring powers around us ; and poets do not , as fifty years ago , dwell solely upon the beauties and harmonies of the earth . Here is a touch of pessimism from Tennyson 's " Maud , " and he is most hopeful of the new singers : " For Nature is one with rapine , a harm no preacher can heal ; The May-fly is torn by the swallow , the sparrow speared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where I sit , is a world of plunder and prey . " We are puppets , man in his pride and Beauty fair in her flower ; Do we move ourselves , or are we moved by an unseen hand at a game That pushes us off from the board , and others ever succeed ? Ah ! yet we can not be kind to each other here for an hour ; We whisper , and hint , and chuckle and grin at a brother 's shame ; However we brave it out , we men are a little brecd2 ' // Thus poetry in our time acknowledges the existence of the pessimist creed , and illustrates its character and tendency , as a reaction from the prevailing optimism of our ideal leaders . It shows , in its way , the drift of recent thought in its search for the absolute reality , and its disposition to find in impersonal law and unconscious force the inexorable sovereignty which it has ceased to find in the Divine Personality and Providence . The movement is the logical as well as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the universe in place of the worship of God , an effort which began in enthusiasm for Nature as the perfect harmony , and ends in despair at her discord and tyranny , acccording to her new interpreters . II . The cardinal principle of pessimism goes directly against the first instinct of human nature . Human nature , and in fact all Nature , clings to life , while pessimism declares that life in itself is evil , and the end of it , death , is the only redemption . The pessimists say , " Spell Leben , life , backward , and you have Nebel , cloud ; ' * or , to put the same conceit into English , spell live backward , and you have evil . Such is the dreary creed of this school , which teaches what never before has been seriously taught west of the Ganges , and what distances even the founder of Buddhism in its doctrine of despair . Now we can find motives enough to account for the rise of this school , but where is the sufficient reason ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the wretchedness of life , for many have suffered more than he , and yet believed in the Supreme Good , and reasoned out its triumph . Nor does Schopenhaner 's doctrine of the supremacy of Will over Nature and man of necessity teach that life is evil , and under bondage to cruel force , since the Will , as Will , may rule justly and mercifully ; and religion has built its most commanding systems upon the sovereignty of law , the triumph of Almighty Power and Grace . If , as he affirms , music is the most direct expression of the sovereign Will , its voice is not despair , for there is hope in all music , and the saddest Alii8erere implores pardon and offers peace . llartmann least of all implies his pessimism in his philosophical standing-point  --  the doctrine of the Unconscious . Grant that we are surrounded and pervaded by elements and powers outside of our consciousness , why may they not be friendly rather // than hostile ? And is not the fact of the existence of such influences as transcend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have founded their claims to inspiration ? Indeed , a devotee like St. Augustine would delight in Hartmann 's plea for the Unconscious , far more than a calm philosopher like Marcus Antoninus , or an ethical theologian like Pelagius ; and Wesley 's camp-meetings , and Moody 's revival campaigns , have been set on fire by the same idea of influence from outside of consciousness as that which inns through llartmann 's book . That there is , moreover , a power of will and intellect beyond our consciousness is one thing to believe ; and that this power has no consciousness of its own , and that it sets itself against all conscious life , is quite another thing . llartmann claims for his principle of the Unconscious the place in philosophy which the law of gravitation has in physics , and thus he makes himself out to be the Newton of philosophy ; while he gives to Kant , who refers all knowledge to the criterion of reason , the honor of being the Copernicus of philosophy . Why not carry out the parallel ? Why turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so dismal , and so little in keeping with Newton , or with Copernicus and Kant ? It is very evident , however , that the pessimist leaders insist upon connecting their extreme opinions with their primal philosophy of the Will and of the Unconscions . Let ns glance at the most conspicuous of these opinions , and consider the pessimist ideas of the evil work of the Omnipotent Will in creating desire , in raising illusions , and in making of the whole struggle of existence a disappointment at last . Man is born into this world to be tormented by desire , which is a perpetual and unceasing thirst , not satisfied , but intensified , by each pleasure , and agonized by each privation . " The life of man is only a struggle for existence , with the certainty of being conquered . " The ruling Will gives him a never-ceasing will to have what he can not secure , and the result is that pleasure is in itself negative , and pain only is positive ; and , moreover , as intelligence and refinement increase , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calls progress is but the most wretched sense of his misery . Such is the pessimist view of life . It is plain that this theory of desire is full of assumptions and fallacy . It // is not true that will is mere desire , or that desire is an evil . Will is purpose , a healthful native force , that carries satisfaction in its own pulse and movement , so that it is delight for a child to play , and for a man to walk and think and speak , even when no especial object is to be won by the effort . Life , healthful life , is of itself a blessing ; and if a child cries before he laughs , it is not because the little creature has pessimist notions and declines living , but because he finds difficulties in the way of his breathing and feeding , and he insists upon having them removed , and letting him have his full share of air and warmth and food . The will is one of the most majestic attributes of man , and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as strong ; it speaks in the winds that are battles , and in the songs that are victories ; the sculptor carves it upon the brow of his Apollo , and the painter puts it into the frown of St. Michael upon the prostrate dragon , and into the light of the Christ of the Transfiguration . In fact , Schopenhauer here contradicts himself , as he does often , and he takes back in his theory of *esthetics the pessimism of his theory of the will . If , as he says , art is the only heaven , because it gives us the highest truth purged of base and feverish desire , how can there be art without the will-power ; and is it not the essential characteristic of the artist , whether poet , painter , sculptor , musician , or orator , that he must not only see his ideal , but must be able to put it into telling form , and make it tell always ? Has not a truly-cultivated mind , a well-disciplined life , something of this art-power in itself , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and beauty too , not by deadened nature , but by subdued and harmonized desire ? There is of course some truth in what Schopenhaner says of the intense character of pain as compared with average pleasure . To be near starvation is agony , and to eat from day to day is moderate satisfaction in comparison ; yet it must be remembered that to be near starving is not the common lot , and that the pain of hunger is the motive to seeking food , and no small zest to its enjoyment . Then is it not obvious that , in the regular round of a just life , the desires lead to wholesome satisfaction , and what we call our daily bread stands for a precious knowledge , which is by no means negative in itself , and is a great comfort to be remembered , even when its accustomed order is interrupted by // positive pains ? Schopenhauer defines the will alike as a universal power and a human faculty , and he took something of the fatalism and torpor of the Orientals with his Buddhist creed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that castle of indolence ; and Aristotle , its greatest practical thinker , spoke its conviction when he said , " The intellect is perfected , not by knowledge , but by activity . " There is much to be said in behalf of Schopenhaner 's idea that pain is more frequent and intense as culture rises , and that refinement brings peculiar snsceptibility to snifering . Our modern life illustrates this position , especially where it pampers desires instead of nurturing ability , and where its exactions grow as its power dwindles . But this is not true progress , and the happiest men and women are they who have the best and most comprehensive culture , and whose lives have the richest resources of society and books , and whose habits have such range and purpose as to give unity and variety to their days , in that melody of sequence and that harmony of combination that give the charm of art to the economy of labor and enjoyment . Such persons may , like Baring-Gould , say that " it is a high privilege to have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the intellect or the soul , " and that suffering is education , evidence , and sacrifice . Schopenhaner 's description of the illusion to which mankind is subject , under the rule of the universal will , is one of the most striking parts of his book . His idea is , that the will-power strives to keep up the races without any care for the individuals who make up the race . This view of illusion comes to a point in the discussion of sex and the act of generation , which he regards as the original sin and the cause of all evil . The will brings man and woman together by an irrepressible instinct , not for their good , but to keep up the race . The sexual relation , with its comedy of love , he regards as supreme folly , and wrong so far as the parties to it are concerned ; a piece of irony in Nature , who veils her spite in a show of pleasantry , and whose blandest smile is the disguise of a fatal coup de qr6ee . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He thinks this sex secondary to man , with no position apart from him , without original genius , without justice and truth , with ideas as scant as her hair is long ; not , indeed , // without a certain quickness of wit and tenderness of feeling , yet full of hate for her own sisterhood , and making up by deceit and artifice what is lacking in power . He especially dislikes the lady of modern society , and thinks her a mistake and a fraud upon simple womanhood . He evidently had occasion for this cynicism toward the sex that does not believe in pessimism . Women troubled him apparently more by their attractions than he troubled them by his gibes . He apparently knew more of the torment of the instinct than the worth of the affection that brings the sexes together ; and his whole treatment of the subject of marriage is a coarse caricature . His sentences , indeed , are cutting ; but any gentlewoman who looked him in the face , or charmed the social circle by her smile , could cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and by a spiritual charm that he tried to degrade and deny . Hartmann escapes his teacher 's extravagance in this respect ; and , much as he insists upon the illusion of sex , he allows to women the marvelous power of being moved from the charmed sphere of the unconscious , and of charming men and refining them , as their fellow-men themselves can not do . A sufficient answer to the satire upon marriage , as " halving a man 's privileges and doubling his burdens , " and upon love , as the cruel illusion of the universal deceiver , is found in the closing paragraph of Hartmann 's sketch of his own life . It is a picture of his frugal and happy home next the Botanical Garden in Berlin , with his loving wife  --  the intellectual companion of his ideal efforts  --  and his pretty child , playing with a four-footed pet at their feet , and with kindred and friends near by . " If you would see cheerful and contented faces , you must go to these pessimists . " So said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is evident that Leopardi has anticipated Hartmann in his criticism of the three stages of history and life-childhood as in Greece , youth as in the middle ages , maturity as in modern times  --  but to our sober thought there is more satisfaction in the poet 's impassioned portraiture than in the philosopher 's bold and proud analysis . It is not true that in those three stages the search for good has ended only in disappointment , or that disappointment is the only end for those who wish to renew those stages . Childhood always had its own joy , and it still lives and still rejoices . // In fact , is not our race as young as it ever was ; and if our cliiidren sometimes are a little too old in their ways , and sometimes ape their elders , are not the best of our elders children at heart , with not only their own buoyant pulse , but with the best young blood of the whole race bounding in their veins ? That child of the Berlin Botanic Garden is as merry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Homer sing ; and that father who reasons out his gloomy philosophy in a home so full of satisfaction has not only child and wife to make him young , but the whole inheritance of the world 's undying culture to cheer him up , especially the thought and soul of immortal Greece , which Germany inherits , to give him joy . Greece lived into the middle ages , and it went , in the spirit of Paul and the mind of John , into the best life of the Catholic Church , and is there still in the sense of sonship , that is essential to all spiritual and Catholic faith . This faith , too , survives in our modern culture , and , if the belief in the immortal life has undergone changes , it has not died out ; while in many quarters it keeps its own form and fervor , in other spheres of thought it has not lost light and power by losing gloom , and making the hereafter more to be hoped than feared . Nay , the most serious and promising social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Greece with the faith of Christendomand asks men to c&amp;5perate in work in the name of their common brotherhood , and in the light of the Eternal Reason and Love as well of the Eternal Word and Spirit . There are , indeed , some ugly spots in the survey of those three stages of human experience ; but there is no slough of despair , no wall that blocks the way onward . The fathers of those three ages are still with the race , and Plato and Aristotle , Augustine and Charlemagne , Franklin and Goethe , and their peers , still lead the race forward . Perhaps Goethe , among the authors of our century , in his calm wisdom as well as his ideal beauty , best answers the pessimist 's dark vision of our coming civilization ; and his " Faust , " especially its second part , is the best commentary on the temptations and the triumphs of our age . Not the old learning or the new lust , not the study of Natnre or of art , not diplomatic shrewdness or self-righteous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generous humanity and filial faith , must solve the problem of the future , give peace on earth , and grace from heaven , as in the old man Faust , who // died true to the last , and escaped the clutches of the pessimist devil . It is odd that , in some respects , Schopenhauer , the most aggressive and crabbed of pessimists , goes more into the clouds of mystery than any of our romantic poets or visionary socialists , and that he believes in what he calls magic with a light that can penetrate space , and a will that can set distance at naught , and , by contact with the Supreme Will , make itself felt in all worlds . Men with more heart and soul than he will not believe as much as this without believing a great deal more , and hoping and loving more . llartmann , too , has his share of mysticism , and his doctrine of the Unconscious keeps a certain hold of the ages of faith . As Mr. Sully says , " llartmann is largely read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " So Jerusalem is not dead , nor Athens either , in these new Titans who are trying to break up the old world . III . As to the probable influence of pessimism upon the thought and action of our age , there will be quite various opinions , and already we discover signs of antagonist schools of philosophy and literature within thi* movement . Yet there can be no doubt that the movement falls in with some conspicuous and important tendencies of our times . People have been somewhat fast of late all over the world ; and the fall of financial values , and the decay of dignities , have brought with them a decline in the very sense of value itself ; a misgiving not only of the worth of goods , but of the reality of good itself ; in fact , a question whether anything is worth striving for , and life itself is worth living . In both cases undue inflation has brought about the extreme depression ; and men have come to loss and to grief because they marked their property too high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ families too high expectations . Therefore , the creed that finds disappointment in the very nature of things is , in some respects , a comfort , dismal though it may be , in these dark days , and the unhappy are relieved by being told that their case is not exceptional , but normal ; and the fault is not in themselves , or their particular stars , but in the structure of society , and the nature of man , in the constitution of the universe , and in all the stars that shine , or that have ceased to shine . We meet this disposition among croakers all over the world ; and even matter-of // fact England has a rising brood of these frogs of Aclieron , who are not sorry that others are in the mud with them . So great a name as Carlyle makes some of this poor music at times ; and Mr. Grey , in his " Rocks Ahead , " utters a fearful wail over the prospects of the faith , the industry , and the wealth , of England . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so far as it cautions men against over-sanguine anticipations , rash adventures , and romantic visions , and leads them to recognize the limitations of their own intelligence and power in the facts of Kature , and the vanities and vices of their fellow-men . It is well for the sentimental who think that it is enough to mean well , and that a good heart is sure to triumph , to be told that he who means well , and yet does not see his way clearly , is sure to go where the road which he has mistaken leads him , even if to ruin of fortune and health . It is proper too for idealists to be told that there is will as well as thought in true wisdom and success , and that they are poor leaders who see the right way and have no force or means to go , and to lead others there ; or who do not know how much time and opportunity tell upon every plan and work of man . A little leaven of pessimism might have helped our people fifteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them their Utopias of progress , and asking them to make money by manufacturing promises to pay it ; and our over-eager optimists might have kept back the defiance that has brought the wreck of a million lives and countless millions of money , to say nothing of the general demoralization of business , politics , and society . The fire-eaters of the South , the star-gazers of the East , and the manifest-destiny men of the West , all were possessed with the same optimism ; and if the leaders were to live their lives over again they would see the worst before , instead of after , the evil day . The result need not have been acceptance of persistent wrong , but vindication of the right under more deliberate legislation , and more comprehensive and conciliating principles and policy . The conspicuous reforms of the day need the same caution ; and it is safe to assure the enthusiasts who expect to dismiss all poverty and all intemperance by ballot or legislation , that Evil is a tough old visitor , and he is not likely to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a day or a generation . In fact , what we need as much as anything is a // serious and searching and thorough-going review of things as they are , with all the help of science , the arts , education , and morality ; and if pessimists can best hold the mirror up to the sin and shame of what we call our civilization , let us thank them for doing it . But of course we are to distinguish between their just criticism and their dogmatic dictation . Their philosophy may be much at fault , while their facts and illustrations may be just and wholesome . We may find satisfaction in Schopenhauer 's statement of the primacy of the will-element in the universe , without regarding this will as a blind force , or thinking that the whole problem of causation is solved merely by summing all the forces of Nature , and the desires , volitions , and purposes of men , and the power of the Almighty , under one little word of four letters , in a brevity which may be the soul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mark of folly or the trick of pride . We may be grateful to llartmann for pointing out so strongly what so many sages of Nature and the soul have indicated , that our conscious life is in a great degree dominated from a source beyond our consciousness , without thinking that the word unconscious is enough to explain all the facts that it is used to designate ; and surely without accepting his rash assumption that the power which acts outside of our consciousness must therefore have no consciousness of its own-an inference as false as to infer that because the organ is played by a hand of which it is unconscious , therefore the player must be as unconscious as the organ which he plays . Certainly this is a strange turn of the theory of Agnosticism , and its idea of the Absolute . Instead of saying that we can not know God , it says that the Supreme Being can not know us or itself , and must be of necessity impersonal and unconscious , a position which certainly can not be proved , and which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then , too , we must not forget the utter mistake of pessimism in its scheme for the redemption of mankind from misery by the ceasing of the will to live and the annihilation of existence . Whether this scheme is to be carried out , as with Schopenhauer , by personal asceticism in its calm absorption into nothingness , or , as with Hartmann , by a grand combination of the race to will itself out of willing and out of existence , the absurdity is essen // tially the same . Mankind would not do this if they could , and they could not do it if they would . They like in the main to live , and they waut bread and beef , not death and nothingness , to give them comfort ; for even their vices are faults of vitality , not of deadness , and they love strong drink because it seems to give them spirit , not because it may lay them dead , or as if dead , by excess . A French physician ascribes the pessimism of Germans to the use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart ; yet the beer-drinker drinks for pleasure , and he also smokes for enjoyment , however unwisely . Then , moreover , what is more evident than that if men could cheat the blind power that compelled them into conscious being , and will themselves out of it , that same blind power would probably repeat the old wrong and will them back into being again , or create another , perhaps a more cursed race ? The whole tone of this system is degrading as it is disheartening ; and , proud as its leaders are of their ethics of resignation and compassion , they strike at the root of ethics by striking at the idea of right and duty under supreme justice . While they make light of pleasure , and deny that it can hold its own in comparison with pain , they really exalt pleasure above virtue by denying that there is anything to live for in the face of suffering , and by maintaining that it is best to go out of existence , because we can not have a good time by staying in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creed of despair will inspire the mass of men with any exalted resignation , or still the rage of communists , by its assertion of the wretchedness of the rich as well as of the poor . Sakyamuni might persuade the mild people of India to wait for the Nirvana of oblivion , but the mob of Europe and America are not of that passive temper . They want money and meals , and they will not be led to seek them by gentle or by just means , by being taught that blind Will rules the universe , or that whatever reason there is in Nature is unconscious and serves blind Will , and that there is no hope but in death . Pessimism may be the white flag of peace and resignation to the dreamy thinker , but it is the black flag of blood and booty to the ignorant and the wretched , and not only to them but to the well-to-do workman who may be led to believe what this system falsely // teaches , that labor itself is an evil , and it is better to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view of this philosophy of despair , however , it is well to remember that the great ages of faith and regeneration have been accompanied by an intense sense of existing evils , and have not been times of cheerfulness and prosperity . The Christian civilization sprang np in a dark time , when the old faiths were decaying , and the might of Rome threatened to crush the life of nations , and the worst superstitions were seeking to supplant the falling idols and to fill the deserted shrines . Among these superstitions there are traces of the Buddhism that is now appearing in the high places of modern thought and life . Why not look for a triumph of good as decided as the threatening evil , a new Christendom iu this new IRome of money and pleasure , luxury and misery , which so invites enthusiasm and tempts despair ? There is evil enough to make pessimists of those who see nothing else . Is there not good enough to overcome that evil by the only true optimism , the faith and the purpose that see a divine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to its standard , and learn by faithful service the secret that philosophy fails to teach ? It has been well said that as the electric spark turns the flaming oxygen and the torpid nitrogen into vital air , thus the true fire so joins the good with the evil in the world as to make the reconciliation a triumphant redemption . Perhaps , with health of body and of mind , with comprehensive service and brave faith and manhood , we may see some such sequel to the pessimism of the nineteenth century .
