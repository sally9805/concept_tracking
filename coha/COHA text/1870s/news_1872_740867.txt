txt The Erie Ring is making a desperate fight . Its present point of attack is the Committee of the lower House of the Legislature . We do not now say that it has carried this Committee , but it is believed that a majority of the Committee is relied on to report " Husted 's bill , " or some similar one , instead of Mr. O'BitiEzi 's bill , for the repeal of the Classification act . If this be correct , the boast of the Erie lobby , that the Ring owns a majority of the present Legislature . will be so far confirmed . The Erie Ring has had large experience in the ownership of men . holding trusts from the public . It has seen its seal set on Judges , on members of the Bar , on Senators and Assemblymen , on jurors , referees and District Attorneys , and it has still enough stolen property in its bands to buy more . But we warn members of the Legislature , who are preparing to sell out to the Ring , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bargain as now . They may get their price , but it is not their votes alone that they sell . They part with all title to the confidence of honest men , and it will be very strange if the people fail to remember them . If it should turn out that the Ring can get the " Hosted bill " through the Committee , then we hope that the minority will insist on presenting a report , and that the question may be brought up for discussion in the open House , and receive a full exposure . It only needs a fair comparison of the bills to see in whose interest they are respectively drawn . The O'Brien bill , as it is known , is thorough ; the Husted bill is a mere subterfuge . The one presents solid security for the rights of shareholders in providing a practical method for them to obtain control of their property , and calls in the aid of the Chief Justice of the Court of Appeals , ( a Democrat , by the way , ) and of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the election for directors . The other presents no such guarantee . We submit that it is not difficult to divine which of these bills the Erie Ring would prefer , and that one is the one *that every honest member of the Legislature ought to vote down . It is not our fault that any member who does not vote the right way will lay himself open to suspicion . It is the fault of the facts . Some cases are too plain for argument , and the case of the desperate rascality of the Erie Ring is one of these . Whatever it touches it defiles , and . for the honest public servant there is only one safe course  --  to have none of it . The Erie Board of Directors wish to keep in power . They can do so in spite of the repeal of the Classification act , by the fraudulent use of stock which does not belong to them , but which is in their control on account of their refusal to transfer it . The Husted bill allows this perpetuation of stolen power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Legislature chooses to vote for the former , knowing the character of the Erie Board , ? its notorious jobbery , its lawlessness , and corruption ? he must take the consequences . He will be judged bythe company he keeps , and the community will rank him with the host of minor chattels , purchased at various prices for various purpose by the Gould Ring , with the money stolen from the Erie shareholders .
