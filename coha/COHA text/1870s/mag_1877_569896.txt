ARTICLE TIH. - HORACE BUSHNELL . Isaiah vi , 5-8. 5 . Then said I , Woe is me , for I am undone ; because I am a man of unclean lips , and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips ; for mine eyes have seen the King , the Lord of hosts . 6 . Then flew one of the seraphim unto me , having a live coal in his hand , which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar . I. And he laid it upon my mouth and said , Lo , this hath touched thy lips ; and thine iniquity is taken away and thy sin purged . 8 . Also I heard the voice of the Lord saying , Whom shall I send and who will go for us ? Then said I , Here am I ; send me . THESE words indicate my theme . In commemorating our honored and beloved friend and distinguished alumnus , I propose to sketch his character and his career , only so far as they illustrate what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That Horace Bushnell was in many respects a great man , no one doubts who knows anything of his person or his works . But perhaps few of us are aware how much his greatness and his power were owing to the transforming energy of his faith . It is to deepen your impressions of this truth , that I ask you to follow me in the tribute of love and honor , which I would pay to his memory . He was born in a grave but gentle household , in which plain living and high thinking taught him the first and best lessons of life . His father , though fixed in his opinions , was courteous in his ways , and his mother though notable in household industries , was fond of books , and refined in her tastes and culture . The home of his childhood and youth was in a stern but picturesque region , being nestled on a pleasant slope at the foot of a broad-backed hill which stretches a mile upward and westward till it introduces the traveler to a smooth and rounded summit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from it , you can see more than one other distant church , each sitting on its own hilltop . Near by was the parsonage in which President Day was born and bred , whose father was the long remembered pastor . Very near Dr. Bushnell 's home is one of the finest mountain // lakes in Connecticut , to which he was devoted in boating and fishing in his boyhood . A lonely rock rises directly from its border on the east , on the summit of which some scholar or witling had long ago traced a few enormous Hebrew letters . From this " pinnacle " one looks down upon the lake and far away over all the neighboring townships . On one occasion , I chanced to meet Dr. Bushnell at the foot of this rock ; we climbed slowly up and ran quickly down as he had been wont to do in his youth . As we stood upon the top , he remarked , that he found every time when he reviewed this landscape , that his eyes had in the interval become better educated to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the poet 's sensibility and the self-analysis of the philosopher , as well as the loyalty of the man to the scenes of his boyhood sports and joys . The community in which Dr. Bushnell was trained was made up of sturdy men , who were about equally interested in education , religion , politics , and thrift . Their peculiar way of life has been well delineated by himself in his " Age of * a charming picture and vindication of the old New England life . The bracing climate and rocky but vigorous soil made these men and women somewhat severe in aspect and self-reliant in character ; but intelligence and hospitality brightened their family life , while an earnest Christian piety refined their feelings and purified their lives . Farming was their chief occupation , though an active business in excavating and sawing marble brought many of the people into contact with other towns . In this community Dr. Bushnell spent his youth . He was a strong , resolute , practical and kindly boy , a leader and a favorite , yet remarkably free from little vices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years he was self-reliant and self-asserting . At the age of fifteen he attended the academythen recently opened-into which the master had introduced the monitorial system . This was maintained for a while , but when it became Bushnell 's turn to serve as monitor he refused , saying , that he came to school to study for himself and not to watch others . The system was soon abandoned . Soon after this he became somewhat skeptical in his religions views and joined an infidel club in a neighboring town-at the head of // which was a hard-headed Deist of the type of Paine-whereupon his father interposed his authority and refused to assist him in a college education , and he remained for some time in his father 's domestic cloth works . Subsequently , in 1821 , he became decided in his Christian faith and profession and was fitted for college , and entered , in 1823 , at the age of twenty-one . In college he was mature in every way . Even his peculiar style of writing had assumed some of the features which it never lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the class-room . The ambition of his later years impelled him to excel in every form of activity whether intellectual or physical . He was behind no one in athletic feats . But his position as a Christian was nearly nominal . While he attended the communion services , the growing spirit of doubt which he had so early cherished took strong possession of his mind as he advanced in college life . But scarcely a word of this escaped him . He undermined the faith of no man . He was disposed to check rather than further vicious tendencies in any of his younger classmates . His conscientiousness was scrupulous , his integrity of the sternest kind , his honor was the truest and noblest . Even when he was the leader of a foolish college rebellion-for which he and his associates were sent home-he took pains to acknowledge his folly and rashness to one of the youngest of the class , who did not join the movement , and bade him " not mind what the fellows said to him but to hold up his head , for he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong . " He graduated in 1827 at the age of twenty-five . His oration at commencement attracted general attention for the boldness of thought and the freshness of its style and led to an engagement after a few months as an assistant editor upon the Journal of commerce , then recently established . In this occupation he was eminently successful , but he left it after a year 's trial and came to New Haven to study law , with the design of entering upon this profession as an introduction to public and political life in what was then called the west . Being invited to become a tutor in this college , he was persuaded to accept the offei , against his own wishes and decision , by the counsel of his mother . As a tutor he was the same strong-hearted , self-asserting man that he had always been , and devoted himself to his // work and to his pupils with a manly and quickening sympathy . It was while he was tutor that there occurred the most important crisis of his life . Early in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religious revival . It affected officers and students alike , leaving none unmoved . It was emphatically sober , serious , and earnest , leading every man to enquire concerning the reasons of his faith or his want of faith , and constraining almost every man to make his faith a supreme and living power over his character and life . Of the six tutors then in the Faculty , three had been pronounced in their adhesion to Christ and three were not . Among the latter was Horace Bushnell , known to himself and to his pupils as unsettled in respect to every point of religious belief , if not a positive rejector of the Christian revelation . As the movement proceeded , two of his fellow tutors yielded to its power and threw themselves into active sympathy and labor for the welfare of their pupils . Bushnell stood alone , apparently unaffected , and his division with him , indifferent if not contemptuous with respect to all that was going on . His associates did not dare to approach him . The silence was broken by himself as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get out of this woe . Here am I what I am , and these young men are hanging to me in their indifference amid this universal earnestness . " He announced what he would do , that he would invite them to meet him and would define his position to them and declare to them the decision which they ought to take with himself . The result was as might have been expected . The division was dissolved in tears and fixed in earnest resolve . Many of these young men remember that interview as the turning point of their lives . For many , if not all of them , it was a far easier thing to believe and obey the gospel than it was for him , entangled as he was with the self-reliant and dishonest doubts of years . Indeed , the only decision which he could announce at that time was that he would seek after God , if so be he might find Him . Even then he scarcely knew whether there was a God , or whether he was responsible to God , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christ and salvation // by him he had no settled opinions . But one thing he knew and felt to the very depths of his soul-that the position of ' contemptuous indifference and satisfied uncertainty in which he had lived for years , was wholly without excuse ; that his confident unbelief was false and hollow , because it was in no sense a rational and final conviction ; and therefore he resolved that an end should come to this position at once and forever . He used all the energy of his resolute will in the purpose , that if there were a God he would find Him , and if God had spoken to man he would know it . He consecrated this purpose by prayer to the living God for guidance and light . He followed this consecration of himself to the as yet unknown God , by avowing his position to his pupils and his associates . He at once frequented their meetings for prayer . For weeks he was a searcher for truth , now seeming to get a firm foothold and anon losing every standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Christ shone into his mind , and his strong and hitherto self-sufficing heart was filled with wonder and joy , at the glory of God , as revealed in the face of Jesus Christ . As he read , and studied , and thought with unabated hunger and thirst after truth , he found rest and peace-yet at first not uniformly . As some new aspect of Christian truth , or some unthought of difficulty presented itselg his mind was shaken . Again and again was he called to struggle and grope and feel after God . On one occasion he came into the room of a friend , threw himself into a chair , and thrusting both his hands into his black hair , broke out half desparingly and yet laughingly , " Oh ! what shall I do with these arrant doubts I have been nursing for years . When the preacher touches the Trinity and when logic shatters it in pieces , I am all at the four winds . But I am glad I have a heart as well as a head . My heart wants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart wants the Holy Ghost ; my heart says the Bible has a Trinity for me and I mean to hold by my heart . I am glad a man can do it , when there is no other mooring , and so I answer my own question , what shall I do ? ' but that is all I can do yet . ' This memorable utterance , which came glowing from his own struggling soul , is the keynote of his subsequent history . It interprets his theory of Christian Theology . It explains scores of his sermons . It lets // us into his inmost thoughts . It shows the reader of his most characteristic writings , at what cost of painful misgivings he learned to b*lieve and teach . He fought his doubts and gathered strength . He would not make his judgment blind , He faced the spectres of the mind And laid them ; thus he came at length To find a stronger faith his own ; And power was with him in the night , Which makes the darkness and the light And dwells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the cloud . When at last he believed , and as long as he believed , he believed with all his heart . When he came into the daily meetings of his associates , " was there ever such a child " - writes one of their number , " as this strong , self-reliant , repelling man of twenty-nine years ? " On the first occasion of his presence " the conversation turned upon the desirable posture in prayer , and it set our hearts flowing to hear that voice , hitherto so full of command in opinion and action , quivering with the words : Well , there is one posture settled for me at any rate , flat on the floor , alone with Jesus . ' " As might be expected Dr. Bushnell threw all his manhood into his new life . He labored at once to bring his pupils into the same purposes with himself . I remember well how patiently he reasoned and how affectionately he pleaded with one of the most gifted young men I ever knew , who had been as bold in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and withal grossly wicked in his life . As his faith began so it proceeded to the end of his days . It was founded upon conviction . He accepted the gospel because he believed it to be true . He accepted it as true because he had known his own wants , and its power to relieve them . He did not love Christianity , nor Christ himself better than the truth ; but he loved Christ because he was to him the truth . He looked upon his face with a searching and steady eye and when Christ met his gaze with an answering look he answered , " My Lord and my God . " Nor did he fear to look a second time nor a third at the grounds of his faith . Every new assailant of Christ 's claims found in him an open and candid // hearer . The infidelity which first took possession of his mind was the old infidelity of the last century , which rejected the supernatural Christ . because of its own superfic*al views of man s capacities and man 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of perfbction and its flat and prosaic explanations of the Christian history . He tried this by the test of his honest conscience and his conscious needs . His own sense of manhood , of duty and of God could not be satisfied with the needs of man which this infidelity assnmed and the version of Christ which it supplied , and he therefore abandoned it in the name of God and of the truth . It was some years after this that the new infidelity of Strauss and Theodore Parker presented its theories and urged its arguments . He studied these most carefully and did not hesitate thoroughly to re-consider the grounds of the faith which he had preached . I well recollect lending him a pamphlet of . twenty pages , which he returned to me , saying it kept him awake and almost in agony for one long night . In the same spirit he became conversant with the various types of unbelief which have followed each other in rapid succession for the last thirty-five years . He did not profess nor care to be a learned scholar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He did not wait to be a subtle or erudite metaphysician in order to answer the modern versions of atheism , pantheism , and " the unknowable God , " which have of late held the public ear . He did not stay till he was an accomplished geologist or zoologist before he decided upon the question whether it was an hypostatized abstraction called evolution or the living God which " in the beginning created the heavens and the earth . ' lie did not panse to study Chinese or Sanscrit before he should decide the question whether the Christian Bible is so much superior to the teachings of Con flicius or Sankhya-Muni , as to warrant the reception of its claims . That he did not despise science or learning as suchis evident , in that he was eager to learn the best results of both . That he did not wait till he should master either before he decided what he should believe , was because he had such clear and earnest convictions concerning the place of both God and man in the universe , concerning man 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man 's guilt , and concerning man 's // helplessness and God 's pity , that when he read the story of God in Christ reconciling the world to himself he did not care to inquire further of Strauss or Parker , of iR6nan or Darwin , of Spencer or Huxley , of Tyndall or Stuart Mill , in order to decide whether this Christ was from God . And yet he was always ready to hear what these men had to say . He found them aids rather than hindrances to his faith , because they so manifestly left out of their reasonings the weightiest elements , and even then differed from one another 50 widely and labored so heavily with the theories and explanations which they urged , that whatever else might be true , he knew their conclusions were false . It was neither from ignorance nor weakness that , while hewas eager to read the speculations of the very newest and latest writers who exalt atheism into the holiest religion and hallow the denial of immortality with the semblances of that worship and prayer which they prove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pitying , half indignant scorn . He was a bold thinker because he sought for the truth . Near the end of his life , he said playfully , to one of his friends , as the two were fishing in the wildei'ness , " It is my joy to think that I have sought most earnestly and supremely to find and to live by the truth . " He was broad-minded and manysided , because he would look at the truth from every point of view . He was careless of traditions because he sought solid standing place for his own feet . He was independent of others , because he must satisfy the consuming hunger of his own soul . When he found the truth he a'pplied it fearlessly to himself and to other men , to principles , institutions , and dogmas . He abhored shams and conventional phrases in argument , because he believed so strongly in realities . What offended others as irreverent , often-not always-betokened his higher reverence for what he received as positive truth . He was also manly in the expression and defense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the sanctuary of his inner self there ever dwelt a prayerful , magnanimous , loving spirit toward God and man . The same type of faith was manifest in his interpretations and expositions of Christian truth . To many he seemed fanciful , rash , and mistaken in his theories of some of the most important doc // trines of Christian Theology . I do not care to ask whether he were or not . I am not here as a defender or critic of his opinions , nor do II care to discuss his theory of theology as a science . Upon many of these points I have expressed and defended my dissent from his teachings . But for this reason I am the more desirous to declare that I believe him to have been impelled in all his speculations by the supreme purpose so to set forth the truth in Christ as to make it a commanding and renewing power over the lives and characters of men . It was unfortunate for his influence and his reputation , that he was not a better instructed and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was equally unfortunate that he had so little respect for the formulas of theological doctrine and the history of their development , and in general for a logical thelogy when it interfered with or contradicted his own opinions . Many of his interpretations must seem fanciful and violent to any well instructed scholar , even though he may admit the reach and elevation of his conception of the truths , and mo tives which give the New Testament its power . His contemptuous defiance of logic when it made against himself , did not deter him from using it with masterly effect , as against his critics and antagonists . F or theology as a pure science he cared but little - neither for the history of its doctines nor the constructions of its formulas . He was in no sense of the word a trustworthy exegete , although some of his interpretations are like flashes of genius . But he did desire that God the Father , the Son , and the Spirit shouki rule in the hearts of all men , and that the incarnate Christ should dispel their fears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death . He did desire that the teachings of the Scriptures should enter as living forces into the being of the living men about him , and thoroughly transform the thinking and the feeling of the present generation . It was for these reasons that , as he interpreted the voice of Christ to the church of the present day concerning the formulated theology of the past , it sounded thus : " Let the dead bury their dead , but come thou and follow Me . " That such were his supreme motives with some admixture of human infirmities , I desire to aver , standing by the grave that has received him so lately from our sight and following his manly and heroic soul // to the Christ in whom he believed and for whose honor he " kept the faith . " Such was the Christian faith of Dr. Bushnell . What did it do for him ? By nature he was a gifted man . His self-reliance and self-assertion were founded upon the consciousness of insight and power . His intellect was quick , sagacious , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a poet 's heart for man . He loved the earth and the sky , the mountains and the sea , the laughing spring , the solemn winter , the song of birds , and the roaring of the tempest . He sympathized with a genuine man whenever he found him , the simple , honest , loving , kind-hearted , noble-souled man in the plainest of speech and the humblest of garbs . He delighted to contrive and invent ; he had a heart for adventure and the stomach for a fight . Above all he had that subtle gift of affluent and creative imagination which men call genius , by which he could find analogies and illustratjons faster than he could use them , and invest the most familiar truths with novel fascinations , and embellish the tritest of common places by a startling picture , or embody a whole argument in a single word or phrase . He was a born leader of men ; always aggressive ; not infrequently rude and rough in speech ; but as tiuly kindly in thought and feeling , and noble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirited . He was fruitful in generous and far-reaching plans for the hamlet in which he sojourned for a summer , or the distant state whose growth he delighted to watch , or the city to which he gave his heart , or the nation whose honor always moved his soul , or the two Asiatic Empires that have so strangely and so recently brought their sons to our colleges and our homes . He was indeed a gifted man and a man of mark and power . In view of these manifold gifts we repeat the question-what did his Christian faith do for him ? We answer with confidence , it made him ten , nay , a hundred-fold more of a man than he otherwise would have been . It transfigured and harmonized his excellences , and it softened and dwarfed his defects . Had he gone forth into life without the faith which inspired his genius , he would doubtless have made his mark in the world . He would in some sort have achieved success . His VOL . XXXVI. ii // genius and generosity and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At the bar , through the press , or in political life , he would have compelled his fellow-men to hear him . Possibly his special defects might never have been so far repressed as not to have hindered his highest success . It is hazardous to conjecture what he might have been . It is safe to contemplate what he actually became . We notice first that his Christian faith did not interfere with his individuality . Not a few persons seem to think that if they consecrate themselves to Christ they must nail their individuality to the cross . For this reason some refuse to *believe altogether ; others hold back their whole-hearted zeal in Christ 's service . Their mistake proceeds from an inexcusable ignorance of Christ 's teachings or from a miserable perversion of His words by priests and bigots . It is the old man-that is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts-which is to be crucified . : Jt is the new man into which the believer is to be transformed , and this new man is simply the individual self that has room to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . It was certainly true of Dr. Bushnell that the more of a Christian he became the more individual he was . Everything that was characteristic of him flourished in the sunshine of his faith . If Christ was his , everything was his , and most of all his living self . His faith increased his energy . It stimulated his imagination . It gave it form and power . Before his new life of faith began , the poet in him was scarcely known to himself . But after his eye was opened to those inspiring realities , which engirdle and penetrate this world of sense , he found himself possessed of a poet 's imagery and a poet 's fervor . His literary resources were enlarged a hundred-fold by the elevating power of his faith . His faith also increased his joy in nature . It softened his heart toward man and kindled and sustained his public spirit . It justified his ardent hopefulness in human progress by his faith in the resources that are provided for man in Christ , and in the possibilities , nay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activity as it warranted the hopefulness in which his sanguine nature rejoiced . It increased his sympathy with men , making him more brilliant in conversation and more genial in society . No more decisive proof of // this can be named than the quiet but kindly humor which was constantly bubbling forth in the extreme weakness of the later years of his life , and brought many a ripple of sunshine in scenes where jests and humor never dare to appear , except Christ is very near and very precious . It gave to his protracted and heroic struggle for life the charm of a slow but cheerful sunset , such as gives the certain tokens of a brighter morning . So much did the Christian faith do for him as a man . We ask next , what did it enable him to achieve for others ? What of power and influence did it give him among his fellow men ? and we replyFirst of all , it gave him zeal and ardor in his profession as a preacher . His faith i n Christ was so earnest and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work of commending Christ to his fellow men . His sermons and his pastoral activities represented the best work that he could do . While he sought to be understood and felt by his people , he also sought to educate them up to his own conceptions and aims . Hence his instructions exerted a positively stimulating influence upon earnest and receptive hearers , and were to such a molding and educating power . He sought to be thoroughly alive to the actual thinking and living of those about him , that he might interpret Christ in such a way as to meet their wants and to move their hearts . He entered with all his heart into the social and family life of his people , and into the ordinances and appliances of the Christian church , that he might unite both in a noble and quickened Christian life . He did not make orations instead of sermons ; he was far too much in earnest for that , but by reason of his earnest faith , his sermons became noble orations through the force of the irrepressible convictions which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works to his generation was his Essay upon Christian Nurture , which came of his desire as a pastor , that the family life of his people should be so supremely Christian , that every child should need no conscious conversion . This simple practical treatise embodies a profound and sagacious philosophy and exemplifies most happily how the Christian ministry may task and reward the noblest gifts when these are used for practical results . Many of his published discourses have strengthened the faith and elevated the life of not // a few gifted men and women wherever in the world the English language is spoken . Their power to do this is not in their rhetoric nor their imagery . It is not explained by their soaring and somewhat ambitious diction , nor their startling wordpictnres , but by the earnest spiritual convictions and the exalted conceptions of Christ and the Christian life which are embodied in winged and fervent speech . In spite of not a little strained diction and incoherent imagery and occasional forced conceits , the deep spiritual earnestness of the man and his fervent reverence for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give to these sermons permanent interest and power . It is no slight achievement for a man to have ushered into the world quickening forces like these-beginning to act while he lives , and going on after he is dead . Next it gave him power to understand and meet the wants of thinking men in his generation . One of the best services which he rendered to them was his defence of supernatural Christianity , and the supernatural Christ , against the unbelief of the times . His own struggles after faith had prepared him to appreciate many of the difficulties of modern unbelief . His wide-reaching sympathies and catholic temper preserved him from any narrowness of treatment , or ignorance of the occasions of doubt , or want of sympathy with the temper of the times . He was a lover of nature , and sym. pathised most ardently with the promises and the achievements of modern science . Though least of all a proficient , and scarcely a neophyte in any single department of physics , he was fully alive to , and in hearty accordance with all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the materialistic denials of the present hour had been heard of , he predicted the oncoming conflict between science and faith . He felt the storm in the atmosphere which was to gather every minor current into one central vortex of strife , between nature and the supernatural , between matter and spirit , between law and miracle , between force and God , between culture and Christ . Long before the extreme necessity seemed to have come , he prepared and delivered a series of lectures which he afterwards published , but which when first delivered were so premature as scarcely to be understood . That he anticipated // the coming need does credit to his sagacity ; that he met it so successfully is a tribute to his power . Whatever weaknesses there are in his " Nature and the Supernatural , " it contains one of the noblest essays in the language in its chapter on the character of Jesus . The power of this work is not chiefly in its diction , nor in its imagery , nor in its analysis , nor in its reasoning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather in the fervent faith of the writer in the principles which the Christian revelation assumes , and in the truths and the facts which the Christian history declares . No merely sensational preacher or hair-split. ting theologian , or learned commentator , no profound philosopher , or astute logician ; no one but a whole-souled hero of the Christian faith could have written that work . It shows on every page the evidences of his own personal conflicts with the insidious and pretentious unbelief of the times , as truly and distinctly as the battered spear and the dinted shield which the warrior hangs in hall or temple is a speaking memorial of desperate struggles for his own life . That it is a book of great intellectual power and sagacity no one who reads it would be disposed to deny , that it has made a strong impression for good no one who is acquainted with its history will question . Not a few men of mark in the kingdom and service of Christ in all the English-speaking world have expressed their thankful obligations for the help which it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and power and usefulness of this book are largely to be ascribed to the energy and glow of the faith of its author . While the energetic faith of Dr. Bushnell not only strengthened the faith of many , it also elevated and liberalized their conceptions of the Christian life . The faith of not a few preachers and writers seems narrow in proportion as it is strong . The example of many earnest Christian men has almost hardened into the maxim , " To be spiritually minded is to be morose and consorious or ascetic , " or what is far worse , " a glowing zeal for Christ may be set over against injustice and discourtesy towards man . " IDr . Bushnell 's life and teachings were strongly in the opposite direction . His own manhood was in the main noble and magnanimous . Whatever defects were natural to his strong self-assertion he gradually if slowly outgrew . Otherwise he was exceptionally generous , courteous , // affectionate , and frank , and alive to every noble impulse and aspiration . His conceptions of Christian manhood were exalted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspiration toward whatever things are honest , or true , or just , or pure , or lovely , or of good report . Some of his sermons are unsurpassed expositions of the ethics which are characteristically Christian . The sagacity and effectiveness of these teachings and incitements were all explained by the entireness and positiveness of his faith in Christ as the example and inspiration of Christian manhood for the loftiest and lowliest relations of life . The faith of Dr. Bushnell enabled him to render an important service to the cause of tolerance andeatholicity . He came upon the stage of thought and action just after the crisis of a stirring theological controversy . Its surges had scarcely began to subside when he became the occasion and the hero of another . It was by no abrupt or violent transition , however , that the community and Dr. Bushnell proceeded froni the one controversy to the other . The discussions of the first circled around man 's responsibility and God 's sincerity , the nature and extent of sin , the nature and reality of God 's moral administration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the gospel for man 's redemption . The authors most earnestly studied were Edwards and Butler , Locke , Reid , and Stewart , and the commentators of the new exegetical or historical school . After this controversy was well advanced , and the new generation had became familiar with its discussions , the writings of Coleridge began to be read in this country , and the philosophy of Germany gradually lifted its mysterious form from across the sea , half repulsive and half attractive , but ever challenging curiosity and compelling investigation . Carlyle , too , began to be read in here and there a paper strange in dialect and more strange in import . Kant was also studied with indifferent success indeed , but with indomitable perseverance . Schleiermacher and Neander re-opened the way to theological conviction through the heart and the imagination . These influences were just beginning to be felt when Dr. Bushnell brought his hitherto secularized intellect to grapple with the great truths of Christian theology , which have always fascinated and stimulated the greatest of men , who have learned the // secret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intellect , and stimulated his imagination . Though independent in his thinking and never given to confess any special dependence upon any teacher or writer living or dead , he found both atmosphere and aliment in this new philosophical and literary life , which vibrated with convulsive if not revolutionary energy through every school of theology in this country , from Cambridge to Princeton . Nor should it be forgotten that those were times of great ieligious activity and aggressiveness in the way of revivals and measures to promote them , nor that every form of moral and social reform was publicly promoted and earnestly embraced or as earnestly rejected by multitudes of aggressive souls ; that whole communities were agitated and churches were divided , that pastors were unseated , that the political fabric was almost lifted from its foundations by these excited discussions , which invoked earnest and excited argument , and called in question every custom and tradition of the past . In all the discussions of those wakeful times Dr. Bushnell took an active part , and bore himself gallantly in them all . He early took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be apprehended through the forms of the imagination , and must consequently be incapable of sharp and fixed definitions and an exact terminology . He thought to introduce a new method in theology , and he conformed his own practice to his theory . His views were not new . I do not believe , as he held and applied them , that they are true , although the half-truth which they express is most important . They had been propounded before his time and formulated with great ability and eloquence , but they were dear to him as thought out by himself and he applied them to the doctrines of God and of Christ in a series of elaborate treatises , in which some most sacred formulas were brought into question on grounds of reason and revelation . Had he been held to a strict and logical construction of his language he had not escaped condemnation . It was well for him and better for the church that he was judged by men who were capable of trying a man by the real significance of his thinking and believing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theories . But in all this ordeal it was the earnestness of the Christian faith of the man that saved him from being condemned as a theologian . How nobly he has justified this generous construction of the real import of his creed , by formally revising and amending some of his earlier teachings , I need not say . But the charity by which he was judged did not bless him alone that received it . It also blessed those who gave it and acquiesced in it when given . If theology in all Protestant denominations is now more tolerant of differences and more charitable in its constructions of import under a variety of phraseology , if it is more kindly in its spirit , it is in some measure owing to the earnest Christian faith which Dr. Bushnell exemplified , while with heroic boldness he contended for his rights to be accredited as a teacher of " the faith once delivered to the saints . " No man needs now to be told that the methods of theological judgment which prevailed in Protestant Christendom fifty years ago can never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driven out from His temple by the dogmatism of the schools . The Christian faith of our friend was eminently conspicuous in his conflicts with infirmity and his anticipations of death . In the year 1854 he was overtaken by an acute disease which seriously interrupted his regular labors in his parish . From that time he lived the life of an invalid . For twenty-one years he labored with varying degrees of hope and success . For a little more than twenty-one years he battled with threatening death . How heroically he contended for his life many of his friends know full well . How resolutely he combatted with infirmity , with what energy he summoned his mind to new activities and occupied himself with new interests , it has been inspiring to see and learn . He visits California , and , instead of thinking of his health alone , he throws his whole soul into prophetic anticipations of the new empire that is to rise upon the Pacific coast , and gives counsel and spirit to the founders of the college which was the nucleus of its promising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the realization of his darling scheme for the ndornment and honor of his adopted city . He preaches here and there with unabated energy and zeal , either occasionally or in longer or shorter // engagements . One of the latest , if not the very last , of these services , was performed in this chapel ,  --  some of us remember with what interest to us and with what painfulness to himself ; and especially how a tender pathos unusual to him , entered into his last appeal to the young men who heard him . He brings volume after volume forth from the press . He maintains an unabated interest in old friends and lavishes a youthful freshness of affection upon those newly acquired . But it is all the while apparent that he does not struggle against death because he is afraid of death ; but rather that he has conquered death , because the life he is now living he lives by faith in the Son of God . He becomes more genial in his ways , more kindly in his judgments , more sweet in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demonstrative in his tenderness . He is contented to live . He is not afraid to die . God is with him by day and by night . Christ has become more and more completely the indweller within his soul , and more and more the inspirer of his wonder and joy . In one of the last days of the last year , I spent two or three hours with him in what I believed would be a farewell visit , as it was . He was cheerful in spirits and even buoyant with humor . He talked of the present and the past with more than his usual spirit and freedom , but with an indescribable simplicity and loveliness . At parting he asked me to come again foranother three hours as pleasant as these we had spent together . I bade him good-by , never to meet with him again in what we call the present life . I know not how or where we may meet again , nor with what surroundings : whether in scenes to which earth 's scenery has no analogies , or in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " a land of brooks of water , of fountains and depths that spring out of valleys and hills . " But of this I am certain , that wherever and whatever that land may be , " the glory of God will lighten it and the Lamb will be the light thereof ; " and of this also , that the man vhose character is formed most completely by faith in the love of God in this life will be transformed into a manhood which shall be proportionately glorious in the life which is to be .
