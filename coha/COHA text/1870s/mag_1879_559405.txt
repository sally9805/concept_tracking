THE INDIAN PROBLEM . STRANGE as it may appear , it is nevertheless a fact that , after nearly four hundred years of conflict between the European and American races for supremacy on this continent , a conflict in which war and peace have alternated almost as frequently as the seasons , we still have presented the question , What shall be done with the Indians ? If the graves of the thousands of victims who have fallen in the terrible wars of race had been placed in line , the philanthropist might travel from the Atlantic to the Pacific , and from the Lakes to the Gulf , and be constantly within sight of green mounds . And yet we marvel at the problem as if some new question of politics or morals had been presented . Indeed , wise men differ in opinion , journalists speculate , divines preach , and statesmen pronounce it still a vexed question . The most amusing part of the quandary , however , is that it should be regarded as something new and original . After every generation has contended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the home governments enacted laws , the colonies framed rules , every Administration of our Government forced to meet the difficulty , and every Congress discussed th' " Indian Question , " we are still brought face to face with the perplexing problem . The real issue in the question which is now before the American people is , whether we shall continue the vacillating and expensive policy that has marred our fair name as a nation and a Christian people , or devise some practical and judicious system by which we can govern one quarter of a million . of our population , securing and maintaining their loyalty , raising them from the darkness of barbarism to the light of civilization , and put an end to these interminable and expensive Indian wars . The supposition that we are near the end of our Indian troubles is erroneous , and the fact that a condition of affairs now exists over an enormous area of our country , in which an American citizen // can not travel , unguarded and unarmed , without the danger of being molested , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If , by a dispassionate and impartial discussion of the subject , some measure may be devised that will eradicate the evil , and lead to the adoption of a permanent improvement in the management of our Indian matters , one object of this paper will have been accomplished . In considering the subject , it might be well to first examine the causes which have produced the present condition of affairs , and , in doing so , if the writer shall allude to some of the sins of his own race , it will only be in order that an unbiased judgment may be formed of both sides of the question . It will be remembered that one class or race is without representation , and has not the advantages of the press or the telegraph to bring it into communication with the intelligence of the world , and is seldom heard except in the cry of alarm and conflict along the Western frontier . If we dismiss from our minds the prejudice we have against the Indian , we shall be enabled to more clearly understand the impulses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war chief of the Dakota nation , uttered one truth when he said that " there was not one white man who loved an Indian , and not a true Indian but who hated a white man . " Could we but perceive the true character of the Indians , and learn their dispositions , not covered by the cloak of necessity , policy , and interest , we should find that they regard us as a body of false and cruel invaders of their country , while we are too apt to consider them as a treacherous and bloodthirsty race , that should be destroyed by any and all means , yet , if we consider the cause of this feeling , we might more readily understand the result . The more we study the Indian 's character , the more we appreciate the marked distinction between the civilized being and the real savage , yet we shall find that the latter is governed by the same impulses and motives that govern all other men . The want of confidence and the bitter hatred now existing between the two races @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centuries , and by the stories of bad faith , cruelty , and wrong , handed down by tradition from father to son until they have become second nature in both . It is unfair to suppose that one party has invariably acted rightly , and that the other is responsible for every wrong that has been committed . We might recount the treachery of the red-man , the atrocity of his crimes , the cruelties of his tortures , and the hideousness of many of his savage customs ; we might un voi*. cxxvul. - NO. 268. 20 // dertake to estimate the number of his victims , and to picture the numberless valleys which he has illumined by the burning homes of hardy frontiersmen , yet at the same time the other side of the picture might appear equally as black with injustice . One hundred years before the pilgrims landed at Plymouth , the Spanish Government issued a decree authorizing the enslavement of American Indians , as in accord with the law of God and man . Later they were transported to France , to San Domingo and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Island , Pennsylvania , Virginia , the Carolinas , Georgia , and Louisiana , and hunted with dogs in Connecticut and Florida . Practically disfranchised by our original Constitution , and deprived either by war or treaty of nearly every tract of land which to them was desirable , and to the white man valuable , they were the prey to the grasping avarice of both Jew and Gentile . Step by step a powerful and enterprising race has driven them back from the Atlantic to the far West , until now there is scarcely a spot of ground upon which the Indians have any certainty of maintaining a permanent abode . It may be well in this connection to remember the fac , t that in the main the Europeans were kindly treated by the natives , when the former first landed on American shores , and when they came to make a permanent settlement were supplied with food , particularly the Plymouth and Portsmouth colonists , which enabled them to endure the severity of long and cheerless winters . For a time during the early settlement of this country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be followed by violent and relentless warfare . Our relations with the Indians have been governed chiefly by treaties and trade , or war and subjugation . By the first we have invariably overreached the natives , and we find the record of broken promises all the way from the Atlantic to the Pacific , while many of the fortunes of New York , Chicago , St. Louis , and San Francisco can be traced directly to Indian tradership . By war the natives have been steadily driven toward the setting sun  --  a subjugated , a doomed race . In council the Indians have produced men of character and intellect , and orators and diplomats of decided ability , while in war they have displayed courage and sagacity of a high order . Education , science , and the resources of the world have enabled us to overcome the savages , and they are now at the mercy of their conquerors . In our treaty relations most extravagant and sacred promises have been given by the highest authorities , and yet these have frequently been disregarded . The intrusions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever before ) , the non-compliance with treaty obligations , have been followed by atrocities that could alone satisfy a savage and revengeful spirit . We need not dwell upon the original causes that have led to the present condition of affairs . Facts that have been herein referred to make it almost impossible for the two conflicting elements to harmonize . No Administration could stop the tidal wave of immigration that is sweeping over our land ; no political party could restrain or control the enterprise of our people , and no man could desire to check the march of civilization . Our progress knew no bounds . The thirst for gold and the restless desire to push beyond the horizon have carried our people over every obstacle . We have reclaimed the wilderness and made the barren desert glisten with golden harvest ; settlements now cover the hunting-ground of the savages ; their country has been cut and divided in every conceivable form by the innumerable railroad and telegraph lines and routes of communication and commerce ; and the Indians standing in the pathway of American progress and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the common enemy and have been driven to the remote quarters of our territory . During the time that this wonderful change has been wrought , it may be asked , Have the Indians as a body made any progress toward civilization ? and in the light of past history we would be prompted to reply , Why should they have abandoned the modes of life which Nature had given them to adopt the customs of their enemies ? In seeking to find the evidence of enlightenment , the results are not satisfactory . It is presumed that there is not a race of wild men on the face of the globe who worship the Great Spirit more in accordance with that religion taught in the days of the patriarchs than the natives of this country , and yet after many years of contact with the civilized people we find the footprints of evil as plentiful and as common as the evidences of Christianity . Again , in early days the Indian tribes were to a considerable extent tillers of the soil , but by constant warfare , in which their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become entirely subjugated , the mere remnant of their former strength , or pushed out on the vast plains of the West where they subsist upon wild fruits and the flesh of animals . Could we obtain accurate statistics , we would undoubtedly find that there were more acres of ground cultivated by the Indians one hundred years ago than at the present time . // The white race has now obtained such complete control of every quarter of the country and the means of communication with every section are now so ample that the problem resolves itself down to one of two modes of solution , viz. , to entirely destroy the race by banishment and extermination , or to adopt some humane and practicable method of improving the condition of the Indians , and in the end make them part and parcel of our great Population . The first proposition , though it may be found to have thousands of advocates in different sections of the country , is too abhorrent to every sense of humanity to be considered . The other method is regarded as practicable , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our Government toward the Indians , we find that after subjugating them it has been our policy to collect the different tribes on reservations and support them at the expense of our people . The Indians have in the main abandoned the hope of driving back the invaders of their territory , yet there are some who still cherish the thought , and strange as it may seem it is a fact that the most noted leader among the Indians advanced such a proposition to the writer within the last two years . They now stand in the position of unruly children to indulgent parents , for whom they have very little respect , at times wrongly indulged and again unmercifully punished . Coming down to our direct or immediate relations with them we find that our policy has been to make them wards of the nation , to be held under close military surveillance , or else to make them pensioners under no other restraint than the influence of one or two individuals . Living without any legitimate government , without any law and without any physical power to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be found for vice and crime ? We have committed our Indian matters to the custody of an Indian Bureau , which for many years was a part of the military establishment of the Government ; but , for political reasons and to promote party interests , this Bureau was transferred to the Department of the Interior . Whether or not our system of Indian management has been a success during the past ten , fifty , or one hundred year4 is almost answered in the asking . The Indians , the frontiersmen , the army stationed in the West , and the readers of the daily news in all parts of our country , can answer that question . Another question is frequently asked , Why is our managemeut of Indian affairs less successful than that of our neighbors across the northern boundary ? // and it can be answered in a few words . Their system is permanent , decided , and just . The tide of immigration in Canada has not been as great as along our frontier ; they allow the Indians to live as Indians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the customs which to them are distasteful . In our own management it is the opinion of a very large number of our people that a change for the better would be desirable ; such a measure is now under consideration , and we have the singular and remarkable phenomenon presented of the traders , the contractors , the interested officials of the West , and many of the best people of the East , advocating one scheme , while a great majority of frontier settlers , the officers of the army of long experience on the Plains , and many competent judges in the East , advocating another . The question is one of too grave importance to admit interests of a personal or partisan nature . It is one of credit or discredit to our Government , and of vital importance to our people . A commission of eminent legislators have been for months investigating the subject , and . the greatest danger to be feared is that no good will result , or that a mere makeshift will be adopted by which neither party will be benefited . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defined plan for the government and gradual elevation of the Indian race , for such is believed to be both practicable and judicious . Now , in order that peace may be secured , the Indians benefited , and protection given to the extensive settlements scattered over a greater area than the whole of the Atlantic States , it is believed that a plan could be devised which would enlist the hearty approval and support of men of all parties . The object is surely worthy of the effort . No body of people whose language , religion , and customs are so entirely different from ours can be expected to cheerfully and suddenly adopt our own . The change must be gradual , continuous , and in accordance with Nature 's laws . The history of nearly every race that has advanced from barbarism to civilization has been through the stages of the hunter , the herdsman , the agriculturist , and finally reaching those of commerce , mechanics , and the higher arts . It is held , first , that we as a generous people and liberal Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that all other men enjoy , and if we deprive them of these privileges we must then give them the best government possible . Without any legitimate government , and in a section of country where the lawless are under very little restraint , it is useless to suppose that thou- // THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW . sands of wild savages thoroughly armed and mounted can be controlled by moral suasion . Even if they were in the midst of comfortable and agreeable surroundings , yet when dissatisfaction is increased by partial imprisonment and quickened by the pangs of hunger , a feeling that is not realized by one man in a thousand in civilized life , it requires more patience and forbearance than savage natures are likely to possess to prevent serious outbreaks . The experiment of making a police force composed entirely of Indians is a dangerous one , unless they are under the shadow and control of a superior body of white troops , and , if carried to any great extent , will result in rearming the Indians and work disastrously to the frontier settlements . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the remote frontier , composed of a strictly non-combatant for chief , with a posse comitatus of red warriors , undertaking to control several thousand wild savages ! The available land that can be given to the Indians is being rapidly diminished ; they can not be moved farther West ; and some political party or administration must take the responsibility of protecting the Indians in their rights of person and property . The advantage of placing the Indians under some government strong enough to control them and just enough to command their respect is too apparent to admit of argument . The results to be obtained would be : First . They would be beyond the possibility of doing harm , and the frontier settlements would be freed from their terrifying and devastating presence . Second . They would be under officials having a knowledge of the Indian country and the Indian character . Third . Their supplies and annuities would be disbursed through an efficient system of regulations . Fourth . Besides being amenable to the civil laws , these officers would be under strict military law , subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " unbecoming a gentleman , or prejudicial to good order . " It is therefore suggested and earnestly recommended that a system which has proved to be eminently practicable should receive at least a fair trial . As the Government has in its employ men who by long and faithful service have established reputations for integrity , character , and ability which can not be disputed-men who have commanded armies , reconstructed States , controlled hundreds of millions of public property , and who during years of experience // on the frontier have opened the way for civilization and Christianity-it is believed that the services of these officials , in efforts to prevent war and elevate the Indian race , would be quite as judicious as their employment when inexperience and mismanagement have culminated in hostilities . Allowing the civilized and semi-civilized Indians to remain under the same supervision as at present , the President of the United States should have power to place the wild and nomadic tribes under the control of the War Department . Officers of known character , integrity , and experience , who would govern them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placed in charge of the different tribes . One difficulty has been , that they have been managed by officials too far away , and who knew nothing of the men they were dealing with . The Indians , as far as possible , should be localized on the public domain , in sections of country to which they are by nature adapted . The forcing of strong , hardy , mountain Indians from the extreme North to the warmer malarial districts of the South is regarded as cruel , and should be discontinued . Every effort should be made to locate the Indians by families , for the ties of relationship among them are much stronger than is generally supposed . By this means the Indians will become independent of their tribal relations , and will not be found congregated in large and unsightly camps , as are now usually met with about their agencies . Much of the army transportation now used in scouting for Indians and clearing the country could be utilized in transporting their stores , breaking the ground , and preparing the way for making the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of money should be made under the same system of accountability as now regulates army disbursements . The officers in charge should have sufficient force to preserve order , patrol the reservations , prevent intrusions , recover stolen property , arrest the lawless and those who take refuge in Indian camps to shield themselves from punishment for crimes or to enable them to live without labor , and to keep the Indians upon their reservations and within the limits of their treaties . The officer in charge would be enabled to control or prevent the sale of ammunition , as well as to suppress the sale of intoxicating liquors among the Indians . Many thousands of the Indian ponies , useful only for the war or the chase , should be sold and the proceeds used in the purchase of domestic stock . A large percentage of the // annual appropriations should be employed in the purchase of cattle and other domestic animals ; the Indians desire them , and the Plains will support hundreds of thousands of them . They will replace the buffalo , the elk , the deer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be branded and given to the Indians by families ; the surplus stock to be sold after three years under such restricted rules as would enable the Indians to receive full return for their property . From a pastoral people the Indians should be induced to become agriculturists ; taught the seasons to plant and to harvest the variety of valuable products and the use of machinery as a means of obtaining food . The step from the first grade to the second would be easily accomplished provided the Indians were directed by a firm hand . As they accumulate property and learn industry , there would be a threefold incentive to their remaining at peace , namely , occupation , the fear of confiscation of property , and the loss of the comforts of life . The above is no idle theory , as the writer has advocated such a policy for years , and by actual and successful experience has demonstrated that such was practicable even with the wildest tribes of the Plains , a part of whom , eighteen months before , had never shaken hands with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are also needed , and should be authorized by Congress . In all communities there will be found disturbing elements , and , to meet this difficulty , courts of justice should be instituted . Frequently outbreaks and depredations are prompted by a few mischievous characters , which could easily be checked by a proper government . This is one secret of success with the Canadian system : where disturbances occur , the guilty suffer , and not whole tribes , including innocent women and children . As a remark from Sitting Bull has been quoted , we will now repeat the words of Joseph , who says that " the greatest want of the Indian is a system of law by which controversies between Indians , and between Indians and white men , can be settled without appealing to physical force . " He says also that " the want of law is the great source of disorder among Indians . They understand the operation of laws , and , if there were any statutes , the Indians would be perfectly content to place themselves in the hands of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their wrongs into their own hands , or retaliate , as they now do , without the law . " Do we need a savage to inform us of the necessity that has // existed for a century ? As these people become a part of our population , they should have some tribunal where they could obtain protection in their rights of person and property . A dispute as to the rights of property between an Indian and a white man before a white juror might not be decided in exact accordance with justice in some localities . Fortunately , our Constitution provides that " the judicial power of the United States shall be vested in one Supreme Court , and such inferior courts as Congress may from time to time ordain and establish " ; and it is believed that Congress has power , af least in the Territories , to give such jurisdiction either to the military courts , or the Territorial courts , or both , as will secure justice to the Indians in disputes arising between the Indians and the white men . The warriors may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the industry of the Indians that is now wasted may be diverted to peaceful and useful pursuits ; yet the great work of reformation must be mainly through the youth of the different tribes . The hope of every race is in the rising generation . This important work might well enlist the sympathy and support of all philanthropic and Christian people . As we are under obligation to support the tribes until they become self-sustaining , it might be advisable to support as many as possible of the children of the Indians at places where they would be the least expensive to the Government , and where they would be under the best influence . As the Government has expended hundreds of thousands of dollars in building military posts that are no longer occupied or required , and as there are at these places excellent buildings and large reservations , it would be well to utilize them for educational and industrial purposes . The present school system is regarded as too expensive , and productive of little good . The children are exposed to the degrading influence of camp-life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best efforts of instructors . Several years ago the writer recommended the use of several of our unoccupied military posts , and that as many of the youth of the different tribes as could be gathered voluntarily be placed at these establishments , particularly the sons of chiefs , who will in a few years govern the different tribes . These could soon be taught the English language , habits of industry , the benefits of civilization , the power of the white race , and , after a few years , return to their people with some education , with more intelligence , and with their ideas of life entirely changed for the better . They would in turn become the educators of their own // people , and their influence for good could not be estimated , while the expense of educating them would be less than at present , and thousands would be benefited thereby . The Indians , as they become civilized and educated , as they acquire property and pay taxes toward the support of the Government , should have the same rights of citizenship as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States should have power to transfer from the War Department to the Interior Department any tribe that shall become so far civilized and peaceable in its disposition as to render it unnecessary to keep its members longer under the control of the military power . Whenever an emergency arises which has not been foreseen and provided for by Congress , such as failure or destruction of their crops , the President should have power , on the recommendation of the officer in charge or the Governors of the different Territories in whicVthey are living , to order the necessary supplies , as has been done in several instances to white people , in order to prevent great suffering or a serious disturbance of the peace ; such supplies to be limited to the smallest necessity , and only until such time as Con- congress could take action on the matter . v A continuation of the system which has prevailed for the past twenty years will , it is believed , simply perpetuate a condition of affairs the result of which is a chronic state of insecurity and hostilities . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race of savages can not by any human ingenuity be civilized and Christianized within a few years of time , neither will 250,000 people with their descendants be destroyed in the next fifty years . The white man and the Indian should be taught to live side by side , each respecting the rights of the other , and both living under wholesome laws , enforced with ample authority and exact justice . Such a government would be most gratifying and beneficial to the Indians , while those men who have invested their capital , and with wonderful enterprise are developing the unparalleled and inexhaustible wealth that for ages has lain dormant in the Western mountains , those people who have left the overcrowded centers of the East , and whose humble homes are now dotting the plains and valleys of the far West , as well as those men who are annually called upon to endure greater exposure and suffering than is required by the troops of any other nation on the globe , would hail with great satisfaction any system that would secure a substantial and lasting peace . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
