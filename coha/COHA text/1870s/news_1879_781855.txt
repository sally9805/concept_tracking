txt It is sad to see any trustful , confiding man deceived . It is still morn sad to see the finer feelings of the members of the Field family trifled with and their confidence abused . Yet this has lately been done , once in the ease of Mr. CYRUS W. FIELD , and still later in the case of Mr. DAVID DUDLEY FIELD . If this sort of thing is to go on , the consequences will be terrible . The Field family will become embittered and misanthropical , and when that takes place we might as well try to live without the sunshine as without the light of the beneficent countenance of one or another variety of Field . It all comes from the frank , unsuspicious nature of the FIELDS , and their burning desire to do other people good . When Mr. CYRUS W. FIELD  --  the illustrious man who made the Atlantic Ocean expressly in order that a telegraphic cable might be laid beneath its waves  --  found himself the owner of a quantity of shares of the elevated railroad with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought was to make Some other man a sharer in his good fortune . He remembered his old friend , Mr. TILDEN , and said to himself , " Sammy shall have some of these shares . " He had known Mr. TILDEN many years , and he utterly discredited all the unpleasant things that had been said of him . " Sammy , " Mr. FIELD was accustomed to say , " is as frank , genial , and free from guile as I am . He is a noble , unselfish , honorable old gentleman , and I am proud to call him my friend . " To this excellent old gentleman Mr. FIELD went with a glow of enthusiasm on his expansive cheeks , and urged him to take some elevated shares , and impressed upon him the importance that a favorable decision by the Court of Appeals would be to the interests of the elevated road . Mr. TILDEN took the shares , and when Mr. FIELD went to England in order to search out poor and deserving Brit us whom he might make happy with elevated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of friendliness . And yet no sooner was the beneficent FIELD safely out of the country than Mr. TILDEN sold his stock at a profit of a million dollars , without , asking Mr. FIELD 'S approval and blessing . No wonder that Mr. FIELD considered himself a betrayed and outraged being . He had trusted Mr. TILDEN , and this was his reward . It forced upon Mr. FIELD 'S mind the conviction that there are treacherous , cunning , and deceitful men in the world  --  a fact which until then he had always refused to believe . Close upon this melancholy event comes the sorrow which has just fallen upon Mr. DAVID DUDLEY FIELD , who is at least as great and good a man as his brother , and who practices law not to make money , but solely to do good . Mr. FIELD had been for something like seventy years the intimate friend of Gov . ROBINSON . He believed the Governor to be a thoroughly good man , unsullied by the world , and living only to make others happy . Nevertheless , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past Summer , he forfeited the respect , confidence , and love of Mr. DAVID DUDLEY FIELD . That venerable man  --  if one can without irreverence speak of a FIELD as a mere man  --  went to the Democratic Convention , and there rose up and said that Gov . RoBINsoN must not be renominated . No one can imagine what anguish it must haale given Mr. FIELD to thus publicly strike at his old friend . In sacrificing personal feelings to duty , the FIELDS can , however , at all times give odds to BRUTUS or . any other Roman father . There is not the slightest doubt that had Mr. FIELD been free to choose , he would have cut off all his hands and thrown his last dollar into the sea rather than say one word in opposition to the interests of his life-long friend , the Governor . Yet this noble FIELD did not hesitate to do his duty . The conduct of the Governor during the last few months had caused Mr. FIELD to lose all confidence in him , and he felt compelled to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FIELDS . ' - should have thus successively lost confidence in Mr. TILDEN and in Gov . ROBINSON is of itself a painful fact ; but the consequences that may flow from the loss of confidence are of still greater importance . What will the community do if the FIELDS gradually lose all confidence in their fellow-men ? . At present , they are examples which we can set before our children with the utmost confidence . We can say , " Consider the FIELDS . They are rich , they are influential . One of them has made the sea and the telegraphic cables therein . Another has invented the science of law , and given to the world its varied systems of jurisprudence . ' Yet these great men are simple and innocent as children . The world has not touched their pure and noble hearts , and they are a living proof that goodness of the purest typo can be associated with greatness and the most brilliant worldly success . " When , however , the FIELDS , through the repeated abuse of their confidence , lose faith in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cunning tricksters , where will the models to which we now point our children be ? Even we ourselves will be left without a single FIELD in whom we can believe and on whom we can humbly try in our small way to model our daily lives . There is one result which the recent course of the two FIELD brothers directly tends to produce , although these good , simple-hearted men never thought of it . Mr. CYRUS W. FIELD was driven by his righteous wrath and keen sense of duty to denounce Mr. TILDEN as a man unfit for any trust ; and Mr. DAVID DUDLEY FIELD in attacking Gov . Roan/so/sr  --  similarly from a pure sense of duty  --  struck also at Mr. TILDEN , of whom the Governor is at present the representative . Now , if the two FIELDS should succeed in inducing the rest of the Democratic Party to share their views of Mr. TILDEN 'S character , the latter would fail to obtain the nomination for the Presidency , and a third FIELD brother , who at present graciously consents to sit on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nominated in Mr. TILDEN 'S stead . This is a view of the matter which we may feel certain has never dawned upon any FIELD , for neither CYRUS W. nor DAVID DUDLEY fix their thoughts on worldly topics sufficiently closely to foresee possible political complications . Still , it would be a beautiful piece of poetic justice if the betrayed FIELD brothers should unexpectedly find that the pain which the discovery of Mr. TILDEN 'S and Gov . ROBINSON 'S unworthiness gave them is to be salved by the nomination of Mr. JUSTICE FIELD for the Presidency of the United States .
