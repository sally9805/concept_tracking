txt Messrs . DWIGHT FOSTER and P. W. CHANDLER are able and reputable lawyers , but Mr. WINSTON underrates the intelligence of the community if lie imagines that their brief opinion is a set-off to the exhaustive opinion of Messrs . ROPES , GRAY , and LORING , concurred hi by AttorneyGeneral TRAIN . The latter document , which we printed on the 13th inst. , covers all the essential parts of a large question . Messrs . FOSTER and ( ' HANDLER , whose opinions we print to-day , confine themselves to a single point , and that really the least important in the controversy . They merely say that the Trustees of the Mutual Life Insurance Company " may from time to time alter " the rates of insurance " by increasing or diminishing them as they may see fit , " and that the policies issued in pursuance of the new plan " are valid , and bind the company as effectually as any of its former contracts of insurance . " The view thus expressed may be right or wrong , and the vital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Messrs . ROPES , GRAY &; LORING go to the ? bottom of the question , and impugn both the equity and legality of the Trustees ' action on grounds which the opinion obtained by Mr. WINSTON does not touch . It is absurd to suppose that the fragmentary state- ' milt published by the company in its justification  --  based , as we shall show it to be , on misrepresentation  --  can be accepted by the policy-holders or the ' public as an answer to the comprehensive review of their powers and obligations which the managers of the Mutual Life will vainly strive to evade . It is fair to assume that Mr. DWIGHT FOSTER is not responsible for the perversion of fact which serves as his startingpoint . Doubtless he has relied on the case submitted to him , and has taken its presentation of alleged facts without inquiry as to their accuracy . Be this as it may , he is altogether off the scent when he discusses the right of the Trustees or managers of an insurance company to change its rates of premium . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Mutual Life chosen to reduce their rates in good faith , without detriment to the interests of existing policyholders , their action would have been unchallenged . The expediency of the change would have been the only matter for consideration . But the plan they have adopted is not a reduction of premiums at all . The old rates are maintained . The 30 per cent , that is deducted from the first two premiums on new policies is not a genuine reduction , since the amount which is offered as an inducement to bring in new members is paid out of a fund belonging to the old members . A beau fide deduction might be honest , however inexpedient , if due regard were had . to existing interests . But a gift of 30 per cent. , for two years , of money owned by the present policy-holders is a totally different affair , and one to which Mr. DWIGHT FOSTER makes no reference whatever . His opinion , therefore , rests on a false premise . The practice he declares to be lawful is not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to justify . How far the obvious inaccuracy of his premise vitiates Mr. FOSTER 'S conclusion as to the validity of the new policies , lawyers must decide . There is a wide difference between an actual abatement of premium , and an abatement which consists simply of taking money out of the pockets of one set of policyholders for the benefit of others . If law is the equivalent of equity , a serious flaw impairs the value of the new policies , and prudent persons seeking insurance will regard them with distrust . After all , however , this is a minor part of the matter in dispute , and the attempt of the Mutual Life managers to concentrate attention upon it is equivalent to a confession that their real position in regard t ) the ' policy-holders and the ' surphWig ? inde- ' 1 fensible . If the " newsdeparture " could b ) properly so-called ? if reduced rates of premium were to be honestly introduced ? there would be no cause of complaint . Se long as the two classes of business , the al @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dividends , the present policy-holders could not suffer injustice . The wrong done to them takes the shape of a misapplication of a portion of their funds for the benefit of others . This is the fundamental wrong which Messrs . ROPES , GRAY , &; LORING pronounce unlawful . The managers plead that the money they give to . new members , having been derived by a process of confiscation from theunfortunates who have been obliged to surrender their policies , does not belong to the present policy-holders in the sense that the surplus accruing on their own premiums belongs to them . Such an argument is inadmissible . Every dollar owned . by the company , from whatever source derived , is the property of the policy-holders , and the managers have no more right to alienate any part of it than they have to " scale " the policies or transfer the profits to their own pockets . " The whole of its large profits , and surplus from every source , " says one of the Mutual Life 's publications , " is divided , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who have entire control of its business , and to whom its funds exclusively belong . " This is the orthodox doctrine of mutual insurance . Mr. WINSTON ' and his colleagues act on a totally different principle . Availing themselves of the absolute authority which an abuse of the proxy system secures to them  --  accustomed to virtual irresponsibility in the exercise of arbitrary power  --  they have undertaken to divide surplus finals inequitably , giving a part to persons who have no claim to a dollar of the amount ; they withhold from the policy-holders , to whom everything belonge , a fund that is not mentioned in the tiecounts ; they not , only deprive the policy ' holders of control of this portion of the property , but they assert a right to do with it as they please without consultation with the policy-holders and in spite of their remonstrances . Can Mr. DWIGHT FOSTER be induced to say that these pretensions are lawful ? Yet these really are the pretensions set up by Mr. WINSTON and his colleagues in the management . These gentlemen object to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Praise they liberally pay for ; opinions which amount to nothing they send forth with a flourish of trumpets ; independent discussion of a plan that is too manifestly dishonest to be even plausible they resent as an hnpertinent interference with their functions as . managers . They have administered affairs with so high a hand that they overlooked the rights of policy-holders and the possibility of their objection to a wasteful expenditure of their money in an attempt to regain lost ground . Nor will the indignation of the policyholders be appeased by the evident falsity of the excuses employed to overcome their objections . The pretense that misled Mr. FosTEa is a fair example of the disingenuous tactics resorted to with the view of silencing opposition . Not one whit better is the pretense that by this plan ' heavy rates of commission are obviated ; the truth being that these rates are'beavier than before . The policy-holders are patient , but there are limits beyond which oven Mr. WINSTON may not go with impunity . The courts may be appealed to , to decide whether the policy-holders , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , have the stronger right to regulate its disposal . Massachusetts is the best State in which to have this question fairly tested .
