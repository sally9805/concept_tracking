HISTORY is like the sky at midnight . The regal stars are few , the planets fewer . Every now and then comes a bright meteor flashing from the multitude , and vanishes as swiftly as it came , leaving behind only a legend of light . The brilliant and exceptional genius dies young or suffers sudden eclipse when the period of maturity is passed ; while those who attain fame late live late to enjoy it . Happy the young genius who has compressed seventy years of human experience into thirty-six , and dies with his life still perfect and complete . At the age when other men are beginning to emerge from the crowd , these few , set apart from the rest , have practically ende4 their career . If death does not terminate it soon , a turn in the tide is sure to come at last , and the favorite of fortune becomes her sport in most instances .

Henry V. , the conqueror of Agincourt , the Black Prince of Poictiers , Alexander of Macedon , Titus , the conqueror of Jerusalem , are the few meteors in war that have lived a perfect life , never failing , and dying early enough for their fame . In literature , Byron and Shelley in England , and Joseph Rodman Drake in America , are equally happy instances of this rapid attainment of fame and of death in the fulness of honor , leaving their short lives as complete as those of the slower growing reputations which commence to bud only when the early flowers are wIthered .

The brilliant Alcibiades , with all the world at his feet at twenty , at forty was disgraced and murdered for the one crime of having lived too long for his luck . Two thousand years later , Napoleon Buonaparte , victor of Montenotte at twenty-six , ruler of Europe at thirtysix , was a broken exile at forty-six because he had outlived his fortune . Murat , his most brilliant cavalry chieftain , rose as swiftly as his master , to sink in the same disgrace . How much better for the fame of both , had Napoleon died in the arms of victory at Austerlitz or Jena ; had Murat fallen in the grand charge at Eckmuhl . How many brilliant captains have survived to posterity as the incarnations of gallantry and success , ending their careers on the field in the prime of life !

Never perhaps has there been a more striking instance of the coinpleteness of good fortune , from his first appearance on the field of war to his final and heroic death thereon , than that of the brilliant young chief in whose memory these lines are written . Never was there life more rounded , complete , and symmetrical than that of George A. Custer , the favorite of fortune , the last cavalier . His name recalls nothing but brilliant deeds of daring , romantic courage , and all that is noble and charming . In his life he was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's favorite Seidlitz , with an unfailing good fortune peculiarly his own . The manner of his death has cast a halo of glory round his name such as no man ever attained in contest with savages . Not to many men is such completeness of good fortune allotted . Murat died disgraced ; Seidlitz was a gouty , worn-out old roue when fate took him . To Custer alone was it given to join a romantic life of perfect success to a death of perfect heroism ; to unite the splendors of Austerlitz and Thermopyhe ; to charge like Murat ; to die like Leonidas . George A. Custer , born December 5 , 1839 , in a western village called New Rumley , Ohio , died at the head of his troops , of whom not a man returned to tell the tale , June 25 , 1876 , in his thirty-seventh year . From his first entrance into public life he never suffered a reverse , and faults and merits alike seemed to conspire to befriend him on the road to success . After going through the common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bingham , member for his district , sent him to West Point in 1857 , and the rebellion broke out in 1861 , just as he graduated into the army . By nature he was remarkably favored physically , being one of the handsomest of men-tall , slender , lithe , and active as a cat , with a noble , knightly face , curling golden locks-just such a figure as Dc La Motte FouquS has pictured for an ideal knight in " Sir Folko de Montfaucon . " All the elements of success seemed to have been united in Custer 's favor when he made his appearance on the scene . His splendid physique and the varied qualities of his mind would have been of much less avail but for the happy accident which sent him to West Point . The rigidly practical studies of that institution are exactly those calculated to regulate that spirit of recklessness which hurries so many young men into destruction early in life ; and they served as a balance wheel in Custer 's after life . Left alone to educate himself and devour romantic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hard knocks he must have gone through before he could have been drubbed into a practical man , his enthusiasm tempered by the slow results of experience . As it was , from his own account of himself , * he seems to have found the Academy exceptionally irksome , but its regulating influence was his after salvation . As he so naIvely tells us , in a class of thirty-four members , thirty-three graduated above him ; and almost on his very graduation day his reckless romance of character cost him a courtmartial , which would have ruined any one not possessed of " Custer 's luck . " There is something peculiarly characteristic and interesting in the story he there tells of the boy officer of the guard , who , seeing two cadets quarrelling , instead of arresting both , calls out to the bystanders , " Stand back , boys ; let 's have a fair fight . " It was the key-note of his whole character . " Let 's have a fair fight " was his motto then and to his death , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough of fair fights the rest of his life , passed in an atmosphere of war . It reminds us also of his last recorded saying , when he spied the Sioux camp that was to be his passport to enduring fame : " Custer 's luck ! the biggest In * " War Memoirs , " " Galaxy " for April , 1876. q4 // dian village on the continent ! Forward ! " He had reason to trust Custer 's luck , for it had never before failed him . Besides the mental advantages given to the young officer by a West Point education , the positive social and  |p0-litical  standing which it afforded him must not be forgotten . All of Custer 's brilliant qualities would not have carried him with the same wonderful rapidity where they did had it not been for the magic letters N. A.* after his name . Had he started in the race a second lieutenant of volunteers , even with the same advantages of education , his rise could hardly have been so swift , his promotion so exceptionally rapid . Besides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the moral influence of graduation was immense at that early stage of the war when he entered , and till long after . Any lad of impetuous disposition and good natural talents , having the West Point stamp , was sure- of rapid promotion , as was exemplified by Custer 's own class and those immediately preceding and following it , both in the Union and Confederate forces . The selection of the cavalry for his branch of the service , in spite of his low standing in the class , was another . Grant and Sheridan , both in former times cadets graduating nearly as lowt as Custer , had been put in the infantry , and travelled a long and weary road , both having attained their prime before the late success came to them . " Custer 's luck " sent him into that branch of the service which made general officers in four years out of eight of his fellow cadets - Wheeler , Rosser , Young , Robertson , and Kelley among the Confederates ; Merritt , Kilpatrick4 McKenzie , and * Military Academy . * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sheridan was No.84 in that of 1853. * With regard to McKenzie , this statement needs a slight qnalification . He graduated the year after Custer , at the head of his class , and was made an engineer ; hut it was his transfer to the cavalry in 1864 which gave him his reputation , and he has remained there ever since . Custer on the Union side . All were cavalry officers . It was with these advantages of mind , body , and estate in his favor , that George A. Custer emerged from the halls of West Point , his court-martial difficulty overcome by his good fortune , and reported for duty at Washington . It chanced that he was presented to General Scott on the very day and hour that the latter wished to send a despatch to General MciDowell at Bull Run . Scott took an immediate fancy to this tall , handsome young fellow , and selected him as the bearer of the important papers . Again , on the same day , his luck found him a horse in Washington , when every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sergeant of Griffin 's battery , going to the front with a spare horse , the very same on which the young cadet had learned to ride at West Point . From thenceforward " Custer 's luck " never forsook him . His first experience of battle at Bull Run left him untouched by the general disaster , his company not being seriously engaged . Soon after he was drilling volunteers in Washington , whence he was transferred to staff duty under Phil Kearney , and passed nearly a year , with little danger to himself , on various duties , till the opening of the Peninsula campaign . From his military history in Cullum 's " Register of West Point Graduates , " it appears that he went home on sick leave in October , 1861 , and did not return till February , 1862 . He went to the Peninsula and was placed on McClellan 's staff* in which capacity he earned promotion to the rank of captain and additional aide-de-camp . His service with McClellan evidently gave him a very high opinion of that leader 's character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " War Memoirs , " as well as from the one which appears in this number of " The Galaxy . " With him he remained till the end of McClellan 's career , when his remarkable good luck saved him from further identification with his fallen general 's fortunes , re // stored him to service on the staff of General Stoneman , chief of cavalry to the Army of the Potomac , and subsequently on that of his successor , Alfred Pleasonton . Here it was that he received his sudden promotion , at the same time with Kilpatrick and Merritt , and blossomed out into a brigadier general of volunteers , at the very commencement of that Gettysburg campaign which was to make or mar the future of the Union cavalry . At the time that it occurred there was a great deal of criticism and ill feeling in the cavalry of the Army of the Potomac at the sudden elevation of these young men , almost devoid of experience as they were , to the command of brigades and divisions ; but events soon justified the choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stewart and Hampton , had been distinguished by dash and impetuosity , while our own , under such slow and cautious chiefs as Cooke and Stoneman , had accomplished very little , and had generally had the worst of it in all contests . The sudden accession of these fiery young men , elated with their promotion , brimful of energy and ambition , to the command of large fractions of the Union force , turned the tables on Stewart . Their headlong impetuosity reduced him to the defensive , and at once gave our men the moral advantage of the attack . True , both Kilpatrick and Custer were constantly plunging into scrapes ; charging superior forces and suffering repulses ; but this sort of fighting does not hurt cavalry like infantry . It inures them to rapid fighting ; and they never call a retreat a defeat , because they are always able to cut their way out without serious loss . Merritt was saved from the troubles of the other boy generals by coming under cool , cautious John Buford , his division commander . Thus the rashness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invigorating the whole cavalry corps , which it was not allowed to compromise . For all this the nickname of " Killcavalry , " applied to Kil patrick , stuck to him as long as he was in the Army of the Potomac , and there is little doubt that his influence was decidedly injurious to Custer . The spring of 1864 , however , removed the young general to a new field , and sent Kilpatrick to the West , bringing Custer 's Michigan brigade into the First cavalry division , under the command of a slow and cautious infantry general , A. T. A. Torbert . In the Wilderness campaign , and the subsequent movements around Richmond , there was little of those opportunities for distinction which Custer craved so earnestly , and which had been so plentiful in 1863 . It was all hard , grim work , with nothing to gain but a few feet of ground ; a4d the wooded country drove the cavalry to fight dismounted altogether . The brilliant figure of the boy general in his velvet and gold , that was wont to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a charge , always at a gallop , his bright curls flying over his shoulders , was lost in the thick woods , and he fretted against this prosaic and knock-down warfare . He looked gloomy and low-spirited , and actually cut off his curls . All sorts of romantic stories were told of those curls . Some said he wore them because of a vow never to cut his hair till Richmond was taken ; others in obedience to the laws of his lady love . The plain truth probably is , that vanity and a desire to attract attention to himself , as well as a spirit of romance , induced the wearing of the curls and of the velvet and gold . Fame was the breath of Custer 's life , and he coveted it at any cost . The wearing of his singularly showy costume attracted every one 's attention to him , and his dashing career of the previous summer had brought him into more notice than any brigade commander in the army . The uneasy position in which he found himself during the Wilderness campaign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Early 's raids on Washington ; and Custer went with Sheridan to participate in the famous // Valley campaign of 1864 . Here he was at home on the open flats around Winchester , with a clear , unbroken sweep of country all the way to Harrisonburg , and here the dashing cavalier had once more a full chance to charge as much as he listed . very soon after his arrival Averill was superseded , and Custer appointed to the command of his division . Thenceforward he had no trouble , but quickly achieved glory to his heart 's content . To cut up and utterly destroy the already disheartened foe , never was there man like Custer ; and it was his marvellous dash and eagerness to gather the fruits of victory that enabled him to achieve so much during Sheridan 's last campaign . The same enemy that once contested every inch of ground was now utterly demoralized , Attacks which would have been rashness itself , and destined to certain repulse , in 1863 and 1864 , succeeded in 1865 , because the enemy had lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found Ouster occupying perhaps the proudest position in the whole Army of the Potomac , after Sheridan ; the observed of all observers , as the man whose division had captured more guns and flags than any other in the whole army , and the deeds which gained it most fame were those which were most directly the result of that wonderful good fortune which its leader recognized as " Custer 's luck . " In the final Appomattox campaign Custer enjoyed the additional advantage of being Sheridan 's peculiar favorite , and of being contrasted with the temporary commander of the only other division in his corps , who was in a peculiarly unfavorable position , having a staff which he had not chosen , and expecting momentarily to be superseded . In the final chase after trophies , it was Ouster 's division which always had the luck to cut in at the right time . Devin 's division took the brunt of the fighting at Five Forks , but after that had no chance given it , such as fell to Ouster . The result of all this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington , Ouster attracted more attention than any major general in the army , after Sheridan ; and the wellknown incident of the runaway horse with his wreath of flowers , the long curls of his rider floating in the air as he tore past the grand stand , was only another item in the long list of instances of " Ouster 's luck . " It brought him before the people in the accounts of all the newspaper correspondents , and aided to make him the popular idoL The war was over  --  the great war which once promised to last for an indefinite time , and which collapsed as suddenly as it had risen . The army was reduced , peace covered the land , and the regular forces of the country returned to their old , tedious , inglorious work on the frontier . Now indeed it seemed as if " Ouster 's luck " could carry him no further ; that nothing was left for him but to vegetate at frontier posts or sleep on his laurels till they withered in oblivion . It was the rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confederations of tribes had ceased , had degenerated into an inglorious strife of small posts . The days when Harrison fought Tecumseh , and rode into the Presidency to the tune of Tippecanoe , were over . The contrast between those days and the present was like that in Algeria between the wars of Abd-el Kader and the petty affairs of outposts in the second empire . There was no glory , as it seemed , to be gained on the plains , because of the nature of the fighting . It was the difference between charging Early at Winchester and fighting Mosby 's guerillas . There was everything to lose and little or nothing to gain in the contest . Irregular enemies , divided into small bands , living among their friends , with thousands of volunteer spies , appeared only when it suited them , and always in heavier force than the soldiers . They swooped down on wagon trains , waylaid small parties , killed and destroyed with little risk to themselves , and vanished // from effective pursuit at one point , only to reappear at another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daring . This kind of warfare naturally develops only one side of a soldier 's character . It is the proper domain of a captain of light cavalry-an affair of small parties , rapid marches , long raids , and vigilant outposts : The qualities of generalship which prevail in civilized warfare were of little value here , where the enemy was invisible when wanted , and opposed no tangible army to be destroyed , no town to be captured , no roads to cut , no convoys to seize . Everything that was mlnerable was on the American side , and the army was perforce reduced to the condition of defensive warfare , pure and simple . Of all attitudes this one is the most irksome and distasteful to a born soldier : to a cavalier like Ouster , whose every instinct was to attack , it was peculiarly trying . The young warrior , who had worn a general 's stars and swept the field with his clouds of victorious horsemen , found himself wearing the modest leaves of a field officer . Instead of a division of veteran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recruits in a newly raised regiment . Major General Custer , the brilliant , was transformed to plain Lieutenant Colonel Custer , to await the slow progress of seniority for promotion , with the knowledge that no deed of his , however brilliant , could advance him a step further . In war time , when the best men are indispensable , it may do to promote for merit . In peace the claims of red tape and seniority can not be disregarded . The only concession due to past services was found in taking the field officers of the new regiments from among the young generals who had led the volunteers to victory in the civil war . Many of the volunteer generals , seeing no chance of distinction in the service , retired to civil life and prospered . About twenty appear in the list of field officers to more than a hundred and fifty froifi other sources . Few generals but the West Pointers remained in the army , though the lower ranks of officers were full of ex-volunteers , men who had commanded regiments being content with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seniority a step in ten years . The condition of our regular army after the close of the war was far from good . The fact of so many men being willing to come down in life for a small certainty of support , instead of taking their chances of earning a living in civil pursuits , argued badly for their energy and ambition . The result soon appeared in a deterioration of the standard . The number of court-martials increased ; the men , dissatisfied with their officers , deserted ; the officers , soured and disappointed , with small prospect of success , became careless ; and the whole army was a very different body from the little army of 1860 . The result could hardly have been avoided , and the political methods of appointment to the lower grades operated as a further injury . Instead of procuring the best of the volunteer officers for the new and old regiments , in many instances very poor ones were admitted , some by the influence of political relatives , others by bargain and sale through the claim agents at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snug berth for a lazy man , and too many such entered the force from 1865 to 1867 . Matters , however , soon regulated themselves . The influence of the small aristocratic corps of West Pointers was all-powerful here . Its high traditions of the honor of the service operated with remarkable success to throw off the waste matter of the army . The reductions in force which took place in successive years , and the operation of the compulsory retiring board , currently termed the " benzine board , ** weeded out the poor material , and restored the army to its normal condition more rapidly than might have been thought possible . // SEPTEMBER , In the midst of these conditions , with a regiment composed of green recruits , largely tempered with chronic deserters , Custer went to the plains with the Seventh Cavalry . Here his old experience could avail him little . He had to learn everything over again . As green in Indian warfare as the newest subaltern just joined from " the Point , " he had the additional disadvantage from the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of force on the plains , and of being thrown on his own respon*ibility . The career of Custer on the plains is marked by the same qualities that gave him success in the civil war . Above all things he loved a charge and a fair fight , and always preferred the attack to the defence . The readers of " The Galaxy " are familiar with his greatest exploit in the southwest , the destruction of Black Kettle 's band on the Washita river . It was a type of his whole career on the plains . To that warfare Custer brought originality of conception , and along with Sheridan , seized on the only proper objective for an Indian campaign . The Indian has but one vulnerable point , his village ; and that village he always removes at the first signal of hostilities . Custer 's great and overpowering success on the Washita was the first indication that the white man had learned how to circumvent the most wily Indian . Its success was closely followed by the pacification of the most formidable savages that had troubled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a model of success , fairly earned and fairly deserved , from its commencement to its close . We do not intend to tell its story here , for that has been already done by its principal actor in a style so vivid and picturesque that art could not improve it . In this as in all his Indian fights , Custer deliberately embraced the policy of attack under any and all circumstances , and found himself as successful as ever . He seems to have very quickly imbibed the nature of a frontiersman , apparently reckless and foolhardy at times , but really cool and calculating . In a country where danger is perpetual the most timid policy is unavailable to secure safety , and the boldest generally succeeds . In a frontier country the gambling element is one which enters largely into the composition of all successful hunters and scouts . Living in the midst of perils , where it is necessary in nine cases out of ten to take the chances of killing or being killed in order to obtain the commonest rights of the citizen , each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frontiersman 's confidence in his own special immunity from the common lot of mortals . His life is a succession of escapes from death : he is no sooner out of one danger than into another . Very soon after his appearance on the plains , Custer 's character developed into that of a perfect frontiersman with which moreover his appearance corresponded . The old jaunty velvet jacket slashed with gold was replaced by the even more elaborate buckskin hunting dress , with all its capes and fringes , and his golden locks grew longer and wilder than ever in a land where long hair was the fashion among the scouts . He was always fighting with superior forces , always embarking on perilous expeditions , and always coming out triumphant under the benign influence of " Custer 's luck . " Some of those adventures and perils he has recorded ; but there are many more equally interesting which will now very probably never see the light unless some of his comrades take up the tale . It is observable in that series of sketches entitled " Life on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those events in his frontier career which have a public bearing . Of private and merely personal incidents , he only tells those which occur in the course of public events , and never hesitates to tell a story // qwq punishing him severely , although the field of battle remained in Crook 's hands . The latter was , however , crippled to such an extent that he fell back , and failed to disturb Sitting Bull 's camp , the objective point of the expedition . The next news that came was that Gibbon had been stopped at the crossing of a river , had lost some horses , and that he too was unable to proceed . All the hopes of the expedition now lay with Terry 's column , which , starting later than the rest , was moving toward Gibbon and the camp of Sitting Bull . The most sanguine hopes were now placed on the success of this column , chiefly for the reason that it contained Custer , the favorite of fortune , the most renowned Indian fighter of the plains , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time since the war that the regiment which Custer 's influence had moulded from a discontented mass of green recruits into a crack corps of Indian fighters had been united . The previous occasion was at the battle of the Washita , when the Seventh had triumphed under the magic influence of " Custer 's luck . " Was it to be wondered that high hopes were entertained by them and all their friends of their success on the present occasion , when they were accompanied by a strong force of infantry and a battery of the renowned Gatling guns , while every day brought them nearer to Gibbon ? At last the junction was effected ; and the united forces , secure in their own strength , began to search for the enemy . Then it was that Major Reno , of the Seventh , despatched on a scouting expedition to hunt up Indian signs , came across the broad and palpahle track of a great Indian village on the march from the valley of the Rosebud and going straight toward the Little Horn , one of the secondary tributaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sitting Bull , and returned at once to Terry to make his report . Now it was that occurred the second serious mistake of the campaign . We who are wise after the fact , can see it ; but it is hard to say on whom the blame of the losses which followed should be fairly laid , except it be on the commander of the whole column . Terry committed the fatal error of dividing his forces ; for which , however , it is difficult to judge him severely when we remember how scant were his means of information of the real strength of the enemy . This was owing principally to the vicious strategy of the campaign . The three columns were on exterior lines , without communication with each other , while Sitting Bull was in the centre . Terry had no means of knowing the number of his foe , for he had known nothing of the rough handling given to Crook 's large force on the Rosebud . He imagined , as Crook had , that Sitting Bull 's band of less than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had yet to learn that the Sioux chief had been joined by the Arapahoes and Cheyennes , as well as by other bands of his own nation . His only fear was that the wily savage had already had notice of his approach , and would probably be able to escape if he followed with his whole column , retarded as it was by infantry and slow-moving wagons . To catch the lively-moving Indians it was necessary to be as light as they , and there was the whole Seventh Cavalry , with its renowned leader , famous for successful enterprises of exactly the same sort . It is also quite possible that a sentiment of generosity , entirely creditable to Terry , dictated the order which sent Custer with the Seventh Cavalry to the front . To give Custer full credit of the anticipated conquest over Sitting Bull , he was detached with his regiment as an independent command , and moved forward by forced marches to the attack . It appears from Terry 's despatches that he intended the Seventh Cavalry to execute a long detour , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camp , while he with the infantry followed on the straight road toward the Little // 1876 . Horn , timing the advance so that both columns should unite together at the Indian camp on the 26th of June . Terry and all his command were totally unaware that the trail they had struck in the Rosebud valley was the trail of the same village whose warriors had so suddenly swarmed out on Crook on the 17th . They were coming from the north , Crook from the south , and the Indians lay between them , the country swarming with their scouts and preventing any communication . The story that follows is brief . Custer pressed on , straight up the Rosebud , to its junction with the Little Horn , found the whole force of the Indians camped all along the river , and charged in on them just as he had done at the Washita a few years before . There was , however , this important difference between the two cases . At the Washita there were three different camps , and nearly as many Indians as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' caused him to strike only the camp at one end of the line , which he destroyed by surprise ; and he had the further advantage of keeping the others all in his front much demoralized . At the Little Horn he struck the very centre of a line of lodges several miles long , and the enemy was waiting for him . Reno , whose attack on one flank of this line most resembled the Washita attack* had not sufficient force to make it effective ; but he managed to escape after a severe mauling . * Custer 's attack , even had he known what was before him , had not a chance of success . This he must have seen as soon as he found himself fairly surrounded . Only one thing remained for the five companies of the Seventh Cavalry and * After the August number of " The Galaxy " had left the hands of the editor some account of the engagement in which General custer fell was inserted under the head of " Galaxy Miscellany and Advertiser , " to accompany a portrait of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the news of his death . As this hastily written account , based upon the early newspaper despatches , reflected upon Brevet Colonel Reno , U. S. A. , major of the Seventh Cavalry , it is due to Colonel Reno to 871 their young leader  --  to die fighting , and impress the Indians with respect for the white man by their deaths . That Custer did this is proved by one affecting circumstance . In the midst of the circle of dead bodies which marked the last stand of the remnant that was left , lay the body of the young chief , with a bullet in his brain and one in his heart , but unmutilated*-the only body which enjoyed the distinction . This is only recorded of one other person in former fights-a boy bugler , who had behaved with superhuman bravery in a certain fight , and whose body was left untouched by the savages as a token of respect . It shows that in all that little band of men who were found lying dead on the skirmish line where they had fought , brave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , so magnificent in his courage that even his savage foes reverenced his valor . " Custer 's luck ! " he is reported to have cried when he first caught sight of the village of the Sioux chief , dreaming of another Washita . He found a greater battle than the Washita , and better luck for his future fame than any Washita could have given him . He found the one thing needed to complete his character as an ideal hero of romance  --  a glorious and terrible death on the battlefield . No jarring chord disturbs the harmony of his career . The incarnation of courage , he never quailed in all his life . He lived long enough to add to the spurs of the cavalry king the trophies of the best Indian fighter on the continent ; and he died the only man on record whose death in Indian w*Terfare was as proud and heroic as that of Leonidas at the Pass of Death .
