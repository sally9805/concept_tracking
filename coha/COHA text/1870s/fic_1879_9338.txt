THE BIG BONANZA The Big Bonanza was not ill-named . At the time it was produced , Daly was in financial straits . The first Fifth Avenue Theatre had burned on January 1 , 1873 , and the new Fifth Avenue which opened on Twenty-eighth Street near Broadway after a short season at 728 Broadway , had fallen upon hard times . The play was a bonanza to Daly in more ways than one . Not only did it relieve the momentarily desperate situation at the new Fifth Avenue Theatre , where it was acted for the first time on February 17 , 1875 , but it was the beginning of that long series of farce-comedies adapted from the German which were for many years the delight of New York . The original of The Big Bonanza was Gustav von Moser 's Ultimo , which had appeared in Berlin in 1874 . Daly followed the situations and characters of his original very closely , though transposing the scenes to New York City . The lines he rendered more freely by giving the sense rather than a literal translation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Daly 's career is heightened by the fact that it introduced as a member of the Fifth Avenue Theatre company a young man from a well-established theatrical family of Philadelphia , John Drew . The newcomer was welcomed by most of the critics , one of whom thought he had talents that could " scarcely fail to raise him to a position of prominence as an interpreter of light comedy " ( New York Dispatch ) . Another , somewhat more harsh , declared that he had " intelligence , self-possession and a certain odd sense of humor which is attractive , " but he lacked " that finish and culture which are required on New York boards for the portrayal of ' walking gentlemen 's ' parts " ( Daily Graphic ) . Concerning the play itself , there was a marked difference of opinion , the majority of the critics disapproving pretty strongly . William Winter was caustic . As a piece of dramatic construction or literary composition , as a picture of life and character , it has no claim to consideration . The dialogue drivels through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one spark of wit , not one bright thought , not even a gleam of smartness . The play can hardly be said to have a plot . The story involves itself without any cause , and is straightened out at the end without any reason .... The whole mixture is like fragments of a multitude of farces shaken up in a kaleidoscope.  --  New York Tribune , Feb. 18 , 1875 . The Herald recognized that " the public requires this quality of dramatic composition , " but thought that " it might , however , be worth while producing better work of the same class , if they are to be found . " The same viewpoint was expressed somewhat more superciliously by another critic six months later when Daly revived the play in a supplemental summer season with Maurice Barrymore making his New York dbut in John Drew 's rle of " Bob Ruggles . " " The Big Bonanza " is one of the most remarkable instances on record of the appetite of the average American for " hash " that is warmed up . This voluminous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The allusions to the stock market threw all the ablebodied men into paroxysms of pleasure , and the quasi-fashionable dresses and airs of the female players were accepted as proofs supreme of histrionic genius .  --  New York World , Aug. 24 , 1875 . Such critical snobbishness was assailed by the Daily Graphic : " The Big Bonanza " is the same sort of piece as " Saratoga , " " Diamonds , " and other plays of Bronson G. Howard 's  --  pieces , by the way , most ingeniously and maliciously attacked by our local critics . There is a place on every modern stage for a class of pieces which is neither farce nor comedy but which has many of the characteristics of both . People go into a place of amusement to be amused , and bright dialogue , eccentric characterizations and queer and unexpected situations are sure to be pleasing .... The plot of " The Big Bonanza " is not worth giving , but the play abounds in humorous situations , and is constantly moving the audience to merriment . It is well mounted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admirably represented by the members of Mr. Daly 's company .  --  Feb. 18 , 1875 . The Big Bonanza was not as popular as Divorce , but it received 137 performances , closing the New York season on June 28 , 1875 . Cast changes were numerous toward the close as many of the regular members of the Fifth Avenue Theatre company left with Daly before the end of the play 's run on a tour to San Francisco . The new piece was an important item in the repertoire of the touring company . In Chicago , where it was given for slightly more than two weeks beginning June 14 , it was welcomed for its " downright roaring fun " in spite of being " dreadfully talky . " " ' The Bonanza , ' " said the Chicago Times , " is scarcely up to what it was expected to be , and ... is not likely to astonish the natives . " San Franciscans , native or otherwise , failed to be impressed by the play when the Daly troupe arrived at the Golden Gate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attributed to the production , only a few weeks before , of Bulls and Bears , Bartley Campbell 's version of the same piece , were it not that all of the plays of the repertoire suffered in the same way . When the play was given in Boston , October 18 , 1875 , with a Boston Museum cast headed by William Warren , a slipshod attempt seems to have been made to localize the production . Boston stores and , in some instances , Boston streets replaced New York stores and streets . It is not impossible that other revisions were made in the play from time to time , as the number of acts , as reported by the critics , varies from four to six and the printed version , though claiming five acts on the title page , actually has but four . The play kept the stage in New York for about three years , chiefly as a starring vehicle for James Lewis . The last New York performance of which I have record occurred May 2 , 1878 , at the Park Theatre . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minor houses in 1885 , and in the latter city a revival featuring William Courtleigh as " Bob " was favorably received on July 10 , 1899 . As was usual with Daly 's successes , The Big Bonanza was an inspiration to other playwrights . In addition to Campbell 's rival , and not too successful version , there was at least one burlesque which was produced in Boston under the title of The Two Bonanzas several months before the Boston Museum gave its localized version . Sol Smith Russell appeared in the burlesque . The privately printed edition of 1884 is the basis of the present text .

Here 's this morning 's paper , Taking it out and slapping it a family newspaper , containing the stock quotations . In it I have just read that the great Seal Oil Company pays 12 per cent dividend , and yet its stock sells for 63 cents on the dollar . Now where is the logic , the common sense , the arithmetic of those facts ? A stock that pays 12 per cent dividend , ought certainly to be above par .
