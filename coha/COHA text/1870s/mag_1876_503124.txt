I WAS encamped for a while near the banks of the Jordan in the vicinity of a camp of Bedouins , of whom , a part of the time , I was the guest . Orientalists make a point of calling them Bedawin , which is something after the pronunciation of the native , but in order to be understood by all I prefer to adhere to the accepted and older name . Besides , if the practice of pronouncing like the Arabs were observed , it would lead to some confusion . Aceldama would be called Agheldama , Kedron Khedron , and soon . Further , it is not in the capacity of English letters to give all the sounds of the Arabic tongue . Agheldama and sheikh , for instance , give after all but an imperfect idea of the way these words are pronounced by the natives . The chief of the tribe , Mahmoud , was in the neighboring camp , but only a small number of his people were with him ; perhaps thirty or forty in all . Their presence afforded an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bedouins inhabiting this region of country , which I was not sorry to avail myself of . The ground on which our tents were pitched was of pleasant aspect , surrounded by trees in which the bulbul , or Palestine nightingales , continuously sang their songs , and once in a while a gorgeous blue kingfisher displayed his plumage . In sight were the potatoblossoms of the apple of Sodom , and strewn on the ground underneath lay some of its yellow fruit , beautiful to the eye , but full of ashes and bitterness within . On the borders of the stream were little wrens hopping among the branches of the tamarisk . In the neighborhood was a thorny tree , which , according to the spiritual authorities , bears the true balm of Gilead , whose oil is sought and carried away by the enthusiastic pilgrims as a panacea for human ills . Across the Jordan to the east arose the dark blue mountains e.f Moab , extending from north to south like an unbroken wall ; to the west the hills of Judea with their white , chalky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dead Sea , shining under a constant sun . Around us were the plains  --  the old historical plains which were once the gardens of Cleopatra , a munificent gift of the enamored Antony , and by turns the property of Hcrod and of the knights of Jerusalem , who lived in state around the Holy Sepulchre from the princely revenue gathered from this once fertile soil . The chief , Mahmoud , made us the first visit , with a half dozen followers . The usual mouth hospitalities were offered , such as the coffee and the chibouque , which were accompanied with the usual hyperbolical compliments , and the graceful raising of the hand from the mouth to the forehead . Our pigeon Arabic only served on the outskirts of the conversational domain , and the services of the dragoman were Boon brought into requisition . As they sat , Mrs. B and her daughter of our party asked a question at the entrance of the tent as a pretext for taking a look at the sons of the desert , and the sitting Arabs ignored their presence .. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stranger of the male sex and their indifference toward the other sex . This conduct piqued handsome Miss B , who said she could not see the poetry in the barbarous nature which some people admired . The eyes of Mahmoud had passed over her as if she were a part of the far.off Moab mountains . After a visit of half an hour and many assurances of lasting friendship , our guests left us . The bearing and courtesy of the chief suggested a grandee of Srain 8U ? le retour , a Don Osesar do Bazan in his moments of dig- // JULY , nity . One of the results of the visit was the loss of several spoons , two tooth-brushes , and a piece of soap . B , the father of Miss B , just mentioned , was something of a naturalist , and when Malimoud saw the enthusiastic collector energetically beating about in the sun for specimens of plants and shells , he followed his movements with interest , then tapped his forehead with his forefinger , and shook his head , intimating that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observed to treat B with that unusual consideration which Arabs pay to persons of unsound mind . Thereafter B was quizzed by his daughter , never slow in seizing any pretext for mirth , concerning the bee in his bonnet , in which she imitated the tapping of the forehead and shaking of the head of the Bedouin chief in a way that showed natural aptitude for mimicry . B and myself , in response to an invitation to dinner from Mahmoud , repaired to the camp of our neighbors , directing our steps to the principal tent , which was looped up in front . Part of the tent was closely screened off for the women ; the middle portion of the apartment into which we entered was supplied with Turkish carpets and cushions something the worse for wear . The chief took us each by the hand and ushered us to seats on the carpets with a courtesy not unworthy a courtier of the time of Louis XIV . Besides the chief , were three other Bedouins , who according to the hierarchy of the tribe were assigned places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position , apparently , squatted on the ground off the carpets . Coffee was prepared , as a preliminary to the dinner , in our presence . Before we began to eat there was the hand-wash enjoined by the Koran . The water was poured on our hands out of a jug outside the tent , about half a pint being allotted to each . The process was brief . The Arabs swung their hands , flapped them on their garments , and it was done  --  and they were no cleaner than before . This clearly was not the hygienic operation which Mahomet intended it to be , but as may be inferred from this description , people here as elsewhere are prone to obey the letter of the law rather than its spirit . I observed subsequently that when they desired to cleanse themselves more thoroughly they rubbed their hands with sand , and on rare occasions with soap . Semi-purified , we returned to our places in the tent , and the repast was served without a woman in sight . It consisted of a huge wooden bowl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ batter cakes and overhanging the sides , the bowl being filled with boiled rice saturated with grease , probably butter made from goat 's or camel 's milk ; in the centre of the rice was piled up a quantity of boiled mutton . The chief setting the example , we fell to on this mess , while the retainers and our dragoman , off the carpets , eyed us with envy and watered mouths . For a man accustomed to a knife and fork the eating presented difficulties , which , however , were partially overcome by closely observing the men who have never known any other aid in this way than what nature has given them . Yet they have an etiquette which governs them as tyrannically as our own . Only the right hand may be thrust into the bowl . He who eats with the left is ill bred , and he who employs both is a glutton . We imitated our hosts as well as we could ; thrust the right hand into the rice , made a bowl of it the size of a hen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it , and twitched it into the mouth by a dexterous movement of the thumb , after the Bedouin manner , pronouncing occasionally the indispensable " taYb " in compliment to the Amphitryon . Another feature of Arab etiquette was to confine oneself to the same place in taking from the bowl , each one making his own hole and remaining therein . In the beginning of the re* past there is not much trouble in ohserving the rule ; but when the general level of the rice and mutton lowered // it required care to remain on the preempted domain , and not invade that of the neighbor . The rule was hardly observed by my neighbor on the left , who was a voracious eater , with an indifferently clean hand ; he at length ate away the barrier , entered my territory , and pushed me to the right , where I fed on a narrow ledge until my appetite was satisfied ; when this gave way , and the two holes merged into one , I stopped . To a man seated at one of Delmonico @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but to a hungry one on the banks of the Jordan it was different , and both B and myself ate of the great platter with pleasure a few minutes after it was brought in , for in the beginning it was too hot for us , although not for our neighbors , who had a skilled way of dancing the rice about between their fingers to cool it , which we endeavored in vain to acquire . They also dexterously stripped the meat from the bone , one finger going down and rising after another on the burning mutton , as if playing a lively air on the violia . Our old proverb tells us that fingers were anterior to forks ; and if we of today had been born a thousand years earlier , it is probable that we would have had no prejudice on the subject . To realize how deeply rooted this is we have only to think of the aversion inspired in polite society by him who eats with his knife . He may be intelligent , good , and wealthy , yet this act will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is simply a question of introducing into the mouth three or four prongs of silver instead of an inch or two of a blade of steel . The fork people aver that there is danger in using the knife , while the knife people affirm that there is fully as much in using the fork . The cases where the knife man cuts himself are probably rare , and this argument is doubtless employed to give reason to those who eat with a fork . From an esthetic point of view , it is certainly more pleasing to look at a man who uses the fork . From the same point , after divesting oneself of conventional opinions , it is perhaps more pleasing to regard him who performs the office with his fingers-not fingers that are all thumbs , but clean , clever , and graceful fingers . On a subsequent occasion I had an opportunity of seeing this done by a Christianized Arab woman . Her hands were small and handsome , which indeed are characteristic signs in her race . Just before the repast her hands , already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soft perfumed napkin . Each bit of viand was conveyed to the mouth with a natural charm which invested the act with poetry . She ate heartily as well as gracefully . When through , she washed her hands with sweet-smelling soap , the attendant pouring fresh water on them before they were dried . That I was permitted to enjoy this scene of finger-eating was owing to the fact of her being a Christian , as Arabs of Moslem faith veil before strangers , except those of Egypt , who veil to the eyes , and the fellahin throughout the Turkish domains , whose abject condition renders them indifferent in this particular . The women of the fellahin not only eat in public , but perform other acts which it would be indiscreet to describe . It should be observed that the veiling among Moslems of the town is more closely adhered to than among those of the desert , where the faces of the women are occasionally seen . As the feast progressed  --  to return to our dinner  --  the subordinates continued to regard us with the expression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we stopped the chief in his character of host urged us to take more . He went so far as to make a ball with his own hand and to attempt , by gentle persuasion , to introduce it into my mouth ; but meeting with resistance he twirled it into his own with the adroit movement which challenged the admiration of his guests each time that they saw it . // When we were satisfied , the great platter , still about half full , was handed over to the waiting group of attendants , who ate voraciously . After they had finished , a small portion of food still remained . It was taken away , and soon the sound of women 's voices muffled with food was heard through the thin partition . That is , the leavings of the man were given to the woman , and she accepted them without a murmur because she knew no other treatment . It is part of the Arabic nature to be polite to the man and neglectful to the woman . Fortunate indeed is she who is born in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remind Mrs. B and her daughter of the privileges they enjoyed ; but they did not appear to see them with the same conviction as ourselves . We were furnished with soap and water after the remnants of food had disappeared . The Arabs went through the hand-ablution after us , but rather as a matter of form . Then the coffee was prepared , and of such fragrance that the manner of doing it deserves notice . A tin pan , something the shape of a soup plate perforated like a nutmeg grater , containing a few green coffee berries , was held over a flameless wood fire by a long handle . As soon as the grains were roasted on one side they were singly turned over , and when done were mashed hot in a hollowed block with a wooden pestle , and immediately turned into a pot of boiling water , which was allowed to simmer a few minutes , and then the coffee was served , of slimy thickness , and of excellent aroma . The six diners of the first guild could not however at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of which there were only three , more or less cracked , and Mahmoud and the two guests first partook . In sipping it we more than ever realized the fact that to have fragrant coffee it must be made hot from the roasting , which housewives and cooks would do well to make a note of , as it is for their benefit that the process is described . It was plain our coflVive8 prided themselves on their breeding . As they sipped the coffee they made a noise with their lips such as the horse makes in drinking , which is here the sign of the man accustomed to the usages of polite society ; he who is in the habit of doing it noiselessly being regarded as a person whose social education has been neglected . " Solace of the soul , " said Mahmoud , making the sound through his lips , " he that possesses thee , a pipe , and a mare , is blest among men. * ' Next pipes were handed around , the wants of the stomach being satisfied . Mahmoud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the narcotic , remarked , with unctuous conviction , " Life is sweet . " What pleased him most in our equipments was the revolver , which he handled with infantile wonder . He and his people possessed nothing but old , long-barrelled , match-lock guns ; hence was a pistol with a capacity for shooting six times a terriblo instrument of destruction . It is related that an Englishman , straying from his party on the other side of the Jordan in the Moab mountains , was attacked by about thirty Arabs , when he placed his back against a rock , drew his revolver , and shot five of them , the rest taking flight and crying out that it was the devil in the disguise of a man . But Mahmoud was more in the movement than these Arabs of the interior , and it was his ambition to possess this arm . We saw some of the women of the tribe engaged in their domestic occupations . Two were grinding grain with probably the same kind of primitive mill referred to in the Scriptures : two stones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turning on the other , two handles being inserted in the upper one by which to turn . They sang a low , nasal ditty as they turned , the stones making an accompaniment something like the grinding of one of our coffee-mills . Another was engaged in churning , the churn consisting of a goatskin shorn // 47 of its hair and sewed up at the ends , looking like the carcass of the animal from whose back it was taken , less the head and legs . It was hung between two upright stakes , and was swung back and forth with a jerk until the butter was made , usually from goat 's milk . Others were kneading bread and baking it on the glowing embers in cakes about an inch thick or less , and as large as a good-sized plate . The Arab on a journey habitually puts one of these cakes of unleavened bread in his breast between shirt and skin , and when it is brought forth for consumption it is often moistened with his perspiration . Nor does he hesitate to offer a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be warm from his body . With this and the sour milk of the camel , he will journey for days without other food . Nature has given him the nature of the camelsobriety , dry flesh , and power of endurance . By way of exchanging hospitalities , the chief and his three principal retainers were invited to dine with us the next day , our dragoman being instructed to keep a sharp lookout after the spoons , knives , and any other liftable articles around the tent . They came at the appointed time , and decorously took their seats , and dignifiedly leaned against the cushions provided for them around a low , round table , which was set in European fashion with plates , knives and forks . They manifested no surprise , which is in accordance with Arabic nature . Had we begun by balancing the spoons on our noses , it is probable they would have regarded us with the same impassability . When , however , Mrs. B and her daughter took their places at table a quick glance of surprise appeared , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kind was visible during the repast . When soup was served they hesitated about beginning ; we saw what was passing in their minds , and took the initiative , they following . Thus , throughout the dinner , they waited to see what we would do , and then imitated us as well as they could . At the conclusion of the meal Mahmoud made the usual high-flown compliments , and they returned to their camp . The dragoman took an inventory of the contents of the tent after their departure , and only one spoon was found to be missing . Thenextdaylwas presentatatrial , which took place before Mahmoud as judge , between two Bedouins of his tribe but of different camf ) s , for the tribe is made up of several divisions . It was a case of stealing a sheep . The trial was under a tree , the judge sitting , pipe in hand , against the trunk , his back protected by an old cushion . When I came into court he informed me of what was going on , adding that stealing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any allusion to the spoons and other trifles which had disappeared from our tent . He observed with solemnity , as a light spiral drift of smoke curled around his turban , " It is noble in man to respect his neighbor 's property . God is great and Mahomet is his Prophet . " " The expression and practice of such a noble sentiment , 0 Sheikh , does you honor , " said I , adopting the local coloring . He pressed my hand and ejaculated , " TaYb I " which was the " retort courteous . " There was a long wrangle between the plaintiff and the defendant , and during a good portion of the time they both talked at once in that energetic fashion characteristic of the race . Their respective friends from time to time also put in a word . At length the court demanded silence , and it was only obtained when the Judge menaced the disputants with a club within his reach . " I have smoked three pipes since this trial began , " said the Judge sententiously , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay forty piastres down on the ground for the stolen sheep , after which we will proceed to a new trial for the assault . " // Here was light on Arabic law among the Bedoujas . The man from whom the animal was stolen on discovering the thief struck him with his hand and endeavored to choke him . If he had struck him with sword or club , the assault would have been less serious from the Arabic point of view ; for it is not considered dishonorable to be struck with a weapon , but an indignity to be smitten with the hand . Thus the case was complicated , and the Judge simplified it by trying each grievance apart . The thief naturally endeavored to show how badly he had been assaulted , and the wrangle began again , he winding up with words something like these : " Did he strike me with a sabre , o wise Judge ? No . Did he beat me with a gun , or even a stick ? No . If he had , I should have felt such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takiag his sheep-which , by the way , was done in mistake-but iastead of taking some arm which any honorable man takes to smite another , what did he do ? In the name of the Prophet , what did he do , 0 Judge ? Tell it not in the desert , tell it not in the tents of the women . I blush to avow it , 0 excellent Sheikh ! lie outrageously smote me with his hand ; he choked me with it , and I still live to relate it- " The Judge here interrupted him , saying that he had smoked three pipes , and the trial was consequently over . It only remained for him to give his decision , which was that he who had struck the sheep-stealer with the hand should pay him for his wounded honor eighty piastres , adding by way of commentary , that no member of his tribe would be suffered to beat a man as if he were a woman or a child . The commentary was interesting for the man of the West , in the light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tents . Thus the man who lost his sheep was muicted of forty piastres . Thereupon the court adjourned . As may properly be inferred from this trial and the loss of little objects in our tent , the Arab is given to stealing . To be a successful robber is not considered an objectionable trait of character . If you are under his tent , and have eaten salt with him , then only are you safe . The robbing of members of his own tribe is of common occurrence ; it is considered unworthy of the Arab gentleman , but at the same time he who is given to it does not altogether forfeit general respect . In other words , it is not regarded as an act exactly criminal . To rob an enemy is heroic , and is celebrated in many of the Arab songs . He who is bold and skilful in this way is held up to the youth as an example for imitation . The accounts of such exploits inspire the same spirit of emulation which the stories of George Washington and his hatchet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lightning , do in our boys . Camel stealing is practised more generally than other hinds of robbery , owing to the facilities which the animal offers in its removal , as it rises from its recumbent position and walks away without noise on its sponge-like feet . When a band are bent on robbing , three of the most skilful steal toward the camp at midnight . The first attracts the attention of the dogs behind the tent , and they fly toward him barking , and are thus led off some distance in his pursuit . The second cuts the strings tied about the legs of the camels , makes them rise up gently , leads off a she camel , and the others follow . While he is doing this , the third robber stands on one side of the tent-opening with a club , ready to knock down any one issuing from it . When he sees his companion well out of the way with the animals he runs after him , they each catch a camel by the tail and pull vigorously , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the others following to the appointed place of meeting , where the first confederate joins them . There is jey over the loot successfully carried off , but when the robber is caught the other side of the medal // is seen . He becomes the prisoner of the first man who touches him , is bound hand and foot , and taken into his tent , where he is soundly beaten . A ransom is demanded of him of a value considered proportionate to his means . He affects poverty and gives a false name . He is kept on low fare , receives an occasional beating , and is kept a close prisoner in a tent which is a rude penance for a man accustomed to the freedom of the desert . Meanwhile the haggling goes on about the ransom , the prisoner offering a small one and his keeper asking a large one , the former hoping all the time that he will be rescued by his friends . The ransom is sometimes so heavy that the prisoner 's possessions do not suffice , and his friends are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this they invariably do if necessary , for they stand shoulder to shoulder in misfortune with a tenacity rarely found in other peoples . After a certain degree of intimacy had been established between us Mahmoud saluted me with more than usual affability as I approached his tent one day , the salutation being , " Peace be with you , " which , as will be observed , is quite simple compared to the extravagant greetings of Cairo , where an acquaintance 's manner of saying good morning often is , " May your day be white " ; to which the inevitable response is , " May yours be like milk . " He asked me if I liked his people , and if I did not think they were happy . My answers were such as he expected . There was something else , however , on his mind , which after a silence he communicated to me . He invited me to come and live with him , saying that if I did so , he would give me in marriage a handsome young girl called " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he pointed to where she was at that moment . My eyes followed the direction of his finger , and I saw , thirty or forty yards off , a symmetrical girl jerking a goatskiim back and forth-in other words , churning goat 's milk  --  and before I could stop him he had sent for her . She swung the sloshing fluid two or three times vigorously to make it go for some time , and then ran toward us , but her step became slower when she saw there was a stranger present . Mahmoud informed her of the proposition he had made to me . She was sixteen , with the development of one of our women of twenty . A veil was partly drawn across her face with sufficient indiscretion to show that she was comely . She looked at me furtively , and according to the interpreter who was present , asked naively , " Does my lord like pilaf ? " Without waiting for instruction the interpreter answered in the affirmative , when she added , " And ra-hat-lacoom ? " To which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her chief desire was to know if the future partner of her joys and sorrows was fond of rice and something resembling figpaste . " Taib , taib , " said the chief , waving his hand , and she ran away with the grace of a gazelle . " You see , " pursued the chief , " she is as lithe as one of the willows there which overhangs the Jordan , and as beautiful as a dream . Are you a sheikh in your country beyond the sea ? " He was informed that I belonged to the rank and file of humanity , when he said he would raise me to chieftaincy on my wedding day with the young person who had just left us . I explained that I could not av*dl myself of his matrimonial offer , as I was obliged to return to my home . " Marry her for the time you live with us , and when you leave divorce her , " was his reply , which was a significant commentary on the marriage relations of this curious people . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immoral in my country , and that such a proposition could not be entertained . At this he removed the chibouque from his mouth , emitted a long thin breath of smoke , and philosophically re-marked , // " What a strange people ! " We often strolled to the ford of the Jordan , usually designated as the place of John 's baptisms . Around us were swarthy men in shirts of camel 's hair , girdled at the waist , who , besides sour milk and pilaf , fed on locusts and wild honey , and who drank neither wine nor any other liquor . We idealized more than one Abdallah of the Wilderness into likeness with that Prophet whom Pilate regarded as the agitator and leader of a new faction . Messiahs there had been before , but they took up the sword to spread their faith , and perished by it . At length there came one who was without sword , who spoke evil of none , and laid the corner-stone of the new religion of love and charity . The enthusiastic man had stood in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ multitudes who came down from Jerusalem and Galilee . We had come through the Wilderness where the forerunner so long dwelt-that dry , uninhabited region lying between the hills of Judea , the Dead Sea , and the Jordan  --  and we felt in looking at the dusky men of this waste , that we had a better idea of the appearance of the men of eighteen hundred years ago than we ever had before . We were not far from the site of the ancient Jericho , once called the " City of the Palms . " One solitary tree of this description is seen in the neighborhood , which is a picture of desolation . The ancient palaces , vast circus , and avenues lined with sycamore , balsam , and palm trees , were no more . Here was the last resting-place of Herod the Great after being driven out of Jerusalem ; here he was at bay until he died , still practising his cruelty and finding his pleasure in Hellenic and Roman amusements . Over this ground he drove in Roman chariots ; on this spot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gladiators . Of all these splendors there are now a score or two of mud huts , with cornstalk roofs , enclosed by a wall of brush and stones . About one hundred and fifty heads are covered by these roofs , and they belong to a small tribe of the most abject and miserable Arabs in Palestine . They are dirty , attenuated , licentious , poor , and indolent . Their originally black hair appeared to be frizzled by the powerful sun into a reddish brown , and the complexion given them by the sun was made darker through want of soap and water . They are looked upon with contempt by Jew , Arab , and Gentile . They claim kin with a tribe of Bedouins dwelling in the south , but these do not admit the relationship . They represent , in a word , the lowest type of humanity . Yet forbidding as they are , they have found an English writer who calls them " winsome , " which forces those who have seen these poor wretches to a conclusion not flattering to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of numerous instances of inexactitude in those who have written concerning this country , which arises from a disposition to depend on natives such as dragomans and mukarees for facts . These are , as every one familiar with them knows , untrustworthy in any statements they make which may be in the remotest degree against their interests . The only way to get at the truth , it is hardly necessary to say , is to see and verify for oneself . The forlorn inhabitants of this village , which is called Er Riha , insisted on giving us a fantasia " in front of our tents . Two dozen of them , consisting chiefly of women , formed in front of the camp , with that strange shout of the " trill la Ia la " peculiar to Arab women . One with a scarf in each hand advanced before the others , and danced rather by contortions and swaying to and fro of the body and movements of the arms than by lifting of the feet . It was the dance , a trifle modified , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the perfection to which it attains in the Almehs of Egypt , so graphically d&amp;. scribed by one or two French writers . // The beauty of the Egyptian Almehs , and their picturesque costume , have doubtless largely contributed to their reputation ; and when described by a poet like Mr. Curtis , in his " Nile Notes of a Howadji , " they are invested with many charms . A gulf separates the dancers of the Nile from those of Jericho , and we were only too willing to get rid of them by giving backshish . There was some grace of movement displayed , but there was also what we considered a certain impropriety for the eyes of our two gentle spectators , and this added to our desire to send them away , which was effected after some wrangling , without which nothing is accomplished in the East . Two Arab guards that we had brought with us from Jerusalem , in concert with the people of Mahmoud 's tribe , gave us another " fantasia , " consisting of songs in the usual nasal two-four time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words were more or less improvised , and were in praise of their chief and ourselves . In those relating to us the stimulating motive was naturally prospective backshish . They vowed fidelity to their chief ; he was a generous captain and a terror to his enemies ; he was a generous host and the camel of his household , the lion of the desert , and the jackass of the tribe  --  the name jackass not being given in the uncomplimentary sense which we usually attach to it . All this in the vocative , as , 0 camel ! 0 jackass The singing was accompanied with dodging , swaying to and fro , clapping of hands , and those indescribable gutturals and grunts which are a part of the Arab tongue . A rude kind of banjo was the only instrument of music used . This continued for an hour or more , and became very monotonous . They also have their love songs , but they are not generally sung in public . The lover places himself in a secluded spot , within hearing of the beloved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responding with two or three of her wo men friends if his addresses be favorably received . He thus passes the greater portion of the night in calling her the nightingale of the woods , the bulbul of the desert , his cherished gazelle , and similar epithets . If his passion be reciprocated , she in time confesses that he is her camel or her jackass , her women friends joining in the chorus . The camel-drivers when riding or driving often sing by the hour , to beguile their long journeys and stimulate their animals to a brisk pace ; for the camel is known to be fond of this music , indifferent as it is . The love songs say little of the graces of the mind and heart , but dwell monotonously on supposed physical perfections . This is especially the case in Arabs who inhabit the towns , where the first time they know the woman is to possess her . This is less so among the Bedouins , the man and wife having generally passed their childhood together , the affection of early life often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a certain freedom as to the choice of a husband which is denied to the woman of the town , and there are instances where she meets death rather than be united to a man she does not like . A place is shown on the summit of a mountain near Sinai , called the Damsel 's Rock , which marks the syot where two girls who were to have been married in the evening to men they disliked , went up to this elevation , twisted their long hair together , and threw themselves from the precipice . There is not sufficient energy of character in the woman of the town to do this . The Bedonins are more nomadic than is generally believed , for they seldom stay in the same place over three or four days-enough to exhaust the slight pasturage offered by their meagre country  --  and then move on to other grounds . When the whole tribe is in motion , it is usually preceded several miles by half a dozen horsemen to reconnoitre . They are followed by // the body of horsemen and camel-riders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the she camels and their young ; after these , the camels and males laden with the tents and the provisions , and lastly the women and children . In camping , the chief usually pitches his tent on the side next to the Mediterranean , for it is from that side the stranger generally comes , and on such occasions he is held to do the honors . He thrusts his lance into the ground alongside of this temporary abode , and ties his horse in front of it , and his followers do the same-at least those who have horses . The tent is divided into two apartments , the right being occupied by the men and the left by the women and small children . There is some effort at ornament on the men 's side , while the women s is the receptacle of utensils and rubbish . When there is a stranger in the men 's apartment feminine eyes may generally be observed peering through the chinks of the dividing cloth , with that curiosity which belongs to the sex in all lands . Travellers often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a peasant who cultivates a patch of ground in the mountains , not far from a town or village where he sells the products of his garden . Only the hillsides , valleys , and some of the plains of Judea are sufficiently fertile to repay the labor of cultivation . The Bedonin is a wanderer of the plains and the desert , who looks down on the fellab and his peaceful pursuit . The latter is not prepared to resort to arms in defending his property , and the former is . The Bedouin is ostensibly a stock raiser , but he is also a robber and a blackmailer , by profession . His property is on the hoof-camels , horses , sheep , and goats-that is , when he has any . He has a certain beat over which he wanders ; a kind of reservation accorded to him by his neighbors , but from which he makes frequent forays in quest of plunder and new pastures . The treasure of a Bedonin family is a she camel , their vanity being a horse reserved solely for the master @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ butter , to buy barley for the horse . A portion of her milk goes into the goatskin for the daily nourishment of the family . She carries the provisions , the tent , and the women and children . Sure , prudent , and humble , she is of general utility . The gayly colored cloth and fringe are for the horse-for him the coracole and " fantasia . " The camel is the worker and almost the provider of the family . The modern Abraham has no titledeeds to the land over which he roves , and occasionally he gives up his reservation accorded to him by custom to seek more fertile quarters . He also sometimes does it involuntarily , when vanquished by a stronger neighbor . The tenacity of ownership to a plot of ground which characterizes the civilized man is comparatively unknown to him . A clear atmosphere , a blue sky , and a constant sun , with liberty to roam wherever he lists , comprise his idea of happiness . His meagre revenues come from his animals . His mare-when he owns horseflesh it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which he sells as soon as it can safely be separated from the mother . The young of camels , sheep , and goats are also sold , and the trifling wants of the family are supplied from day to day from the sale of butter made from the camels ' milk . So far no insurance company has shown enough temerity to insure this fortune on the hoof , and with reason , for it is almost as precarious as a fortune in the fancy stocks of Wall street . Robbing is so much a custom of the country , that the rich Bedouin of today may be the poor one of to-morrow . The law of might prevails , as far as Syria and Palestine are concerned , except in the strip of imperfect civilization which extends along the coast of the Mediterranean back to the neighborhood of Damascus and Jerusalem . What takes place beyond the Jordan and the Dead Sea is almost a sealed // book .

Cowardice and imbecility see what is going on all over Europe are apt to lead to forced abdication , and America , but here the curtain of when a member of the same family is a semi-barbarous condition shuts off elected to the post . Instances are our view ; all the scenes of pillage and known , however , where the best man massacre are hidden , and we shall has been selected , irrespective of probably never know of them . family . qwq There is no opposition to polygamy from a moral point of view , the institution being in accordance with the teachings of the Koran , but there is from the additional expense which it entails . One wife is a comfort and a pleasure ; two are a luxury which few Bedouins can afford . If , however , they have but one , she is occasionally changed for a new one . In the putting away of wives even Indiana would hardly be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the husband who pronounces the divorce , the wife not being permitted to leave her husband except with his permission . The process is simple : the dissatisfied husband says to his wife , " Thou art divorced , " she mounts a she camel which he gives her as a parting present , and she rides home to the paternal tent . It is said that the thought of parting with the she camel often arrests the decree on the lips of the husband . The cause of the divorce , as in more civilized lands , is frequently the birth of a new passion . The espoused Fatima has borne children , grown plain and somewhat old , and Atalia , the coveted maid , possesses the charms of youth and beauty . The contemplation of the two and the comparison between them brings two contending forces to the mind of the husband , and after a struggle , alas he too often gives up the she camel . And while she is sobbing over the separation in her father 's tent he is glorifying the new acquisition in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for thy feet , 0 love , and the boiling beans shall diffuse their grateful odor . " As may be fancied , the boiling beans do not long continue to diffuse their grateful odor for her benefit . From the poetic maiden in the beginning who was " tall like the cedar of Lebanon , " she becomes a mere servant of her husband . It is natural to suppose that the family of the divorced woman would make complaint , but as a rule they do not . Should , however , a hint be conveyed to him that his treatment of the abandoned woman has not been exactly what it should have been , he simply replies that he did not like her . Sometimes , if the divorced wife is mother of several children , she is allowed to remain with them , and thus becomes a daily witness of her rival 's triumph . In such cases her only consolation is in her children , who are always trained to be rather more affectionate to the mother than to the father . No stigma is attached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she has no voice in the separation . Indeed , no imputation is cast upon her should she be divorced three or four times , though prudent men refrain from making a fourth or fifth matrimonial experience with her . If the wife is very unhappy with her husband , she sometimes flees from him , and seeks refuge with her friends , whither he dare not follow . This separation is tolerated , but it rarely occurs , for the reason that she is not permitted to marry again , while the husband is ' the separation having all the effect of a divorce for him , but not for her . The contemplation of a single life affrights her , and she generally prefers even a husband with whom she is unhappy to none at all . If the man has an affection for the escaped wife , he sometimes induces her to return to the marital tent through presents of sheep and camels to herself and her family . Spinsters and bachelors are very rare  --  the latter can hardly be said to exist . Living nearly in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the exception to find a man or woman not mated . The question of providing for a family , which keeps so many men and women from marrying in the countries of the West , does not exist here . ALBERT RHODES . //
