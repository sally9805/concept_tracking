txt Various efforts are being made in the City by experienced persons to meet the expected pressure of the poorer classes on the means of charity during the coming Winter in a more judicious manner than has been done in fernier years . The State Board of Charity , through Mr. ROOSEVELT , has made a proposition to the City Commissioners of Charity that the distribution of their considerable fund for out-door relief should be made this year under check of responsible citizens who might volunteer for this work . The commission has apparently consented to this , and the committees in the different wards remain to be selected . For the first time , if this plau be wisely carried out , the City 's outdoor relief will be distributed under honest and responsible direction . An effort has also been made to render the organization of the " Association for the Relief of the Poor " more extended and effimut , and new officials have been chosen in the persons of Mr. HOWARD POTTER as President , and Mr. PELLEW as Vice President . The State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charities a comprehensive scheme for distributing alms to the poor , without relieving the unworthy , and under responsible direction . A plan is also under consideration for transporting honest and industrious poor families to those parts of the country where there is abundant demand for labor . Among all these plans , we may well hope that one will be adopted which will relieve extreme want , and yet not feud to pauperize the laboring classes . A Winter of poverty stares us iu the face . Large numbers of working men are thrown out of employment . Business and trade are dull . Many a busy hand , for which there is work enough in good times , finds none in these . Children are thrown ou the street to eke out the family supplies by what they can beg or steal . Poor widows , who in ordinary Winters get sufficient " chore-work " from well-off families to keep above water , now find themselves sinking into penury and distress , and their children almost starving . Laboring men , after two or three bad years , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid with difficulty , and credits with grocers are failing . The severe cold counug so early is a dangerous enemy to the poor , for there many who can afford to buy only the smallest quantities of fuel . Those who once rendered assistance are crippled . The middle class of business and professional people , who supply sine-tenths of all " charity funds " in this City , are cramped for means this year . Much less can be given in private alms . The poor are poorer than ever before , and the well-to-do and charitable are shortened of means . There already begin to appear in the offices of charitable associations that melancholy throng of respectable poor , those who have seen better days , and whom extreme want alone has driven out to seek relief . Shivering child-beggars haunt the hotels and street cornets , aud lodging-houses and station-houses are crowded with youthful or nmture applicants fur shelter . In such a state of things it is manifest that whatever is done to relieve must be done wisely and carefully . The public has less to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do most good . The throng of impostors , " revolvers , " and professional tramps and beggars must be shut out , at least from private alms . The people , too , taught by past experience , should give so as not to pauperize those who receive . The plan which has been suggested by Mr. ROOSEVELT for checking and supervising the public out-door relief , seems to us wise and practical . If there is not time ROW to form committees in every ward , an experiment could be tried in some one very crowded ward  --  say the Eleventh . Each applicant to Mr. KELLOCK for relief could be referred to the volunteer committee to visit and decide upon . Thus , under careful management , every poor person who asked for alms could be relieved to a certain degree , and none of the money in that ward , for out-door relief , could be used for " bribery and corruption . " If the experiment succeeded , the system could be extended another year to other wards , and finally to the whole City . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the City , long familiar with the poor , can be selected as almoners by our citizens . Among these we would particularize the teachers in the industrial schools , the Superintendents of the boys ' and girls ' lodging-houses , the Pastors and Superintendents of the Five Points and other missions and chapels for the poor . No doubt , too , the Association for the Relief of the Poor will , as it has so often done before , distribute private alms in the destitute quarters . The best of all charity is personal , and our readers will do the wisest thing during the coming Winter to find out from such sources as those mentioned above the names of honest and industrious destitute families , and , after inquiry , afford relief and aid directly . Much may also be done in a quiet and careful manner , in forwarding needy and hard-working families to places of work in the country . With judicious management , the bitter wants of this season may be relieved , and no pauperism planted .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
