CoNsTJTUT1oI*AL government means , in the language of the British empire , a certain balance of powers in the State -- a partly traditional and partly statute arrangement which enables the crown , the aristocracy , and the common people , to hold each other in check . More especially it means that the crown can raise no money but by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the House of Commons . In the language of the United States , constitutional government means government under a written constitution-government constituted and limited by a certain statute or written law which it can neither overrule nor change , and which differs from all other statutes in that it is the sovereign charter , from which the power to ordain all other statutes is derived . The constitution creates the government ; and , by the distribution which it makes of the various powers essential to a government , it provides for the enactment of laws , for the administration of justice according to law , for individual liberty , for the security of right against power , and for the conservation of all those common interests which are recognized as coming within the sphere of government . Our idea , therefore , and that which is current among // our British kindred , are alike to this extent : a constitutional government is one in which various powers essential to the State are so adj usted that , while each is helpless without the others , each is in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the British empire " the constitution " is essentially unwritten , an agglomeration of statutes and traditions , liable to be swept away by " the omnipotence of Parliament , " or ( in a closer analysis ) by the omnipotence of the House of Commons ; while with us " the constitution " - whether of a State or of the United States-is always a written instrument ordained by the people , and incapable of being changed or swept away by any of the powers which it delegates to the servants of the people . Thus it is that , in this country , the process of making or amending written constitutions-especially the constitutions of the several States-is almost always going on somewhere . A new State , coming into existence as a member of the Union , must form for itself a constitution , and after a while that constitution will need amendment-perhaps a thorough revision . A thriving State may outgrow the organic law which was once well suited to its character and condition . Changes not only in the number , but in the distribution and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to which ordinary legislation is incompetent Changes in the occupations and industry of the people , and in the amount and distribution of wealth , may be so great that the constitution which was sufficient for the State when almost every citizen cultivated his own farm , and lived in a frugal independence , has become an inconvenient anachronism . In the general progress of the age , corporations of immense wealth , controlled each by an individual who wields it as if it were his own , and continually entering into more formidable combinations with each other , may have grown till the State has suddenly found itself overshadowed by a power which its legislature , under existing arrangements , can not resist . The progress of political science , guided by experience , may indicate new methods of maintain-* in individual liberty , of securing intelligence and purity in legislative bodies , and uprightness in the administration of public affairs , or of guarding the people against that tendency // by which power passes , unobserved , from the many to the few ; and a revision of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incorporate into its institutions the best results of political science or of its own experience in selfgovernment . At this time , the question of constitutional revision is a question immediately practical in Michigan , in Pennsylvania , in Connecticut , and in other States-we need not remember how many . Judge Jameson 's volume , referred to at the head of this Article , is learned , discriminating , sound in its theory of society and government , and judicious in its discernment and application of principles . It is , therefore , a work of great value in our country , and might be of equal value in any country where the people are endeavoring to establish a government limited and controlled by a written constitution . It is unique , we believe , in its subject and plan  --  the first of its kind . 2Te have also referred to a valuable pamphlet by the Hon. J. Hammond Trumbull , a scholar eminently learned and accurate in the history of his native State . Under the modest title of Historical Notes , he has given a mass of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the origin of the constitution which was framed by a convention in 1818 , and ratified by the people . That constitution has been greatly changed by the process of amendment-many of its most important provisions have been set aside-in other respects it has long been acknowledged to be seriously defective ; and yet the convention that framed it , fifty-five years ago , is the latest for such a purpose in the history of Connecticut . We believe there is no other State in the Union which has not had at least one constitutional convention within the last half century . It is not , however , our intention to discuss in this place any question of purely local interest . We prefer rather to avail ourselves of Mr. Trumbull 's notes for the illustration of a much wider question ,  --  when and where was the first constitutional convention , and what was its work ? When and where did this eminently American habit of constitutionmaking have its beginning ? * * In the following paragraphs , we make free use of a " Discourse on the Early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Historical Society , Hartford , May 17 , 1843. // The earliest instance of what is now so familiarly known as a written constitution  --  a distinct organic law , constituting a government and defining its powers-is found in the history of Connecticut . The middle ages had abounded in charters ; but those charters were of the nature of a treaty between a people in arms and its sovereign , or of grants from the sovereign to a community . The " Great Charter " which the English barons wrested from King John , is not what we call a constitution ; nor is the charter of a city or borough recognized by that name The Pilgrims at Cape Cod , when they were about to land in the wilderness , entered into a formal compact , written out and subscribed with their names , " combining themselves into a civil kody poitic ; " and by virtue of that compact they undertook " to enact , constitute , and frame such just and equal laws , ordinances , acts , constitutions , and offices as should be thought most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this was not what we now understand by a constitution ; it was only a voluntary compact under which any kind of government from an absolute democracy to an absolute despotism might have been constituted . Still less can we recognize as a constitution , in our American meaning , the charter granted by Charles I. to a trading and colonizing company in England , and afterward brought over by Winthrop and his colleagues , as a legal warrant for transferring the government of their colony from the Old England to the New . That was a bold stroke of statesmanship , and the world is indebted to the mind that formed the project and the courage that carried it into effect . What was intended to be the charter of a business corporation , go.verning with arbitrary power a colony three thousand miles away , became a charter of political rights and powers for the colony itself . But Massachusetts never set the example of constitutionmaking till 1779 , when the Puritan colony had become an independent State . The founders of Connecticut came from the colony , then six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the territory and under the charter of " the Governor and Company of the Massachusetts Bay . " Before leaving their homes in that colony , they had negotiated with the representatives of certain Puritan noblemen and gentlemen in England who claimed , by a title // indirectly derived from the crown of England , the territory now incladed in the State of Connecticut ; and , by the consent of all parties , a temporary government for the proposed expedition was appointed . The new settlements on the river were to be made by a body of emigrants from Massachusetts ; and , at their desire , inasmuch as they " judged it inconvenient to go away without any frame of government , " eight of the intending emigrants were commissioned by the General Court of Massachusetts with so much authority as was necessary " that some present government may be observed . " Those eight persons , two of them among the settlers at Springfield , were to act as magistrates for the time being , and were invested with authority " for the peaceable and quiet ordering the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not to extend " any longer time than one year from the date thereof . " Evidently it was supposed that some other government , more permanent in its character , would be established within a twelvemonth . That commission expired by its own limitation on the 3d of March , 1637 . In the mean time , courts had been held by the commissioners ( the provisional government ) at each of the three towns afterward named Hartford , Windsor , and Wethersfield ; but never at Springfield , and only once with either of the two Springfield commissioners present ; causes had been tried ; boundaries had been settled ; and various regulations for securing the welfare of the nascent State had been established . But when the commission expired , no sign of any change appears upon the record-no intimation that the provisional government had been superseded . On the 21st of February , orders were issued that were " to take effect on the first of April next ; " and on the 28th of March-more than three weeks after the expiration of the commission-we find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without any intimation of a change in the source or the extent of their authority ,  - -  save as one name unaccountably disappears from the record and is succeeded by another . But on the first of May we find a " General Court , " consisting of the six commissioners ( as we have called them ) together with " committees "  --  a committee of three from each of the three towns . By that " General Court , " convened we know not how , war was declared , an army of // ninety men was raised , and all needful military stores were provided by assessment on the several towns , and one month later ( June 2 ) it was ordered that thirty men be sent forth " to set down in the Pequot country and river , in place convenient to maintain our right that God by conquest hath given to us . " All this makes it evident that in place of the provisional and merely temporary government originally appointed by the General Court of Massachusetts , there had begun to be something more permanent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way those three towns , planted beyond the limits of the Massachusetts corporation , had become a commonwealth with its own General Court . Governments have ordinarily come into being by use-by the exercise of power on the part of those who happened to have power-by the submission and implied consent of the people ; and in some such way government seems to have been growing up and becoming an established fact in the little commonwealth on the Connecticut . Perhaps the question how to constitute their government had been discussed among the planters without arriving at a decision . Perhaps there had been some expectation that the Puritan lords and gentlemen , patentees under the Earl of Warwick , would be able to obtain for them some charter of political rights . Be that as it may , the General Court at Hartford which waged war against the Pequots and took possession of " the Pequot river and country ' by right of conquest , was a government de facto , and therefore ( according to the principle affirmed by the Apostle Paul , " The powers that be are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it could maintain itself , a government de jure . As yet , the relation of Springfield to the other towns on the river was undetermined . Without notice or explanation , the names of the commissioners for that town disappear from the record , after November , 1636 . But in February , 1638 , it was " ordered that the General Court now in being shall be dissolved ; " and at the next General Court ( March 8=18 ) names of members from Agawam ( not yet named Springfield ) reappear . Thomas Hooker says , with obvious reference to that date : " At the time of our election , the committees from the town of Agawam came in with other towns , and chose their magistrates , installed them into their government , took oath of them for the execution of justice according // to God , and engaged themselves to submit to their government . " * It appears , then , that by some process , the government had passed from the hands of provisional commissioners into the hands of the people . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and were inducted not without public solemnity . They were installed by making oath to execute j ustice according to God ; and on the part of the people there was a reciprocal engagement to sustain the magistrates by loyal obedience . But no trace appears of any other fundamental law than the will of the people , enlightened and guided by the book which they recognized as the Word of God . Just then , while the government of the young commonwealth was shaping itself without any extrinsic authority or aid , and while much discussion of the primary questions of political science was going on ( we may be sure ) throughout the colonythe pastor of Hartford , Thomas Hooker , in a Thursday lecture , May 31 , took for his text those words of Moses ( Dent . i , 13 ) , " Take you wise men , and understanding , and known among your tribes , and I will make them rulers over you . " Shaping his discourse according to the homiletic fashion of those times , he first explained the text by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hebrew commonwealth ,  --  " captains over thousands , and captains over hundreds , and captains over fifties , and captains over tens , and officers among the tribes " - and then propounded these points of " doctrine " L That the choice of public magistrates belongs unto the people , by God 's own allowance . " IL The privilege of election , which belongs to the people , therefore must not be exercised according to their humors , but according to the blessed will and law of God . " III They who have power to appoint officers and magistrates , it is in their power , also , to set the bounds and limitations of the power and place unto which they call them . " t * Coil . Conn . Historical Society , i , 13. * Coil . Oonn. list . Soc. , i , 20 . Henry Wolcott , Jr. , of Windsor , born 1610 , was a diligent hearer of sermons ; and , after the Puritan fashion , he wrote down in short-hand characters all the sermons which he heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the arrow-headed legend on a brick from Nineveh-came into the library of the Historical Society at Hartford ; and , many // Next the " reasons , " or rationale , of these three doctrinal propositions were set forth , for to that extent all the old preachers were rationalists . It was always expected that the preacher , after deducing his doctrine or doctrines from his text , with added " proof " from other Scriptures , would commend the truth , as reasonable , to the intelligence of his hearers . In the sermon now referred to , the " reasons " for the doctrines were these . " 1 . Because the foundation of authority is laid , firstly , in the free consent of the people . " In one way or another , the authority of every government rests , primarily , on the consent of tile people governed , and therefore the choice of magistrates belongs to the people " by God 's allowance . " - " 2 . Because , by a free choice , the hearts of the people will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and more ready to yield obedience. ** Surely there is no better way of ensuring the regard of the people for the men entrusted with power. - " 3 . Because of that duty and engagement of the people . " If the people are hound to honor and obey the magistrates set over them , surely it is reasonable that they choose for themselves the men to whom that honor and obedience shall be due . The " uses " with which the sermon closed , and in which its doctrinal teaching was brought home to the conscience , were , first . of thankfulness , " in the manifestation of God 's faithfulness toward us , and the pert mission of these measures that God doth command and vouchsafe . " God , in his faithfulness toward us , doth voucLisafe to us permission to frame our commonwealth accordin* to the rules and measures of his word . " 2 . Of reproof ,  --  to dash the conceits of all those that shall oppose " the people 's right and duty in this matter . " 3 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given us liberty , to take it . And lastly-as God bath spared our lives and given us them in liberty , so to seek the guidance of God and to choose in God , andfor God . " So carefully and devoutly did the founders of the three towns on the river search out the profoundest principles of political philosophy . In those days the Thursday lecture had an importance which is now not easily estimated . It stimulated years also , the fact that nobody could read it , provoked the strenuous mind of Mr. J. Hammond TrumbulL The consequence was that very sufficient " notes " of two political sermons by the first pastor of Hartford were recovered and published . // thought and gave direction to opinion on political and ethical themes as well as on matters of theological dogma and religious experience . The points of such a sermon as that , from Thomas Hooker , with its " doctrines , " its " reasons , " and its " uses , " could not but be discussed in church meetings and in town meetings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and where neighbors met by the wayside . The seed sown by Hooker , and doubtless by others , fell into a receptive soil , and out of such discussions there came , before another year was completed , a written constitution of government , established by the people . On the l4th==24th of January , 1639 , the " free planters " of the three towns , Hartford , Windsor , and Wethersfield , came together , not by their representatives but personally , in the first constitutional convention of which history has any knowledge . It would be idle to suppose that there had been no special preparation for that assembly . The leading men in the various towns must have held conferences in which the plan for a government was considered , and all the particulars adjusted . A draught of the instrument to be laid before the assembled people must have had careful attention and repeated revision , * til every contingency had been provided for and every obscurity made clear . Probably one short winter day was enough for the constituent convention . If any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ submitted to the assembly for adoption , we have no knowledge of them . We only know that the instrument , whenever and by whomsoever prepared , was adopted and became the fundamental law of the commonwealth . The preamble of that instrument recognizes , first , the fact of divine providence that the persons assembled were already a people dwelling together as neighbors in relations of common interest and mutual duty ; and , secondly , the principle , certified to them by the Word of God , that " to maintain the peace and union of such a people there should be an orderly and decent government established according to God . " In other words , it holds and professes that the existence of the body politic , to govern and to be governed , is a divine fact , and that civil goveminent is a divine institution . It proceeds to declare , " We the inhabitants " of these three towns " do therefore associate and conjoin ourselves to be as one public STATE or CoMMoY // WEALTH ; and do , for ourselves and our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any time hereafter , enter into combination and confederation together , to maintain and preserve the liberty and purity of the gospel of our Lord Jesus which we now profess , as also the discipline of the churches which , according to the truth of the gospel , is now practiced among us . " Then follow eleven articles or " Orders " ( sections of a constitution , they would now be called ) , according to which the civil affairs of the commonwealth were to be guided and governed ,  --  the imperial phrase , " It is ordered , sentenced , and decreed , " being prefixed to each in succession. * Those eleven articles are what is now called a constitution . They guard the rights of the people . They provide for the annual election of officers in the common wealth . They assign to each office by name its duties , and mark the limit of its powers . They distribute among those annually elected officers the various functions of legislative and executive administration , guarding against usurpation and mutual encroachment , and especially taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " shall be and remain with the people . The essential features of that constitution , framed in 1639 , have continued to this day . Not to speak of the constitutional changes which other commonwealths and kingdoms have undergone since that date , the changes in the British constitution have been far greater than in the constitution of Connecticut . The government of the State to-day is essentially the same with that which was constituted by the inhabitants of Hartford , Windsor , and Wethersfield so long ago . According to that constitution , a chief magistrate bearing the title of " Governor " was to be annually elected by the people ; and , on the first Wednesday in May last , the people of Connecticut completed the two hundred and thirty-fourth annual election of a " Governor , " - the year 1688 , when Sir Edward Andros had seized upon the government in the name of King James the II , being the only * It is not always remembered that the enacting phrase- " Be it enacted , " - prefixed to every section of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there might be such a law . But Haynes , Ludlow Hooker , and the others remembered what that phrase meant , and used that other phrase , " It *8 ordered , sentenced , and decreed " intelligently . // year in which the election has not taken place according to constitutional forms . The towns were to be represented by their " Deputies " in a legislative assembly ; and , save while that brief reign of violence endured , the towns have been represented in " the General Assembly " every year till now . There was to be also a body of " Magistrates , " chosen not by the towns but by the general suffrage of the people , to assist the deputies or representatives of towns in legislation , and to assist the governor in maintaining order and justice according to law ; and these Connecticut has to-day under the names of Senators and Judges , between whom the powers originally given to " Magistrates , " or " Assistants , " are divided . That constitution made no profession of allegiance to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the English Parliament . On the contrary , it expressly clai " ied for the assembled people " the supreme power of the commonwealth , " and it empowered and directed the Governor and Magistrates " to administer justice according to the laws here established , and for want thereof ; according to the rule of the Word of God . " The men who make that constitution knew what they were doing ; and they intended that English law , as English , should have no force in their commonwealth . The common law , as well as the statutes of England , recognized and presumed a royal government upheld by feudal institutions , a hereditary aristocracy , an established prelacy in the church , a prescribed liturgy in worship ; and the men who were assembled in that constitution-making convention had come across the Atlantic Ocean for the purpose of being beyond the reach of laws which had not been satisfactory to their experience . No small portion of American history , from the first age through many ages yet to come , has been determined by this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was adopted almost two years before the beginning of the Long Parliament . While the little republic on the river , codrdinate with the New Haven jurisdiction on the Sound , was quietly shaping itself , and enjoying the immunities of political independence , the ancient monarchy in their mother country fell before the wrath of the people whose liberty the King was subverting , and then rose again because // the people were as yet incapable of self-government . After a few years of almost continual revolution , royalty was restored in England ; and not royalty alone , but the royal family of the Stuarts . The infatuation and helplessness of the nation placed Charles IT . on his father 's throne , with no stipulation for liberty or for justice , but such as his treachery , aided by the art and cunning of his ministers , was able to violate without shame or fear . It was a perilous time for all the New England colonies , and especially for Connecticut and New lElaven , with no charters to legalize their institutions . For a little while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by hungry courtiers , eager for offices and for lands . But surely they would soon attract attention , and then they must be at the mercy of unscrupulous and malignant rapacity . Their constitutions , created by themselves , and resting on no basis but the laws of God and of nature , would be of no account in the courts of Westminster Hall . No man held , by any title which the English laws would recognize , the land which his own labor had changed from a pathless forest into a fruitful field , and which had been purchased of aboriginal proprietors in amicable treaty , or won from the murdering Pequot in a legitimate war . The weakness of the colonies , then in their infancy , forbade them to defend their hard.earned possessions with the sword . By a single stroke of the pen , that King of England , in some hour of drunken generosity , or at the instigation of any of their enemies , might give away to a parasite or a harlot all that they called their own . What were they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the arts of negotiation . The sagacious eye of the second John Winthrop , who was at that time Governor of Connecticut , saw the peril ; and his experienced skill in public affairs perceived , as in a moment , the only safe course . Under his guidance , the legislature , without any oss of time , determined to apply to the King for a charter which should recognize and establish their rights . In so doing , they could not but acknowledge their dependence on a king , and make profession of allegiance . Yet the people of Connecticut , in taking measures to obtain a royal charter , proceeded not as individuals but as a political body . Their agent was // their Governor . Their petition to the King was entitled " The Humble Petition of The General Court at Hartford , upon the Connecticut , in New England , " and it bore the official signature of their secretary . They asked for a charter which should give validity in English courts to the jurisdiction which they were already exercising . Fortunate in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had so promptly seized , they obtained all that they dared to ask for ; and the reRublic , which their voluntary compact had created , became , without any change in its internal government , a municipality , acknowledged and protected by the King . It is true that in some points the provisions of the charter differ slightly from the " Orders " of 1639 . But , as Mr. rrrum bull shows , the right to modify and amend those constitutional orders had been , from the first , " understood to remain with the freemen in General Court assembled , " and was repeatedly exercised . Either an express determination of " the Freemen , " or a settled usage , had authorized almost every difference , however minute , between the orders of 1639 and the charter of 1662 . The " Magistrates , " named in the one , were called by the other " Assistants , " and -- though the original constitution , while providing that the three towns then existing should be equally represented by deputies , had also provided that the representation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determined by the general court " in a reasonable proporbon to the number of freemen in said towns "  --  the charter ordained ( what had already been settled by the consent of the people ) that the " Deputies " should be not more than two from every " town or city . " With no other change , the entire frame of the already existing government was confirmed . " The Governor and Company of the English Colonies of Connecticut , being incorporated with municipal privileges , were qualified " to plead and be impleaded , " in any of the King 's courts ; and their right to their lands and liberty and local self-government was guarded by an instrument as valid in law as the Great Charter of England itself . The Declaration of independence changed the relations of Connecticut to the King of Great B itain , but made no change in the constitution of the old commonwealth . In June , 1776 , // the General Assembly , by a unanimous vote , directed that its delegates in the Continental Congress should propose to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Independent States , absolved from all allegiance to the King of Great Britain . " A few days later , Governor Trumbull received official notice that such a declaration had been made , and , the assent of Connecticut having been given beforehand , there was no need of any ratification . Only a few slight changes-such as the substitution of " State " for " Colony , " and the omission of all reference to the King-were made in the forms ofjustice and of legislation ; and the government went on , just as it had gone on from the 14th of January , 1639 ,  --  the same democracy in towns , the same annual election of Governor and Assistants , the same General Assembly , the same laws . What we call " the Revolution " was , therefore , no revolution in the constitutional government of Connecticut . At the October session of the General Assembly , 1776 , the Declaration of Independence was approved ; and a resolution was put upon record " that this Colony is arid of right ought to be a free and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allegiance to the British Crown . " A declaration was also made , " that the form of civil government in this State shall continue to be as established by charter received from Charles the Second , King of England , so far as an adherence to the same will be consistent with an absolute independence of this State on the Crown of Great Britain . " In other words , as thet'e was no internal revolution when the Colony acknowledged its dependence on the Crown of England by asking for a royal charter and accepting it , so there was none when that dependence was abolished . The identical " form of civil government " which was created by the " Orders " of 1639 , and which , twentythree years later , was " established " and made valid in English law by the Charter , remained unshaken. * At the next semi-annual Assembly ( May , 1777 ) a new form of the Freeman 's Oath was prescribed . From time immemorial * " The application of the people for the charter , and their voluntary acceptance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and not the royal signature . " Mr. Trumbull quotes this pregnant sentence from Swift 's System of the Laws of Connecticut i , 56. // every man admitted to the privileges of a Freeman in the Colony had taken a certain oath of fidelity . But , thenceforward , the Freeman must swear " to be true and faithful to the Governor and Company of this State , and the Constitution and government thereof . " The State was no longer a colonial dependency of the British Crown , but " the constitution and government thereof " had undergone no charge At the end of the war which " established " the independence of the State , declared in 1776 ,  --  as the Charter had " established " the form of civil government set up in I6*39 ,  --  - there was a revision and new edition of the Statutes ; and in the preamble of " an Act containing an Abstract and Declaration of the Rights and Privileges of the People of this State , " there was this formal declaration : " The people of this State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and independent , have the sole and exclusive right of governing themselves as a free , sovereign , and independent State , and having from their ancestors derived a free and excellent constitution of government , whereby the legislature depends on the free and annual election of the people , they have the best security for the preservation of their civil and religious rights and liberties ; " and for twenty-three years more there was no modification whatever in that " free and excellent constitution of government . " It would have been well ig when the independence of the United States had been established as a fact within the cognizance of Westminister Hall , the General Assembly of Connecticut had taken measures not only for a revision of the Statutes , but also for a revision of the Constitution . In common estimation , that ancient form of government , though instituted by the people , had been identified with the charter which only confirmed it ; and for that reason a new grant of power to the government from the people was desirable . A revision of the fundamental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not unreasonably demanded after the lapse of a hundred and fortyfive years from the day when the planters of the three towns on the river organized the first government that ever derived its powers from a written constitution . Every other State of the Thirteen , with one exception , had framed , or was framing , an organic law for itself in the name of its sovereign people . // In some respects the time was favorable for a Constitutional Convention in Connecticut . Whatever changes were desirable might have been made then , in a conservative spirit , by the men whose experienced sagacity had conducted the State through the revolutionary crisis without a revolution . That opportunity was lost . The constitution , as it was , seemed to be working well ; and the desire of some for a new organic law , to be framed by a convention and ratified by the people , was deemed , by those who had the control , unworthy of attention . But the minority grew ; - certain features in the old constitution became more conspicuously incongruous with the political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interested in a change were formed ;  --  and at last , in 1818. came the Convention which framed what was called a " new " constitution for Connecticut . In the lapse of a hundred and seventyeight years there had been no such change of the fundamental law as was then proposed by the Convention and adopted by the people . Yet that instrument-though not in form an amendment or series of amendments-was essentially the old constitution , revised , and , in some important particulars , reformed . It made some extension of the right of suffrage ; it changedthe'Councii " or " Upper House " of twelve " Assistants " into a " Senate ' * of twelve members ; it lessened somewhat the powers and dignity of the governor ; it provided for a yearly instead of a semiannual General Assembly ; and it did some other things of about the same significance . But at the same time it made two great changes , more beneficial than all the rest ; it created an independent judiciary ; and , by sweeping away the ancient laws which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of public worship , it severed the last thread of special connection between the Congregational churches and the civil government . The constitution of 1818 is still prefixed to the Connecticut Statute-book with a long series of appended amendments , which have been proposed by the legislature and adopted by the people , and some of which , certainly , are amendments only in name . As we look at those so-called amendments , remembering when and why they were made , it becomes evident that , in the States // of this Union. , a Constitutional Convention , revising the entire structure of the government , and chosen expressly for the purpose , is necessary , from time to time , in order to undo what is blunderingly or mischievously donc by the ordinary process of constitutional amendment in distinction from the process of constitutional revision . The process of amendment is substantially the same in most of the States . That in Connecticut may be taken as an example . While the organic law , with judicious forethought , provides for its own amendment , it carefully guards itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be moved in the House of Representatives , and must be recognized by a majority as necessary . Then it must wait for a twelvemonth , and must be approved by a vote of two-thirds in each house of the next annual legislature . After that , the people have the opportunity of ratifying or rejecting it . In the words of Judge Jameson , " Provisions regulating the time and mode of effecting organic changes are in the nature of safetyvalves ,  --  they must not be so adjusted as to discharge their peculiar function with too great facility , lest they become the ordinary escape-pipes of party passion ; nor , on the other hand , must they discharge it with such difficulty that the force needed to induce action is sufficient also to explode the machine . " For this reason , it seems necessary that a constitution should provide for its own amendment by permitting changes to be initiated by the legislature and ratified or rejected by the people . But it may be doubted whether the power of amendment , thus given to the legislature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instrument and introdncing another in the place of it . Admit that what is called a " new " constitution , introduced in the place of an old one , is only an amended constitution-the old one in a new draft with modifications snpposed to be improvements ;  --  the distinction is nevertheless real between specific amendments , one after another as occasion seems to demand , and a general revision in order to a new draft . Specific amendments may be , reasonably enough , initiated by the legislature ; for the more serious work of general revision , a Constitutional Convention seems necessary . When a state constitution has been tinkered for half a century by the legislative method of // amendment , it will be sure to need such a revision and reconstruction as can not be had without a Convention . Jndge Jameson says : " The amendments to our Constitutions are very commonly of no great extent ; a doubt has arisen , perhaps , as to the construction to be put upon a particular clause ; a change may be desired in the qualifications for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a branch of the administration is found to be too cumbrous for use ; or a new distribution among the agencies of government of their constitutional powers is thought to be advisable to facilitate the transaction of business , or to render public operations more safe , or more economical . For amendments of such a stamp , separately considered , the mode by legislative action is well adapted ; and it is adapted to no other . It ought to be confined , in my judgment , to changes which are simple or formal , and , therefore , of comparatively small importance . For a general revision of a Constitution , or even for single propositions involving radical changes as to the policy of which the popular mind has not been informed by prior discussion , the employment of this mode is impracticable or of doubtful expediency " ( p. 495 ) . " The legislature is a body chosen for temporary purposes . It is a mirror of political passions and interests , and , with the best intentions , can not be expected to be free from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is composed , moreover , in general , of politicians rather than of statesmen . Indeed , if a man shows himself , by culture and the breadth of bis views , to be fitted for the highest trusts , it is nearly certain that he will not be found in the legislature , but be left in obscurity at home . But when a Convention is called , it is sometimes possible to secure the return of such men . It is not necessarily because such a body is recognized to be , as it is , the most important ever assembled in a State , but because the measures it is expected to mature bear less directly on the interests of parties or of individuals . Party management , therefore , is not usually so much directed to the seeking of control of a Convention as of a legislature . Besides , the proper function of the latter body , that of municipal lenislation , being one of the highest vested by the sovereign in any governmental agency , it can not but be inexpedient , on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of organic legislation , requiring different and higher gifts , and wider experience and study** ( pp. 494 , 495 ) . To these considerations it may be added that in a Convention , the State may call to its service , for the revision of its organic law , any of its most distinguished citizens who , by reason of their being employed in other important public trusts , are ineligible to either house of the legislature . The Governor of the State , its highest Judges , and its Senators and IRepresentatives in Congress , can sit in a Constitutional Convention . Men , too , of recognized wisdom , and of experience in public affairs , who have retired from what is called political activity , and who are for that reason the more honored by their fellow citizens . may be called out of their retirelnent to serve the State once more on so YOL . Xxxiii. 3 // great an occasion . There are also men who , though , as lawyers , they have seen the working of the Constitution and have had reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without too great a sacrifice , submit to the drudgery of service in the legislature ,  - -  but who might be persuaded to serve in a Convention . If a State would employ its best wisdom , its profoundest jurisprudence , and its most experienced statesmanship , in a revision of its fundamental law  --  the law which is to control all other legislation , it must call together an assembly very different from its ordinary legislature . It is a true saying that a legislature " is composed , in general , of politicians rather than of statesmen . " For that reason it is to be expected that constitutional amendments proposed and carried by the legislative method will be designed to facilitate the management and operation of political parties , rather than to promote , in any broad and generous view , the welfare of the State . For example if no man can obtain a seat in the legislature without receiving a majority of the votes in the ( *onStituency which*he desires to represent ; and if it happens that , for several successive years , a considerable minority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either of the two leading parties , and insist on voting for candidates of their own selection , thus , by their impracticableness defeatino ' the " regular nominations ; " then look out for a statute-or , if need be , a constitutional amendment , which shall make a plurality of votes as effectual as a majority ,  --  or , in other words , which shall leave to the elector no choice except between the candidates nominated by the two leading parties . Or , to suppose another case ,  --  it may be that the constitutional arrangement for the election of a Senate is such that if a man desiring to be a Senator is not known to a great constituency , and recognized as a man of mark and merit , he can hardly get votes enough to elect him . Then look out for a constitutional amendment which shall make it easier for petty politicians , the manipulators of ward-meetings and district conventions , to dishonor the Senate by winding their way into it . An elected legislature , even though elected only for a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as reluctant to surrender any of its powers , as a hereditary aristocracy can be . // If , then , it happens that the judges , in a certain State , are elected by the legislature , that assembly of politicians will never-save under an outside pressure too formidable to be resisted- consent to relinquish the power of appointing judges . And if ; through inadvertence on the part of the people , a constitutional amendment has been ratified which impairs the independence of the judiciary , by changing the tenure of judicial office and requiring judges to keep in view the chances of a re-election , it will be found that the legislature in that State is quite unwilling to abdicate the power of re-electing the judges after limited terms of service . It has sometimes been maintained that if a state constitution entrusts to the legislature the power of proposing amendments , the people of that State have abdicated the right of reforming their organic law in any other way . But it may be and , as has been shown by specifications , it is a fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the constitution for amending it , so that it may conform to the will of the people , is used as the very method of preventing them from getting what they want " * If there be such a case , is there no remedy save in the inalienable right of revolution ? If a State has outgrown its constitution , and finds its legislature largely representative of rotten boroughs ; if it finds that it is governed , in fact , byjuntos of politicians who know how to manipulate the elections in the rotten borough constituencies ; if it finds that year after * The quotation is from an able pamphlet by Albert S. Bolles , Esq. , of Norwich , Connecticut , entitled " The Revision of our State Constitution . " After admitting that the time required for effecting changes in the organic law should be long enough , and the process difficult enough , to bring out " the reason and honest wishes of the people , " Mr. Bolles adds : " But who can doubt that the present mode of amending it is too slow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revision , and so prevents some changes at least which , unquestionably , a large majority of the people desire . Think of the way by which the judges of the higher courts are elected . Formerly their election was by the legislature for life , or till the age of seventy . But in 1856 an amendment was made , providing that they should be elected for the term of eight years only . Experien*e , however , has proved the old way to be the better , modified perhaps so as to require the govenor to nominate and the legislature to elect him . Yet the legislature , reluctant to give up its powers in this respect , will not do its part toward remedying this great and obvious defect , although the people would quickly do their part if they had the chance . One reason , therefore , why a Constitutional Convention is desired is , to make changes which the people want but can not now get . " // year its legislature , in both the houses , is less and less competent to deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swayed by the button-hole persuasion and the marvelously diversified influence of a thriving lobby ; if it finds that the elections of its United States senators and of its judges are controlled by that most irresponsible power , a legislative caucus of the party which happens to be the majority ; and ig at the same time , everybody knows that every proposal for the reformation of such evils will be considered and decided in the legislature with a supreme reference to the interests of political parties , and with very little reference to the honor and good government of the commonwealth ; - has that State no remedy against the power of its own rotten boroughs ? Is there no legitimate possibility of its reforming its own constitution so long as a minority of one-third in either house , having a vested interest in the existing arrangements and the consequent abuses , is determined to obstruct the needed reformation ? We hold that in such a case it is clearly in the power , and is therefore the duty , of the legislature , proceeding in the ordinary forms of legislation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people to exercise , without any revolutionary movement , their " undeniable and indefeasible right to alter their form of government in such a manner as they may deem expedient . " Surely the man who , in derogation of that " undeniable and indefeasible right , " expressed or implied in all our constitutions , will venture to affirm the unconstitutionality of an act providing an orderly method in which the people  --  the State itself as a political unit-may decide the question of a Convention to reform the state constitution , and in which the several constituencies , if the State shall order such a Convention , may elect their delegates ,  --  can not maintain his position by showing merely that the existing constitution is silent in regard to such an enactment . He must adduce the words in which the act is expressly forbidden . Judge Jameson , having mentioned the historic fact that twenty-five Conventions , for revising and reforming constitutions , have been " called by the respective state legislatures , under their general legislative power , without the special authorization of their constitutions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That whenever a constitution needs a general revision , a Convention is indispensably necessary ; and if there is con tamed in the constitution no provision for such a body , the calling of one is , in my judgment , within the scope of the ordinary legislative power ; and , 2 . That , were it not a proper exercise of legislative power , the usurpation has been so often committed with the general acquiescence , that it is now too late to question it as such . It must be laid down as among the established prerogatives of our General Assemblies , that the consti. tution being silent , whenever they dee ? n it expedient , they may call Conventions to revise the fundamental law " ( p. 209 ) . // ARTICLE 111. - REVIVALS OF RELIGION .

It has lost its wide , historic sense , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ length , to facts of varied nature , and to the experience of an entire country or of all Christendom : such as the national religious reformations under Luther , Calvin , and Knox .

The circumstances may vary in nearly all the incidental particulars . The revival may come with or without a resort to special means , such as more numerous meetings , the preaching of an evangelist , or the labors of some minister ot icr than the pastor ; with or without a previous state of doctrinal or of practical declension ; with or without careful and intended preparation ; with or without peculiar measures in the way of manifesting feeling , testing earnestness , and directing inquirers .
