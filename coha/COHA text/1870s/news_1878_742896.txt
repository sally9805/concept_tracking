txt In addition to what we have already said of the new scheme of Army reorganization , there are two important points presented by Gen. BURNSIDE 'S committee which deserve notice . These are : First , that the manufacture of ordnance and ordnance stores by the Ordnance Department be prohibited , and that all purchases of arms and ammunition be made in open market or by contract ; and , secondly , that portion of the report which prescribes the methods of dealing with each officer whose retirement or discharge is contemplated . One of the main issues brought before the joint committee was presented by an association of manufacturers of arms , annnunition , and equipments , and their statements are deserving of serious consideration . As we pointed out the other day , our sea-coast defenses and ships are armed with guns that have long since been surpassed in range , penetration , and in weight of projectile thrown , by the ordnance of other great powers . Further , our Army has 21,000 enlisted men , and still there is in our arsenals a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use . " The money and energies of the Government , " say these manufacturers , " has been spent in building up armories and arsenals of construction , instead of providing on the most economical method the arms and munitions for its defense . " The valuation of the National Armory at Springfield awl the several arsenals throughout the country amounted in 1 877 to $00,000,000 . " At Rock Island , " say these manufacturers , " over $5,100,000 has already been spent , and a further sum of $3,000,000 is required to complete this arsenal , exclusive of the necessary machine ? y and shop fixtures . " They add that during the fiscal year ending Juno 30 , 1877 , the total number of rifles and carbines fabricated at the National Armory was 7,050 ; the valuation of the armory property that year was $7,000,000 . Allowing 10 per cent . for interest , taxes , repairs , &c.,; wo find that the proportionate cost in these expenses of each small arm manufactured at Springfield was about $100 . There are private armsmanufacturing companies in the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rifles identical in every particular with those made at the National Armory , for $15 a piece . In proof of their claims , these American gun-makers refer to the enormous quantities of arms and munitions furnished by them to foreign Governments , and assert that officers of the Army , as well as State authorities , have requested to be supplied with improved arms made in private establishments , but have been refused by the Government . Our other point is as to the retirement of Army officers . Besides voluntary retirement on account of length of service , obligatory retirement on account of age is also provided for . We assume that besides having in view a way to bring about the reduction and reorganization provided for by this bill , the committee were also desirous of providing for a flow of promotion . Now , in order to obtain advancement , vacancies in the fixed establishment of general and regimental officers must be created , and where death and voluntary retirement are not found sufficient to create a reasonable flow of promotion , then means should be created @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ armies arises from the fact that the number of officers in each successive rank is widely unequal ; those in the upper ranks being few , and those in the lower many . Hence , in order to make an effectual scheme of promotion , retirements should he effected in the lower as well as in the higher ranks . But all the necessary retirements can not be wholly compulsory , therefore the necessity of extending the scheme so as to induce voluntary resignations . Without going too far into details , it may be stated that the voluntary scheme permits an officer who has been thirty years in service to be placed upon the retired list on his own application ; and that the compulsory scheme provides that every officer , other than of the corps of general officers , who shall be 62 years of age and shall have servedfor twenty years as an officer shall be at once retired ; that all officers who shall be between the ages of 60 and 62 years shall be transferred to the " reserved list , " ( a new and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 62 they shall be placed on the retired list ; and that every officer who shall be over 60 years of ago and , has not rendered at least twenty years ' service as an officer shall be discharged with a gratuity at the rate of one year 's pay for every period of five years ' service rendered , either as an officer or soldier , in the regular or volunteer forces of the United States . No doubt there are some who will insist that the limit of age fixed upon is not a proper one . It is true that many men are in the very prime of life at 62 , are then full of energy , and able to discharge every duty imposed upon them ; but-it is equally true that every well-conducted subaltern ought to have a chance of rising to be a Major in the prime of his life , and this they can not do under existing regulations . There are officers in service who have been Captains for more than eighteen years , and others who have progressed no further along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the ago fixed for this compulsory removal must be , to a great extent , a matter of experience , and it seems to us the new plan is framed with commendable tenderness for officers who already have seen lom , service . The proposed plan of promoting officers according to seniority in the respective corps is also a good one . Now all promotions up to the rank of Major are made by regiments , and this has been found to work injustice to many gallant and meritorious gentlemen . The bill provides that where there is a vacancy among the Captains , the senior First Lieutenant of that corps or branch of service shall be promoted to 1111 it . On the whole , the Burnside plan is perhaps as good as could be devised ; and the bill should receive immediate attention . Congress should at once place the police force of the Government upon a basis which will give satisfaction to the Army and security to the nation .                  @ @ @
