txt Newtown , Long island , is blessed with a model Justice whose name is MURPHY . His decisions , if they do not carry judicial weight , are at all times looked forward . to with much intarest . Newtown is a dull place , but it would be still more dull were it not that ' , ' its monotony is frequently relieved . by Justice MURPHY . A few examples of the learned Justice 's decisions are worthy of notice . There was a colored picnic at Woodside , near Newtown , last week , and it was- attended ' two young , men , who took with them a horse and car- riage from this City . In the evening , while in a saloon owned by-a  --  Constable of the village named SCHMIDT , in company with some female friends , the railroad engine 's whistle gave notice that the train was about to start , and as the women intended to go by that conveyance , the whole party rose and started . for the station , one of the men announcing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SCHMIDT had furnished to them . SCHMIDT , however , was not satisfied with this proposal , and rushing out with a revolver , he fired at the party , but , fortunately , without any disastrous effect . ' As soon as the women had taken their seats in the train , the men returned to the saloon , where they were arrested by the valiant SCHMIDT and taken before Justice MURPHY . The offense with which they were charged does not appear , nut the newspapers report that the Justice fined the young mon seventy dollars . They had not so much money at command , but as they were compelled either to pay the fine or go to jail , they bit upon a plan which gave them liberty . They had in their possession the horse and wagon which they had hired in New-York , and these they offered to the Justice as security until they could return with the money . Mr. MURPHY is reported to have agreed to this arrangement , but as the young men did not return with the money , he sold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " his Honor . " The owner of the animal paid a visit to the seat of justice soon after the sale , and , after a long argument , convinced the court that it would be both wise and prudent to surrender the horse to its owner . Here is another illustration of the course of justice in this Court . Berries grow wild along the hedges in the country towns of Long Island . Two persons from New-York were caught on Sunday , Aug. 22 , picking elderberries from the bushes in Winfield . A Deputy Sheriff named KLossErr brought the offending persons before the wise and learned Justice , who committed them to jail until the following morning , when they were arraigned , convicted , and each sentenced to pay a fine of twentyfive dollars , or in default to be imprisoned in the County Jail for six months . One of the accused persons was also committed to await the action of the Grand Jury on the charge of carrying concealed weapons . They wore about being marched off to the prison when one of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ho was discharged . His companion was marched off toward the jail , but he too was subsequently released on the pay/nent of the fine , although he had been committed to Await the action of the Grand Jury . Take still another example of Justice MITErmr 's law . A woman named O'NEILL was committed , for disorderly conduct , to jail for six months. ? Two days after her commitment it is alleged that the keeper of the jail accompanied her to this City , where she obtained fifty dollars . This sum she says she paid , and . Justice MURPHY then ordered her release , although there was no fine mentioned in the commitment . No one alleges that the Justice converted this money to his own use . He , doubtless , paid it over to the proper officer for the benefit of the town Treasury . - He may be  --  and is , so far as we know  --  a very honest official , who would not use his office for his own personal advantage ; but if his decisions were more in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he would . be more entitled to public confidence than we fear he is at present .
