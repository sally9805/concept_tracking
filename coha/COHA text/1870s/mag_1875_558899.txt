ART . V. - THE GRANGER MOVEMENT . THE great Know-Nothing movement , so called , which swept over the United States about twenty years ago , apparently originated without cause , raged subject to no law , and finally subsided , having produced no permanent results . It was a species of popular squall preceding the long , violent tempest of the Rebellion . In this respect it furnished a striking exception to the general principles which mark the rise and development of widespread popular agitations . They seldoiu originate without cause ; and , in spite of blunders and mismanagement , rarely pass away without having contributed // something worth ha that general result which makes up the conditions uWwhich we live . This is especially true of that Granger mMement , which , during the last four years , has played a most prominent part in the politics of certain of tl&amp;Northwestern States , and resembled the KnowNothing movement only in its more prominent and least creditable features . It is quite apparent , however , that the time has now come when the Granger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and treated in a spirit of critical justice . Hitherto this has not been done . In the West the Granger has been " inside politics , " and the politicians and editors of rival factions have vied with each other in flattering his vanity , extenuating his shortcomings , and excusing his misdeeds . In the East , on the other hand , the public mind has been mainly impressed by certain striking episodes in his movement , which , naturally , were almost always those reflecting the least credit upon it : of this character was the defeat at the polls of Chief Justice Lawrence of Illinois , for having presumed to decide a constitutional issue which arose before him as a judge , on principles of law rather than in obedience to a popular demand : or , again , the " Potter Law , " so called , of Wisconsin , which seemed designed to operate as a practical confiscation of many millions of foreign capital invested in the public improvements of that State ; or , finally , the illinois Railroad Law , which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use the raili , oads of illinois the final arbiters as to what it was reasonable they should pay for such use . Such episodes as these have led the people of the East to regard the Granger movement as one of those causeless , unjustifiable , and outrageous manifestations , nearly allied to agrarianism , which attempt to perpetrate under the forms of law the most wanton assaults upon property . It is not necessary to have a very exalted opinion either of the Granger movement or of the Granger type of politicians and thinkers to assert that the conclusion last stated does it and them scant justice . The simple truth is that the Granger excitement was not causeless , and that , in spite of the binders which marked its career , it has done a great deal of very good work . // To appreciate this or any other popular movement , it is necessary to have a somewhat definite conception of its sin ' - roundings , - of the various conditions , social , political , economical , and geographical , among which it manifests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judgment , these may , in the present case , be very briefly stated , and they are not without their interest . In the first place we have a young agricultural community , which has grown up with unprecedented rapidity in the very centre of the continent , many hundreds of miles away from those great centres of human industry to which it must look for its markets and sources of supply . Such a fundamental condition as that just referred to necessarily implies a great deal . New social organizations can not enjoy that accumulation of knowledge , of education , and of political habits which is found among people of the same race but of an older civilization ; to look for it is as unreasonable as to look for an equal degree of wealth . The people of the West are accordingly always more or less rest . less under the restraints of law ; nor do they appreciate so fully as the people of New England the immense value of an established credit and an unquestioned good name . To many among them the immediate good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good ; and in rough , energetic fashion they view with undisguised contempt those of their fellow-creatures who believe in such tedious old saws as that " the more haste , the less speed . " The straightest way home is almost always , in their opinion , the shortest way home ; and , indeed , if , in following it , they almost surely come to a bog or swamp , they generally contrive somehow to wallow through , thanks to an exuberant native vigor , though by no means always in an undishevelled condition . They thus see an evil , a wrong , with great clearness ; it impresses itself most powerfully on their fancies ; seeing it thus , feeling it thus , they go directly at its most obvious manifestation , and do not often stop to look for a hidden cause . Accordingly , within the last ten years , the public mind of the West has dwelt upon railroads in two wholly different moods . During the first five years , - those between 1866 and 1870 ,  --  // the fact of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insufficiency of Western capital and the pressing need of new channels of communication with the East assumed an ever-increasing promiiience , and thus railroads , more railroads , were the constant longing of the Western man and the unceasing burden of his speech . He found his way - loaded with maps and plans and prospectuses , and stock and bonds and land grants - into every money market of the world . Railroads could not , he thought , be purchased at too high a price ; no inducements were too large with which to tempt foreign capital . The Western imagination was thoroughly fired ; and so , at last , was Eastern cupidity - and the result was that disastrous railroad mania which culminated in the panic of 1873 . Through a period of five years capital flowed to the West in an apparently inexhaustible stream , and under its influence railroads were constructed as if by magic . The best and the most preposterous lines were equally built ; competing line was run upon competing line between the great centres ; while other lines were laid out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one wanted to go . In the Western States and Territories alone , during the five years which preceded the outbreak of the Granger movement , not less than five hundred million dollars of actual wealth were invested in the construction of railroads . Accordingly the number of miles of road in operation in Illinois is stated to have risen from 3,191 in 1866 to 5,904 in 1871 ; those in Wisconsin , from 1,036 to 1,725 ; those in Iowa , from 1,283 to 3,160 ; those in Minnesota , from 482 to 1,612 ; those in Nebraska , from 473 to 943 ; while Kansas during the same period ran up from 494 miles to 1,760 . These are the six essentially Granger States , and in them alone the increase of railroad mileage in the six years between 1867 and 1873 was from 6,992 to 17,645 , or no less than 254 per cent . Thus about the year 1870 the Western mind began to appreciate the fact that its railroad system was secured . Not unnaturally it now began also to count its cost , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this magnificent railroad development , and could not be deprived of it , yet she did not own it , and was , moreover , bound to pay for its use // according to the bonds given anterior to its construction . In other words , exactly what might have been anticipated now began to appear . In her over-eagerness the West had made an improvident bargain ; she hadgiven for her longed-for railroads all that she had , all that any one asked ; and now she had them , and began to shrewdly suspect that her bargain had after all been somewhat of the hardest . It was , indeed , a case of absentee ownership , with all that those words imply and when that is said one great cause of the near-impending trouble is disclosed . Macaulay somewhere describes the condition of affairs brought about in India in the last century , through the fact that the stock of the East India Company was held exclusively in England , while the empire from which the company drew its income was in ilindostan . As a consequence the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of direction , at whose will they held their places , and their one care was to satisfy its incessant demand for dividends , regardless of the misery their exactions caused . The illustration is a somewhat strong one , but it offers a vivid idea of the abuses almost always incident to absentee ownership . In a very modified form the same abuses existed in connection with the Western railroad system . Those who owned it did not live in the West , nor did they know much of the West ; they simply knew that they held bonds or stocks of certain Western roads , upon the income derived from which they depended for support ; accordingly , if that income were not forthcoming , it needed no prophet to foresee that there would be discontent and trouble in the next stockholders ' meeting . The roads , also , were managed in the West by shrewd men , who fully took in the exact posture of affairs ; they knew perfectly well at whose will they held their positions , and they knew just what was expected from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the roads who would keep up the condition of the property and at the same time earn dividends . Men of this sort might feel secure in their positions . As for discontent along the lines of the railroads , or a growing want of sympathy between the companies and the communities they served , - with such matters those having charge of the operation // of the railroads troubled themselves but little . They did not undertake to serve or to satisfy two sets of masters , and those whom they did undertake to serve were the holders of the stock and bonds , and did not live on the prairies . Meanwhile those who did live upon the prairies were not EastIndians , and there was little probability that they would long submit to any very appreciable ignoring of their rights . They had also very respectable grievances to complain of ; not oppressions , of course , but something far more likely to stir that high-spirited , restless community into measures of retaliation than were all the oppressions of the East India Company to rouse the Asiatics . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the other of these two causes could gQnerally be traced nearly all that hostility which gave the Granger movement such power and public sympathy as it had ; these were , in the first place , Competition , and , in the next place , Bad Manners . As respects competition , it is not at first very obvious to a person who has not made a special study of the subject why this great desideratum to all branches of trade under ordinary circumstances should in the case of railroads lead directly to an outbreak of popular discoiitent . Yet nothing is better established than that it does lead to this , and that not in the West alone , but here in the East and in 2Europe . So well is this established that in certain countries of Europe , and notably in France , competition among railroads is especially discouraged with a view to avoiding this very result . The people of the West , however , were very far from foreseeing any such contingency , and they undertook the construction of their railroad system with an implicit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operations . They fancied that railroads in the work of transportation would find themselves subject to a law of supply and demand exactly in the same degree as factories and mills in the production of cotton cloth or of flour . Indeed , this idea is even yet not wholly eradicated from the minds of many very intelligent men who have thought but little on the subject . The simple truth is that competition , properly so called , among railroads , except as a perturbing element , is simply impossible . It is impossible for two rea // sons : in the first place , to have it at all , every locality must be served by at least two independent and competing railroad routes , and it is a physical impossibility that nine points out of ten should have more than one ; in the second place , it is obvious that an active competition between two or more agencies , - the number , however , being always very limited , - no one of which can withdraw from the field , must necessarily result in the complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weaker . In other words , where combination or absorption is possible , continued and sustained competition is not possible ; and the truth of this aphorism has been demonstrated through forty years of railroad history . The distinction between a competition where the field is open to the whole world and one where it is confined to a few monopolizing agencies is very obvious , - competition of the first description is an end , an ultimate condition ; that of the second is a means to an end , a mere phase of evolution . People still fail to realize the full significance of this proposition , because the consequences which must result from it do not take place at once . The range of railroad competition is continually spreading , and it requires time for the necessary combinations to work themselves out ; nevertheless , the results in this direction which the last ten years have brought about are very significant of the inevitable in the future . The people of the West eagerly invited foreigners to build railroads for them ; and it was not until after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through bitter experience , to realize that competition between its members was producing results neither such as had been anticipated nor such as were altogether satisfactory . They found , in a word , that while the result of ordinary competition was to reduce and to equalize prices , the result of railroad competition was to produce local inequalities and to arbitrarily raise and depress prices . The railroads of the West had been built a great deal too rapidly , and the business of the country could not support thqm ; those immediately in charge of them were under a heavy and unceasing pressure to earn money , and thej * v*ned it wherever and however they could ,  --  where it // was in their power to earn it through exactions , they exacted ; where they were forced to compete for it , they competed . There resulted a system of inequitable local discriminations which might not unfairly be described as intolerable . At one point several roads would converge , and the business or travel from that point would be furiously fought over and done for almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away would be charged every dollar that their business could be made to pay without driving it off the railroad and back into the highway . Where goods were started from the same point to different stations upon the line of the same road , those forwarding them discovered to their cost that the tariffs resembled nothing so much as an undulating line , - for a distance of twenty miles , more would have to be paid than for one of forty miles ; and not infrequently a consignee would see goods habitually carried by his door to some point miles farther on , in order that the company might charge him the local rates for bringing them back . Those living between competing points were rigidly excluded from the benefits of competition . To such an outrageous extent was this carried , that it became the common practice where an entire car-load of merchandise was paid through to a competing point to make a large extra charge for not hauling it to that point , but leaving it at its ultimate destination , perhaps a hundred or two miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grossest description , - men or business firms whose dealings were large could command their own terms as compared with those whose dealings were small . The most annoying and injurious inequalities were thus spread all over the land . Every local settlement and every secluded farmer saw other settlements and other farmers more fortunately placed whose very prosperity seemed to make their own ruin a mere question of time . Man to man , or place to place , they might compete ; but where the weight of the railroad was flung into one of the scales , it was strange if the other did not kick the beam . Of course , even under the most favorable circumstances , such a condition of affairs could not be perpetuated . In this case , however , it was aggravated by a system of gross jobbery and corruption which , before the stoim burst , seemed fairly to // have honeycombed the whole railroad system of the West . It began high up in the wretched machinery of the construction company , with all its thimble-rig contrivances for transferring assets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ring . Thence it spread downward through the whole system of supplies and contracts and rolling-stock companies , until it might not unfairly be said that everything had its price . The whole story is , however , told in these two words , Absentee Ownershjp ; - while the Western patron was plundered , the Eastern proprietor was robbed . Under these circumstances the continuance of the system was made even shorter than it otherwise need have been by the other cause of grievance which has been referred to , - Bad Manners . This is a vastly more important matter to railroad corporations , not only in the West , but all over the country , than those owning or managing them appear to be aware of . In New England the condition of affairs is bad enough ; and more than one important corporation has experienced great injury , or finds itself leading an existence of perpetual warfare and turmoil , solely through the inability of some prominent and , perhaps , otherwise valuable official to demean himself with consideration towards his brother man . What in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing to what prevails in the West . Taken as a class , the manners of the employees of the Western railroad system are probably the worst and most offensive to be found in the civilized world . It is difficult to see why the official should regard the traveller or the person having dealings with the railroad as his natural enemy ; but it is apparent that he does . If it were an ordinary manifestalion of the American fondness for asserting equality on all occasions it would be endurable ; it commonly , however , partakes of a more aggressive and hostile character . A ticket is sold , and the purchaser is at the same time made to feel that a favor has been conferred upon him , - that he is on no account to ask any questions , - and , indeed , had best speedily remove himself out of the way . The gruffness of the baggage-master is , as a rule , only excelled l ) y his violence to the baggage . Indeed , it would sometimes seem as though it must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guidance of their // servants , that they are to show the least possible degree of respect or consideration to any person having business with the company ; and so thoroughly is this principle applied , that - always excepting Mr. Pullman 's cars , in which an excellent discipline is maintained - the railroads of the West are the single institution anywhere to be found from whose servants money will not at times buy civility even of the commonest kind . I very well remember an amusing illustration of this rule which occurred to me about two years ago . One autumn day I found myself at the station at Omaha about to take the eastward train . In the baggage-room of the station I had some hours before left quite a heavy trunk , for which I now presented my check . The sternly silent baggage-master found it , seized it , and , without a word , tumbled it out of the door at my feet and disappeared into the recesses of his lair . The train I was to take was some distance down the same platform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I could not well carry the trunk to it , and it seemed foolish to abandon it , especially as directly in front of me an assistant baggage-master or porter of the company stood leaning against the side of the station , chewing a *traw and lazily observing me . There seemed but one short way out of the difficulty ; taking out my purse , and addressing him in the most persuasive tones , I said , " Do you think you could get a truck and wheel that trunk down to the train there for me ? " - at the same time suggestively fingering the purse . For an instant the gentleman addressed did not move a muscle ; then , after contemplating me to his satisfaction , his month opened , he stopped chewing the straw , and simply uttered the one expressive monosyllable , " No " ; - this done , he resumed the mastication of his straw , and the conversation ceased . In that case it is fair to presume that the public had worried and annoyed the poor fellow by asking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even as I had , for all sorts of services ; but the ingenuity of discourtesy with which he retaliated was certainly deserving of all praise , nor can I doubt that before this his merit has been recognized , and he has been promoted to the office of freightagent , or , perchance , assistant superintendent . The explosion of wrath and hatred against the railroad cor // porations which marked the progress of the Granger movement furnished abundance of evidence , if any evidence were necessary , of the all-pervading character of this description of deportment . It was encountered , probably , at every turn , and as the regular accompaniment of every transaction . It was seen in the very curt and unceremonious manner with which , some nine months since , the information was conveyed to Governor Taylor of Wisconsin that the railroad companies did not propose to pay any attention whatever to the " Potter Law . " In the same spirit the officials of the roads held at arm's-length the members of the various commissions that were created . Instead of at once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all their familiarity with the railroad system , of all their intimate knowledge of its workings , of all their social and financial l ) ower , they ignored the existence of these boards , and thus wantonly threw away the greatest strength of their position . They apparently preferred to fight it out at the expense of their stockholders . Thus , in the dealings of the railroad corporations with the people of the West , every favor they conferred produced much the same sensation on the party receiving it as an ordinary refusal , while a refusal was apt to leave the rankling sting of an insult . Such were the relations existing between the people of the West and the railroad corporations of the West about the year 1872 . The community had got its railroad system , but it was not working in all respects as it had been supposed it would work , and those whom it was built to serve were made to realize that its ownership was in foreign hands , which held it with a view to drawing profit from it . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , this people , in place of seeing only the want of railroads , saw only the abuses incident to the management of railroads . In order to quicken construction they had rushed headlong into the wretched land-grant policy , ; amid now the railroad companies were become monopolists and speculators , and held vast tracts of land at inordinate prices , which the settler would ultimately find himself compelled to pay . Not satisfied with this the towns and counties had been bonded , and even the private farms mortgaged to hold out new inducements to construction ; and now the interest began to press , // and so , what with the gradual appreciation of paper-money in value , aud the results of that protective system which euriched the manufacturer at the expeuse of the agriculturist ; and what with two or three exceptionally good years in America and as many in iRussia aud Hungary , - what with all these things , the Western mind was perplexed in tt*e extreme , and looked eagerly about for something with which to find fault . Had the people been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down below the mere outward aspect of things , and found the real source of their trouble in that curious combination of protection and paper-money which , through a series of years , had been regularly forcing up the market price of everything except the products of the soil . Being what they were , however , their thoughts naturally dwelt upon the one obvious fact that the product of their farms was at home worth but a fractional part of what it was worth in Liverpool , and that the other portions were eaten up in transportation . The railroad companies were far from popular , their management teemed with abuses , causes of complaint existed against them no less grave than notorious ; and so the impetuous Western farmer saw only these facts , and , as his anger blazed up , he became at once deaf to reason , to law , or to considerations of remote self-interest . So now the railroads were no longer the pioneers of dawning civilization or the harbingers of an increased prosperity ; they were the mere tools of extortion in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ East , - marauders , banditti , usurers , public enemies . The extravagant utterances of that time would seem incredible were they not recorded . For instance , here are two of a long series of resolutions adopted at the great convention of the Granges held at Springfield , Ill. , on the 2d of April , 1873 - " Second , The railways of the world , except in those countries where they have been held under the strict regulation and supervision of the government , have proved themselves of as arbitrary extortion and opposed to free institutions and free commerce between the states as the feudal barons of the Middle Ages . " Third , That we hold , declare , and resolve that this despotism , which defies our laws , plunders our shippers , impoverishes our peo // pie , and corrupts our government , shall be subdued and made to subserve the public interest , at whatever cost . " This comparison between the modern railroad corporation and the feudal baron has in it something grotesquely absurd , but it was very popular among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in nearly all their more labored and ornate productions . In June , 1873 , for example , numerous county gatherings put forth a declaration of farmers ' grievances and principles , in which occurred this notable passage " The history of the present railway monopoly is a history of repeated injuries and oppressions , all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute tyranny over the people of these States unequalled in any monarchy of the Old World , and having its only parallel in the history of the mcdi*val ages , when the strong hand was the only law , and the highways of commerce were taxed by the feudal barons , who , from their strongholds , surrounded by their armies of vassals , could levy such tribute upon the traveller as their own wills alone should dictate . " It is , however , little better than a waste of room to repeat these will utterances ; for in fact it may be briefly said that no language was found strong enough to characterize those who at that very time , under the stimulus of avarice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country , were literally sinking millions upon millions in the construction of railroads which were destined to be at once monuments of Eastern folly and the source of Western prosperity . As usual , however , the wild utterances took the form of yet wilder laws . The enactment of laws was demanded which should regulate the l ) roflts , the methods of operation , and the political relations of the railroads ; the corporations were to be made to realize , as the phrase went , that " the created was not greater than the creator " ; that the railroads were the servants of the people , and not their masters . Here was the complete abandonment of the whole theory of regulation by natural law , under which the railroad system of the West had been organized and had grown up . It was brought to a logical result . If that theory was worth anything at all , the remedy for the ills under which the community was suffering would at once come into play . // The railroads were not monopolies . There was nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and competing lines of roads side by side with those already in operation , from one end to the other of every Western State . Here was the remedy through competition , and the mere statement of it revealed the utter absurdity of the whole theory which had been at the base of thirty years of legislation . The position was , in fact , a very difficult one ; and its greatest difficulty lay in the fact that the remedy appeared to lie upon the surface . When natural laws break down it is apt to seem a very trifling matter to set them going once more by some little act of Legislature . In other words , if , as the Grauger philosophers assert , " the created is not greater than the creator , " he is , at any rate , when duly chosen to the Legislature , infinitely wiser , and the sadly bungled laws of nature are continually ameiided and made right through the beautiful symmetry which marks the enactments of the statutebook . In America a law is the popular pan a*ea for every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or economical . The faith and simple confidence in which it is applied has in it something bordering upon the sublime . Our men are made temperate by one chapter of the statute-book and our women virtuous by another ; people are prevented from overworking themselves by a " ten-hour law , " and kept from paying more interest than is good for them by a usury law ; the amount of currency necessary to carry on the business of the country must be regulated by a legal-tender act , and the character of our industries by a so-called protective system . Our statute-books are in fact most curious and valuable monuments of the very trivial inroads which have in this department as yet been made by us as a people into the vast domain of ignorance . As a rule , they evince upon the part of our law-makers about the same degree of acquaintance with the principles and limits of legislation , as the star-gazers of the fifteenth century possessed with those of astronomy , or the alchemists with those of chemistry . All this was illustrated to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficulty arose from deep seated causes ; the agencies upon which the community had relied for the proper regulation of its whole system of // internal transportation had broken down , and the machinery through which alone the work could be carried on was the property of aliens and foreigners . If ever a problem called for wise legislation , founded upon careful and patient study , this one certainly did . The Grauger Legislatures , however , went at it like so many bulls at red rags . For three years it was useless to argne , useless to refer to experience , useless to point oat absurdities or incongruities . No inquiry into the remote consequences of legislation was deemed necessary ; no investigation of the hidden causes of the difficulty was tolerated ; there the difficulty was , and a law such as almost any man who knew how to write at all could easily draw up in an afternoon , would , it was confidently believed , at once remedy it . Yet practically the control of the railroads was to be taken out of the hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those of the State . The arguments encountered in the discussion of this question were of the most appalling description . On one occasion I suggested to a Western man , occupying a prominent official position connected with railroad legislation , the grave doubts I entertained whether , under the shifting system of administration in use in this country , it was practicable for the government to deal with the complicated details which arose in the preparation of railroad tariffs . The answer was immediate and a veritable clincher . " Sir , " said the prairie Solon , drawing himself up to his full height of six feet one and one half inches , " you will never make me doubt that a government which could put down that mighty Rebellion can regulate the details of a few tariffs of some railroad corporations ! " The last previous occasion on which I remembered to have heard that argument had been when General Garfield of Ohio advanced it , with great applause , in reference to an alleged inability of the revenue officials to collect a tax of one dollar and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Always , however , brilliant in conception , - always fresh , it is an argument which is almost certain to bring discussion to a close . The legislative struggle was , however , soon over . Laws were passed amid went into effect under which entire tariffs of charges were imposed upon the railroad corporations . These , // of course , the corporations resisted in the courts , not always in the most judicious manner , upon the ground that under the Constitution of the United States the Legislatures had no authority to practically confiscate private property by decreeing that the public might enjoy it on paying therefor an inadequate compensation , or no compensation at all if it so saw fit . On this question more will be said presently . One of the least creditable features of the Western character now , however , began at once to reveal itself , - an extreme restiveness under the restraints of law . This is a not unnatural remnant of the old frontier life , and one which is rapidly passing away ; but i.n 1873 it is none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voters of what is beyond question the leading State of the Northwest could not and would not understand how any court of law should presume to set aside as illegal a duly authenticated expression of the popular will . The prevalent idea in this respect , so wholly different from that which prevails in longer-settled communiLies , so revolting to every sense of calm , well-ordered justice , was well and tersely expressed by a witness before the Windom Committee , so called , of the United States Senate , on Transportation Routes , of 1873 . The name of the witness was Samuel P. Tufts , and he went before the committee as representing the Northwestern Farmers ' Convention already referred to , which held its sessions in Springfield , Ill. , in April , 1873 . He had expressed to the committee the opinion that Congress should enact a law limiting passenger fares to three cents per mile upon all railroads which passed from one State to another ; the following colloquy then took place between Senator Slierman and himself . Mr. Sherman suggested this case : - Question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law of the State chartering the railroad company and inviting capitalists to build the road in the State has stipulated that they should receive five cents a mile for passenger traffic , and has made it a part of the charter . Have you considered that difficulty l Answer . It ought to be abrogated and wiped out . Q ii . lIave you ever considered the difficulty of abrogating it , under the Constitution of the United States Ans . There are different views of that . We hold , and that position // is generally advocated by the farmers in the West , that all power rests with the people , and that they can remodel all laws which are made to affect them ; and that the law of Congress that was passed in the interests of the people , which conies in contact with charters that have been adopted even under the provisions of the Constitution , would receive the support of the people and be sanctioned by popular approval . Qu . I am not speaking now of the law of Congrcss ; but suppose the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Constitution of the United States declares that no State shall impair the obligation of a contract ? Ams . They must alter their law . I do not apprehend that the contracts ought to he binding . Q a . The difficulty is , suppose that Congress should undertake to change the law , and the Supreme Court should declare it to he unconstitutional under that provision ? Ans . Then do as they did in the Dred Scott ( decision . Wipe the Supreme Court out and get one that would decide it . Q u . We are all in favor of cheap transportation , but we desire to see the difficulties in the way of legislation . You would , then , reverse the decision of the Supreme Court by the popular will ? Ans . Yes , sir . Now , in thus expressing his views , Mr. Tufts not only said what be himself believed , but he described nothing more than had more than once in the Western States actually been done , and that , too , on questions affecting the rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago that a popular contest , which excited fully as much feeling locally as the Granger movement has over a wider field , raged in the West on the question whether railroad corporations had or had not a purely private character ; because , if they were purely private , then the municipalities were unauthorized to a.ppropriate to their use the public funds , and the bonds which had been issued in aid of these enterprises had been issued without right , and constituted no debt collectable at law . In plain English , it was a move for practical repudiation under cover of a technicahity , the point being that the authorities had exceeded their power in appropriating public money to private uses . The // courts held that the railroads were quasi public corporations , and that the bonds issued by towns and counties in aid of their construction were a valid debt against the localities which issued them . Not pleased with this decision , the people of certain of the Granger States proceeded to , and actually did , reverse it by the process of electing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bench , other judges pledged to a different construction of the law . The bench was thus packed , and this packed bench rendered a decision which is subsequently referred to in an opinion of the Supreme Court of the United States as " standing out in unenviable solitude and notoriety ; " *  --  and recognizing the ingenuity of the self-stultification , the opinion of the Supreme Court was concluded with this stinging and xvell-merited rebuke : " We shall never immolate truth , justice , and the law , because a State tribunal has erected the altar and decreed the sacrifice . " Now , however , the whirligig of time had brought its revenges , and it had ceased to be convenient to consider railroads as purely private corporations . It was necessary for their regulation that their public character should undergo development , and the Granger was fully equal to the occasion . In the early part of the year 1873 a case was brought before the Supreme Court of Illinois , which involved the constitutionality of the acts under which the Legislature had sought to impose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision of the court was unanimous , and in undoubted accordance with the law . The opinion was prepared by Chief Justice Lawrence , who , while pronouncing the legislation , as it then stood , unconstitutional , at the same time went out of his way to point out the very simple process through which the defects in it could be remedied . None the less this decision gave great offence to the Grangers , and they proceeded to forniulate their objections to it . While their conventions resolved that " the doctrine of vested rights belongs to a past age and despotic rule , and has no legitimate place in the jurisprudence of a free people , " their leading authorities enlarged upon the text , and one of them , a certain Dr. M. M. Hooton , of Centrahia , Vice-President of the Illinois State Farmers ' Association * Gelpeke v. City of Dubuque , 1 Wallace , 206. // thus publicly stated the issue as tersely as his brother VicePresident Tufts could have done - " What , then , do the farmers complain of l " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is , is about a hundred years hehind the business and people of this country . " Second , The court attempts to rule the country , regardless of the wishes of the people ; usurping the right to make the dictum of the court the law of the land , no matter what the wishes of the people may be . " The Illinois Grangers , however , did not by any means stop with empty denunciations ; on the contrary , they proceeded at once to evidence their faith by works . It so happened that the term for which Chief Justice Lawrence bad been chosen to the bench expired at about this time . Accordingly , on the first of May succeeding the publication of the opinion in the railroad cases , a nominating convention was held at Princeton , Ill. , which first proceeded to revise the law of the Chief Justice , and then to select another man to succeed him on the bench . The resolves of this and of other similar nominating conventions at about the same time are curiosities , and deserve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of some future history of the elective judiciary . The opinion of the court to the contrary notwithstanding , it was declared that railroad charters were not contracts at all , and that the Illinois legislation was constitutional , and that the judiciary ought to decide it to be so . Difficult points of constitutional law were thus disposed of in towii meeting , and candidates for the ermine were called upon to pledge themselves as to how they would decide cases involving the rights of numberless private persons , in advance of all argument , and as a condition of their promotion to the bench . At the election in June , 1873 , Chief Justice Lawrence was defeated by a heavy popular majority , though generally supported by the bar of his district , and a Mr. Craig was elected in his place . Had they cast about them with all the ingenuity of perversity , the Grangers could not have devised a worse , a more fatal blow at all effort at wellconsidered railroad reform . Americans are not wont to be sparing of their denunciations when , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find the scales of justice weighted down either // by the hand of a despot or the sword of a tyrant . It may well be questioned , however , whether in the whole history of modera civilization there can be found a parallel to the Illinois bench-packing of 1873 , whether as respects its outrageon sdisregard of all considerations of decency or the brazen brutality with which it was done ; - which , indeed , carried with it the single defence of which the transaction admitted , that those concerned knew no better . There is , however , one point in connection with all the legal proceedings that sprang out of the Granger legislation which is deserving of more notice than it has received . The corporations uniformly fell back on their constitutional guaranties ; and , these guaranties apart , it seemed to be conceded on all sides that railroad companies had no rights which legislative majorities were bound to respect . In Illinois the corporations sought shelter behind the Constitution of the United States and the decision in the Dartmouth College case . It may well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been far better for them , had they been compelled to defend themselves through the merits of their cause . In Wisconsin the circumstances were different ; a constitutional provision there exists securing to the Legislature of the State a power of altering , amending* or repealing all charters . The effect of this clause apparently is to restore to the Legislature of Wisconsin full parliamentary powers within certain limits , - powers as ample as those possessed by the British Parliameat . Unfortunately , however , as the recent railroad legislation of that State seems to show , our legislators have become demoralized through the custom of looking only to written constitutions for a restraint on their action ; and , when the restrictions in those instruments are removed or cease to apply , they fail to realize that others are still effective . In a civilized community the precepts of common honesty are surely entitled to some respect in and by themselves . The earliest constitution , whether of Illinois or of Wisconsin , is young beside the great commandment , " Thou shalt not steal ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , more than once pressed hard upon it , and that , too , upon the averred ground that there was nothing to the contrary in the Constitu VOL. cxx. - NO. 247. 27 // tions of the States . It is certainly not flattering to our national pride , nor conducive to a renewed faith in written constitutions , to reflect that much of the recent Illinois and Wisconsin railroad legislation would have been indignantly thrown out of Parlia*rent , riot as being contrary to any provision of a written code , but for the aimple and obvious reason that it was opposed to common right , to common decency , and to common-sense . Apart from questions of discrimination and those relating to the local management of their railroads , the Granger agitation was based upon two hypotheses , neither of which will bear a close examination . The first of these was that the West was paying to the corporations owning its railroads an inordinate profit on the work of transporting its products to the seaboard ; and , second , that these profits were made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the roads . The first proposition generally took the form of a statement , more or less correct , as to the propdrtion borne between the value of a bushel of corn in the West and the cost of transporting it to a market at New York ; in general terms it would be said that of five bushels of corn , four were taken by the railroads as the price for carrying the other one to a market . This may perfectly well be true , and yet signify absolutely nothing . Before finding fault with what is paid for a service , it is desirable to know what the service is ; - what , in this case , was the distance of the market ? As a matter of course there must be a point somewhere to which transportation would cost more than the entire worth of the article transported , especially if that article should chance to be heavy and of small intrinsic value . The transportation-tables which have long been in use show that upon a common earth road corn of the ordinary value can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be consumed in the cost of its transportation . By rail , however , it can be carried some 1,650 miles . Because it can be carried this much greater distance , it is manifestly absurd to claim that there is no limit to which it may not be carried before that result should be arrived at ; the only question is whether it is carried a proper and reasonable distance . On this point the Granger authorities have never met the statistics presented by the railroad corporations , and , indeed , // it is not easy to see how these could be met . Under the stress of competition over great distances , it would be found that , as respects this class of business , the usual and obvious result had been arrived at , - that peculiar description of merchandise is carried at less than cost , and something else has to make good the loss incurred upon it . Neither are the Granger authorities more fortunate in their second proposition , that the extortionate charges of the railroad corporations are made necessary in order that dividends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fictitious cost of the railroad system . The case is thus stated by the Hon. William M. Springer of Illinois , a leading Granger authority , in a widely circulated speech " The railroad debt inflation amounts to over $ 15,000 per mile . Interest and dividends on this sum in Illinois alone at eight per cent will amount to $ 7,600,000 anhually . This is just as much a charge upon the people as if they were Illinois State bonds . The interest and principal are alike demanded of the producers of the State . " Here is an emphatic and plausible statement . What are the facts in the case ? They are enrionsly , even ludicrously , at variance with the proposition . The indignant Mr. Springer was speaking of the State of Illinois , and the official returns of that State were probably not inaccessible to him . Illinois is essentially the railroad State of the Union ; railroads made it , and the superb system of roads which make their returns to its cominissioners include a larger aggregate mileage than any other State in the Union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the total is no less than 13,462 miles , one sixth part of all the railroad system of the United States , and a twelfth part of that of the whole world . The proposition is that $ 15,000 of fictitious securities , representing no investment actually made , have been issued on each and every mile of this railroad system , upon which the community is oblIged to pay interest which he computes at eight per cent , and the binding character of which upon the people he asserts to be practically the same as that of Illinois State bonds . The statistical tables to be found in the report of the Illinois Commissioners for 1874 show the aggregate cost of construction of all the railroads included in them to be $636,000,000 , upon which net annual earnings // to the amount of $ 30,570 , OOOIare reported ,  --  a trifle , it will be noticed , over 4.8 per cent ; a rate of interest but little more than half of that alleged , and a very materially lower rate than that required on Illinois State bonds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the amount of railroad returned was represented by at least $ 15,000 of fictitious securities . If , therefore , this sum is deducted , it will on the whole aggregate of the mileage amount to no less than $ 202,000,000 , reducing the capital account to $ 434,000,000 . Upon this reduced amount - the dry , waterless residue of the investment - the entire net earnings represeiit an annual returti of exactly seven per cent - results somewhat at variance with those evolved from their inner consciousness by the Granger economists . Tried by this killing test , Illinois , however , shows better than any other of the Granger States . Their statistics , indeed , are curiosities when examined in a fresh memory of the railroad niania and the Granger agitation . The Wisconsin returns include 4,686 miles of railroad , of which 2,360 are within the limits of the State . The cost of these roads is reported at the not unreasonable amount of $ 157,000,000 , or $ 33,000 per mile ; certainly sums calculated to excite coinment only because of their moderation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) represeiit a modest return of 4.3 per cent . Fearlessly , however , following out the hard rule applied in the case of Illinois , and striking off $ 15,000 a mile as fictitious values from the very reasonable figures just stated , we find the cost reduced to an average of $ 18,000 per mile , - a result utterly preposterous . Even upon that , however , the net earnings of the system represent an annual profit not exceedingeight per ceiit . Wisconsin , too , be it remembered , is the State whose Legislature , by the enactment in 1874 of the most ignorant , arbitrary , and wholly unjustifiable law to be found in the history of railroad legislation , reduced the freight tariffs of its railroads twenty to fifty per cent . It is the governor of Wisconsin , also , who , in 1875 , is unable to find words sufficiently strong in which to repel the imputation that the people or Legislature of that State are actuated by any feelings towards foreigii investors other // than those of the purest and strictest justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his composition ; but there is a familiar couplet from an old English play which the unfortunate foreign investor might well and ruefully suggest for his prayerful consideration - " Perhaps it was right to dissemble your love , But - why did you kick me down stairs ? " Turning next to Minnesota , we find that State returning on August 31st , 1873 , 1,900 miles of road at a nominal cost of $121,589,000 . Dealing in round numbers , and reducing this aggregate to $47,000,000 , or $ 25,000 per mile of completed road , the people of Minnesota pay those making the investment as nearly as can be ascertained the almost bashful annual return of three per cent upon this condensed , waterless result . Taking now the tables in Poor 's Manual , in the absence of any more trustworthy guide , we find Iowa credited with 2,734 miles of road , represented by $ 96,000,000 of securities , and titus not charged with a cost exceeding $35,000 a mile ; upon this the net earnings of the system represent an annual return of about four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per mile of fictitious values , and so reducing the cost of this system to the low standard of $ 20,000 per mile , we find that upon this reduced valuation the entire net earnings are equivalent to an annual return of only seven per cent . Kansas is credited with 2,215 miles of road , represented by a capital of $ 118,000,000 . An unusually large proportion of this is fictitious , and for that reason it would be safe to throw out of the account , not $ 15,000 , but $30,000 per mile ; and yet , even with this liberal deduction , it will be found that the people of Kansas annually pay a profit of but six per cent on the capital invested in their means of transportation . Here , then , are the five great Granger States , - those in which the cry against the unfeeling extortions and the inordinate profits of the railroad " monopolists , " " Shylocks , " " marauders , " " banditti , " " feudal barons , " and " tyrants " has rung out loudest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawn from the returns ? Those returns include 25,000 miles of railroad . It may be objected that a portion , and no // inconsiderable portion , of this amount enters more than once into the total . That fact , however , does not affect the results , as the securities , the discounts , and the earnings all enter into the computations in the same degree . These 25,000 miles of road are represented by $ 1,130,000,000 of paper securities , upon which the net earnings of the system equal , not eight per cent , but just half of that amount , four per cent . Casting out of this great aggregate thirty-six per cent of fictitious capital , reducing it at once by $16,000 per mile and by a grand total of $400,000,000 to a dry , waterless basis , we find that the aggregate of the net earnings represent an annual return of just 6.5 per cent on the investment . This certainly is neither usurious nor oppressive . Six and one half per cent on the reduced cash capital is a very different thing from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Springer goes on , in the torrent of his indignant denunciation , declaiming against the wroiigs under which his people suffer , and in the next breath declares that , though they will not submit to a continuance of the existing system of charges , yet " railroad tariffs that would pay reasonable running expenses and seven per cent on the actual cost of the roads and equipment would be cheerfully paid by all the people . " Under the Granger process of reasoning , therefore , it would appear that 6.5 per cent is an outrageous extortion to be resisted to the bitter end , while seven per c3nt is a reasonable profit to be cheerfully paid The simple truth is that the Granger authorities , as respects the construction of railroads , gravely suggest a most plausible arran gei*cut , the innate absurdity of which they do not themselves seem to appreciate . In plain language , they wish others to take all the risk , while they are to retain the entire excess of profit , which was the inducement for which that risk was incurred . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is found by experience to be a most dangerous business to engage in . The average profit on the actual investment hardly exceeds five per cent per annum , and the Granger States alone are now enjoying the use of some $ 200,000,000 of foreign capital , recently invested in the construction of their railroads , upon which they do not pay one dollar of interest , while a very large proportion of the principal is being swept // out of existence through bankruptcy. * Under these circumstances all their authorities - their governors , their commissioners , their legislators , their orators , and their political conventions - indIgnantly deny that the people of those States wage any war on capital . They also unite , as with one voice , in declaring the universal willingness to pay a reasonable profit on the real cost of the railroads ; but when pressed to explain what is meant by the phrase , " a reasonable profit on real cost , " it uniformly appears that they understand it to mean a reasonable profit in cases of success and nothing at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to allow the system to average itself , nor do they understand that under any circumstances they are ever to be called upon to pay more than a fair interest , and where no interest is earned - that is none of their cofleern . As the Railroad Commissioners of Illinois very fairly arid bluntly state in their last Annual Report : " There is for the business of railroading no more a royal insurance company , guaranteeing a Thir return upon any and every investment made therein , than there is for any other business . " It is very questionable , however , whether the gentlemen who made this statement will accept its other and necessary consequence . Certainly if the principles of a reasonable limit on profit and no guarantee against loss could be combined and made practically effective , it would be a most admirable arrangement for any community which was so fortunate as to find any one ready to construct its railroad system upon it . After all the losses on the had investments have been charged , and all the profits on the good ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem " reasonable , " the statistics show that the average interest paid on the entire investment would not exceed two per cent per annum . Unfortunately the plan labors under a very serious difficulty , - innate absurdity . That it should at this late day be coolly and seriously proposed by reasoning beings is truly a matter for wonderment . There is no business , there is no form of investment on earth upon which the calculations of the market-place do not work out an average , making the profit offset the losses . A low rate of // interest implies a perfect security , a practical guaranty against* loss ; a high rate of interest indicates an unusual risk , with no assurance against loss , if the Granger States of the West will guarantee to those constructing their railroads a fair and reasonable interest on the capital actually invested in them , they cau undoubtedly on those terms secure all the capital they need ; probably not at so low a rate ( five per cent ) as they now enjoy it , but still upon terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ propose to offer any guaranty , to establish any " royal insurance company , " but do propose to leave investors to take their own risks , they must then make up their minds to one of two things , - they must either let the successes offset the failures , or they must go withoi4 their railroads . Neither in Illinois nor in Wisconsin , nor anywhere else in the world , will persons of ordinary prudence invest their capital in a notoriously unsafe f'orm , in which losses may be total , while profits can only be reasonable . Hitherto , through the wretched expedients of railroad financiering , and in utter disregard of ridiculous statutes , a rough average of not unreasonable profit has worked itself out , and the development of the railroad system has gone on . The " heads-I-win , tails-you-lose " basis of future construction , now with such indescribable gravity propounded from the Northwest , may excite a grim amusement in the money markets of the world , but that any railroads which imivolve a risk of loss will be built under it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the man who l ) uilds the road will iimsist upon his guaranty against a loss , and he will have it . It is difficult , therefore , from anything which can be found in the statistics upon the subject to avoid the conclusion that , though the States of the Northwest got their railroad systems at a very high miominal cost , yet that they paid for them largely in the most worthless of paper securities ; and that the real cost , after the slow process of liquidation has worked itself out , will prove to be not only actually reasonable , but eveim considerably less than it would have been had the investment been guaranteed by the State governments . It would also seem that the people of those States have no just cause of complaint as respects the cost of moving their products to time seaboard . // there , at least , competition has produced every result which even the most sanguine could have anticipated from it . What , then , has been the real underlying , hidden cause of this widespread agitation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after all , a mere restless surface movement ? The real cause of complaint , the true source of the evils under which they suffer , has as yet received but little mention among Western mcii ; in fact , the subject is one the discussion of which they instinctively avoid , for there are no votes in ugly truths . Though the source of all their woes is not apparent on the surface , it may be described in very few words , - they have gone too far West . For this they are themselves chiefly , though not wholly , respon sible . The XVest has ever proved itself the steady , reliable ally of that wretched land-grant and subsidy policy which did so much to stimulate the mania for railroad construction . For years the ruling idea of the Western mind has been the bringing of remote acres , and ever acres more remote , under cultivation . There was thought to be some occult virtue in expediting this process , - a service to God and one 's country . Every artificial appliance and inducement was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the steady and healthy growth of civilization into regions beyond the reach of the world 's centres and outside the pale of social influence . It was this hurtful forcing process which brought about that condition of affairs which had to culminate in the Granger movement , and in the organized assault on property in railroads. lUbe people were paying the penalty of too rapid growth , - paying it just as much as any boy or girl must pay it who is so unfortunate as to outgrow strength and clothes at once . The result brought about by the unnatural diffusion of population , so far as the agricultural interests of the West were concerned , was exactly what any thinking and observing man should have anticipated , - over-production at remote points . This difficulty no iiicreased cheapness of transportation can alleviate ; it can only transfer the locality of the difficulty to a point somewhat more remote . The darling vision of the Granger 's dreams , the Utopia of his waking fancies , and the constant theme of his noisy rhetoric , is a double-track , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's barn-door // straight to the city of New York . Paradoxical as it may seem , there is not the slightest room for doubt that even the full realization of this fanciful impossibility would not at all benefit the individual farmer of the West . It would fail to benefit him for a very simple and obvious reason . The difficulty he is now laboring nuder is over-production ; the West grows more of the fruits of the soil than the world will consume at l ) resent prices . Meanwhile the area from which production is possible is not only not fully occupied , but is for all practical purposes unlimited . A reduction of the present cost of carriage , therefore , only serves by so much to extend the area from which the supply can be drawn , bxings so many additional acres and so many more farmers into the field of competition . The whole benefit of the reduction inures , therefore , not to the producer , but to the consumer . The new-corners glut the market before it can be relieved . Any reduction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , therefore , of enormous importance to us on the Atlantic seaboard , and of yet more importance to the swarming population of the British isles , - to the competing agriculturists of Eastern Europe it involves also most serious consequences , - but to the farmers of the West , as a class , it amounts to nothing more than one additional step in continuance of that same progress which has steadily been going on for over thirty years , and which they now claim has brought them to their present hard and desperate pass . Ever since 18*O the cost of transportation has been growing cheaper and cheaper , until it has now touched points which would once have been considered incredible ; yet the standing complaint of the farmer is still that the cost of carriage consumes the whole value of his product ; just as much so to-day , when the limit of its carriage is sixteen hundred miles , as fifty years ago when it was but one hundred and sixty miles . The Grauger movement touches , then , the real cause of the evil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it tends to supplement the disasters of the recent financial crisis and put a complete stop to all further immediate railroad construction . In this way it may help to hold in check the existing tendency of population to diffuse itself prematurely , and restore the conntry to a healthy , because more measured process of de // velopruent . This , however , is a result which its leaders and would-he philosophers have not contemplated , and which partakes , indeed , somewhat of a boomerang character . rrlley may , however , yet learn that what we need is not always that which is pleasant to get , and that we sometimes build more wisely than we know . Meanwhile the recent halting and confused action of the legislatures of the Northwest makes it apparent enough that the Granger flood is reached , and that the ebb will soon follow , - the movement is now obviously losing its strength . Though it accomplished little that it intended , it has yet , unconsciously to itself and through that rough process of attrition by which most results that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those more superficial grievances which gave it its only popular strength . It has placed many preposterous laws on the statnte-books of the West , which will probably long remain there , undisturbed memorials of legislative incapacity , and about as formidable as those ancient blunderhusses which sometimes in old-fashioned houses ornament the kitchen wall . Undoubtedly it has seriously hupaired the credit of those States more especially identified with it , amid notably that of Ilhimiois and of Wisconsin . For this , of course , they will have to pay dearly ; - higher interest and more binding guaranties will unquestionably be exacted of them , and , what is more , they will have to give them . Habitual borrowers can not afford to play tricks with their credit , and it will be very long indeed before either the defeat of Judge Lawrence or the provisions of the " Potter Law " are forgotten in Wall Street or on the Royal Exchange . In some respects the results produced by the movement have been most beneficial . The corporatiomis owning the railroads have been made to realize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , to be operated successfully , they must be operated in sympathy with the people of the West . The whole system of discriminations and local extortions has received a much-needed investigation , the results of which can not but mitigate or wholly remove its more abominable features ; finally , certain great principles of justice and equality , heretofore too much ignored , have been driven by the sheer force of discussion , backed by a rising public opimlion , into the very essence // of the railroad policy . All this is much gained . The burnt child fears the fire , and the Granger States may rest assured that , through an indefinite future , the offensive spirit of absentee ownership will be far less perceptible in the management of their railroads than it was before and during the great railroad mania . Finally , East and West , the good which has resulted and yet will result from the Granger movement will be found greatly to predominate over the evil ; what is more , the good will survive , while the evil will pass away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
