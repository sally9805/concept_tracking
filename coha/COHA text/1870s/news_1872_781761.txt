txt Ghost stories have an undying popularity , and many are the firesides during these Christmas Holidays at which such tales have been heard with awe and admiration . There seems to be , even in the most skeptical of minds , a certain grain of credulity about apparitions , and . this it is which en-dows accounts of them with such perennial interest . It may be said that this interest only proves the appetite of mankind for the marvelous and . extravagant ; but such a statement hardly explains the matter . Fairy tales answer this description ; but fairy tales only please children ; whereas ghost stories have a charm for young or old , for the ignorant or educated . If we may draw a distinction as to the relative popularity of ghoets , we should say that the favorites are ' those that have a local habitation as well as a name . It is not desirable that these mysterious beings , however incorporeal , should be too shadowy . When we van look right through a ghost , as in RETZCH 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him is sensibly diminished . Perhaps one reason for this is that the more diaphanous the object , the more we are unconsciously , impressed with the possi-bility of optical delusion . On the other hand , too opaque a ineetre , besides involving something like a pontradiction in Lem 's , . shocks our sense of propriety . Hence a judicious lines deleted much higher than if he went pottering vaguely about for no assignable end : These considerations account for the exceptionaL esteem in which ghosts are held who haunt houses or other particular localities ; and hence we can understand the excitement that has been produced in London by the proposed disturbance of some ghosts who have occupied houses in the heart of that city for something like half a century . The story of these houses is singular . Particularly to one in Stamford-street , the repute of being haunted has attached for a long time . Every now and . then a report would go through the neighborhood that a Abort was walking about the rooms , and crowds would collect and the matter be no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house has been without a bodily tenant ; and . there are six other houses also in Stamford-street that have likewise been empty . for the same time . They are now in a state of wretched dilapidation , and it is said that the loss of rent upon them will Mid a aunt Of . $300,000 . Various reasons have : . been given for . this strange state of things ; but the explanation most generally acceptable has ' been . that the supernatural occupants frightened people away , and . that . in short , no fleshly persons could be allowed to dwell there .. Only within ... the last fortnight have the facts of this curious business been made public . It appears the property once belonged to a solicitor named REID . This gentleman , for a mere whim , resolved not to let any portion of his property . Having a large fortune , apart from real estate , he could afford to indulge his caprice , and this he persistently did . When he died , he left a strict injunction to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religiously obeyed , and , dying in turn , left the houses on the same terms to her daughter . The latter died during last December , and hence the present disclosures . She lived a very Penurious life , and . saw no one but a single old female servant . The twe dwelt in a corner of one of the houses in Stamfordstreet , and periodically , at night , used to visit the other houses adjacent . On these occasions they carried a lantern , and , wandering through the rooms , probably thus gave rise to the ghostly rumors so long in circulation . It seems the last deceased old lady left no will , and . had no apparentheirs ; but , immediately after her death became known , parties claiming to be such came forward and . took possession of her home . It is reported that they have since found cash to the amount of more than ene hundred thousand dollars hidden about the house , and that other claimants have been heard of , and that the case is likely to get into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the story naturally provokes disappointment . There seems really , however . no conclusive reason for altogether abandoning it . If people take pleasure in believing the Stamford-street houses to have been haunted , they might as well believe it now as before . In the absence of any assigned motive for Mr. Ram 's eccentric behavior , it is plausible to suppose that he intended the houses to serve as places of recreation and quiet retirement for his own ghost , and ultimately for a kind of family spiritual mausoleum . It is obvious that the chance , as Mr , WALT Warrmax would put it , ? " to loaf and invite his soul " in. congenial privacy , would be much improved by the policy which Mr. Rum adopted . The fact that two old women occasionally prowled. about the rooms with a lantern by no means disposes of this rational conjecture , and need . in no way have interfered . with the ghost 's comfort . If , as is stated , the houses are to be put in immediate repair and let , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to doubt any speedy interference with the spectral society , should the property be thrown into the Court of Chancery ; and perhaps Mr. REID , with professional astuteness , foresaw this contingency , and resolved to profit by it .
