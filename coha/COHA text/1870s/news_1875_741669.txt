txt Gentlemen who are now in training for service as orators next year , may profitably lake notice of the variety of oratory so far furnished this year . We have already begun to celebrate the events which preceded the Declaration of Independence , by observing their one hundredth anniversaries . Indeed , to such an extent has this centurycommemorating spirit been carried that some students of colonial history have actually gone back two centuries for subjects . They lately celebrated the bi-centennial of King PHILIP 'S war in New-England , a festive clam-bake and its accompaniments having ushered in the oratorical display which was designed to revive memories of the time when aborigines yet held possession of the territory now given up to thrifty ' farms and manufacturing towns . The speeches on this occasion were naturally reminiscent , as it is impossible to avoid contrasting the present with the past . So were the Concord and Lexington orations ; each speaker easily drifted into the picture gallery of our colonial history , and described the famous men and scenes with which all our national beginnings are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ largely occupied with historical description , and oven Gen. SIIERMAN , when coerced into saying something , grew jocose over the historic doubt cast on the name of the hill " famous in the fight , " and declared that if there was any Mr. BREED about there , lie had better get out of the way . Earlier in the year , too , we had reports of the celebration of the Mecklenburgers of North Carolina , and , though one man bad the ill-taste to talk about some things that were not legitimately connected with the anniversary , the general spirit of all that was said was patriotic and sensible . If our Connecticut neighbors choose to pacify the perturbed ghost of " Old Put , " in view of Boston 's supposed neglect of the hero of the breakneck horseback ride by a Putnam centennial , we have no doubt that the exercises will be appropriate . Wo have been accused of being a people fond of gorgeous flights of rhetoric , big figures of speech , and grandiloquence in oratory . The callow youth " whose home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fair typo of native sentiment and form of expression . The prosecuting attorney , whose hapless victim " arose in the blackness of the night , when nothing was heard but the silent muttering of the distant thunder , and , with the rapacity of a robber baron of the Rhine , stole eleving skeins of totting yarn , " may have been a fair example of a school of public speakers now passing away . What is called Fourth of July oratory is quite different from the variety of eloquence once peculiar to that festal day . But it is noticeable that from feasts of mere figures of speech , we have come into possession of homely facts and plain philosophic principles on our national festival occasions . The spread-eagle style of oratory has been mercilessly satirized . It is no longer tolerated by the mass of the people . We have celebrated the Fourth of July for nearly a century , and wo have come upon a modification of style , both in the manner of celebrating and in the average character of the thoughts presented for that day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to appear in oratory , they might have been expected during the centennials on which wo have just entered . If these somewhat ludicrous effects in speech-making were ever to be dreaded , we might look for them next Independence Day and . in the observances next year . Nevertheless , the orations so far made have been characterized by moderation , dignity , and patriotic familiarity with the principles underlying our national life . We have traveled so far beyond the early dangers which our fathers met and subdued , we have less and less occasion for jubilation , and more frequent necessity for reading the lessons of the past , that we may look at the present with intelligence and appreciation . ? In other words , we have got out of the era of youthful glorification , and have entered one which demands the exercise of prudence , judgment , and dignity . This is certainly apparent in the orate of the period . We must have the climbing rocket , the irritating fire-crack , and . the noisy artillery , we suppose , but t day of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
