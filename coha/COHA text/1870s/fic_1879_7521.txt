Gilder , Richard Watson , 1844-1909 : Make me a summer song , for music meet from " Make me a summer song , for music meet " ( 1879 ) " Make me a summer song , for music meet , And you shall hear it when you come again . Let it be full of life And sunshine and of flowers . " Thus should it run , "  --  she smiling spoke , and then Struck the white keys and played a joyful tune : ' T was winter , but I thought The birds began to sing . I waited till the buds should bloom once more , For then , I said , my song were better tuned  --  Catching a sound of mirth From the awakening world . O friend ,  --  dear friend ! The winter has gone by But still thy poet 's song will not be glad While the bright flowers of June Blossom above thy grave . Richard Watson Gilder.                   @ @
