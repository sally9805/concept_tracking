BROTHER CHRISTOPHER . I HAVE never considered myself proud ; I have cherished democratic ideas , and scarcely ever observed a poor person thoughtfully , without a wish that there were not those distinctions of rich and poor , cultured and uncultured , and a vision of the blessedness of the millennium , when a fortunate few will not be thus favored above their fellows . My sympathies have always been with the weak , and I have endeavored to cast what little influence I had in that scale . And yet , - and yet , - is the remark not made every day , " He is human " ? Ah , yes , there it is ; I am human . I have , in spite of my democratic principles , been all the time conscious of a terrible humanness which brought all my lofty , generous , liberal ideas down to the very earth , and dragged them in its mire . I pitied the poor .. If I could have done so without any detriment to myself , or with none to speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 1 believed there were brighter minds and truer hearts and nobler souls among them than are always to be found in the mansions of the rich . I have spoken to my poor acquaintances in the street with nearly as much politeness and carefulness as to my more fortunate friends . I went to call upon them sometimes , even , and was very condescending and affable towards them at all times , and , in my own mind , ready to admit that in reality , and the sight of Heaven , very many of them were my superiors . // But I might as well say it outright , since I have undertaken the confession : I was ashamed of my brother Christopher , and of his wife Sophronia , and of their children . Now , I can inform persons who have had no experience in the matter , that it is quite a different thing to bow politely and benignly to shabby , inelegant persons in the street , whom one may happen to know , but with whom one has no personal connection , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's own blood relations , when they happen to be of the shabby and inelegant class . We were orphans , my brother and myself . He was the elder , by nine years . Christopher lived around with the different uncles ; n6w in town , going to school awhile , now out on the farm with uncle Ben ; there , or wherever he happened to be , doing what tasks were found suited to his age , committing the usual boyish misdemeanors , and getting thrashed for them in genuine Puritanic fashion ; also rebellino ' occasionally against the reasonable or unreasonable government , whichever it was , and gaining the name of being a headstrong , unmanageable boy . Twice he ran away ; but he was found easily enough , and safe enough , as soon as the little money he had taken with him was exhausted . Yet he still managed , in one way or other , to keep me , and all connected with him , in a constant state of anxiety . He delighted in the society of the wildest and commonest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the warnings nor to the commands of his guardians ; he was also inclined to be disrespectful , and in all his conduct , instead of regarding those who had charge of him as friends , he waged a rebellious warfare against them as enemies . 1 have never been able to get at any substantial evidence as to the amount of blame due to my relatives for mismanagement or lack of gentle methods of treatment ; but as near as I can come to the facts of the case , although the influences which surrounded the boy were 278 far from being as propitious as is the case when a child is brought up under the home roof , with his father and mother , yet my relatives , who were persons of high character , good standing , and no little family pride , appear to have been very anxious that their brother 's child should become a good and useful citizen , and to have done what seemed to them best , under the difficult aspects of the case , to bring about that desirable result ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be molded , and did not of himself incline toward a respectable end . The fact is , he was eccentric from a child . He had opinions of his own , not derived from those around him , and an obstinacy in clinging to them which it was a hopeless task to oppose . When he began to approach manhood , one of his most strongly expressed determinations was to belong to the common people , and he scoffed at the aristocratic ideas which prevailed in the family to some extent . lie preferred the commonest clothes , the commonest manners , and rejected , in spite of the good opportunities which were proffered him in that direction , any but the commonest education . Another strong predisposition was toward a sea-faring life , a business than which one could scarcely have been found more foreign and displeasing to the family habits and tastes . And , sure enough , his second runaway trip was to a sea-port , where he hired himself out on board a fishing-smack . " A fishingsmack ! " I remember now the shame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was ascertained , and which burned warmly in my young veins while as yet I had not the remotest idea of what a smack was , except the kind I gave Jennie Wright one day , at her earnest solicitation ; which smack made my face burn as warmly as this fishing-smack news , so that , in fact , the two kinds gained an association in my mind beyond what the mere similarity in spelling would have occasioned . After suitable deliberation and conBrother Christ op her . // sultation , it was concluded to let him fish it , or smack it , until he grew tired of the amusement , which happened after about two years of rough knocking about in this business , when he came back and signified his willingness to learn a trade . Therefore , although a trade was something unknown in the family , our friends bestirred themselves , and found him a good place for obtaining the trade he had chosen , even this turn being more than they had expected , so decided an inclination for a roving life had he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in whose very wildness my own boyish partiality for an elder brother had found something upon which to build both hopes and admiration , settled down into a plodding , contented journeyman ; as mild and harmless and tame a specimen as could ever have been produced by continual adherence to a mother 's apron strings . If you could but know him , and then be told that this man was once . a wild , irrepressible , runaway boy , keeping his friends in a continual flutter of alarm , you would be tempted to express an utter disbelief in the statement . He is as steady as any eight-day clock . This , however , did not all happen in a day . After the trade was learnt , he went , now and then , on a " spree , " and still continued to set us on nettles occasionally . At length , when he had , by seeking common society , wearing the commonest clothes , and adopting the commonest manners , fully settled himself among the commonest of the respectable class of people ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I ever knew , did a mean act in his life ) , thus achieving the height of his youthful ambition , he selected from the very commonest of this respectable common class a wife who had also the commonest manners , and looks which were only redeemed from commonness by being very uncommonly plain . She was a factory girl , who had not been to school since she was eleven years of age . She was a trifle older than Christopher himself , and in her manners that which can not be adequately described by any other word than " outlandish . " Yet she was a kindhearted woman , and not deficient in mind . This was the climax . It was a terrible blow to the family pride ; for although we were not aristocrats , either by rank or wealth , that generation was one of superior intelligence and energy , its members were among the substantial part of the community , and their ancestors had always belonged to the respected middle class . Every generation looks forward to some progress in its descendants ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started , - being sons of a worthy farmer , - and would fain have had the coming generation rise yet higher . There was some talk , among the prouder members of the family , of disowning Christopher . But he could hardly have been disowned . Who could disown him * he was only a nephew . I could have disowned him , but I was a mere boy of twelve . Disown him ! Well , I have unworthy traits enough , and I have just begun the story of one of my meannesses , but I have never come to that yet . It is no easy thing to disown your own mother 's son . If he had been only a brother on the father 's side , perhaps I could have done it , although that is very doubtful ; but there is something in a man 's heart that makes him true to his mother , even if , as in my case , he only beheld her with the unconscious eyes of early infancy . After Christopher 's marriage , he left off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he never had any fondness for liquor , and drank merely because he was in drinking company and imagined he had no one to keep sober for . Thus , abandoning the last symptom of youthful wildness , he at once became , as 1 have stated , as steady as any machine , a faithful workman , a good husband , a.lways at home when not at the shop , and as fond and faithful to this homely factory girl , who could not put three words together correctly ( to his praise be it spoken ) , as if she had been one of the fairest and most accomplished ladies of the land . 274 March , // Now 1 , the little brother , though having the same father and mother , was as great a contrast to Christopher in everything but a physical family resemblance of features , as could have been possible had one of us been born of Eastern origin , on the opposite side of the globe . My very first instincts , as far as I can remember , were ambitious ones . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if I may so speak , the love of books and literature which prevailed in the family . I was almost morbidly sensitive in regard to appearances . I was anxious to far exceed the hopes of any one who might be inclined to take an interest in me ; which last was , indeed , an easy matter ; for so inclined are persons to believe in family likenesses in character , as well as in looks , that my best efforts excited but feeble expectations in the minds of my relatives , who were always looking for me , sooner or later , to develop some of the traits so noticeable in Christopher . But , however these traits may have lain dormant in my character , they have as yet only developed in the characteristic of which I spoke in the opening of this chapter : a warm sympathy with the humble and despised , and a wish that social distinctions were not so marked . Yet how far I ought to thank my brother Christopher for this state of mind , and how far it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As a child , I looked upon the deeds of others to wish and hope that I might yet do as well or better . I regarded all greatness and grandeur with a passionate desire to realize it in my own experience , and , though an orphan , little regarded and encouraged , I never lost heart , nor thought it worth while to stop trying to be " somebody , " believing I had it in me to become that indefinite personage , even if every one around me did seem to be perfectly unsuspicious of any such possibility . I made a success finally in a small way by getting the name of a somewhat remarkable scholar at school , which so emboldened me that , after what was supposed to be my graduation , as far as education was concerned , I asked if there was n't some possibility of my going to college . " College ! " Why , I created almost as much commotion as Christopher stirred up when he ran away and went smacking . " College ! ' * Why , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very grand in comparison with Christopher 's little brother Reuben , had been to college , although in their youth every one of them had longed for the opportunity . " I 11 make the opportunity , " I said with quivering lip but beaming eye . " Only let me go , and I 11 make the opportunity . " " Go ? Make the opportunity ? Pshaw ! Go and make it , then , " they said in derision . And I went . They helped me somewhat , and I helped myself more . I worked my way , and a year after I left college , beyond my own support I had earned enough to pay my uncles back , with interest , all they had forwarded for my assistance . I chose the law for my profession , and , while I studied that , supported myself by reporting for the papers , assistant editorship , and other newspaper work . Step by step , although not without varied difficulties and discouragements , I have been enabled to advance , until now I feel myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as in some other directions . I am petted and flattered in society to a degree very far beyond my deserts , and have learned by experience the truth of the old saying , that not only will every one give the man who is going down hill a push in that direction , but will also lend a helping hand to a person who is already on the ascent . I have received so much of this gratuitous hoisting , recently , that the climbing process has been not a little accelerated . I some time since left in the rear , as regards the social scale , the relatives who naturally enough , in my childhood , looked with distrust upon my future , and have far outstripped any of their offspring ; and if so , how 1875. 275 // far have I left behind my poor brother Christopher ! I say this in no boastful spirit ; it is for those who possess inherited rank thus to boast , if any one , not he who in the winning it has found how small and poor a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may gain for himself with his own puny energies , which he can hold only for a brief period , and which , while he has it , seems , thus safe in hand , dull and commonplace to what it appeared when glistening in the distance . It is more a symbol of might than of merit , and I know that when we come to be ranked according to this latter standard I may take a lowly place , while many a one now beneath me goes above . Then ( and my heart leaps gladly at the thought ) my brother Christopher may have a chance . For indeed , a kindlier spirit than his never lived . That is where the difficulty lies . If a man is malicious , mean , mischievous , our consciences uphold us for declining to associate with him ; but if he merely eats onions , smokes poor tobacco , wears seedy , ill - made clothes , changes his linen but once a week , and has no ambitions beyond the commonest necessities of existence , where shall we condemn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capacities are so limited . If I were to seek to lay my finger upon one mean or evil trait in my brother Christopher 's character , I believe I should seek in vain . Kindly , affectionate , generous , honest , forgiving , faithful , unenvious , uncomplaining - what a list of good qualities I might make out , and still adhere closely to facts . On the other hand , what does he lack ? Energy , ambition , superior capacity , a refined taste , self-esteem , aristocratic ideas . Are these virtues ? Is any one of them essential to true worth and goodness ? I can not say " Yes , " - and can any one ? Where then is my excuse for being ashamed of my brother Christopher , and of his wife and children ? For against the latter I can say no more than I can say against him , and all I have said in his favor I can say in theirs . I find no argument in my own behalf . Therefore I tell my story and make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covered with sackcloth and ashes . Christopher loves me , and I love Christopher . The ties of blood are strong , and let who will dispute it , he deals falsely with his own heart . I visit Christopher two or three times a year , and stay part of a day . If I stay longer than this it depresses my spirits , and I fall into a fault-finding mood and . say things which I regret very much afterwards . For instance , once when I had committed the blunder of stopping with him over Sunday , I asked him why he did n't have his clothes cut in a later style . I also inquired if it was the fashion to put a child of three years into trousers , and offered to buy Soplironia a chignon . Then I suggested that a tenement in a house containing less than five families might be preferable . I noticed , at the time , that my queries and suggestions did not have any pleasanter effect than might have been anticipated , and heard afterwards that my brother and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarks which I made at that visit . Now , of all things , I have one of the greatest antipathies to the word " hurt . " I have learned to be thick-skinned myself , and if anything ever does make me smart , I never " let on , " as the boys say , and generally get something out of the smart by learning a lesson of some kind from it , as I used from a whipping in my boyhood , so that it serves me a good turn in the end . But I knew that in Christopher 's and Sophronia 's case the hurt meant simply a hurt which had not done any good , and which was merely cruel . So , whenever I went afterwards , I made no more sharp queries or suggestions out of the ordinary line . My brother and his wife have several times since my settlement in Bstated that they were coming up to see me sometime , and to this I have always replied , " Let me know when you are coming , and I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urge the visit , for I did // not feel anxious about it ; or rather I did feel anxious in one sense , inasmuch as the very thought of it filled my mind with a dread , of which I was then , and am now , thoroughly ashamed , but which , it seemed to me , I could no more help than I could an ague chill . But if they would come , they must . I thought very likely they would , and made up my mind that , sooner or later , the ordeal awaited me ; but the period being indefinite , and a long space of time having passed away without the fulfillment of the intention , I had at length almost ceased to think of it , except once in a great while , as a possible future infliction . I seemed to grow more and more popular every day , in my profession and in society , and I was even a favorite in the fashionable world of the place , with the wealthy and stylish ladies generally , as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transported , however , with these gay ladies of the bon ton ; for only two or three of them did I feel half the inward respect which I cherished for my unlettered , uncouth sister Sophronia . But their adulation had not yet lost the charm of novelty , while for me it had at this time something also of the charm of conquest , and I should have been chagrined to lose it . They had a certain dignity and prestige in virtue of their wealth and position , the influence of which I felt as much as any one could , - I who had just risen from the ranks , as it were . I have , for more than a year past , had a very comfortable and pleasant suite of rooms at one of the best hotels in B- . I can very well afford this , in the present state of my income ; yet I should not have incurred the expense , - as 1 am not of an extravagant turn of mind , - had I not considered it at first , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I have by this means been brought in contact with a very much larger number of people than I could otherwise have met ; and it has given me excellent opportunities for the study of human nature and character , a knowledge of which is of great value in my profession . There is at this house quite a large number of regular boarders , persons of wealth and high social standing , with whom I am on very friendly terms , and with whom I exchange frequent and informal calls . One morning , as I was looking over the mail which my office-boy had just brought in , I found a note from brother Christopher . It was like all his letters , brief and to the point , and ran as follows : - DEAR REUBEN , - . Sophronia and I thought , as mother Hendricks is down , and can take care of the children , we would run up and see you to-day , and bring Willie and Frank with us , as it wo n't hurt them to travel a little . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as you spoke about it . Yours truly , CITRISTOrHER . The time of trial had come . I have had several teeth extracted ; I underwent a painful surgical operation once ; I was also in a very severe battle at the time of the war : and in every such position which I can remember , however much I may have felt a cowardly dread beforehand , when the critical moment arrived , " Let the worst come , I can stand it , " was the language of my thoughts . I have shaken inwardly until the dentist 's steel clinched the tooth , and then , although I could not set my teeth , I set my resolution with a will , and thought , Pull away , old fellow , all you please ; " and after the surgeon 's knife had once cleft the skin , I felt as if I could be cut up into delicate slices with a good grace . So , on the battlefield , although I marched to the encounter with trembling limbs , after the first peal of artillery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And now , after I had read brother Christopher 's letter , I felt as though should he bring a troop like himself and his Sophronia , I could endure . Still , as in the case of the dentist 's forceps , the surgeon 's knife , the battlefield , there was a call for stolid endurance in every nerve ; there was a coward // heart within me to be vanquished , and it all but conquered me . I must play the brother 's part ; I must show them the town ; I must take them in to dinner with my friends , and to tea , too , if they would consent to remain until after that meal ; I must introduce them to such of my acquaintance as they should chance to meet . I laid out as elaborate a programme , indeed , as if I were to receive a visit from some high dignitary and his wife , and in the sudden valor of my heart resolved to carry it out like a man , let what would come . When I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relatives , I felt like a valiant hero about to perish in a good cause . But alas for lofty human resolutions ! As soon as I saw my brother Christopher and sister Sophronia , every good purpose deserted me on the instant , and I , who had faced every other trial that I could recall to mind with some show of courage , turned and fled , figuratively speaking , before nothing but my own brother and his wife . My brother is a little dumpy , oddlooking man in figure , scarcely reaching to my shoulder , and with a large head which used to perplex our relatives not a little , since they could not understand how a broad square forehead like his could help having something in it ; and I believe they for a time cherished hopes that some talent hidden closely away at present in that generous cranium might yet come to development . His wife , also , is short and dumpy after a square and angular fashion . They were as usual , on this occasion , attired in a style not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but certainly a caricature of that of the present day . I do n't know much about the technicalities of feminine apparel , and the only thing which I was certain was lacking in my sister 's outfit , to which consciousness I am able to give expression , was the entire lack of - I hope I shall get the word right - bustle . I do not admire this invention . I detest the Grecian bend , but it did seem to me that , in the present universal prevalence of this fashion , a small newspaper or some such thing , which I have been told ladies of less ambitious toilets sometimes use as a substitute , would have made Sopbronia a trifle less likely to attract attention , a result which seems to me very desirable in the way of dress , as a general rule . Further than this , language fails me in a description of Sophronia 's appearance . I only felt the fresh conviction which comes over me every time I see her , that she is thoroughly nondescript ; and so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wore a striped shirt , a suit of clothes each member of which was of a different color and texture from either of its neighbors , a new felt hat of a peculiar and unbecoming shape , and he carried in his hand a rough , covered basket , in which , as afterwards appeared , the dear fellow had brought some choice apples for me , knowing my partiality for that fruit . I went up and shook hands with them , with as much apparent pleasure and cordiality as I could possibly counterfeit . The boys tumbled out of the cars after them , two bright , pleasant little chaps , but not as handsome or graceful as if they had been got up in better style , and kept in genteel and careful habits . Instead of asking them to walk up to the hotel with me , in the bright , pleasant October sunlight , what did I do ? I said , " Step into the ladies ' room a moment , please ; I 11 be back presently , " and hurried off to procure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and ordered the driver to take us , first , around the suburbs . After a whirl about the outskirts of the town , I rallied a little of my recreant courage , and took my friends around the park , past the principal public buildings , down several of the aristocratic streets , with , however , the inward reflection that no one would dream of their being my connections . Ladies and gentlemen were bowing to me on all sides , and there was evident on most of the faces a look of passing wonder and curiosity ; but all my friends knew of my democratic and condescending manners , and probably thought I was playing the 278 March , // agreeable to some country acquaintances or clients - at least , so I said to myself . If was where I was not called upon to introduce my guests , and the thought now occurred to me that , after all , I might be able to get through the day without showing any lack of attention and politeness to them , and yet without presenting them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this dastard thought enter my mind than it summoned to its aid all my ingenuity to carry out the project . For the first time , it now occurred to me that I might , as I sometimes did when I had company , order a dinner in my own parlor . And having made my company at home in my apartments , I went directly and gave information that I had friends from out of town with me who were accustomed to dine early , and that I would like to have dinner served in my rooms as soon as possible . After dinner I left my guests to entertain themselves a while , . having some important business to attend to that afternoon . In fact , a trial in which our whole community was greatly interested was to come off , and I was to make a plea upon which some important interests were supposed to depend to a considerable degree . I had expended more time and labor on that plea than on almost any other I had been called upon to prepare since my very first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no means lengthy affair . I had felt no little enthusiasm in my subject , but this sudden and exciting diversion had , for a few hours , driven it almost out of mind . Usually I pay but slight after-attention to my MS. , finding that in working it up I get it fully established in my mind ; but now , for almost the first time in my experience as a speaker , I distrusted myself , and felt more anxious over this coming plea than over my maiden plea . I put my speech in my pocket , concluding to go down to my office and get into the spirit of it by reading it over alone , for it seemed to me that the whole fabric had fallen out of my memory since ten o'clock that morning . Therefore I informed my friends I had some important businesi* itt my office , and added that before I came home I should have to deliver a plea at the court-house . As this building was near the hotel , and I had pointed it out to my brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should step in there about three o'clock or sooner he would have the opportunity of criticising my speech , and perhaps Sophronia and the boys would like to go with him . They were all highly pleased at the idea , and I rather liked it myself ; it would serve as an entertainment for them destitute of any embarrassment and difficulty for me , and would while away the chief portion of the time remaining before their return home . I had noted considerable amusement depicted upon the faces of clerks and waiters at the peculiarities noticeable in the looks and manners of my guests , and had wondered that the feeling was not more repressed , as all belonging to the establishment were in the habit of showing the greatest deference to me and those whom I chose to favor ; but as I then suspected , and afterwards ascertained , it was the general impression that the family were witnesses in this very case . At my office , behind lock and key , I soon worked myself into the spirit of my plea so thoroughly that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everybody else , myself included , except my client and the various characters concerned in his case . My fears in regard to the success of this day 's speech had not been prophetic ones . I went to the court-room as full of my theme and as oblivious of all other matters as if nothing out of the usual course had diverted my mind that morning . I do n't know how I spoke , except by the account of others ; but I know I thought of nothing but making a desperate effort to gain the case for my client , feeling , with all my heart , that right was on his side . I was not even aware , until the plea was finished , that my head was aching terribly . I felt so dizzy and ill when it was over that I dreaded to sit there // and await the delivery of the verdict , espe'cially as the room was oppressively close where I sat , and if I awaited the conclusion I might have to encounter interminable hand-shakes and greetings . So , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , being conscious that I had done as well as I could , and consequently less anxious in regard to the result , I left the platform and slipped quietly out at a side door . When I reached my rooms , I found the boys already there before me , the exhibition having lost its interest for them when uncle Reuben ceased to be the actor . They were playing checkers very happily at the centre-table with my chess-men , jumping knights over castles , and bishops over knights , and so on , in a style quite as amusing to me as to themselves . I threw myself wearily on the sofa and watched the pleasant little fellows , listening to their boyish prattle and bright repartee , while turning over in my mind what could be done for their interests , for they were evidently capable little boys , and not deficient in energy . As the excitement which my recent effort in the courtroom had induced began to subside , my mind recurred to the dilemma in which I was placed by the presence of my visitors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five o'clock . At seven the train left which was to bear away my brother Christopher and his family . Two hours ! I drew a breath of relief , yet almost hated myself for doing it . Just then brother Christopher and Sophronia came in , very happy and beaming . " That was pretty well done , brother , * ' said the former , with a look of pride stealing into his honest , affectionate eyes . " But they could n't make out what had become of you . I should think there were fifty waiting to congratulate you , and asking where you were . " " Oh , " said I , thinking of the result for the first time , " do you know how it came out ? " " Yes , we stayed it through . Nfr . G- got the case by a unanimous verdict . " I went and ordered tea in my room at six , after which I sat conversing with Christopher and Sophronia in regard to the boys , inquiring into their progress at school , their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the door , accompanied by a murmur of voices . It flashed upon my mind in an instant that some friends had probably called to talk over the favorable result of the case with me . The time of trial had come , after all . A cold sweat seemed to break out over me in an instant , and my limbs almost trembled as I stepped to the door . But as I threw it open , and met that brilliant little assembly , full half of them ladies in their rich dinner costumes , got up , too , with especial care for this occasion - did I grow faint ? did I become embarrassed ? Well , I might have done so with scarcely less credit to myself than I could claim for the courm*ge and resolution which nerved me on the instant , and sent the warm , invigorating blood coursing again through my veins , for it was but the courage and animation of sheer despair . I asked them in with punctilious  |p0-liteness  , those lively , well-dressed , sparkling ladies and gentlemen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Patterson ? Every one said you had gone out of town in a hurry , you left so mysteriously . We ye been discussing your whereabouts all dinner-time , and not in the best of humor either , for we had got up something extra in your honor . If you had come past the dining-room just now , instead of round the other way , you d have heard some scolding , on the part of the ladies , at least . " By this time I had ushered in the whole company and closed the door . As soon as it became evident to all that I was not alone , a genteel hush occurred , and then , of course , tongues being tied , eyes were called into extra requisition . There sat my group of Christopher , Sophronia , and the boys , a target for all those keen though polite glances . It touched even my dastard heart , this pleasant , honest , unassuming family , in their simplicity and plainness facing // these gay aspirants to rank and wealth and culture , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ length , I firmly believe , some straggling remnants of true , democratic feeling , and honest , unblushing brotherly allegiance and love . " Gentlemen and ladies , " I said , turning to Christopher and Soplironia with , I think , a trifle more coolness and urbanity than if I had been presenting a princely guest , " allow me to introduce to you my brother , Mr. Patterson , and his wife , and their sons , Willie and Frank , who have come up from Gto-day to make me a little visit . We had an early dinner in my rooms , which accounts for my not dining with you as usual . I left the court-room early on account of a severe headache which the close air seemed to aggravate , and was - not aware , until my brother just informed me , of the favorable verdict . " Apologies were profuse . They were not aware that I had company with me , they would not thus have intruded , etc . Some of the ladies were evidently a little inclined to smile and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mastery . Sophronia talked with perfect freedom and vivacity , not being of a diffident disposition , and displayed her Down-East dialect to good advantage ; but Christopher , who is not much of a society man , did not speak except when addressed ; and if I had not become possessed of a stolid indifference which would have endured almost anything within the region of possibilities , I could scarcely have told which was most embarrassing , Christopher 's statue-like silence or Sophronia 's peculiar eloquence . As for me , I astonished myself . Nothing annoyed me . I cared not in the least what any one thought . The Rubicon was crossed , - not , it is true , by my own courage ; I had been plunged in headlong , and had swum for my life , - but it was crossed , nevertheless , and fear or hesitancy as to my course was over for good . I forgot my headache ; Christopher and Sophronia caused me no more anxiety than if they were some other man 's relatives instead of mine . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if there were nothing out of the ordinary course . The visit was a somewhat constrained one on the part of my guests ; but I did my best to entertain them , and I do n't think they could complain of any lack of cordiality and sociability on my part . They left just in time to be out of the way when the waiters brou0ht in the early tea I had ordered . It was one of the pleasantest meals I had ever known , with Frank and Will sitting , one on either side of me , and Christopher and Sophronia opposite , and I a happier man , it seemed to me , than I had ever been before . The mean and false pride within me which shrank from owning my honest and true-hearted brother , because he lacked brilliant graces and endowments , was , as I hoped , laid forever . I was the personification of jollity . Not a vestige remained of the headache which I had almost regarded as a premonitory s*rmptom of typhoid or brain fever . I kept the boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sophronia looked admiringly on . After tea , when all were arrayed for departure , I took Sophronia on my arm , and , with Christopher and the boys following , walked down the brightly lighted hall , past the open parlors , where the beauty and fashion of the house were assembled , out at the ladies ' entrance and towards the depot , where I waited until the train was off , and I had made a last bow to my friends at the car windows . Before I received the visit I have described , I was but half a democrat compared with what I am to-day . I have also put aside all condescending airs toward my less worldly-prosperous fellows , and , in owning my brother , I have owned them all . Yet when I see , as I do daily , some persons of aristocratic feelings and expression , I can only say : " It is not so much to be wondered at ; he has no brother Christopher . " E. S.
