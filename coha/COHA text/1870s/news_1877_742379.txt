txt Looking over the field , just as the riotous scenes of last week were closing , THE TIMES had occasion to note 0110 Or two instances of imbecile management in the disordered districts . The military , in some eases , proved a broken reed . In other instanees , 1110 immicipal authorities seemed to come lamentably short of the requirements of the occasion . Mayors , Aldermen , Sheriffs , and other civic dignitaries were not certain whether they were dealing with rebels or voters , The Mayor of Cincinnati and the Mayor of Buffalo seemed to us shining examples of municipal weakness . There was something grotesque in the spectacle of the functionary of Cincinnati mounting an ash-barrel , or other convenient eminence , and arguing with the mob , trying to convince them that arson was not on the whole profitable and benefieent . And , if the circumstances had been less tragic , it would have been comic to read the proclamation of the Mayor of Buffalo , issued while the riot was at its height . That official , announcing that " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large number of persons as the laws require , " asked that the citizens conic together " to consider what precautions , if any , should be adopted for the protection of the city . " As if resolutions and preambles were to quell a mob . As if speeches and debates were to save property when a riot was . in progress , and after the Governor had called out the military to suppress domestic violence . As if the strikers were to be dispersed by " precautions , if any , " and be driven away by the voice of Mayor BEcKER and his friends in council . It was preposterously absurd , and Tun Timlis said so without reserve . To our great surprise , Buffalo has managed to make a little tempest over this entirely just criticism . It was apparent that the Mayor who issued this novel proclamation was not willing to take any responsibility . The law had clothed him with certain powers . In conjunction with the Police Commissioners and Common Council , he had ample means for the suppression of disorder . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rioters , who are also voters , he put forth a proclamation mildly annottneing that peace and good order were not maintained as they ought to he ; and would the citizens be good enough to see what ought to be done about it ? The fact that Mayor BEcian is a candidate for renomination seemed to explain this manifest imbecility . We said so , and further remarked that an inclination to cry " Good Lord " or " Good Devil , " as the wind shall seem to blow , was a fair example of the difficulty of getting good work from a municipal officer who was more intent on securing votes than in doing his whole duty . This honest criticism , made , in the interest of good government everywhere , has had the effect of rousing the indignation of a majority of the Buffalo Common Council . That ' body has passed a series of ricketty resolutions to the effect that Mayor BF:clan is a gentleman and a scholar , whom it is a privilege to know , and whose wisdom , courage , forethought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bulwark flung around the City of Buffalo during the lato crisis ; and it was further resolved that " the unfavorable criticism of the conduct of the Mayor of Buffalo , dining the riot , by a New-York newspaper , is not only unworthy the high character and influence it has attained , but was entirely uncalled for and undeserved , " with more to the saute disjointed effect . And ; by way of clincher , it was further resolved that the " aspersions " of THE TIMES " were written or inspired by some resident of Buffalo whose personal animosity toward the Mayor induced hint to resort to this most remarkable method of revenging an imaginary grievance . " Tins truly admirable series of resolutions was adopted by a large vote . Let us hope that the Mayor feels better . The Mayor of Cincinnati is yet to be heard from . Evidently the good Mayor of Buffalo fancies himself a very Considerable person . Ile believes that a metropolitan journal , which must grasp over night the salient features of important news , and promptly make its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have private griefs to avenge on BECKER . What is BEcrun to us that lie should not go on with his little game of politics , and be renominated and re-elected as many times as shall please him ? There was no occasion for anybody in Cincinnati , or anybody in Buffalo to give THE TIMES instruction as to the general idiocy of the Mayors of those two cities . Nobody did anything of the sort . Their imbecility was so open and so flagrant that it would have been a lost opportunity to have passed it over without comment . The Buffalo Mayor called a meeting , and , according to a local account , ran away and left the citizens to decide in their own disorderly way " what precautions , if any , were necessary , " &c.; The meeting resulted in noise , confusion , disorder , and nothing else . It was an attempt to put down a riot with gab . On the whole , the Buffalo Mayor ought to be glad that his insignificant but unique example of weakness was singled out to point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose of the article which has wounded the spirit of the Common Council to show that against the furious lawlessness of a mob we had no municipal vigor and common sense to put in the field . How true this was in many instances , the lament- able events of the past two weeks amply testify . And , as if to emphasize the bitter lesson , the Buffalo Mayor rushes into the sanctuary of the Common Council , and , laying hold of the horns of the altar , cries , " Save me from criticism ! " To us he is only an incident in the melancholy review of the field . To the Common Councilmen he is firm , noble , wise , prudent , courageous , thoughtful , vigorous , and much else besides . And when this tempest in a teapot shall abate , and Buffalo shall subside to its normal calm , may it not be said that we have inadvertently done the Mayor a good turn ? He has his vote of confidence . We have had a fresh illustration of the small amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governed .
