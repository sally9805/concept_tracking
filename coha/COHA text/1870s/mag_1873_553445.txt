Madame George Sand 's Impressions et Souvenirs is a curious medley of her views on the education of children , the condition of France at the present time , the future condition of women , personal reminiscences , etc. , etc . One can not give an adequate idea of the book without copying out the whole of it . It is all written with her wonderful grace , and with the ease which she never loses . She tells us about her manner of working , which deserves to be read ; but perhaps as interesting a chapter as any is one dated in Paris , January , 1841 , in which she gives an account of a conversation between herself and Delacroix about the Stratonice of Ingres . Then , as if to make the scene more complete , Chopin joins them and takes part in the conversation . We translate from it - " Chopin and Delacroix are very , even tenderly , fond of one another . In character they are not unlike , and they have the same great qualities of heart and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while Chopin does not understand Delacroix . He has esteem , affection , and respect for the man , but he detests the // artist . Delacroix , who is broader in his sympathies , appreciates music , he understands it ; his taste is accurate and delicate . He is never tired pf listening to Chopin ; he enjoys it , and he knows much of his music by heart . Chopin accepts his adoration and is touched by it ; but when he looks at one of his friend 's pictures , he suffers and is unable to utter a word . He is a musician and nothing but a musician . His thoughts can be expressed only by music . He has much wit , . tact , and malice , but he understands nothing of pictures or statuary . Michael Angelo frightens him . Rubens horrifies him . Everything that appears eccentric scandalizes him . He limits himself , by a singular anomaly , to the rigidest conventionality . His genius is the most original and individual that exists , but he dislikes to have any one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account of a monologue by Delacroix about shades in painting . " Chopin does not listen any longer , he is at the piano , not noticing that we are listening to him . He is improvising carelessly ; he stops . Well , well , ' cries Delacroix , that is not all ! ' It 's not begun . Nothing occurs to me Nothing but shades , shadows , reliefs , which are all vague . I am trying to fix the color , but I ca n't even make sure of the drawing . ' You wo n't get one without the other , ' said Delacroix , and you 11 find them both . ' But if I only find moonlight ? ' You will have the shade of a shade , ' answered Maurice . " That idea pleases the divine artist . He goes on , without seeming to begin again , so vague and uncertain is his theme . Before our eyes float the soft tints which correspond to the gentle modulations which we hear . " Chopin speaks very seldom , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is with admirable clearness and soundness , which , if generally known , would overthrow many heresies . But even in private life he is reserved , and only pours forth his soul at the piano . Nevertheless he promises us to write a treatise in which he will describe , not only the practice , but also the theory of music " The bell rings , Chopin shivers and stops playing . I tell the servant I am not at home for any one . But , ' said Chopin , you are for him . ' Who can it be ? ' Mickiewiex. ' 0 , yes , to be sure ! But how do you know it is he ? ' I do n't know , but I m sure it is he ; I was thinking about him . ' " It is he in fact . He shakes hands with us all kindly , and soon takes a seat in the corner , begging Chopin to go on . Chopin continues ; he is inspired , he is sublime . But the servant runs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We rush out and find my chamber is on fire ; but we are in time to save it . We put it out at once . Still it keeps us busy for an hour , and afterwards we ask , Where can Mickiewiez be ? ' We call for him , he does not answer ; we return to the parlor , he is not there . Au , there he is in the little corner where we left him . The lamp has gone out , but he did not notice it ; we made a great deal of noise two paces oft but he did not hear anything ; he did not even ask why we had left him alone ; he did not know he had been alone . He had been listening to Chopin , and he was still hearing him . " There are but few passages which are as interesting as this , which makes us wish that this remarkable woman had given us , or might still give us , a fuller account of her singular life . When one considers how many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she has had , one can not help wishing that it might be set down for us to read and draw a moral from . Whatever other merit it would probably lack , it would be certainly interesting . But we suppose it would be as hard for her to write us the plain unvarnished truth as it was for her in her youth to look forward and see what it would be . The minor virtue of accuracy would probably be wanting , but we still should like to read it . // ART . THE Italian Art Congress in closing its annual meeting , held at Parma in 1871 , which had been placed , to parody a formula of the Roman Church , under the patronage of Correggio , determined to hold its next session at Milan , and decreed , beforehand , the honors of the occasion " to that universal genius which was Leonardo da Vinci . " The Italian government interested itself in the proposed meeting , and the Minister of Public Instruction , Signore Cesare Correnti , suggested that the best way to signalize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leonardo 's works . But , greatly as this is to be desired , the task presents so many difficulties that it was deemed not best to attempt it ; and it was finally concluded to publish a volume of selections from that great treasure of the Ambrosian Library , ii Codice Atlantico , a name which it derives from its size , it being the largest single collection of skefches and manuscript notes by Leonardo that exists . Of thirteen volumes , all of the same general character , but of different sizes , which were stolen from the library in 1796 , by the French , or rather , let us say , by Napoleon , and which it was promised by the treaty of i8i5 should be returned , this is the only one that was so returned , and the whereabouts of the others is only to be guessed at , though it is generally admitted that most of them are in Paris . This is the famous volume of which everybody at all interested in literature or science has at least heard , if he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was the study of such extracts from it as had been published from time to time , notably by Venturi , in 1797 , that moved the discreet and learned Hallam to that eulogy on Leonardo which from almost any pen but his would have been set down as extravagant . " These fragments , " says the historian of the literature of Europe , " are , according to our common estimate of the age in which he lived , more like revelations of physical truths vouchsafed to a single mind than the superstructure of its reasoning upon any established basis . . . . If any doubt could be harbored , not as to the right of Leonardo da Vinci to stand as the first name of the fifteenth century , which is beyond all doubt , but as to his originality in so many discoveries , which , probably , no one man , especially in such circumstances , has ever made , it must be by an hypothesis , not very untenable , that some parts of physical science had already attained a height which mere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to publish these selections , the Minister of Public Instruction appointed a commission of seven literary and scientific men , by whose joint labors they should be edited and illustrated with whatever might be necessary to give them completeness . Accordingly , under the modest title of Specimens of the Works of Leonardo da Vinci , - Sag* , io deile Opere di Leonardo c/a Vinci , - the commission has issued , under the editorship of Signor Carlo Belgiojoso , the President of the Academy of Fine Arts in Milan , a random selection of twenty-four drawings from the Codice Atiantico reproduced in fac-simile by photolithography . The portion of the volume containing the text is a sumptuous specimen of printing in the grand Italian manner , - " a river of text in a meadow of margin , " - large type , black ink , and white strong paper such as we knew in the days before tinted-and-satin-smooth paper was the tasteless , effeminate mode . As for the plates , we are- sorry to be obliged to say that they do no credit to Signor Angelo della @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chosen by the commission for this work as the best that Italy can produce . Italy is far behind Germany , France , and England in book illustrations , and especially in illustrations that depend upon the new processes of reproduction , and photolithography in particular . We wish these sketches could have been submitted to the process of Heliotypy ; we are sure that a far better result might have been looked for . We must say a word as to the text of the present publication . It will be found of noticeable value and interest , and it is a pity it could not be put into a more convenient and accessible form . Leonardo 's genius is exciting more and more interest , and yet the material for the study of him is scanty , the essays in the present volume being by far the most important contribution that has been made to our // qwq // Art . up four cords attached to the strings of - the fore crossbows . As the opening in the circuil-iference of the wheel opposite each bow comes in line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the axle , slips an arrow into the bow , releases the cord , and repeats this operation as each bow comes up in turn with the revolutions of the wheel . The men who tread the wheel are protected from the enemy 's fire by a tilting screen of wood , which receives all missiles at such an angle as to break their force . No doubt this machine will look impracticable enough to the eye of a practised engineer , but to the layman it is ingeniously murderous , and whether good for anything or not , it is drawn in a very interesting way . The youngster in the middle , who is the most active agent in the mischief , is a handsome child of the type of the early Florentine painters , and it is worth noticing that he appears in embryo plainly enough in the rude first sketch . These balistas evidently occupied Leonardo 's thoughts very seriously for a time , and it would seem as if he did not recognize the fact that in his age their occupation was already gone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrown the medieval engines of war , balistas , battering-rams , scaling-ladders , and the rest , into the second rank as means of defence , and the city-walls themselves were tumbling down before the rams ' horns filled with powder . Even Diirer , who , in some respects , seems the parody of Leonardo in the versatility of his powers and in the way in which he sometimes trifled with them , and who was only nineteen years younger than his great contemporary , wasted no time , in his 1 ) 00k on Fortification , over balistas and crossbows , though perhaps it will be thought a proof of as little sagacity that he gave so much study to the planning of equally useless walls and bastions . But Diirer believed in cannon , as not only his book shows , but his etching on iron called The Great Cannon , made in 1515 . So far as we know , all Leonardo 's speculations on the conduct of war were purely medieval ; they did nothing to advance the revolution brought on by the invention of gunpowder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comical , device for pushing the ladders of a besieging party from off the walls of a town . It is not actually impracticable , but looks easier on the paper than we suspect it would be found in execution . Here Leonardo is trying his hand at solving a prob November , lem that had puzzled a good many ingenious heads in the Middle Ages as well as in his own time . Viollet-le-Duc says , " The books of the Middle Ages on the military art are filled with models of engines of war , and particularly with various inventions for ladders , which it would be impossible to make of practical use " ; and perhaps the best thing to be said of this particular drawing of Leonardo 's is , that it is an impossible device for knocking down an impossible ladder . If we find these war-engines extremely interesting and ingenious in the Album of Villard de Honnecourt , particularly when his rude sketches are interpreted and put into an orderly form by Viollet - le - Duc , it must be because they seem more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rude a time ; and it is because Leonardo 's general cleverness would justify us in looking for something more in accord with the growing science of his time that we study his designs for war-engines with some impatience . Leonardo is to be praised , however , for this , that , as a rule , his mechanic inventions and studies - at least such of them as we seem this book - are directed to the immediate needs of his country and his time . Here are clear , , decisive drawings for machines to cut files , to shear the nap of cloth , to saw marble , to twist silk ; and here must be one of the first lamps , properly so called , that was ever devised . It has a very modern look , and might easily be taken for a carcel lamp . Of its internal machinery , if it be supposed to have any , we do not read anything in Leonardo 's description , and it may be merely a wick set in a cup of oil ; but what makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surrounding the wick is filled with water , - a simple expedient for increasing the light . Singularly enough , this device has just been introduced into our cities , where it is employed with an ingenious modification to light shop-windows where goods are displayed . A hemispherical bowl of glass is filled with water , and the gas-jet being arranged over it horizontally , a diffused but brilliant light is thrown over the goods below . Doubtless , Leonardo suffered , as a student , for the want of a brilliant and equable light at night . Italy has had to wait all these centuries for the American petroleum , which she . doubtless thinks the best result of her great son 's discovery , to give her the much-desired comfort . Excellent // Music . candles are made in Italy , none better anywhere ; but they are only for the rich , and , picturesque as the brass lamps are , they give a miserable light . The delight of the Italians , especially of the poorer sort in the petroleum oil , which makes their rooms more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few years ago , is expressed with childish profusion and volubility ; and the very look of the placards that offer " Petrolio d ' America " for sale is a sort of mute " Hurrah . " Here , then , we see Leonardo trying , like a Renaissance Franklin , to supply practical needs in practical ways . Quite as . impracticable looking , on the other hand , as Franklin 's experiments with electricity must have seemed in the beginning , are these sheets from Leonardo 's sketch-book filled with schemes for flying-machines , one page being taken up with a careful study of the means of utilizing for his purpose the structure of the wing of a bird . We have said enough , we think , to indicate to our readers the general character of these notes and sketches by Leonardo . They are the speculations and studies of an ingenious mind curious about many things , and with a superfluous activity that sought satisfaction in a hundred channels . Work was Leonardo 's play , and he found rest for 633 his mind in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his in unwearied and unceasing labor of the hands . But , while we welcome even this partial publication of that great collection of his studies which has been the subject of such enthusiastic praise , not only from men of the eminence of Henry Hallam and Sir William Hunter , but from . all the students of art and science who have made even a superficial acquaintance with it , we submit whether the time has not come , seeing the means we have at our disposal , to publish the whole of the Codex Atlanficus at least , and of whatever other collections can be discovered of Leonardo 's sketches , in order that we may know exactly what services he has rendered to mankind in the way of original investigation . Did he really render any such services , or was he only a busy and ingenious speculator , with little true mechanic genius , and with little capacity for scientific investigation ; - a poet , before all , playing with science as Bacon and Goethe and Oken played with it , catching glimpses of scientific truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , if one should dare to say it , in pursuing will-o ' - the- wisps , that might have made the world richer with miracles to mate with the Gioconda and the John Baptist . MUSIC . AS the " season " gradually draws near , and the various music-purveyors begin to show forth their respective bills of fare , a naturally hopeful disposition and instinctive trust in the better side of human nature for the moment triumph over the less reassuring teaching of experience that impressarios ' promises are not always to be implicitly trusted , and that an exhaustive bill of fare does not always mean a good dinner . But really the list of " attractions " is more than usually striking . Well-known names of great singers stand forth in goodly quantity in the advertisements . Nilsson-Rouzaud , Lucca , Ilma de Murska , Tamberlik , Campanini , our own Miss Kellogg , who , it seems , is to appear this time in English Opera , and Miss Annie Gary , who will be associated with Madame Nilsson-Rouzaud , go to make up a most inspiring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money so much worldwide celebrity must cost the adventurous managers suggests a fear that this list of stars will necessitate a meagreness of support of which the two past seasons have been but a foretaste . When shall we have an opera company in America r*ally worthy of the name ? Some hint at an answer may be found in a rather flourishing announcement a few weeks ago in the New York papers , of a grand operatic project of Mr. Theodore Thomas , showing that all his work for the last six years has been tending towards the founding of a permanent opera in New York , in which the orchestra , chorus , and all the accessories shall be upon the same footing as in the // principal opera-houses in Europe . From what we know of Mr. Thomas 's musical convictions , we suppose that the production of Richard Wagner 's musical dramas is one of his prime objects . But no doubt we may also expect operas by Gluck , v. Weber , Mozart , Beethoven s Fidelic , and perhaps the German versions of the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cherubini . Mr. Thomas 's well-known scrupulousness in perfecting every smallest detail in the performance of the orchestral works that he and his orchestra have brought before the public during the last six years , as far as the means at his command would allow , implies some solid foundation for the glowing promises of " perfection " held forth by the papers . However much many people may differ from Mr. Thomas 's musical views , there can be no doubt that he is a man to persist in doing everything he undertakes as perfectly as possible , cost what it may of toil and vexation ; and the reputation he has earned for himself in his past labors would seem to be no feeble guaranty of success in this more daring venture . Even a partial success of his undertaking would be more valuable to the artistic culture of the country than any musical enterprise that we can conceive of . An established opera is the point at which are concentrated the musical executive forces of a community . The opera is the only institution that can afford to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same time . The poor quality of much of the music almost unavoidably performed at the principal opera-houses all over the world has tended towards giving the opera a worse name than it deserves , yet in almost every capital in the world the opera is the standard of executive excellence . Such exceptions as the orchestra of the Conservatoire at Paris , and some of the orchestras in London ( where the opera exists under quite peculiar circumstances ) , do not in the least go to disprove the rule . We take it as a matter of course that Mr. Thomas 's enterprise is to be exclusively directed towards the production of German operas , with the possible exception of such French and Italian works as we have named above . And we must confess that , after hearing the Italian operas of the **26;384;TOOLONG school performed at the principal opera-houses in Germany , we should not be at all sorry to see them left out of the list . The Germans have certainly not as a rule the faculty of satisfactorily performing these works . But in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great work , we must look to Messrs . Strakosch , Maretzek , and Co. , for our operatic entertainments , and be thankful for what is good , and try not to grumble overmuch at what is bad . And let no one suppose that we undervalue the privilege of hearing the great artists whom their opera troops bring to us , and whom we should in all probability never have heard except through their agency . Many of us must surely count some of the highest musical moments of our lives among the hours we have spent tt our opera-houses . It may go to our hearts to see the manner in which great masterworks are cut and slashed and ignominiously rehashed to bring them within the executive scope of some of our companies ; to see feminine youth and beauty fall a victim to the fascinations of some roving young blade of sixty , of whose seductive voice there only remain a few wintry notes ; or to see the passionate attempts made by some unhappy maiden to restrain the impetuosity of an aspiring hero whose highest endeavor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's bdton and not to lose his place . There is some consolation in thinking of what old Caffarelli said to the young singer who expressed some trepidation at singing the part of Berenice to his Antigono " You will make fiasco ; that is of little consequence to us . I shall so sing as to make the audience forget that the part of Berenice exists . " This is a bad artistic principle to be sure ; but Where the secondary , and alas ! sometimes certain of the leading parts are as poorly filled as they often are with us , let us be grateful that there are artists who can , if only for a moment , make us forget that they exist . The list of operas promised us contains some interesting novelties . Of these Richard Wagner 's Flying Dutchman and Lahengrin will probably excite the most curiosity , if nothing more . Concerning these two operas , and for the benefit of those people to whom Wagner is only known as a theorist , the following passage from a letter of the composer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The first three of these poems , The Flyin6 Dutchman , Tannhduser , and Lahengrin , had already been written , composed , and also , with the exception of Lohengrin , produced upon the stage , before the drawing up of my theoret // ical writings . In them . . . . I could show you the process of development of my artistic productiveness up to the point where I found myself prompted to account to myself theoretically for my proceedings . I only mention this to call your attention to what a great mistake people make when they imagine that these three works are to be explained by my having composed them with a conscious purpose , according to abstract rules formed by myself . Let me much rather say that even my most daring conclusions concerning the feasible dramatico-musical form forced themselves upon me through this , that I carried in my head at the same time the plan of my great Nibelungen drama , of which I had already written a part , and was developing it in such fashion that my theory was hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process that was developing itself in me . My real system , if you would call it by that name , thus finds in those first three poems as yet only a very limited application . " Rossini 's Ole/la is an opera which , we believe , has not yet been produced in Boston . The beautiful swan-song , Assisa in Ji ? dun sal/ce , is , however , quite familiar to most of us . Mozart 's Magic Flute , an opera which ranks only second to the mighty Don Giovanni , will be welcome to us all . It is in fact the greatest of his German operas , and has been most shamefully neglected in this country . That the part of the Queen of the Night has been one of Madame Nilsson-Rouzaud 's most brilliant successes will perhaps act as an inducement to those Verdified and sensationloving beings to whom Mozart sounds " tame and antiquated , " to go and hear the opera . Verdi 's Aida , written by order of the Kh ? dive of Egypt , will be at least a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this opera , some saying that in it the composer has outdone all his previous efforts , others that in attempting to elaborate his ideas in the modern French style , and to give something to the world that should show him to be not behind the spirit of the age , he has so overladen his ideas with elaborate writing , that the ideas themselves , none of the best at the outset , have literally gone to pieces . The only number of the opera - a tenor song , Celeste Ak/a - that we have yet seen points rather to this latter supposition than to the former . Upon the whole , unless Messrs . Strakosch and Maretzek fail to perform a very large percentage of their promises , the " season " looks rather hopeful than otherwise . The Triennial Festival of the Handel and Haydn Society comes this year . Let us hope , for the honor of Boston that Mr. Paine 's " St. Peter " will find a prominent place among the good things performed . May we not also hope for a complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so many years ' coquetting with this colossal composition , such a hope may not be deemed unreasonable . The symphony concerts of the Harvard Musical Association we have always with us , and we may no doubt expect a visit from Mr. Theodore Thomas 's orchestra , perhaps the last one . - In recently published sheet.music , * we notice a quite graceful , though perhaps rather drawing-roomy transcription by Sidney Smith of the fascinating Nocturne in Mendelssohn 's " MidsummerNight 's Dream** music . Louis Meyer of Philadelphia is also publishing , under the style of Album dArtiste , a collection of excellent salon pieces by the best modern piano-forte writers . The edition is exceedingly well got up and the engraving of the very best . A set of eight short pieces called " Arabesques , " by Isidor Seiss , are also worthy of sincere commendation . In songs we notice Lost , by Virginia Gabriel , as better than most songs of its class , and So the Children say , by Berthold Tours , as quite fascinating , graceful , and singable .
