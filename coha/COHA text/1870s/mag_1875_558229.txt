THE VIRGINIA CAMPAIGN OF JOHN BROWN . V. BEFORE THE OUTBREAK . THE early summer of 1858 found Biown in Kansas instead of Virginia , where he had wished and hoped to be . On the 28th of June in that year , he wrote me from Lawrence a short letter , addressed to " F. B. Sanborn and Dear Friends at Boston , Worcester , and - , " and containing this passage : " I reached Kansas with friends , on the 26th inst. ; came here last night , and leave here today for the neighborhood of late troubles . It seems the troubles are not over yet .... I do hope you will be in earnest now to carry out , as soon as possible , the measure proposed in Mr. Sanborn 's letter inviting me to Boston this last spring . " ( This was the raising of money for a campaign in Vir* , inia in 1859 , after the Kansas fighting had ended . ) " I hope there will be no delay of that matter . Can you send me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , half a dozen or a full dozen whistles , such as I described , at once ? " These whistles were for use in making signals among his men when in night attacks , or amid woody or mountainous regions in the day-time , and he had both spoken and written to me about them before . They were to be " such as are used by boatswains on ships of war ; " and Brown thought them of great service . " Every ten men ought to have one at least . " He had also requested me to procure for him " some little articles as marks of distinction , " - badges , medals , or the like ,  --  to be given to his men in token of good conduct . Happening to be at Dr. Howe 's house in South Boston one day in the spring of 1858 , the doctor ( who was a chex her of the Greek Legion of Honor , for services rendered in the Greek revolution of 1820-27 ) had shown me his cross of Malta and other decorations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these seemed to me exactly what Brown would want . I therefore made rude sketches of them and showed these to Brown , who selected the Maltese cross and one or two other designs , as suitable for his badges , but I doubt if they were ever used for that purpose . In forwarding this letter to Colonel Higginson at Worcester , I wrote as follows , on the 6th of July , 1858 : " In accordance with the decision of two meetings in Boston , late in May and early in June , at which all our associates were present except yourself , our shepherd of the people went to K**n*as with a few companions , to look after matters in Linn County . The arrangement of the winter still holds good , and is to be put in action next spring , with God 's help . " how well Brown looked after Kansas matters will be seen by the following letter , a very long one for the old soldier to write , which has never before been printed : - MIssouEI LINE , ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ F. B. SANBORN , ESQ. , AND FRIENDS AT BOSTON AND WORCESTER : I am here with about ten of my men , located on the same quarter section where the terrible murders of the 19th May were committed , called the hamilton or Trading Post murders . Deserted farms and dwellings lie in all directions for some miles along the line , and the remaining inhabitants watch every appearance of persons moving about , with anxious jealousy and vigilance . Four of the persons wounded or attacked on that occasion are staying with me . The blacksmith Snyder , who fought the murder ers , with his brother and son , are of the number . Old Mr. Hargrove , who was terribly wounded at the same time , is another . The blacksmith returned here with me , and intends to bring back his family on to his claim , within two or three days . A constant fear of new // troubles seems to prevail on both sides the line , and on both sides are companies of armed men . Any little affair may open the quarrel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of late . I have also a man with me who fled from his family and farm in Missouri but a day or two since , his life being threatened on account of being accused of informing Kansas men of the whereabouts of one of the murderers , who was lately taken and brought to this side . I have concealed the fact of my presence , pretty much , lest it should tend to create excitement ; but it is getting leaked out , and will soon be known to all . As I am not here to seek or secure revenge , I do not mean to be the first to reopen the quarrel . How soon it may be raised against me I can not say , nor am I overanxious . A portion of my men are in other neighborhoods . We shall soon be in great want of a small amount in a draft or drafts on New York , to feed us . We can not work for wages , and provisions are not easily obtained on the frontier . I can not refrain from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrible affair before alluded to , in an account found in the New York Tribune of May 3 1st , dated at Westport , May 21st . The writer says : " From one of the prisoners it was ascertained that a number of persons were stationed at Snyder 's , a short distance from the post , a house built in the gorge of two mounds , and flanked by rock walls , a fit place for robbers and murderers . " At a spring in a rocky ravine stands a very small open blacksmith 's shop , made of thin slabs from a saw-mill . This is the only building that has ever been known to stand there , and in that article is called a " fortification . " It is to-day just as it was the 19th May , - a little pent-up 1 The allusion here is probably to Brown 's contract with charles Blair of collineville , Connecticut , the hlacksmith who was to make the thousand pikes which were afterwards captured in Maryland . Brown had engaged them in 1857 , and had paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars which the pikes were to cost when finished . In 1858 Brown had not heen able for lack of money , to complete the payment , and was afraid his contract would be forfeited and the money May , shop , containing Snyder 's tools ( what have not been carried off ) , all covered with rust , - and had never been thought of as a " fortification " before the poor man attempted in it his own and his brother 's and son 's defense . I give this as an illustration of the truthfulness of that whole account . It should be left to stand while it may last , and should be known hereafter as Fort Snyder . I may continue here for some time . Mr. Russell and other friends at New Haven assured me before I left that , if the Lecompton abomination should pass through Conuress , something could be done there to relieve me from a difficulty I am in , and which they understand . Will not some of my Boston friends " stir up their minds " in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You may use this as you think best . Please let friends in New York and at North Elba 2 hear from me . I am not very stout , have much to think of and to do , and have but little time or chance for writing . The weather of late has been very hot . I will write you all when I can . I believe all honest , sensible Free State men in Kansas consider George Washington Brown 's Herald of Freedom one of the most mischievous , traitorous publications in the whole country . July 23d . Since the previous date , another Free State Missourian has been over to see us , who reports great excitement on the other side of the line , and that the house of Mr. Bishop ( the man who fled to us ) was beset during the night after he left ; but , on finding he was not there , they left . Yesterday a pro-slavery man from West Point ( Missouri ) came over , professing that he wanted to buy Bishop 's farm . I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the other side . At present , along this part already paid would he lost . He therefore communicated ( as I suppose ) the facts in the case to Mr. Russell , who was then the head of a military school at New Haven and had some assurance from him of money to he raised in Connecticut to meet this Connecticut contract . But I do not remember that anything was done concerning the pikes until 1859 , when Brown paid for them with money contributed in Boston . // of the line the Free State men may be said in some sense to " possess the field , " but we deem it wise to " be on the alert . " Whether Missouri people are more excited through fear than otherwise I am not yet prepared to judge . The blacksmith ( Snyder ) has got his family back ; also some others have returned , and a few new settlers are coming in . Those who fled or were driven off will pretty much lose the season . Since we came here , about twenty-five to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearer to the line , I believe . August 6th . Have been down with the ague since last date , and had no safe way of gettin* off my letter . I had lain every night without shelter , sufferin0 from cold rains and heavy dews , together with the oppressive beat of the days . A few days since , Governor Denver 's officer then in command bravely moved his men on to the line , and on to the next adjoinin0 claim with us . Several of them immediately sought opportunity to tender their service to inc secretly . I , however , advised them to remain where they were . Soon after I came on to the line , my right name was reported , but the majority did not credit the report . I am getting better . You will know the true result of the election of the 2d inst. much sooner than I shall , probably . I am in no place for correct general information . May God bless you all . Your friend , JOHN BROWN . Inclose in envelope directed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside directed to S. Morgan . Some of the incidents and allusions in the above letter need to be further explained . The " Hamilton murders " are better known in border story as the Marais des Cygnes Massacre , - a tragedy which Whittier has celebrated in verse . Near the river named by the old French royogeurs of Louisiana " The Swan 's Marsh " ( Marais des Oggnes or du Oygne ) , in Southern Kansas , was a little settlement of Northern farmers . As they were planting their fields and fencing them , in May , 1858 , an unpro 593 yoked assault was made on them by a party from Missouri , under the lead of three brothers named Hamilton , from Georgia ; five farmers were killed and five wounded . The murderers were not Missourians , but men from farther South , who had been in Kansas but were driven out in some of the contests of 1856-57 . They marched over in an armed band from Missouri , gathered up their victims from the prairie farms and the lonely roads , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line , and shot them down by a platoon discharge . Then the invaders gave out word that they meant to shoot all the Free State settlers in Linn County in the same way . The farmers mustered for defense , in a band of two hundred , near the Missouri line , and detailed a company of mounted men to stand guard , or to ride up an ( l down the line , and keep watch of the Hamiltons and their band . When Brown reached the spot a month later , lie put his own men on guard , and the settlers went back to their work . The Governor of Kansas , Denver , also sent armed men , perhaps United States troops , to keep the peace , and it is to these that Brown alludes as having offered to serve under him . Brown went to the spot where the massacre took place , assuming the name of " Captain Morgan " for the occasion , fortified himself , and gave out that he was there to fight or be peaceable as the other side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a neighbor or as bad as they pleased . " Gradually his secret caine out , and the terror of his name frightened the enemy away ; the Hamiltons left the neighborhood , and the troubles there ceased . But Brown himself fell sick and was obliged to take shelter for a few weeks with his friend Wattles , at Moneka . I wrote to him early in July a letter which reached him there , and to which he replied as follows : - OsAwAToRmE , KANsAs , 10th September , 1858. 3 DEAR FRIEND , AND OTHER FRIENDS , - Your kind and very welcome letter of the 11th July was received a long The Virginia campaign of John Brown . // time since , but I was sick at the time , and have been ever since until now ; so that I did not even answer the letters of my own family , or any one else , before yesterday , when I began to try . I am very weak yet , but gaining well . All seems quiet now . I - have been down about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , if you have not already sent forward those little articles , ' do not do it . Before I was taken sick there seemed to be every prospect of some business very soon ; and there is some now that requires doing ; but , under all the circumstances , I think not best to send them . I have heard nothing direct from Forbes for months , but expect to when I get to Lawrence . I have but fourteen regularly employed hands , the most of whom are now at common work , and some are sick . Much sickness pi'evails . How we travel may not be best to write . I have often met the " notorious " Montgomery , 2 and think very favorably of him . It now looks as though but little business can be accomplished until we get our mill in operation . I am most anxious about that , and want you to name the earliest date possible , as near as you can learn , when you can have your matters gathered up . Do let me hear from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so that I may have some idea how to arrange my business . Dear friends , do be in earnest ; the harvest we shall reap , if we are only up and doing . 13th September , 1858 . Yours of the 25th August , containing draft of Mr. S. for fifty dollars is received . I am most grateful for it , and to you for your kind letter . This would have been sooner mailed but for want of stamps and envelopes . I am gaining slowly , but hope to be on my legs soon . Have no further news . Mailed , September 15th . Still weak . Your friend . The money which I sent to Brown , as above acknowledged , was probably contributed by Gerrit Smith , who , first 1 The boatswain 's whistles . 2 This was James Montgomery , one of the bravest and last , gave Brown or sent him about one thousand dollars . Most of the smaller sums which Brown received during the years 1858-59 , I suppose , passed through my hands , while the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or other contributors . Most of the correspondence on this Virginia business also went through my hands ; it beinn Brown 's custom to write one letter to be read by the half-dozen persons with whom he desired to communicate ; and this letter generally ( by no means always ) coming to me in the first instance . My custom was to show it to Mr. Parker and l ) r . Howe , when they were at home , then to send it to Mr. Stearns , who sometimes forwarded it to Colonel Higginson or some more distant correspondent , and sometimes returned it to me . It appears that both the letters just quoted came back to me in October , 1858 , and were by me forwarded to Higginson on the 13th of that month , with this comment : - " I received the inclosed letter from our friend a week or two since . You see he is anxious about future operations . Can you do anything for him before next March , and if so , what ? The partners in Boston have talked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any definite proposal . I send you also an older letter , which should have been sent to you , but , by some fault of others , was not . " Colonel Iligginson expressed the hope that the enterprise would not be deferred longer than the spring of 1859 , and made some contribution to the fund , as also did Mr. Parker and the other members of the secret committee . No active movement to raise money was undertaken , however , until the winter and spring of 1859 . On the 19th of January , 1859 , three weeks after Brown 's incursion into Missouri , where he freed a dozen slaves , I wrote thus to Colonel IIi ( nYinson : " I have had no private advices from J. B. since I wrote you . He has begun the work in earnest , I fancy , and will find enough to do where partisans on the Kansas border , and during the civil war colonel of a black regiment in South Carolina . 594 May , // he is for the present . I earnestly hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States or Missouri . If he does not , I think we may look for treat results from this spark of fire . If Forbes is a traitor , he will now show his hand , and we can pin.him in some way . " On the 4th of March I wrote again : " Brown was at Tabor ( Iowa ) on the 10th February , with his stock in fine condition , as he says in a letter to G. Smith . He also says he is ready with some new men to set his mill in operation , and seems to be coming East for that purpose . Mr. proposes to raise one thousand dollars for him , and to contribute one hundred dollars himself . I think a larger sum ought to be raised , but can we raise so much as this ? Brown says he thinks any one of us who talked with him might raise the sum if we should set about it ; perhaps this is so , but I doubt . As a reward for what he has done , perhaps money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he means to do the work , and I expect to hear of him in New York within a few weeks . Dr. Howe thinks J. F. and some others , not of our party , would help the project if they knew of it " Following up this last suggestion , I sounded several antislavery men of wealth and influence in the spring of 1859 , and did obtain some subscriptions from persons who were willing to give to a brave man forcibly interfering with slavery , without inquiring very closely what he would do next . But on the other hand I found that Brown 's manly action in Missouri had made some of our friends more shy of him . A strikino ' example of this change of feeling has been furnished me by an old abolitionist of Western Iowa , who vouches for the anecdote . Early in February , 1859 , Brown was at Tabor , as he had often been before , but this time with a party of Missouri fugitive slaves . Now althou0h the little village had got the name of being a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fugitives had been openly brought there , and none under such appalling circumstances . These slaves had actually been taken from their innsters ' houses , and one of the slave-holders , while aiming his revolver at one of the liberators , was himself shot down . After many skirmishes and narrow escapes , Brown had reached Tabor with his party , expecting friends and aid there ; but great was his surprise to find himself disowned by the very men who had aided him before . A slave-holder from Missouri happened to be visiting in the village , and it was judged best to satisfy him that Tabor was not the home of abolitionists . A public meeting was called for Monday morning , , and announced in the churches of that whole region on the Sunday preceding . The people flocked in , and the slave-holder was there as well as John Brown and his true men ; amon , , them his lieutenant , John Henry Kagi , who was killed at Harper 's Ferry . The meeting was addressed by one Deacon C , who had hitherto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now called on his neighbors and fellow-Christians to declare that the forcible rescue of slaves was robbery and might lead to murder , and that the citizens of Tabor " had ho sympathy with John Brown in his late acts . " When the deacon had offered his resolution and made his speech , the opposite opinion was advocated by James Vincent , a minister , who had been an active abolitionist in England and America , and who had supposed the meeting called to devise means for aiding the fugitives . Mr. Vincent asked , " Have we not all , citizens of Tabor , aided John Brown before ? has he not counseled with us and we with him , and has he not been sent on his way with our money and our prayers ? Suppose our brother , Deacon C- , were traveliiig in Missouri with his covered wagon , and his own brother , a slave , should ask to be carried into Iowa , to escape being sold away from his family ; who believes that our neighbor would turn from his own brother and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he would not aid a slave to escape in Missouri , not even his own brother . Mr. Vincent then offered an ironical resolution , drawn 1875. 595 // up by Kagi , to this effect : " Whereas , John Brown and his associates have been guilty of robbery and murder in the State of Missouri , Resolved , That we , the citizens of Tabor , repudiate his conduct and theirs , and will hereupon take them into custody and hold them to await the action of the Missouri authorities . " The meeting evaded this caustic test of its sincerity , but went on denouncing Brown and his acts . In the midst of these natural but disgraceful proceedings , John Brown arose , speechless with astonishment and grief , and went his way from the meeting and from the town , to which he never returned . In the whole assembly there were but four persons who were willin5 , to stand by their old friend , and to have it known that they had helped him . " I often think , " writes one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw him in that last sad meeting . He listened to these bitter reproaches of old-time friends in silence , and offered no reply . As he left the house he put me in mind of the Saviour , his whole bearing was so lofty , so dignified , so full of meekness ; yet his countenance indicated a tremendous conflict within . The thought of that scene fills my heart anew with anguish , yet gratitude that , by the help of God , I was enabled to withstand the tide that had set in against him . " Similar experiences , though less painful and less dramatic in their incidents , awaited Brown in other places . When he reached Boston in May , he was invited to dine one Saturday at the Bird Club , and there for the first time met Senatoi* Wilson , now Vice-President of the United States , who has thus described the interview : " The last of May , 1859 , 1 met John Brown at the Parker House in Boston . There were a dozen persons present ; Brown came in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of gentlemen who were there . I was introduced to him , and he , I think , did not recollect my name . I stepped aside . In a moment , after speaking to somebody else , he came up again , and said to me that he did not understand 1 The late Major Stearns , of Medford. my name when it was mentioned . He then said , in a very calm but firm tone , I understand you do not approve of my course ; ' referring , as I supposed , to his going into Missouri and getting slaves , and running them off . It was said with a great deal of firmness of manner , and it was the first salutation after speaking to me . I said I did not ; I believed it to be a very great injury to the antislavery cause ; that I regarded every illegal act , and every imprudent act , as being against it . I said that , if this action had been a year or two before , it might have been followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excited people on the border , an ( l a great many lives might have been lost , lie said he thought differently , believed he had acted right , and that it would have a good influence . " If Brown had known Senator Wilson as well as he did that Kansas friend who reproved him for the same cause , he would perhaps have gone further , and given the senator the same answer : 2 * Brown called in to see me , in going out of Kansas in 1859 , and I censured him for going into Missouri and getting those slaves , lie said , I considered the matter well ; you will have no more attacks from Missouri . I shall now leave Kansas ; probably you will never see me again . I consider it my duty to draw the scene of the excitement to some other part of the country . ' " In this aim he certainly succeeded . Even Dr. Howe , who had been concerned in the Greek revolution , the French revolution of July , 1830 , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return from Cuba in the spring of 1859 , to find that Brown had actually been taking the property of slave-holders with which to give their escaping slaves an outfit , and for a time withdrew his support from the veteran , who chafed greatly at this unexpected rebuff . I have an impression that Dr. Howe , on his way home from Cuba ( whither he accompanied Theodore Parker in February , 1859 ) , had journeyed through the Carolinas , and had there accepted the splendid hospitality of the Testimony before Senator Mason 's committee . 596 May , // rich planters ; and that it shocked him to think he might have been instrumental in giving up to fire and pillage the noble mansions where he had been entertained . If so , it was a generous reluctance which held him back from heartily entering again into John Brown 's plans ; nor did he after 1858 50 completely support them as , althou1 , h he never withdrew from the secret committee , and continued to give money to the enterprise . Parker never returned to Boston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He contributed nothing after 1858 , nor did Higginson give so much , or interest himself so warmly in the enterprise after its first postponement . All this would have made it more difficult , during 1859 , to raise the money which Brown needed , had it not been for the munificence of Mr. Stearns , who , at each emergency , came forward with his indispensable gifts . After placing about twelve hundred dollars in Brown 's hands in the spring and summer of 1859 , he still continued to aid him in one way and another , until almost the day of the outbreak , which was delayed by the slowness of Brown 's own movements during the spring and summer of 1859.1 Up to this time the enterprise of Brown , aiming at the very heart of slav 1 * find this in one of my letters , dated " concord , June 4 , 1859 : " " Brown has set out on his expedition , having got some eight hundred dollars from all sources except from Mr. Stearns , and from him the balance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who , having put his hand to the plow , turneth not hack .

He could not say where he should be for a few weeks hut letters are addressed to him , under cover to his son John , Jr. , at West Andover , Ohio . This point is not far from where Brown will begin , and his son will communicate with him . Two of his sons will go with him . lie is desirous of getting some one to go to canada and collect recruits for him among the fugitives , - with harriet Tubman or alone , as the case may be . " This letter shows I had then no thought that the attack would be made at Harper 's Ferry , nor had Mr. Stearns , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or writing about this matter every few days . I have no doubt he knew as much as I did about the general plan . On the 18th of August , Brown sent me word from Chain-597 ery , and destined to be successful by its rebound , even when failing signally in its immediate effect , had wholly escaped public notice . The disclosures of Forbes , such as they were , left no permanent impression on the mind of any person not previously acquainted with the plot . In the summer of 1859 , less than two months before Harper 's Ferry was captured , a second and more direct disclosure was made , in a letter written from Cincinnati to the Secretary of War at Washington . This official was then a Virginian , John B. Floyd , after wards in high command in the Confederate army ; but although the information sent to him was in the main very exact , and though one would have supposed a Virginian specially sensitive to such intelligence , it does not appear that General Floyd , , ave the matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quoted below while at a Virginian watering-place , but probably did not read it twice , although he laid it away at first as a paper of some moment . It has never been ascertained who wrote the letter , but it has been ascribed to a young man then connected with one of the Cincinnati newspapers . This person had become acquainted with a Hungarian refugee , formerly in the suite of Kossuth , then living in Kansas under the name of Leonhard or Lenhart. bersburg that be was again delayed for want of money , and must have three hundred dollars which I undertook to raise for him . On the 4th of September I had sent him two hundred dollars , of which Dr. howe gave fifty ; on the 14th of September I had all but thirty-five dollars of the remaining hundred , Colonel Higginson having sent me twenty dollars . I think the balance was paid by Mr. Stearns , who on the 8th of September had written thus to one of the secret committee : " By reading Mr. Sanborn 's note to me a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been sent to you with his note . Please read it and inclose again to him . I hope you will be able to get the fifty dollars . We have done all we could and fall short another fifty as yet . " The " inclosed " here was an urgent appeal from lDhambersburg for money . On the 6th of October - ten days before the attack was made - I wrote to Iligginson , " The three hundred dollars desired has been made up and received . Four or five men will be on the ground uext week , from these regions and * These facts were all known to Mr. Stearns , who within a fortnight of the outbreak was in consultation with Mr. Lewis Hayden , and other colored men of Boston , about forwarding recruits to Brown . I think he paid some of the expenses of recruits , but am not certain . The Virginia Campaign of John Brown . // The Hungarian had fought in Kansas on the side of the North , possibly under Brown himself , and had learned in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is believed he communicated in an unguarded moment to the Cincinnati reporter , who could not contain the secret , but sat down at once ( it is said ) , and wrote thus to the Secretary of War : CINcINNATI , August 20 , 1859 . SIR , - I have lately received information of a movement of so great importance that I feel it to be my duty to impart it to you without delay . I have discovered the existence of a secret association , havin for its object the liberation of the slaves at the South by a general insurrection . The leader of the movement is Old John Brown , late of Kansas . He has been in Canada during the winter , drilling the negroes there , and they are only waitin* , his word to start for the South to assist the slaves . They have one of their leading men , a white ftman , in an armory in Maryland ; where it is situated I have not been able to learn . As soon as everything is ready , those of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are to come in small companies to their rendezvous , which is in the mountains of Virginia . They will pass down through Pennsylvania and Maryland , and enter Virginia at Harper 's Ferry . Brown left the North about three or four weeks ago , and will arm the ne* , roes and strike the blow in a few weeks , so that whatever is done must be done at , once . They have a large quantity of arms at their rendezvous , and are probably distributing them already . As I am not fully in their confidence , this is all the information I can give you . I dare not sign my name to this , but trust that you will not disregard the warnin0 on that account . As will be seen by referring to what I have written above , and in previous chapters , the writer of this letter knew more about the details of Brown 's movements , in some particulars , than his Massachu setts committee did ; more even than his own followers generally did at that time . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frederick Douglass learned from Brown in Chambersburg of his purpose to attack at Flarper 's Ferry , nor did Brown 's soldiers know it till about the same time . I had myself supposed that the blow would be struck farther west , and nearer to Ohio than to Baltimore and Washington . Another of Brown 's principal friends had looked to Kentucky as the point of attack . Whoever wrote this letter then , though " not fully in their confidence , " must have derived his information from some one very near to Brown himself , and must have been duly impressed with the value of the secret he made haste to reveal . But he might as well have written his message in the waters of the Ohio River . The secretary , in his testimony before Senator Mason 's committee , the next winter , thus described his state of mind upon receiving the mysterious letter : - " My attention was a little more than usually attracted by it , and therefore I laidit away in my trunk . I do not know but that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was anonymous ( as the man seemed to be particular in the details ) , but he confused me a little by saying these people were at work in an armory in Maryland . I knew there was no armory in Maryland , and supposed , therefore , that he had gone into details for the purpose of exciting the alarm of the Secretary of War , and to have a parade about that for nothing ; and that mistake in the statement satisfled me there was nothing in it. l Besides , I was satisfied in my own mind that a scheme of such wickedness and outrage could not be entertained by any citizen of the United States . I put the letter away and thought no more of it until the raid broke out . I showed it to nobody , I believe , except some members of my family , until the outbreak . I have no means of knowing who wrote it , or what the object in writing it was . " It is now plain , of course , that the 1 The armory or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maryland , yet Mr. Floyd does not seem place named in the letter ) was less than a mile , I be- to have thought of it . 598 May , // writer 's object was to put the government on its guard ; but why he did not afterwards disclose himself , and claim the credit of his revelation , is somewhat mysterious . Perhaps even now , if he is living , this letter-writer will make himself known , and tell the source of his intelligence . Another warning was more publicly given by a well-known opponent of slavery , the late Gerrit Smith , but this also passed unheeded . Writing to the colored men of Syracuse , New York , a week later than the date of this Cincinnati letter ( August 27 , 1859 ) , Mr. Smith said , among other things , " It is , perhaps , too late to bring slavery to an end by peaceable means - too late to vote it down . For many years I have feared , and published my fears , that it must go out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So debauched are the white people by slavery that there is not virtue enough left in them to put it down . If I do not misinterpret the words and looks of the most intelligent and noble of the black men who fall in my way , they have come to despair of the accomplishmeut of this work by the white people . The feeling among the blacks that they must deliver themselves gains strength with fearful rapidity . No wonder , then , is it that intelligent l*lack men in the States and in Canada should see no hope for their race in the practice and policy of white men . No wonder they are brought to the conclusion that no resource is left to them but in God and insurrections . For insurrections then we may look any year , any month , any day . A terrible remedy for a terrible wrong ! But come it must , unless anticipated by repentance and the putting away of the terrible wrong . " I have always supposed that Mr. Smith had the plans of John Brown in his mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the remarkable passage that follows . He added , at the close of his letter , - " It will be said that these insurrections will be failures - that they will be put down . Yes , but will not slavery nevertheless be put down by them ? For what portions are there of the South that will cling to slavery after two or three considerable insurrections shall have filled the whole South with horror ? And is it entirely certain that these insurrections will be put down promptly , and before they can have spread far ? Will telegraphs and railroads be too swift for even the swiftest insurrections ? Remember that telegraphs and railroads can be rendered useless in an hour . Remember too that many , who would be glad to face the insurgents , would be busy in transporting their wives and daughters to places where they would be safe from that worst fate which husbands and fathers can ima*ine for their wives and daughters . I admit that but for this embarrassment Southern men would laugh at the idea of an insurrection , and would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their beloved ones , I know of no part of the world where , so much as in the South , men would be like , in a formidable insurrection , to lose the most important time , and be distracted and panic-stricken . " When the day of her calamity shall have come to the South , and fire and rape and slaughter shall be filling up the measure of her affliction , then will the North have two reasons for remorse : - " First , That she was not willing ( whatever the attitude of the South at this point ) to share with her in the expense and loss of an immediate and universal emancipation . " Second , That she was not willing to vote slavery out of existence . " But why should I have spoken of the sorrows thatawait the South ? Whoever he may be that foretells the horrible end of American slavery is held both at the North and the South to be a lying prophet - another Cassandra . The South would not respect her own Jefferson 's prediction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she will respect another 's ? If . the South will not with her own Jefferson tremble ' when reflecting that God is just , ' if she will not see with her own Jefferson that the Almighty has no attributes which can take side with ' her in a contest ' with her slaves , then who 1875. 599 // is there , either North or South , that is capable of moving her fears and helping her to safety ? " 1 Such predictions were indeed looked upon , at the North and at the South , as the ravings of Cassandra . To the unthinking public , slavery had never seemed more secure , or more likely to continue for centuries , than in this very year 1859 . But Brown and his friends believed that it could be overthrown ; that it must be overthrown , and that speedily , else it would destroy the nation . Unlike Mr. Smith , Brown did not contemplate insurrection , but , as I have said , something like partisan warfare , at first on a small scale , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extreme consequences of his position . A man of peace for more than fifty years of his life , he nevertheless understood that war had its uses , and that there were worse evils than warfare for a great principle . He more than once said to me , and doubtless said the same to others , " I believe in the Golden Rule and the Declaration of Independence ; I think they both mean the same thing ; and it is better that a whole generation should pass off the face of the earth - men , women , and children - by a violent death , than that one jot of either should fail in this country . I mean exactly so , sir . " He also told me that " he had much considered the Soon after the capture of Brown 's papers at the Kennedy farm , a letter of Gerrit Smith 's , found among them , was published in all the newspapers , and was the first occasion of connecting his name with that of Brown in the undertaking . But for a misprint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smith , the name of Mr. Stearns , as well as mine and that of my friend Morton , would have been at once coupled with John Brown 's . The Mr. " Kearney " thrice mentioned in the letter given below was , in fact , Mr. * The word " Washington " is also a misprint , but for what I have now forgotten , - perhaps " Westport , " on Lake champlain , where Brown was soon after the date of the letter . He was at Keene , half-way between Westportand North Elba , on the 9th of June . At this time Brown had left Kansas , expecting never to return . The letter as printed was this - PaTEaeoao ' , June 4 , 1859. cAPTAIN Jonie Baows : Mv nasa FSuENO , -I wrote you a week ago , directing my letter to the care of Mr. Kearney. lie replied , informing me that he had forwarded matter , and had about concluded that a forcible separation of the connection between master and slave was necessary to fit the blacks for self-government . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan with the liberated slaves . " When they stand like men , the nation will respect them , " he said ; " it is necessary to teach them this . " He looked forwa , d , no doubt , to years of conflict , in which the blacks , as in the later years of the ci*Yil war , would be formed into regiinents and brigades and be drilled in the whole art of war , as were the black soldiers of Toussaint L ' Ouverture and Dessalines , in Hayti . But in his more inspired moments he foresaw a speedier end to the combat which he began . Once he said , " A few men in the right , and knowing they are right , can overturn a mighty king . Fifty men , twenty men , in the Alleghanies , could break slavery to pieces in two years . " Within less than three years from the day he crossed the Potomac with his twenty men , Abraham Lincoln had made his first proclamation of emancipation .
