AN EARTHQUAKE EXPERIENCE . Six months after receiving our diplomas of graduation at Annapolis found us a disconsolate mess of six midshipmen attached to one of Uncle Sam 's most unseaworthy " double-enders , " fitting out at the Boston Navy-yard for the most disagreeable station in the world , the West Indies . We felt as if the Navy Department had put us on the ' black list and was determined to sit on us from the start in our active service career . Our professional ardor was at a low ebb when the joyful news reached us that we were all to be detached from our double-bowed bugbear and ordered to the sloop-of-war which shall be nameless in this narrative . Suffice it to say she was a vessel with a history that will live in story as long as the battles of Mobile Bay and the terrible passage of the forts at New Orleans are recorded ; and what was more to our purpose and a desideratum sought after by all midshipmen , but unfortunately not always obtained , she had commodious quarters ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is preparing for a cruise , assigned as her destination the Mediterranean squadron . However , this illusion was soon dispelled , for the navigator informed us confidentially that he had been supplied from Washington with a full equipment of charts of the West Indies . " Ah , well ! " we thought , " we have the weather-gauge of some of our kind who are sweltering down there in much smaller vessels , "  --  a consolation which , I fear , we keenly relished , I will not attempt a full description of the trials and tribulations we endured in this our first experience at equipping a mess ; the shifts and stratagems , the profound calculations to make ends meet , pay our bills , and avoid the dread " dead horse " * ; our frequent councils to devise ways and means ; the heated wrangles that broke the harmony of these councils , and the invariable conclusion that starvation or bankruptcy would be the result of all our efforts . How we missed the providing hand of our excellent commissczire at Annapolis , which always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We were , indeed , fledgelings cast out to provide for ourselves . At length our ship was ready and we bade adieu to Boston . We shaped our course southward , our destination being Cape Haytien , where we were ordered to report to Admiral Palmer , on his flag-ship , // 663 " Susquehanna . " We passed Cape Hatteras ( the dread of all landsmen , and , at times , the terror of old salts ) while the Storm-king slept , the sea being as smooth as an inland lake , which was a pleasant surprise to us " green uns . " However , had we remembered the doggerel , " If Hatteras you should pass , Then look out for Bermudas , " we would not have plumed ourselves so much on our luck , for , on the second day after , Boreas took things in hand . At twelve o'clock that stormy night the rude hand of a quartermaster aroused me from my peaceful slumbers and announced that it was my watch on the fo'castle . " Is it raining ? " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' , I arose , and , sheathed in rubber from head to foot , ascended to the spar-deck . The night was intensely dark , the sea running high and the ship rolling as only our noble vessel knew how to roll . I scrambled forward , holding on to the running rigging to keep my feet as she lurched heavily to leeward , dodging with very indifferent success the seas that broke over her bulwarks , so that when I reached my confr ? re to relieve him , I was as wet as though I had swam forward . " **Vell , I 'll relieve you , " I said to him ; " what orders ? " " The commodore and first luff ' will give them to you , they are both forward trying to run a hawser to the foretopmasthead ; the stay has carried away , " he replied . Just then a flash of tropical lightning lit up the scene and made visible an old tar hanging in a sling about half-way up the mast , assisting others aloft to secure the hawser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay . Whew ! What lightning and what thunder ! I thought till then that our Western lightning was incomparable , but for extreme brilliancy , attended with a diabolical , greenish tint , commend all lovers of lightning to the tropical zone . I overheard a blue-jacket make the following remark after one of these displays , to which I mentally gave my hearty concurrence : " A man would be a fool to sell a farm to go to sea in weather like this ! " During this storm we noticed at the mastheads the dim , bluish , electric light called St. Elmo 's , upon which sailors , in times gone by , looked with superstitious dread . These are now regarded , however , as an indication that the gale has spent its power . And so it proved in this instance , for by the next morning we were booming along with a stiff breeze and a clear sky . A few days after , the welcome cry of " Land ho ! " sounded from the mast-head , and soon we made the entrance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the American consul that the " Susquehanna " had left a week before for the United States , as yellowfever , the scourge of these fruitful islands , had appeared among her crew . W&amp;found orders for us to take an extended cruise among the islands , commencing with Santa Cruz and returning to the same point by a certain date . We remained only two or three days in this harbor , which gave us bat a short run ashore . Sufficient time we had , however , to admire the picturesque scenery in the neighborhood of this once flourishing city , - this " New Paris " as it was called , under the French re*ime . It is located at the foot of a towering mountain covered with tropical verdure abutting on the sea , and is built on a large and beautiful plain , ( utilized in part for coffee plantations ) which terminates at the foot of a brown-stone colored mountain abounding in crags and ghastly precipices upon which , standing out clear and well defined , appears the almost inaccessible castle and fortress of King @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city could at any time have deserved such a flattering cognomen as " New Paris . " Riots , revolutions , earthquakes and that improvident spirit of the negro which seems opposed to the exertion necessary to keep anything in repair , had made a bat 's nest of what no doubt was once a beautiful city . I fear Hayti is a discouraging commentary on the theories of those humanitarians who believe in the ultimate elevation of the negro to the level of the Caucasian race . There is a backward tendency of which barbarism seems to be the inevitable goal in the richest island of the West Indies , unless a new people take possession of the soil . The sights about this shabby city were curious and amusing . Soldiers and police were visible at all points in various uniforms , if such a term is allowable , from semi-nudity to full-rigged brigadiers , each one seeming to consult his own taste , convenience or purse as to color , style and ornaments . Such a travesty on modern military equipments I had never beheld . A soldier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red plume , a cavalry saber strapped to his side , a pair of tattered unmentionables and barefooted , mounted on a mule or donkey , would go scurrying by , and this , we would be informed , was a " regimental officer . " We hired a brigadier for fifty cents to carry our luggage to the hotel . We carried out the instructions received from time to time from Admiral Palmer , to call among the various groups of islands , touching at all the principal ports as well as Aspinwall and the ports on the Spanish Main , until finally the month of October found us lying in the harbor of Frederickstadt , Santa Cruz . We were there recuperating the health of our crew , having had eight cases of yellow fever aboard , one of which had proven fatal , the other patients having been sent ashore to the hospital . " It is an ill wind that blows nobody good ; " for , had it not been for this sickness , our vessel , without doubt , would have anchored just outside Prince @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ St. Thomas , as had been our custom for several months so as to meet the American mail , and would have been caught in that terrific hurricane of the twenty-ninth of October , 1867 , which visited that island , wrecking in its harbor in the space of two hours , sixty odd vessels of all sizes , from the magnificent iron steamer of the English mail lines to the small coasting schooner , and drowning over five hundred persons . But we were reserved for a different fate . Hearing of this catastrophe , our commanding officer immediately resolved to steam over and render all possible assistance . The first view of the scene impressed us with the terrible power that had been running riot among the shipping . The harbor was literally choked with wrecks , and , as if not content with that , some of the smaller craft were flung high upon the rocks . Vessels of all sizes became unmanageable and were driven hither and thither about the harbor by the violence of the merciless gale , driving upon and sinking each other . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " by name , broke from her moorings and charged three times across the harbor , maneuvered by the shifting wind , sinking steamers , ships and schooners , until , shattered and stove , she finally sank upon the wrecks of two Danish brigs she had sent to the bottom before her . I shall not attempt to depict the horrors of the wrecking of the mail steamers just in from Europe , loaded with passengers : how one attempted to gain the open sea and in the mist ran upon a reef outside the harbor , only two of her crew surviving ; how others went down in sight of the city with human aid powerless to save even the women and children . One steamer had the good fortune , when in a sinking condition , to be driven alongside an iron floating dock in time to transfer her passengers . Many of these passengers I afterward saw at the hotels lamenting their unhappy condition , being left penniless in a strange land thousands of miles from home . A wealthy Mexican with a young bride had much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatly feared had gone to deck " the dark unfathomed caves of ocean . " A small Spanish man-of-war , the name of which I regret to say I can not recall , deserves special mention . During the entire gale she steamed as best she could from point to point in the harbor as she was directed by the cry for help or the shriek of the drowning , until she had lost all boats but her smallest one and many brave men , when her commander heard the cry of the captain of a French vessel who was clinging to a buoy . He called for volunteers to man the only boat left  --  a mere toy in such a gale ; but his men hesitating to run the hazard , he leaped single-handed into the boat . and shoved off to his own destruction , the Frenchman clinging fast until rescued after the gale had abated . The various adventures and hair-breadth escapes " WE HIRED A BRIGADIER FOE FIFTY CENTS TO CARRY OUR LUGGAGE TO THE HOTEL . " // of individuals , if all told , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an American brig , having his wife aboard and anticipating the loss of his vessel , determined to make a desperate effort to save her whom he prized far above vessel and cargo . Dressing her in a suit of his clothes , he waited a favorable lull and shoved off in a small boat for the shore . They rowed but a few fathoms from their vessel when their boat capsized , and man and wife were separated forever , the former being drowned and the latter saved by drifting under the bows of a Danish bark and catching a rope thrown her , by which she was drawn aboard . But still ill-fortune followed her ; in a few minutes this vessel was capsized , or stove , and once more she was in the water battling with the fury of the winds and waves , to be again rescued by a rope from a schooner nearer shore . Bleeding and exhausted , she had scarcely recovered her senses when this last refuge was carried among the breakers and she swept with the wreck to the shore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harbor-master and a cr&amp;w of negroes proved themselves heroes on that day at thc ' cost of their lives . Many trips they made in their life-boat from shore to wreck , carrying living freight of men , women , and children . Once too often were they impelled to venture on their mission of mercy , and the angry waves swallowed them . The harbor-master 's body was found locked in the arms of two of his faithful crew who had endeavored to assist him to shore . Several dead bodies were found under the coal-piles near the water , where halfdrowned sailors had crawled only to be smothered by the falling coal . Some of the freaks of the wind I hesitate to mention , lest the veracity of your chronicler may be doubted . But I could produce witnesses to others which I shall narrate . An old-fashioned diving-bell , weighing over nine hundred pounds , which had been left on a small island in the harbor , was picked up by the wind , or some power in the air , and carried bodily several hundred yards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some instances , were blown down and scattered , stone by stone , until nothing remained to mark their sites but the foundation walls , and yet within a few feet of them light frame structures were left standing entire . On the island of St. John , a few miles to the southward , I noticed in the roof of a house holes made by round and oblong stones , weighing thirty or forty pounds , which had been picked up by the wind and hurled through the air ; and to convince the skeptical , there were the rocks lying on the attic floor . Shingles and tiles from the roofs of houses were driven into the trees as if shot from guns . During the gale the air was filled with a salt spray that penetrated the inmost recesses of houses far up on the hills . // After finishing our mission we returned to Santa Cruz only to be ordered back in a couple of weeks . At this time the government was meditating the purchase of these Danish Islands , and the commissioners who had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were desirous of leaving that pestilential " hole in the wall , " to survey the fairer one , of which they had many good reports . Consequently we were detailed to carry them over to Frederickstadt , which we accomplished on the x7th of November . We anchored in the open roadstead which serves as a harbor to this town , about half a mile from the wharf . The weather was warm , but not remarkably so for the tropics , the thermometer ranging during the day in the eighties , touching the nineties in the middle of the day perhaps . The sky , we remembered by the light of after events , wore a coppery hue . Nothing unusual attracted our attention until three o'clock in the afternoon of the *8th of November , when our vessel began to quiver and rock as if a mighty giant had laid hold of her and was trying to loosen every timber in her frame . Officers and men ran pell-mell on deck to ascertain the cause of such a phenomenon . The vibrations continued the space of perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the draught of a smelting furnace , or the hum of innumerable swarms of bees . So certain were we that the cause was connected in some way with the ship that no one cast an eye on shore . Various suggestions were made by old and young . " Blowing down the boilers ! " said one . There being no fires under the boilers , such a solution was impossible . " A drum fish fastened to the vessel 's bottom , " suggested another . " It 's an earthquake , sir ; look ashore ! " shouted from the bow an old blue jacket , who had felt the peculiar sensation before . I looked toward Frederickstadt and saw a dusty hazy atmosphere over the town . I could see men , women and children , running hither and thither , and could cafch faint cries of distress . Noticing that a part of the stone tower of the English Church had fallen , I surmised great damage had been done the dwellings , and was expecting to hear our boats called away to render assistance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shock , when I heard a peculiar grating noise , and looking over the bow I found the chain sawing on the cut-water , and as taut as a harpstring , full ten fathoms of it being out of water . On reporting the fact aft , the warp from the quarter which was used to swing the ship broadside to the land-breeze , was let go , when we found we were dragging anchor very rapidly , because of the powerful currents , the first effect of the shock . Orders were immediately given to " veer " chain ; the executive officer ordered the " stoppers** to be cut . A sailor seized an ax and delivered but a stroke or two , when the tremendous strain broke them , and with the leap of a huge serpent the iron cable ran out the hawse-pipe with continually increasing velocity , swaying and leaping in its mad career , defying the power of the men at the compressor with their powerful lever to stop it ; on and on it dashed , making the vessel 's bow rise and fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a streak of fire , until coming to the end there was a perceptible rising of the deck , a tremendous jerk and the he4avy fourteen-inch bolt riveted in a solid oak beam was torn out and the last links connecting the vessel to the anchor went flourishing and wriggling overboard with the rest . The last couple of fathoms swept the decks thoroughly under the top-gallant forecastle , upsetting and smashing the carpenter 's bench and grindstone , and whipping up the ladder , making it execute a back soniersault in the air . We were now adrift at the mercy of the currents . An effort was made to man the starboard compressor so as to check the other anchor when let go ; but the men had come on deck and were standing panic-stricken , gazing at the terrible appearance of the sea . A reef had risen off the northern point of the island where but a few minutes before were several fathoms of water . Our vessel advanced toward and receded from the shore with the waters until , as if some great power had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapidly closed in on the town , filling the houses and covering the street running along the beach to a depth of twenty-four feet . Our ship , following the current , took a course toward the southern end of the town , until over the edge of the street it swung her bow toward the north and was carried along-smashing a frame store-house , and breaking down a row of shade-trees . During this maneuver an effort was made to hoist the jib in the hope of catching a breeze to keep us off the town . The halliards were manned , when it was found that the cover ( a strong piece of canvas ) was // holding it fast . Several men rushed out to remove the impediment , but their nervous fingers tugged in vain at the stubborn knots when an officer ordered them to cut it loose ; only one knife was convenient , and the man using it had ripped but a couple of feet of the cover , when his trembling hand dropped it overboard . Men were then ordered aloft to loose the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the rigging nearly to the top , when catching a view of the angry and turbulent sea they stopped , trembling in the presence of the mighty power that was abroad , and retreated to the deck . Again were the jib halliards manned , in the hope of tearing the sail from its cover . The men would tug at the rope with frantic efforts for a moment , then turn for a glimpse at the threatening sea , and the rope would drop from their hands . By this time the rush of waters was toward the ocean . We were carried out perhaps five hundred yards from the shore , when our vessel grounded and the water continuing its re* treat , she careened over on her port beam 's ends . The bottom of the roadstead was now visible , nearly bare , for a distance of half a mile beyond us , and that immense body of water which had covered the bay and part of the town was re-forming with the whole Atlantic Ocean as an ally , for a tr*-mendous charge upon us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the catastrophe . As far as the eye could reach to the north and to the south was a high threatening wall of green water . It seemed to pause for a moment as if marshaling its strength , and then on it came in a majestic unbroken column , more awe-inspiring than an army witl ! banners . The suspense was terrible ! Our noble vessel seemed as a tiny nut-shell to withstand the shock of the mighty rushing Niagara that was advancing upon us . Many a hasty prayer was muttered by lips unaccustomed to devotion . All expected to be engulfed , and but few had any hope of surviving . We all seized hold of some stationary object with the intent of preventing ourselves from being washed overboard . " Hold fast ! " was the cry , as the tidal-Wave struck the ship with gigantic force , making every timber shiver . Yet , singular enough , not a drop of water reached her decks . Being rather fiat-bottomed , the first effect of the blow was to send her over on her starboard beam 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well under her before righting , when she was buoyed to the crest of the wave and carried broadside to the shore , finally landing on the edge of the street in a cradle of rocks that seemed prepared for her reception . Here she rested with her decks inclined at an THE FALL OF THE CHURCH TOWER . angle of fifteen degrees . A small Spanish brig was carried bodily inland across the cane-fields and landed in the midst of the king 's highway . The waters again retreated and assumed such a threatening . appearance , that our commander , fearing another tidal wave ( which would have dashed us against the stone houses or against the walls of a Danish fort just ahead of us ) , gave the order , " Every man save himself ! " In an instant ropes were thrown over the sides and the crew began sliding down them like spiders and making for the hills in the rear of the town . Seizing one of the fore try-sail vangs I flung it over the side , securing the part even with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still remained forward had descended on my rope and I had cast a glance seaward to calculate the chances of getting clear of the ship 's bottom before the sea struck her again , I swung to it and descended so rapidly that my hands paid a severe penalty , the rope cutting the flesh nearly to the bone . Upon striking the ground , I immediately // cut round the corner of the street leading to the nearest hill . Like Lot , I looked not back , but made the best time possible , soon overtaking a squad of our men that had preceded me . On arriving at the first cross street we were beset by a rush of water that had been thrown far up in the town , seeking its way back to the sea . We were soon in. water waistdeep , contending with a strong current as best we could . The situation was not so critical , however , as to prevent us from noting some comical incidents . This water bore on its surface all manner of de'bris which it had gathered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chairs , cradles , bedsteads , broken fences and doors , together with flocks of ducks and geese quacking and gabbling , utterly bewildered by the sudden rise of their natural element . We blundered and stumbled along , making all haste for fear the sea would overtake us . A marine secured a horse that had been abandoned by its owner and mounting rode to the rescue of a negro girl who was clinging to a fence . Seating her in front of him , he steered his bark again for the hills with two or three blue jackets towing astern , hanging to the horse 's tail . But even this craft was doomed to be shipwrecked , for the horse stumbled over some obstacle and tossed both marine and girl far over his head into the muddy depths . No injury resulting , we all arrived safely at the foot of the hill of refuge . Here was a scene never to be forgotten . Whites and blacks were collected in groups , praying , crying , and wringing their hands ; some counting their beads , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One old ne // gro , with an open family Bible in his hand was going about prophesying , saying , " Breddern , dis is noffin to what it will be in 72 . Den you will cry for de hills and de mountains to fall on you and hide you , " which gave courage to many of us , as we did not feel quite sure the hills and mountains were not about to fall on us without a special invitation . Many incidents of interest I might chronicle , that occurred aboard our vessel during the interval between the shock and her final landing on the shore . When our apparently hopeless situation began to he realized by all of us , it was curious to mark the manner in which it affected different individuals . Our chief boatswain 's mate stood unmoved at his post , whistle in hand , never forgetting to pipe " haul away , " ' or " belay , " when appropriate , and if I remember correctly , his whistle piped the men over the side when the order " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WAS BUOYED TO SEST OF THE WAVE *NO CAERIED BEOAD* , ? **S TO THE SHOEE. " heard to remark , " We are all lost , but we must do the best we can , " and worked with a will . One man ran about the decks , exclaiming , in the face of the officers , " My God ! we are all lost ! " Two prisoners in double irons hobbled on deck from their prison below , and begged , for God 's sake , to have their irons removed , that they might have an equal chance for their lives , with the rest of us . The master-at-arms was without his keys to unlock their shackles . He had given them to the ship 's corporal , who was on shore . No time was to be 77 A 7 ' // lost , so I ordered their chains to be cut . One of the prisoners seized a hatchet , and , seating himself on the deck , in one powerful stroke severed the chain confining his ankles . He then cut the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confining his wrists , leaving the bracelets still on wrists and ankles , but so as not to interfere with the free use of their limbs . When the commotion in the water first occurred , two men were sent in each of the boats to assist the keepers in getting them under the davits , the intention being to hoist them . But the time was too short , and they drifted from the vessel . I watched the movements of one of these boats through a port as the wave approached . The three men in her manned their oars , and pointed her bow towar ( 1 the enemy , bending every effort to give her headxvay in the shallow water , in the hope of topping the wave and riding it to shore . They did nobly . The boat 's bow rose nearly to the crest of the wave , and I hoped for a moment they would be successful , but their oars were caught foul by the on-rushing water , their boat thrown broadside to the wave , and crew and all were overwhelmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The third one rose , and , seizing hold of a sugar hogshead that had been washed from the wharf , after many immersions finally reached shore unhurt . The coxswain of the commodore 's gig stood by his boat at the expense of his life . Keeping her under the quarter , when the final rush for the shore occurred , the vessel came down on boat and keeper . One poor fellow , who had just returned from liberty , lost his presence of mind , and leaped overboard at a time when no effort could be made . to save him . Another , in descending , lost his hold on the rope , and fell to the ground , breaking both legs and sustaining other injuries . We carried him to a frame church on the hill , where the surgeons , after examination , announced to him it would be necessary to amputate both legs . He asked that he might see a priest before the operation . One was sent for , and , after a short interview , the brave fellow told the surgeons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any emergency , and did not wish them to use an*esthetics . One leg was amputated , by which time it became apparent that internal injuries of a fatal nature had been sustained , and he was saved further unnecessary suffering . Leaving him in the hands of the surgeons I collected what men I could and returned to the vessel . Many had remained on board concluding that the threatening wave could not raise sufficient force for a second charge . XVhen within hailing distance , I was commanded by a superior officer to take a cutlass and clear the men out of a grog shop on the opposite side of the street from the ship . On entering I found twenty or thirty of our crew making away with all the liquor their stomachs could accommodate . They found themselves among a rare assortment of the vilest kind from which to select , and many of their faces already glowed with the liquid fire they had imbibed . Foremost among them I noticed our two prisoners with their chains still dangling to their limbs , far gone in intoxication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relieved by the owner . His face elongated perceptibly when he surveyed the scene within . Billiard-tables , chairs , counters , rum-. bottles and rubbish were piled together in a slimy heap at the further end of the room . On returning aboard ship for dry clothing I learned the full extent of damage sustained by our floating home . Her rudder was torn from its gimbals , forty feet of keel was gone , muth copper was stripped off , two holes were in the bottom , and her frame was so racked that the engines were out of line , the shaft was bent near the propeller , and seams were gaping fore and aft . Hearing that a widow lady and family who resided a half mile from the town were in great distress , three of us who were acquainted with them proceeded to their assistance . We arrived at the house early in the evening and found them huddled together in the yard almost paralyzed with terror , without shelter and their house so damaged that it would have to be rebuilt . We removed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and improvising a tent we prepared for camping out for the night . We built a large fire under the trees and made every one as comfortable as possible . But in vain did we woo sleep that night . Severe shocks occurred at intervals of a half hour during the entire night , which had the effect of keeping us all on the qui vive . So there was nothing for us to do but accept the situation and make the best of it . The night was beautiful and clear , the heavens were filled with bright stars , and , in spite of the unfortunate condition in which we were all placed , there was a charm in the situation , whether owing to the presence of the ladies or the novelty of the surroundings I // can not say . But this I know , the mental exertion put forth by the sterner sex to allay the fear and anxiety of the gentler , gave all a flow of spirits and humor that the frequent and violent shocks could but temporarily subdue . So passed the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folded our tents and moved our friends into the town and gave them a part of a large tent made from the ship 's awnings and erected by our crew in a palm-grove for the benefit of such white families as might feel disposed to accept of its hospitable shelter . The negroes from the plantations were terribly affected by the earthquakes ; they saw water oozing from the sides of the hills , where no springs were known , and the rumbling and shaking of the earth filled them with superstitious terrors . Some of them died from fright , as I was informed by a clergyman who ministered among them . Hundreds of them flocked into town , and for the accommodation of them and others we constructed a tent out of our mainsail . The scene in this palm-grove was not unlike an old-time camp-meeting . The sojourners in both tents devoted their time principally to religious exercises , of which singing formed the greater part . At times these tents would be giving forth volumes of music and praise that made the very welkin ring ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ custom to alternate , one listening while the other sang , until the superiority of the negro music was acknowledged , when the black tent had to bear the burden of song . We had a good opportunity for observing the negro character under the most trying circumstances , and had abundant evidence of its volatile nature . They were all very devout , very penitent for the first three days , and spent the day and nearly all the night-time in prayer and praise . If there was a cessation in their devotions at any time , night or day , a shock was sure to revive them , and a long prayer and one hymn , at least , would follow . But as days passed and the shocks occurred with less frequency and violence , Sambo 's natural gayety arose , and as their repertoire of hymns had been exhausted , some of them occasionally would venture to interject a popular ballad imported from the states , and all would join in and render it with a full chorus . On one occasion they were singing with great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " AFTER THE TIDAL WAVE . SPANISH BRIG IN THE KING 'S HIGHWAY . // when whir-r-r-er came a tremendous vibration , which hushed every voice in an instant , and , as soon as recovered , fervent prayers took the place of the worldly song , followed by the . doubly appropriate hymn beginning , " On Jordan 's stormy banks I stand . " People outside of the tents conducted themselves during these trying times in various manners . Some relied solely on their devotions , others gave rum their exclusive attention , while still others there were who made as they thought , a judicious admixture of the two . All , however , seemed to suffer acutely from anxiety and nervousness . Tb ere is nothing , I believe , so trying to a healthy nervous system as a succession of earthquakes . To a landsman a gale at sea has untold terrors ; yet the tossings of his bark can be accounted for : the wind and waves are there , and the result may be anticipated . But in an earthquake all these factors are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result anticipated is destruction in some form , and the tension of the nerves is most wearing . Imagination magnifies the danger , and thus keeps the sensorium on a constant strain for the next shock . The third day after the wreck an unusually severe vibration occurred , after which the smell of sulphur was plainly perceptible . I was standing at the time.by the side of a friend , and so affected was I by this new symptom of danger that I could not mention it . I felt like one who sees a fatal symptom appearing on the face of a sick friend ; my heart fell within me , and I could not muster*courage to speak of it . My friend sniffed the Plutonic odor , however , and exclaimed , " Gods ! X. , did you smell brimstone ? What if a volcano be under us 1 " I confess I was trying to banish the same thought . At length , after fourteen days of anxiety , we were relieved by the appearance of the United States steamer " De Soto , " from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , with instructions to convey all but a few of us back to the United States . How glad we were to q*iit that island words can not express . Ocean , with its uncertainties , its waves and tempests , even in a damaged vessel , was thrice welcome . Our ark of refuge bore us safely to our native shores , and Uncle Sam , not forgetful of his own , had our noble vessel launched and repaired from keel to mast-head , and to-day she sails the seas without a mark of her rough handling by the earthquake wave .
