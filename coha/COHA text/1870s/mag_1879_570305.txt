ARTICLE IV. - SOME PERPLEXITIES OF THOUGHT . IN treating of perplexities of thought , one is at no loss for subjects of contemplation , so many difficult problems at once present themselves . The existence of sin , pain , death , the failure of the good , the success of the bad , the unequal distribution of fortunes , the appalling calamities which happen , the wanton destruction of life and property by the forces of nature , the premature cutting off of those who might be blessings to the world , are problems which have often tempted the thought of man , but which can never , in this life , be satisfactorily explained . All these subjects are worthy of the most profound study , and he who could shed even a little light upon them , would be a benefactor . We here , however , turn from these questions , which have been the enigmas of the ages , to consider a less frequently presented , perhaps , but no less mysterious order of phenomena . These problems , some of them at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be involved in the very best we have in life , with the very best theories we are able to form in regard to it In treating of them , we disclaim any pretence of offering any complete solution ; we content ourselves , chiefly , with calling attention to them , presenting here and there a suggestion by way of elucidation , leaving to our readers , or some wiser mind , to discover a more satisfactory explanation . Our first perplexity is connected with life viewed as a discipline . It would seem , on the whole , as if this idea of life were the most satisfactory which could be presented . It appears to explain better than any other , its experiences and occurrences , and to connect it with a future state . If we could believe that life were a state of education , in which the evil within us were subdued , our defects supplied , and our good qualities strengthened , this would seem to give consistency to life , enable us to bear its calamities , and to wait patiently , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that to many life proves just such an education . Their characters are // refined and elevated , and they , and others , can see that the experiences through which they have passed are just what they have needed . But in the case of others , it may be boldly affirmed that the contrary is the case . They have not had the discipline of which they were in need , and that through no special fault of their own , but because of the unfitness of the education they have undergone to their peculiar disposition and wants . To this it may be said , that persons often mistake their own characters , and do not know what kind of a discipline is best for them , and this is undoubtedly true . But there are cases where the profoundest reflection of the individual himself , and the keenest observation of those about him , will affirm , not only that he has not had the discipline he needed , but precisely that which he did not need ; and to challenge this conclusion , is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is said that God knows what kind of an education is suited to us , and that what he gives us is the best . There is comfort in this thought . But the difficulty still remains . Our best judgment teaches us that our life education ought to have been something different from what it has been , and finding our reason unmistakably teaching this , we give up reasoning , and as a last resort say that this discipline must be right , for it is sent by supreme wisdom . That the education of life has , in some cases , a tendency to strengthen our worst , and to subdue our best propensities , a little inquiry will make manifest . For example , hope is a very desirable quality . But the natural effect of life is to undermine hope . The young are hopeful ; the experienced are moderate in their expectations , or despairing . Again , happiness is to be desired . But it is the young who are happy ; those in mature or advanced life are frequently desponding . Love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years this love glows with ardor , but almost inevitably life dulls this sentiment . Grand ambitions are very important to elevation of mind , and significance of life ; but experience makes us more conservative in our plahs , less sanguine of success . How life , too , starts into fearful activity our baser propensities . Misanthropy , scepticism , recklessness , selfishness , sensualism , are all the natural outgrowth of a discipline which , differently ordered , might have strengthened all beautiful and // admirable qualities . How often , by a strict logical and natural sequence , are the sweet waters turned into bitterness , all the passion and fervor which might have made the grandest attributes splendidly effective , made but to intensify the most elaborate and degrading wickedness ! Nor is it any answer to say that in all these cases a wrong use has been made of discipline , that our best qualities ought not to have been subdued , or our worst strengthened . It is the thought here that some at least of the unfortunate results are the inevitable outgrowth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to which certain persons are subjected . You ask the old man why he has given up his noble ambitions for himself and the world , and you may not be able to detect any intellectual fallacy in his reply , that reason and experience have taught him so to do . At the same time you mourn the deplorable results , and in comparing his listless indifference and credulity with the ingenuous enthusiasm of youth , you are tempted to ask , if life be a discipline , are we not often better off without it than with it . The education of life , too , often fails to cultivate those qualities which need development , while it brings into undue prominence qualities which ought to be suppressed . For example , here is a conceited , self-confident person . One would say that he needed humbling . Yet it is very likely he will never receive it . Indeed , we have again and again had occasion to observe how just that success in professional and business life which it would seem should be denied to conceited persons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-assurance . It will be said that the success which thus obtained is not of a very high kind , and in itself it is not . But mere pretence will often give a position , emoluments , and an influence which are denied the most sterling qualities without it . Conceit , too , is fostered , not suppressed . On the other hand , a sensitive , retiring person is not only not likely to have this characteristic superseded by a confidence which he lacks , but it is probable that by failure and the stern discipline of life he will have an already undue tendency developed to an abnormal extent . Here again is one of those worldly , superficial , moral , and religious propagandists of which the world is full . One would say that trouble was necessary for such a person , to deepen and // spiritualize the character . But the fact is , he remains the same bustling , earthly kind of person he always was , and the education of life has served to strengthen rather than to correct these qualities . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which apparently should be toned up to a healthy interest in life , and some definite practical work for the world , is confirmed in morbid introspection and reverie . The fact is , not to multiply illustrations , that life is full of what our most discriminating thought pronounces erroneous , superfluous kinds of discipline . This discipline appears to be often ideally wrong , and most deplorable in its practical results . A second perplexity is found in the way in which mere mistakes are followed by the most terrible consequences . A train plunges down an embankment , a ship runs upon a rock , a mine explodes . What is the occasion of this fearful destruction of life and property ? Merely miscalculation or negligence . One is maimed for life , or subjected to terrible disease . Why ? Merely from carelessness or sin ignorantly committed . A person mistakes his calling , and a life which might have been happy and useful , ends in failure and wretchedness . Why ? Merely because he , or his friends , misconceived his capacities and adaptabilities . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as those previously mentioned , are natural , and that we are taught , through them , the majesty of natural laws , and the duty of implicit obedience in every respect . This is true . But the mystery is , that the penalties are so tremendously disproportionate to the offence committed . Men may sometimes live profligate , dissipated lives , and at the end of all their debauchery , have strong , healthy bodies . But a little overeating , a little straining of the eyes , may aggravate into permanent wretchedness , a tendency to dyspepsia or ocular sensitiveness . One person may commit the gravest sins , and scarcely suffer a twinge of conscience . But a trifling error or neglect occasions another the most acute pain . Another mental problem is , that so great an amount of suffering endured in good causes results in nothing . If we can see that all the pain and labor we expend will be finally rewarded , we can well afford the outlay . And this is often the case . The philanthropist , the moral and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of succeeding generations . The philosopher and poet are neglected by their own age , but inspire luture ages . But , unfortunately , this is not always true . It is no certain sign , because the cause is good , and a vast amount of toil and sacrifice have been expended for it , that therefore it will succeed . The seed may be sown , but the harvest may not only be postponed , it may never spring up . The soil may be watered by tears , but may remain eternally sterile . How lamentably insignificant appear , often , the results of wars , ruartyrdoms , heroic devotion to some noble interest , constant , laborious efforts for the world 's good , compared with the suffering endured ! And who can tell how many grand plans have , in the past , been conceived , for a time pursued , and then prematurely abandoned , leaving no result , no fruit . It would not be too much of a presumption to say that history , could it be unfolded in its minutito , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efforts . For our own lives , and those of the persons about us , abound in just such unrewarded toils , such apparently useless sacrifice . Some noble purpose for a time enkindles our thought and enthusiasm , for a time we suffer and toil for its realization , and then reluctantly abandon it as chimerical . And we remain in substantially the same condition we were before the inauguration of our scheme , with the loss of so much time and exertion . A fourth perplexity is found in the fact that our best powers often seem to have no prospective end , to recoil upon themselves , and to be consumed of their own fires . In early life we are apt to comfort ourselves with the reflection that if we do not gain certain coveted things now , we shall in after years . It would appear as if the noblest qualities indicated some appropriate objects to center about , some appropriate field for their employment . And often it is true that persons find in their circumstances and conditions of life , a natural outlet for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But of others it may be said that their grandest attributes find , through the caprice of fortune , no sphere for their employment , that they seem to be , in fact , well nigh wasted . We can easily understand why our baser propensities should be continually thwarted and suppressed in their development . But why our // nobler qualities should fail to find opportunities for their exercise-should everlastingly circle round in our own souls , till they have spent their force and turned to ashes , is , indeed , a mystery . For example , it is no sign because a person is gifted with a deep affectional nature , that , therefore , he will find objects to satisfy that affection ; or because be has an exquisite susceptibility to happiness , that he will ever be placed in circumstances where he will be happy ; or because he is possessed of an ardent philanthropy , that he will ever find himself in a condition where he can , on any wide scale , exercise that philanthropy . The fact is , that many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than for certain internal , psychological processes . They eternally rise and fall , they burn and glow , bound and rebound , but the result is a desolate spirit , scorched , withered by consuming fires . Under happier auspices these attributes might have borne flowers and fruit , for the individual and the world . Now , they remain unused , unproductive . It may be said , that an excellence which remains secreted in the soul , and does not manifest itself , is not worth much ; and that the common conditions of life afford a field for the employment of the grandest qualities . To the first of these objections it may be replied : is it not a fact that there are natures originally noble , who , through some peculiar combination of circumstances , are prevented from doing for themselves and the world what they appear to have been created for doing ? And to the second it may be replied : this kind of usefulness and noble action is really something with which we content ourselves , because we can do no better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not act nobly in the broad arena , and so we do what we can in the by-ways . And this is in truth the best that can be done , and , often , admirable in itself . Still it remains , that our best qualities fail of accomplishing what they were evidently intended to accomplish . It is here that a hard trial comes for our faith . It is often argued that the possession of grand gifts and susceptibilities points to a satisfaction , a completion of our present fragmentary being , in a future world ; and we can never surrender this argument . And , yet , on what a mournful , enigmatical truth is this reasoning founded , and how profoundly unsatisfactory are all // analogies based on the present life . For the truth is , failure and waste often result in this world from the noblest gifts , and the practical efficiency of our best endowments is no complement to our dreams and ideals . Again , how mysterious is the truth that certain persons are prevented by some trifling defect from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an individual may have his mind filled with the loftiest schemes for the good of those about him , may possess great natural energy and great natural ability to put these schemes into execution , and yet may be prevented , largely , from doing so , by some physical infirmity , a neuralgic , or consumptive affection . An orator may have the noblest philanthropy , the finest discrimination of the wants of the people , the broadest and profoundest thoughts , and yet from a nervous manner , an aristocratic appearance , or some minor defect which arouses the prejudices of the masses , may fail to make upon them any impression at all commensurate with his abilities . One would say that a slight assumption of superiority in the company of persons very commonplace in mind and character , was no very grave imperfection on the part of a thoroughly cultivated and elevated mind . Yet , undoubtedly , a trifle like this often renders the finest culture , the loftiest principle , comparatively useless in society . The lack of a winning smile , or cordial manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a great statesman , yet this may materially injure his influence , even cost him his position . This truth is frequently illustrated in religious and moral effort . There are those who have the most ardent interest in the highest welfare of their kind , and yet for the want of a little tact , their most disinterested efforts fail , or awaken opposition . They choose the wrong time for the inculcation of their religious and moral ideas , approach the wrong persons , use the wrong arguments . Persons with not a tithe , probably , of their mental or moral excellence , really effect greater changes in others , merely because they have more worldly wisdom . And it would seem as though the mere want of amiability should not make a person enamored with great moral and religions schemes , unsuccessful or obnoxious . Yet how frequently are we called to observe just this phe // nomenon . How often are the influential , popular persons in a community merely persons of pleasing manners , quiescent , kindly disposition , possessing little grandeur of mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generous intentions are misunderstood or disliked because they have some little mannerisms or peculiarities . Again , circumstances may render welinigh useless the most valuable qualities . Who can doubt that there are among women , persons of great political or business ability , whom the accident of sex deprives of the privilege of using these abilities . Uncivilized , or subject races , the so-called lower orders of society , in all probability , have in them individuals possessing much latent intellectual and moral excellence , whom the chance of birth forever keeps in obscurity . We can see , to be sure , very clearly how these unfortunate results spoken of , came about . But when we attempt to philosophize on the matter , and ask ourselves , why is the world so constituted , why should these trifles so interfere with one 's happiness and usefulness , we find ourselves involved in perplexity . It would seem that admirable qualities ought to insure success ; and in general it is admitted that they do . But sometimes they do not ; and the reason why they do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ causes . And thus the world has in it many who just fail of success . A trifling excess here , a trifling lack there , have made miserable , unprofitable lives out of what should have been happy , useful ones . But it may be said that these defects should not be called insignifi. cant , since so much depends on them . Well , it is the old question , whether there is any difference between real and apparent merit . It has not been affirmed that these defects or qualities are wholly insignificant in themselves , but only comparatively so . The mystery is between their great importance in a prudential , and their unimportance in a rational point of view . Another mental difficulty is found in the way in which we attain things at last which are matters of indifference to us , and the capacity for enjoying which has been exhausted . It is not said that it is not a wise arrangement , that certain bene. fits come only as the result of persevering effort ; nor that it would be always best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And yet it does seem strange that what we call the " prizes " of life , should generally become ours only in the decadence of our powers , when we no longer can derive much satisfaction from them . This truth finds many illustrations . Wealth , for example , usually comes only in the decline of life . Doubtless the possession of great riches in youth often results in dissipation and folly . But this is not universally true . There are many who would derive great pleasure and advantage from wealth if conferred upon them in the vigor of their powers , when the sense of enjoyment is keenest , It is then that they would enjoy and profit from those benefits which wealth , wisely expended , gives-travel , books , society , beautiful surroundings . But as the case now stands , men often employ their time and energies upon that for which they care little , when once attained . Wealth is gained , but finds its possessor a querulous , broken down old man . us coffers are filled , but his sensibilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delightful are influence , appreciation , in early years-how little we commonly prize them when they at last come to us , as the result of long effort . Those conflicts and endeavors which have made influence possible , have also weakened our power to enjoy it . We have reached the summit , but have been so wearied by the long and rugged ascent , that we can take little satisfaction in our position , receive little enjoyment from the prospect . In the freshness of youthful hope , too , a kind of romance attaches to the approbation of others . As we grow older , we learn how indiscriminating , uncertain , popular applause is . And thus with some , the respect and esteem of others come too late . The ear which once would have gladly received words of commendation is now , alas ! deaf . The heart which once would have bounded at the thought of sym. pathy , and inspiring the minds of men with lofty thoughts and purposes is dulled and indifferent . Hence it is noticeable how little importance those generally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those care for approbation . who receive it . Doubtless there is a petty ambition in this respect which needs to be rebuked . But there is a natural , innocent desire for influence , appreciation , which it is strange should not be gratified , and it appears singular that we should at last attain these // ends only through the partial or complete destruction of those sensibilities and desires which led us at first to strive for them . But perhaps the most striking illustration of this truth is found in the sphere of the affections . Marriage , the possession of a home , is commonly esteemed among the most desirable of the blessings of life . And yet it is this blessing which there is a tendency , it would seem almost a necessity in our modern civilization , to defer later and later in life . The ideas prevail . ing in society as to the proper age for marriage , the competi. tions of life and the increasing difficulty of obtaining a liveli. hood , have a tendency to prevent early unions . The gratifica. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is only as a ghostly shadow of what might have been when life was full of poetry and intensity of feeling . In both sexes probably the period between the ages of fifteen and twenty.five is the time when marriage would best satisfy the wants of nature and the desire for happiness . This is the romantic period . There is also common with young people of the sensitive class a morbid loneliness , which the companionship of marriage would be most happily fitted to satisfy . But as it now is , marriage is deferred to the critical age . There is no longer that abandon , enthusiasm , absorption in another which would have been possible in early years . The beautiful romance connected with the sexes , has become at least partially dimmed . Then a person in after life grows independent , self-reliant . The man or woman married at thirty or thirty-five feels the need of sympathy , companionship , but they no longer feel it so keenly as they did , nor is marriage so adapted to satisfy it . The truth is that in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought necessary in our modern life in the way of securing a position and competence , is in many cases so tedious , so beset with vexatious complications and postponements , that by the time we have gained the prize we have become in a measure indifferent to it , unfitted to enjoy it . Thus in life . How far distant is what we most desire ! How long and rough the ways which lead to it ! How many reach the goal , gain the prize , but it is at the expense of what is best within them ! The treasure is as costly and brilliant as ever , but it is a trembling hand which takes it , parched and feverish // lips to which the cup is raised , a languid and indifferent mind which is left to possess , and as best it may , enjoy . A last perplexity which shall be mentioned , is the conflict which exists between our best powers . We can understand why there should be a conflict between our higher and our lower nature , and can see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there should be an antagonism between powers and tendencies which seem equally excellent in themselves , is a strange and disheartening fact . For example , a life of thought , and a life of action , is each extremely desirable in itself . On the one hand , the intellect is one of the noblest of our endowments , exalted pleasure comes from its exercise , vast realms of knowledge , and unsolved problems , invite its activities . On the other hand , grand action appears equally important ; there is always a crying need for wise , generous deeds to be performed , grievous abuses to be corrected . But between these two kinds of lives there is commonly a conflict . It is only in the rarest instances that intellectual and practical ability are united , and if so , neither reaches a very high point of development . Our profound thinkers are not often men of action , or our men of action , men of thought . In the first place time is limited ; then there is something of a natural antagonism between reflection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draw more and more from the busy activities of life , and is gradually incapacitated , in a measure , from taking part in them . The interests and powers of the practical man do not conduce to pursuits and inquiries which are important , intellectually considered . Again , there is an oppositioti between mental and physical perfection . Each is , in itself , important . If the mind is a wonderful instrument , so is the body ; if the culture of the one is desirable , so is that of the other . But while these powers , up to a certain degree of develo.pment , aid each other , the perfection of each involves the subordination and partial neglect of the other . Between the intellectual and affectional nature , the same conflict also exists . Both are necessary to a complete development . But the high culture of the intellect seems sometimes to deaden the affections : the high culture of the affections to confuse and mislead the intellect . Affection attaches // great importance to the individual . Thought sees in the individual only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insignificant . Affection gives a first place to good intentions . Thought , to wise methods . The uncultivated are often outspoken and unconventional in their sympathies and acts of endearment . The scholarly , as often , repress sentiment and consult proprieties . Our philanthropists are frequently persons of weak , perverted judgment . Our philosophers , absorbed in intellectual pursuits , forget the sufferings of humanity . Again , there is something of an antagonism between the devotional and the intellectual spirit . It is certain that faith gives increased grandeur and significance to life . It assures us of the existence of a wise and beneficent God , who hears prayer , and governs the world intelligently , of a future state of joy and holiness . And yet it is true that reason , while it can not in the nature of things , dogmatically deny these facts , feels no such assurance as does faith in regard to them . No purely logical arguments which can be adduced for the being , and providential government of a wise and good God , for the answering of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And here is a difficulty . Reason is undoubtedly one of the grandest of our attributes ; it seems a light from heaven , given to guide us in our darkness and difficulties , and yet it is by no means certain that its strictest and most conscientious use ( i. e. , by and in its*lf alone ) , will not make God , immortality , hypotheses ; life a poor , meaningless thing . It is not a matter of course that the sage will have a vaster conception of life and its consequences than the ignorant but trusting soul . The philosopher may have analyzed and systematized , only to find himself robbed of those illusions , deprived of those inspirations and hopes , which make life grand and beautiful to the more devout but less reflective mind . And of a faith which seems to be founded on fancy , yet makes existen3e vast , and a reason which seems to be founded on fact , yet makes life contemptible , which shall we choose ? A credulous faith , a paralyzing , narrowing reason , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will confess that the results of the strictest intellectual processes in regard to life and its issues , are but a poor exchange // for that poetry of existence which underlies the dreams and beliefs of the devotional . God , prayer , immortality may be , in the light of cold analysis alone , superstitions , but it is certain that reason has discovered no facts which have by any means so elevating and liberating an effect upon the spirit . It is not , indeed , asserted that one can not be , in a certain degree , intellectual and devotional also . But it is the natural tendency of thought to detract from that certainty which forms the life of the devotional spirit . Thus it would appear , not to add other examples , as if in the very citadel of our being there were disorganizing forces at work ; there is disease at the heart , mutiny in the camp . The forces which should be employed against a common enemy , in a common advance , jar and clash with each other , separate in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , is any satisfactory explanation of the perplexities mentioned possible ? It must be confessed , we think , that there is not . Few rays of light converge upon these problems . It is better to attempt no solution of difficulties than to offer an unsatisfactory one . This last is often done , but it is at the expense of intellectual integrity and permanent satisfaction . The existence of sin , pain , death , the success of the bad , the failure of the good , the providential government of the world , can not , as already intimated , be completely explained . Yet these are not wholly unintelligible . Sin may be disciplinary ; pain incidental to the decay of the physical ; death , disenthrallment ; the success of the bad , and the failure of the good , natural , and important to teach us wherein real success and failure consist ; the providential government of the world indispensable in the cultivation of patience and reverence . But neither philosophy nor religion relieves us in any great measure from the difficulties by which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preceding . Intellectually , they are in the main insoluble , and the supposition of a Supreme Being , while it affords comfort does not give the clew to the rational explanation of them , and it is certain that a denial of one does not remove them . We know not , in deed , what may be . Into the mind of some discriminating reader may flash , as he follows these thoughts , the revealing light , or // *ihe philosophic or religious reflection of the future may find the interpretation of these , as of other problems . All we can say is , that with our present knowledge and thought they remain enigmatical . The attitude of the mind toward problems of this order is , however , important . To the inquiry , " what good results from dwelling upon questions confessedly , profoundly mysterious , " it may be replied that there are mental conditions in which a decided effort of the will in calling the mind from gloomy subjects is undoubtedly possible and salutary . Then , although no satisfactory explanation can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be derived from a contemplation of them . For example ( not to re-state ) , from the first perplexity may be deduced the truth , that a reluctant yielding to necessary evil is better than an unconditional surrender . From the second , as already suggested , that painstaking and care are important . From the third , the vanity of human ambition , &amp;c . These truths , to be sure , are insignificant compared with the mysterious and depressing facts involved , yet they are not wholly worthless . To the inquiry , " must we conclude that life is for the worst , " it may be said , we should be careful how we judge of life or the universe , from a single , or even from a series of disheartening truths . While it must be confessed that a larger number of facts than we would wish take their place , on careful examination , in support of a pessimistic view of existence , yet deep in our hearts , in our best moods , we feel that optimism , not pessimism , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there is a vast amount of indisputable good in the world and in individual life-manifold sources of exalted happiness and improvement . The worst that can be said is that we live in a state of mingled good and evil . Certain facts are full of beauty , joy , and life-giving power . Other facts , of deformity and disheartening perplexity . We have not yet learned their reconciliation . Yet it is of the greatest importance , to keep firm hold of the optimistic view of life . Its practical effect on the mind and character is highly beneficial , while that of the opposite view , is , in almost every respect disastrous . The // intellect may be hopelessly bewildered in view of certain phenomena , it may even come to the conclusion , that , on the whole , the depressing facts of nature and life outweigh the joyful facts . Yet we can not give up the belief that all things will be found at last to " work together for good . " I would cherish this expectation , though without the direct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope amid the darkness and perplexities of life , as amid raging seas and howling winds the shipwrecked sailor clings to the rope thrown to save him . If this be called irrational , it is only irrational in the sense that the imagination and feelings assert their rights , and do not allow the intellect to tyrannize over them . Then there is relief in the thought of a future state , where these calamities may be removed , these problems solved . The supposition to be sure , as already intimated , explains none of those difficulties . But undoubtedly much serenity and patience come to the mind from this thought . Pain and mystery are none the less real , because transient ; but if they are soon to pass away we can the better endure them . " What hope of answer , or redress ? Behind the veil , behind the veil . " This is the only , the wise reply . We may avoid premature despair . We may patiently wait for the revelations of another world .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
