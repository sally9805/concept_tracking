THE ENGLISH WORKINGMAN 'S HOME . AND HOW HE PAID FOR IT . THE lowly thatched cottage of the English laborer has been much sung by poets : but when the Parliamentary Committee-man tried to find the house , he announced in bluebooks that the poet had described a cottage that never existed . The thatch was the harbor for vermin , the diamond windowpanes only shut out light and air , and the sheltering vine or tree sheltered dampness and decay . Within , the poet had numbered the family but had omitted to notice the two guests ) typhoid and consumption , who ever sat unbidden by the hearth-stone . At last , the shame of the Committee-man 's statistics worked a partial cure . The cottage was invaded by that modern gospel-bearer , the sanitary inspector . The absurd windows were righteously smashed , and the drainage was attended to . In fact , the cottage of the poet disappeared and a new workingman 's home took its place . Moreover , the former rent-paying tenant was invited to become his own landlord . Located @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ block *f eight houses designed for artisans and small traders . The houses are each two stories high , with a basement below and a garden in front . They have a front door and a large bay-window on the first floor , and two windows on the second floor . The roof has a gentle slope and is covered with slate , while the cornice is tastefully ornamented . Each door has a broad stone step before it ; the gardens are inclosed by neat railings and are well stocked with flowers , and , in front , is a brick sidewalk with a row of trees on the curb . As the street is upon a slope , the roof is broken between the fourth and fifth houses , and the fourth house has an ornamental gable with // gilded finials and a sign- " Alexandra Terrace . " The houses are all occupied , and there is an air of substantial comfort and even of elegance about the Terrace that is encouraging . If the outside is so neat , wholesome and artistic , the inside ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the sturdy children playing about , and the rosy matron at one of the windows , it would seem as if the modern English workman was happily housed . And these houses he has built himself and for himself ; for they make one of the many blocks erected by the Leeds Industrial Co-operative Society , already described in this magazine . But it is not every workingman who can live in a terrace , and we must leave this block to examine other and cheaper houses built by the same society . Located in the immediate neighborhood is a block of six houses , each two stories high , with an extension in the rear . They are 4.27 meters ( ii . feet ) wide , 7.93 meters ( 26 feet ) deep , and 6.40 meters ( 21 feet ) high , from sidewalk to eaves . The roof is of slate and the chimneys are finished in terra cotta ; in the rear is a small yard inclosed by a brick wall . The cellar is only half the size of the house , but is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The first floor has one door and a window , and there are two windows in the second story . The front door opens upon a hall-way having an inclosed stair-way leading to the two chambers above . A door in the hall opens directly into the kitchen , which occupies the entire first floor ; and in the extension are a " scullery " and a closet . From the scullery there is a door leading into the yard and in the yard is a sunken pit for ashes . The inside of the house is neatly plastered and finished , and water is brought into the kitchen from the street , while gas is taken all over the house . The house is thoroughly drained , and is substantial , warm , and in a sanitary sense , safe . For heating , there is a range in the kitchen and an open grate in one of the chambers . A bath-room can be built in one of the chambers , or in a bay over the extension , if wanted . The house is open to the front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workman once lived in and the London tenement he still lives in , or compared with a New York tenement , it is luxury itself . It cost * io shillings . The tenant pays no rent . The society built it for him and he is paying for it in installments of about 5 shillings and 5 pence per week . There are also the ground rent , rates , taxes and insurance , but these will vary with the location , and in no case will they be burdensome. * This is the cheapest kind of house ever erected by such societies . It is just enough for man and wife , with perhaps a child or two , and it is quite enough for shelter , comfort , decency and health . It is hardly possible to imagine anything cheaper , and nothing less will satisfy the sanitary inspector . In other parts of Leeds we may see every grade of house from this up to the Alexandra Terrace . The usual pattern is represented by a two-story house of brick , with a yard in the rear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually have a cellar under the whole house , a sitting-room , kitchen , scullery and closet on the first floor , and three chambers above , and the cost will range from 150d0 250 pounds , according to the finish and ornamentation . THE BUILDING COMMITTEE . WHEN co-operative societies were first started it was not thought that they would do more than supply groceries , coal , etc. , to the members . As some of the stronger societies advanced in membership and capital , they undertook other matters , including house-building . So we find that the " Leeds Industrial " has a building committee , whose duty it is to erect-out of the funds of the society-such houses as may be in demand , and to sell the same at cost to their members . This committee is elected by the members at some general meeting , and has full control of the purchase or rental of the land , the purchase of material and the erection of the buildings . The society votes a fixed sum , estimated to be sufficient for the number of houses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judicious expenditure . A number of persons , members of the society , apply to the committee for assistance in procuring houses . The applications are all heard , and if possible they are grouped together so as to bring the houses into blocks , and thus save expense . However , if the member wishes , he can have a single house of any design he may desire and is willing to pay for ; and in every case the wants of each one are consulted as far as is consistent with economy and the best interests of all concerned . The applications having been adjusted , the committee calls // for ten per cent . of the estimated cost of each house , and the members pay this in cash , or give good security for the money . This done , the committee proceeds to erect the houses , finishing each as nearly as may be in accordance with the wishes of the future owners . When finished , the committee declares the houses tenantable and the purchaser takes possession , and from that date begins to pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest thereon , in quarterly installments . The amount of this installment is adjusted by tables prepared by an actuary , so as to bring the payment of the whole within a fixed number of years . The usual rate for such payments is three pounds five shillings per quarter , which includes principal and interest . In case security is given instead of cash for the first payment , the security is held by the committee till a certain portion of the cost is paid up in money . These payments may be anticipated to any extent , and in default of payments by reason of sickness , the committee has power to grant a release of three months for every ten per cent . of the cost that has been paid . This , for people who depend upon their labor for their support , prevents hardships , and enables the society to " lend a hand " to its unfortunate members . If the anticipations of payment are large the committee may allow interest on the money , and in no case can the installments be called for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society for the services of its committee , each purchaser pays , in addition to the installments , a sum not exceeding five shillings per annum for " working expenses . " The purchaser also pays the ground rent , rates and insurance ; and if the society pays the ground rent to the owner , he pays the society the rent and one shilling extra for the accommodation . For neglect of payment of installments there is a fine , and if the neglect continues , fines are added every two weeks till the fines and interest amount to one-fifth of the cost of the hopse , when the society may use legal measures to collect the dues . If the purchaser fails altogether to comply with his agreement with the society , the committee can evict him and take the property ; and after deducting all charges , may return the money he may have paid , without interest , at the end of six months . Simple provisions are also made for the sale or transfer of the house at the death of the member , or to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen that such societies as this do a vast deal of good in this way , and provide hundreds of houses for people who could not perhaps obtain them in any other manner . The cooperative society at Oldham is reported to have erected over three hundred dwellings for its members , and this at Leeds and many others have done as well or better . BUILDING AND INVESTMENT SOCIETIES . THE co-operative societies of Great Britain have done much to give the British workman a good home ; but their efforts have been far exceeded by the societies known as building and investment societies . The name , building society , is misleading . Such societies in England , like those in this country , are really banks and loan associations . They do not erect buildings , and consequently we need not pause to examine the houses put up through their agency , because they have no voice in the matter , and the houses are only expressive of the taste and ability of the people who live in them . They are generally very much like the houses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stone houses in blocks , and having from five to ten rooms each , with such conveniences as can be afforded or as the local inspector of buildings may dictate . While the building societies of Great Britain have a common aim , they differ somewhat in matters of detail . Many have only a limited membership and small means ; others are very wealthy , have expensive and elegant offices and abundant capital , and count their members by thousands . The original plan upon which they were all founded was known as the " terminable system . " This is now obsolete , and may be briefly mentioned to show the general idea that still underlies them all . One hundred persons wishing to build , formed an association and agreed to contribute ( say ) one pound each every month . The first payment having been made , roo ballots were put in a box and one was drawn . The fortunate holder was then entitled to the hundred pounds , and with the money he bought or built a house , gave a mortgage to the society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ installments . At the next meeting the ninety and nine had another ballot , and thus the society proceeded till it was terminated by limitation . Naturally enough , such a system was wholly unsatisfactory , since it was founded on chance . Some members paid regularly each month for years , and // failed to get a house . Heavy fines were added for neglect of payment , and there was no interest paid on the investments . Balloting for the money was tried with no better success ; and lastly , the money was put up at auction , precisely as is now done in what is known as the " Philadelphia system . " This , too , was finally given up , and out of these terminable societies grew the modern perpetual societies , having all the advantages of the others and none of their disadvantages . The modern building societies of Great Britain differ widely in amount of capital and in membership , but all have a common aim and the same general plan of operation . Such a society commonly consists of two classes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say ) 25 , and earning interest at ( say ) 7 rer cent . per annum , and members holding subscribing shares , " on which they are paying monthly installments of two shillings and sixpence , and receiving interest at the rate of 6 per cent . Besides these there are simple depositors who merely lend their money , subject to call , to the society , and for which they are paid interest at the rate of perhaps * per cent . The first two classes make the real members of the society , who have each one vote in the election of officers , and are each lhible for the society 's debts to the extent of their shares . The depositors , on the other hand , have neither control nor liability . There is usually no entrance fee , and very often there are no fines for neglected payments . If the subscriber seriously neglects his dues he is simply permitted to withdraw . He is an undesirable member and his money is returned to him without interest and his account is closed . Regular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a month 's notice , returning their books and papers , and paying a small fee for the adjustment of the accounts . If the member needs the money at once , or if several wish to withdraw at once , their claims are heard and adjusted in this order : - first , depositors , then the claims of deceased members , and lastly the paid-up and subscription shares . If at any time a member holding a paidup or subscription share wishes to buy or build , he calls upon the secretary and enters his name on a " list of applications , " describes the property he offers as security , and pays a fee to cover the expense of surveying the property . The directors then appoint a committee to examine the proposed security . If their report is satisfactory , the member takes up as many subscription shares as may be needed to cover the sum wanted , the money is immediately advanced to him and the papers are signed and exchanged . The shares he may already hold go so far to cover the debt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monthly installments . In adjusting the ratio at which these installments are to be paid , reference is had to tables prepared by an actuary . The member selects any table he pleases , pays large or small sums , extinguishes the debt quickly or slowly , as is most convenient ; but in all cases the rate is rigidly fixed by the tables , and by reference to them all disputes are instantly settled and both the borrower and the society may ascertain at any moment just the amount paid and the balance due . If he wishes , the borrower may at any time change his rate of payment and adjust his installments to another table that in turn becomes the standard of reference in settling his claims . *AY5 AND MEANS . IN such a society the deposits and the money received for paid-up and subscribing shares make the chief part of the capital . To these may be added the interest , the repayments , and the fines and fees . The payments include the interest , the advances , and the shares and deposits withdrawn . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent . of the capital employed . The secretary is paid a shilling a year on each share , and the directors receive various sums according to agreement , and usually get less than five per cent . of the profits . The profits come from the difference in interest paid by the borrowers and that paid to some or all of the lenders . Though this is small it is sufficient , as the society pays very small salaries and a smaller rent . All the legal expenses incurred are paid by the borrower , and the subscriber and depositor have no expenses whatever . In dividing the profits the society takes one half , which it holds in the form of a contingent fund , and the other half is divided among all the members according to their interest in the concern . It may here be noticed , that while the subscribers must pay their installments on a fixed day , the borrower may call for an advance at any time , and if his security is approved may get the money without delay . // To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advance required , it must have access to more capital than it may have in hand . To do this , the society takes its securities to any regular bank , and borrows the money it wants upon them . This it can do as often as it wishes , or up to two-thirds of the total value of its assets . For this accommodation the society pays the bank a small fee , which is charged to the person requesting the advance . On the redemption of any of its mortgages , or on the payment of any of its dues , deposits , or installments , the money borrowed of the bank may be restored in whole or in part . Interest is paid to the bank for the time the money is out , and as this is less than the interest charged to the borrower , the society makes a small margin on the transaction . This account with the bank gives the society an elasticity and freedom of action that are invaluable . It can always meet the demands of its borrowers , and it thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ borrower wishing to build and the capitalist . The bank knows nothing of the small housebuilder . The society it recognizes as a safe and reliable institution . Besides this , the society in its original capacity collects and makes available the small savings of the laborer and artisan , and enables him to erect and become master of his own house . Such societies are usually governed by a president , secretary , treasurer , and a number of trustees and directors , each elected annually by all the members . Each member has one vote , and one only , without regard to his interest in the association . Like all savings institutions , they are liable to a panic among their depositors ; but this rarely happens , as the business is plain , above board , an ( l easily understood ; the expenses are low , and the security is of the best . This sketch is not designed to describe any particular building society , but to give the general plan on which all are founded . Some of these societies are very small , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " Birbeck " of London , and the " Provincial " of Leeds , occupy costly and spacious offices , and do a large and profitable business . Some of the Scottish societies admit another class of lenders ,  --  capitalists who invest for the sake of the resulting profits . The shares of these societies are regularly quoted in the stock market , and while they do much to help the British workman to put up a decent roof-tree , they resemble jointstock companies more than building socie ties . In all , there is , however , the same general idea . ENGLISH AND AMERICAN PRACTICE . THE English building societies were originally started for political purposes . They were intended to make " householders , " and householders were voters . They indeed made voters , but they did so much good in other directions that they survived and outgrew their original design , and their present aims are identical with those of the building associations of this country . Now , while the building societies of England and this country have a common aim ,  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it may be worth while to see wherein the difference lies . In this country the building societies are conducted upon one nearly uniform plan , and have an average capital of about $*o , ooo , and a membership of from two to four hundred . In England the societies range from one hundred to five thousand members each , and hold capital of from one thousand to five hundred thousand pounds . The majority , like our own , have no building , and meet in hired halls or in private houses ; but a few of them own costly buildings equal to the most expensive structures erected by our savings banks . In our societies there are but two classes . of members ,  --  the lenders and borrowers . The lenders join the society by paying one dollar for every share they take up , and agreeing to repeat this payment each month ; and the money thus collected makes the capital of the society . Some societies may take money on deposit , but this is not commonly recognized , and the lenders really provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ultimate value of $200 is reached , nor are tables prepared whereby the subscriber may learn their value at any desired month . The English system is more complicated , more liberal and more exact . It has three sources of income , three classes of persons who provide the capital , and it uses its assets to makeits capital available . It has paid-up shares or fractions of shares , and subscription shares , and it has deposits left on short notice , or , practically , on call . The member may buy a share or fraction of a share for a fixed sum , may pay two shillings and sixpence a week , or ten shillings a month for one or more years , and he may stop payment when he has paid up any fifth part // of a share . He may change his rate of payment , raise or lower it , make it fast or fdow , make advance payments or withdraw at any time ; and by the aid of the actuary tables , he may see at any time just exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wishes an advance upon a house consults the papers to see when the next meeting of the nearest society is held , and if he can find one convenient he visits a hall , and finds a number of people eager and anxious to get the few thousands the society may have to let . They resort to an auction , and bid against each other for the money . The premium runs as high as 32 per cent. , and if he has the courage to bid so high for the thousand dollars he wants , he gets it , less the premium . He wants one hundred cents on a dollar , and he gets only sixty-eight ; but there is no other course , and he accepts the situation , and pays down five dollars for the five shares that entitle him to the loan , and then gives the location of his property . The society , through its officers , examines his security , and if all is correct , he has the VOL . XIJJ. - 23. money in a few days , less the premium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rebate on the premium , but in any case he must submit to a deduction . The Englishman wishing an advance calls on the secretary of a society , at his house or office , offers his security , and pays a fee of twenty-one shillings for the survey expenses , and if the society is satisfied with his proposal he gets the money within a few days or hours without drawback of any kind . A table is then given to him , and he selects the rate at which he will pay back the money ; the papers are signed , and that is the end of the whole matter . Concerning the profits made by the English and American societies , the advantage is decidedly with the latter . The interest and the premiums paid on the loans combine to swell the profits rapidly in our societies . The English societies have the interest paid by the borrowers , and the difference between this and the interest paid to the lenders makes the only profit . It is true the borrower also pays a part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IN SHAFTESBURY PARK . // Our societies pay no interest to the lenders , but divide each year all the profits , whatever they may be , between borrowers and lenders alike . The shares in our societies , by reason of the large premiums paid by the borrowers , reach their ultimate value at a more rapid , but more uncertain rate . The English share-holder has only to look at his tables to see the slow , safe , and steady growth of his certificates , and he may find their value at any given date with absolute precision . The American seldom knows exactly what his shares are worth , and is only sure of the matter once a year , when the annual report says they are worth so much , or that the society is willing to pay so much for them . If for any reason he must withdraw , he can get his money at the society 's valuation , which is always much less than the estimated value of the share . SALTAIRE . THE valley of the Aire is one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tourist , the Airedale industries are among the largest in Yorkshire , and the little city that stands on a bill overlooking the river and dale is the most famous " model town " in the world . Saltaire takes its name from its founder , Sir Titus Salt , and from the river , and is already familiar to both English and American readers . The manufacturing plant belonging to the house of Sir Titus Salt &amp; Company stands on the river Aire and the Leeds and Liverpool Canal , a short distance from Shipley and Bradford . It is one of the largest establishments in England , and gives employment to between two and three thousand persons . To enable this industrial army to live in health and comfort in the immediate neighborhood of the works , the founder of the house , Sir Titus Salt , laid out and built the town of Saltaire . Now since this town is owned by the firm , its inhabitants being only their tenants , it is interesting to see what people of means and culture think the British workman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing to say concerning the erection of his house . He is only a tenant in it , and for the moment we may forego the consideration of its cost and payment , in looking at it as a house and home . The town of Saltaire covers about 13 hectares ( 26 acres ) , and is laid out into twenty-one streets , four places and four main roads , and includes eight hundred and seven dwelling-houses and forty-five alms-houses , all affording shelter for over four thousand people , at an average of five ' and a half persons to a house . Besides the town , there is a park of seven hectares ; and this , with the mills , dining-hall , and other buildings , makes a total of about 20 hectares ( * acres ) in the entire estate . The railway leaves the visitor at a pretty station , sunk deep in a cutting crossed by a. handsome bridge , and fringed with trees . and shrubbery . Over the trees , on the right , can be seen the tops of a neat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large building used as a public dining-hall , while above the bridge towers the enormous mass of the mills . On reaching the street , one enters a broad and handsome road leading into the town on the right , and the park and open country to the left . Opposite are the mills , surrounded by gardens planted with shrubbery and flowers , and a short disFACTORY SCHOOLS AT SALTAIRE. // tance to the left , and facing the mills , is a fine stone church . Beyond the church are the river and the park , the latter liberally provided with cricket and pleasure grounds , and free to all the people . Adjoining the railway is a public dining-room , where every day at noon a thousand or more of the working people are provided with a good dinner at a trifling charge . As many of the families in Saltaire send every member into the mill , this dining-room is an immense advantage , as it saves the cost and trouble of preparing a meal at home , and saves the time spent in going and coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charity , for there is a regular price-list , precisely as in any restaurant . This main street , called " Victoria Road , " crosses the railway and enters the town , and is the business thoroughfare . It contains all the stores , including a branch of the Leeds Industrial Co-operative Society , the schools , the alms-houses , the hospitals , and the Saltaire Institute . From this street open the others , every one solidly built up with neat and substantial buildings , paved , drained , and provided with ample walks . The houses are of a nearly uniform pattern , two stories in height , and provided with every modern appliance , including excellent arrangements for ventilation . They include at least two rooms on the first floor , with offices in the rear , and three chambers on the second floor . Every house has a good cellar , with a generous garden in the rear , and some of the houses also have a flower-garden in front . There are also allotment grounds where the tenants may cultivate garden vegetables . At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a more expensive character , intended for the " over-lookers " ( foremen ) , and designed to break the monotony of the blocks , and to produce an agreeable variety in the architecture . Everywhere , through street after street , one finds the utmost quiet , neatness , and order . Solidity , permanence and comfort seem to be carefully considered in every block , and not a single house is objectionable , as far as the outside is concerned . Though very small , the place is compactly built up , and is really a city , though its outer rows of houses face the open fields , and nearly every street has a vista of the country . This gives the town a most peculiar atmosphere , a mingled breath of pure air blowing over daisy-checkered fields and " the sweet security of streets . " Even the mills and gasworks are thoughtfully placed at the east of the town , where the smoke may be blown away by the prevailing westerly winds . On the Victoria Road stands the factory schools erected by the firm ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the national schools these buildings have been devoted to other public uses , but they serve admirably to show the architecture of the place . Besides the schools there are a number of public wash-houses and baths , open to all on the payment of a small fee , and a large and handsome structure devoted to the Saltaire Jnstitute , and containing a fine library and lecture-hall , with ample rooms for science , French , and other classes . Close to the Institute is a Sunday-school building , built in the summer of 1876 , and probably the best thing of its kind ever erected . Near the southern end of Victoria Road is an open square surrounded by handsome stone cottages . These are the hospitals and alms-houses erected by the firm for the benefit of persons injured in the mills , and of pensioners who have worked for the house for a certain number of years . Near by is a Wesleyan Chapel , erected by the people on land presented by Sir Titus . In this town live in comfort , health , and sobriety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a living . They pay from three and sixpence to eight and sixpence a *week rent , according to the size of the house . All the rest is free , or very DOOR-WAYS , SHAFTESBURY PARK . nearly so . There are no liquor-shops in the place , and there are ample facilities for health , cleanliness , recreation , and education ; and it is small wonder that the people of Saltaire make one of the best communities of work-people in England , and that , com // pared with neighboring towns , they show a decided gain in thrift , health , and temperance . What does the British workman think of this house erected with such magnificent liberality ? Does Saltaire pay ? It may be presumed that he likes it , for the place seldom has so much as an empty room . In one sense it may not pay , because the rents only cover the interest on the houses , and the streets , the park , the drainage , the charitable institutions and the church are practically a gift . In the opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the writer , Saltaire has paid abundant interest . It attracted to the works a superior class of workers , and has kept them for years . Still , it had not done all that might be expected . A majority of the people seemed to appreciate what had been done for them , but many seemed to consider all these benefits a matter of course , and almost to demand their continuance . Very few ever showed any disposition to do any more work in consideration of the superior homes that SPECIMEN OF BETTEE LLASS OF HOUSE , SHAFTESBUEY PANE . were provided for them , and all were exacting in regard to " time " and wages . They all work steadily and diligently , and appear to be careful and economical of power , time and material ; part of this may arise from the fact that they work " by the piece ; " yet the fact remains that the firm has obtained a temperate , permanent and valuable company of workers , and in that sense Saltaire has been a paying investment . It has also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firms , greatly to the advantage of both masters and men . THE sHAFTESBuRv PARK ESTATE . THERE are two ways of helping people to give them something they need , or to sell it to them at a low price . The first is the workhouse plan , admirably designed to create paupers . The other is the wiser plan , and the one on which the building societies are based , for they seek to supply the greatest of all wants  --  a home . Still , these societies do not and can not provide all with homes . They demand prudence and economy on the part of their members , and in these qualities the British workman is not strong . Saltaire and its many imitations help even the improvident to a good home at reasonable rates ; but they do not permit him to own it . So it happened that there sprang up building associations of another form ,  --  jointstock companies , owned and managed by rich people for their own benefit . Such companies erect , rent and sell dwellings of the best kind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the same time . The tenants and purchasers furnish no money as capital , have no control of the business , and no liability ,  --  they merely get a good house at low rates . Chief among such companies in England is the " Artisan 's , Laborer 's and General Dwellings Company , limited , " of London . The capital of this company is reported at fr , ooo ,  - -  000 , held in ten-pound shares , and its estates and dwellings in various parts of London and in other cities enable it to pay six per cent . interest on all the capital thus far expended . The business affairs of this company need not here be described , as its manner of building , renting and selling the houses is of more immediate interest . On the Surrey side of the Thames , near Battersea , is a new city ,  --  in London , and yet very different from the London known to Aiierican tourists . It occupies a large lot of land just north of Wandsworth Road , reaching to the embankment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ containing fourteen streets and one thousand and thirty-two houses . This is the Shaftesbury Park Estate , valued at about ? 297,000 and held by this company . Its management is one of the most interesting efforts ever made to give the British workman a really good and cheap house . The streets are straight and wide , macadamized throughout // and shaded with trees . The houses are of stone and brick , neat , home-like , comfortable and cheap . Every one has a garden in front , with a large yard in the rear . All are occupied , and altogether they shelter 6 , ooo men , women and children in health and safety . The death-rate in London is 22 in 1,000 ,  - -  in this city , within London , it is only i 2 in 1,000 . The moment one enters the clean and quiet streets , the attention is drawn to a number of features not commonly seen in cities . In the first place , each street is complete in itself , as if one plan had been followed in erecting the houses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same through all the streets ; but each street is treated separately , and with a view to variety and artistic effect . The long lines of eaves and roofs are broken by gables and towers , and the windows , doors and porches are varied in a pleasing and yet inexpensive manner . At convenient distances on the corners are shops and halls for public meetings . Some of these are designed for co-operative stores , and others for private dealers ; but in no instance are liquor-shops to be found within the limits of the estate . On the streets one meets well-dressed and apparently well-to-do working-people . Here is a jolly company of hearty children just loose from school ,  --  living testimony of the healthfulness of the town . Yonder a man is tending one of the gardens , and there a young girl is cutting roses from the luxuriant vines that trail over her door . There are flowers everywhere in the greatest abundance , and every patch of garden is a new conceit in horticulture . Within , the houses are supplied with every convenience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save the very cheapest are supplied with bath-rooms . The first floor usually contains a hail with stairway , a living-room , with one or two windows on the street , a kitchen , a scullery and a closet in an extension in the rear . On the second floor are three or more chambers , according to the size of the house . Every room is also provided with a ventilator in the wall , communicating with the hall or with the chimneys . There are no cellars and no drains under the houses , the drains being all laid in the yards in the rear , and only reaching the street at the ends of the blocks . The foundations and floors being laid in heavy cement , the rooms are perfectly free from dampness and decay .
