ARTICLE IX. - THE NEW PHiLOSOPHY OF WEALTH . PRACTICAL wisdom was never more in demand than at present . Questions concerning currency , free-trade , taxation , etc. , are demanding and receiving the attention of Political Economists , and it is in this part of their science that the attractive fields lie both for the writer and the reader . The period of radical and irreconcilable diversity in the fundamental principles of the science seems to be past ; the so-called " Mercantile Theory " exists no longer among scientists ; the school of the " Physiocrats ' has passed away , and a period of relative unanimity , in thought if not in language , appears to have arrived . If it be true , however , that this unanimity is , at best , only relative , and that even a small amount of obscurity and inconsistency hangs over those fundamental conceptions the clear apprehension of which is essential to all reasoning on the subject , then the removal of never so small a proportion of that obscurity may shed more light on practical questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the present state of the public mind financial heresies receive a ready circulation , and , if these false doctrines connect themselves , in any way , with fundamental errors of Political Economy , it is time that those errors were exposed and their teachers discredited . Those practical questions on the solution of which the prosperity of the nation so largely depends can not be satisfactorily solved without the clear apprehension of correct principles . Nothing can be more fundamental , in the science of Political Economy , than the conception of Wealth . John Stuart Mill , the legitimate successor of Adam Smith , has given the whole weight of his wide-reaching authority to some of the most mischievous errors of his great predecessor . While his definition of wealth presents nothing peculiar , his application of the definition is positively erroneous and inconsistent with the logical consequences of the definition itself . He has classed as wealth some things which do not possess the very attribute of " exchangeable value " which he states as essential , and he has // excluded from the classification things which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be states or implies them . His conception of wealth has obliged him to revive the pernicious classification of labor , as productive and unproductive , and expressly to exclude from the ist of productive laborers such persons as " the actor , the musical performer , the public declaimer or reciter , and the showman ; " also " the army and navy , the legislator , the judge , and the officer of justice . " On the other hand , a school of writers under the leadership of M. Bastiat , while recognizing the evil resulting from Mr. Mill 's classification , have found no other remedy for the evil than that of abandoning the conception " wealth " as the subject of the science and substituting the plausible but ambiguous and delusive conception " services . " Few recent writers have steered clear of both these errors ; a majority bear the marks either of Scylla or of Charybdis , and an open and obvious channel between them would be a boon to all who traverse these regions . It is not promised for this essay that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will remove for its readers all obscurities and the difficulties that hang about the conception wealth , though it has measurably accomplished this for its author . It is offered as furnishing a conception of wealth which renders the classification of all labor as productive , both possible and obvious , and , if it prove to be correct , it renders it easy to place every variety of laborer in exactly that class of wealth-producers where , from the nature of his function , he belongs . Political Economy has for it subject the nature and the laws of wealth . Whether avowed or not , this is the real subject of every treatise on this science , and its recognition and exact definition are essential to clearness and accuracy in the detailed discussion . The distinctive attributes of wealth are indicated by the derivation and historical use of the term . The Saxon " weal* ' indicated a condition of relative well-being , the state of having one 's wants relatively well supplied . No possession common to all men can . constitute this relative well-being ; the things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not by others . The free enjoyment of air and sunlight constitutes absolute but not relative well-being , and // only that which , besides satisfying wants , is capable of appropriation can produce this relative condition . The term wealth , as now scientifically used , indicates those things the possession of which constitutes the state of relative well-being , and its distinctive attributes are want-satisfying capacity , or utility , and appropriability . These distinctive attributes of wealth have long been recognized as such , but the logical consequences of this definition have not , it is believed , been fully realized . Mr. Mill and his school , as has been said , excluded from their classification things which possess these attributes and include some which do not . They recognize as wealth only those things which are sufficiently substantial and durable to constitute a more or less permanent possession , things which would appear on the inventory if society were suddenly to cease producing and consuming and devote itself for , say a month or two , to taking an account of stock . It will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attribute of wealth . Durability is a factor of value and determines , in so far , the measure of wealth in any particular product . But products are of all degrees of durability and there is no ground for excluding any product from the conception of wealth on the ground of this simple difference of degree . Even the school of writers referred to would not hesitate to class the ices of the confectioner in the same category with the stone wall of the mason , though they are at opposite extremes in the scale of ( lurability . They would , however , exclude music from the conception , on the ground of its immediate perishability and its apparently insubstantial character . It is maintained in this discussion that , in that which constitutes wealth , there is no difference other than one of degree be*w. en music and a stone-wall ; that both possess the essential attributes of wealth , want-satisfying capacity and appropriability , and that the difference in their durability is only a factor of their relative value . On the other hand , this school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they differ from it in kind and do not possess its essential attributes . They are not a possession ; that implies externality to the possessor . They are what he is , not what he has . Popular thought and speech broadly distinguish the able man // from the wealthy man . A man has a potential fortune , not an actual one , in his abilities . The term itself indicates a state of being able and implies a possibility , not an attained result . Labor creates wealth , and acquired abilities are potential labor . They are to be regarded as the potentiality of the human factor of production , and it introduces an element of confusion into the science to class them with the completed product . Appropriability , iP the broad sense in which the term is used in our definition , implies that a thing should be free to be owned by any one of various individuals under the necessary conditions . The term implies that one man may become the owner of something previously without ownership or in the ownership of another , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as possessing this essential attribute which is an inseparable part of one man s being . This error is widesprea ( i and appears in the works of some of Mr. Mill 's opponents . As acute a writer as J. B. Say* characterizes acquired talents as " a species of wealth , notwithstanding its immateriality , so little imaginary that , in the shape of professional services it is daily exchanged for gold and silver . " The illustration is its own best answer . Talents are not exchanged and can not be so , and they lack the attribute of " exchangeable value , " which Mr. Mill himself states as essential . Their product only is transferable and that alone is a commodity . It will hereafter be shown that the human effort which creates a product calls into exercise activities physical , mental , and moral . If the talents which create wealth are to be confounded with the wealth which they create , every talent and activity acquired by effort , involving , in practice , the whole man , will have to be classed as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its practical effects . Man produces wealth and consumes it ; but man himself is always distinct from it . The condition of appropriation is a relation between commodities on the one hand and persons on the other , and implies , therefore , that both the commodity itself and the society where it exists should possess the attributes which render the relation of ownership possible . The commodity must not only exist in // limited quantity but it must be of a nature capable of appropriation. *fhe former or quantitative attribute is the only one usually mentioned as necessary in works on this subject . At . mospheric air is inappropriable from its unlimited quantity . Summer showers are in limited quantity but are inappropriable from their nature . On the part of the society where the commodity exists something is also requisite in order that the relation of ownership may subsist . The attributes of society which render ownership possible are , it is believed , usually ignored altogether in treatises on this subject . The existence of these attributes is secured only by the labor of a distinct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persons can not be apprehended without noticing the attributes which they impart to society and to the wealth which exists in society . In order that the essential attribute of wealth , appropriability , may be realized , the rights of property must be recognized and enforced either by personal prowess or by the agency of legal functionaries . In the earlier stages of society the enforcement of the rights of property is largely performed by the producer in person , greatly to the detriment of production . After division of labor has been developed this enforcement of rights is committed to particular persons , officers of justice , who perform this office for society as a whole . Moreover , the recognition and definition of rights is as important as their enforcement , and the legislator as well as the sheriff is , therefore , instrumental in producing that social condition which is necessary in order that the attribute of wealth , appropriability , may be realized . Legislators and officers ofjustice are , therefore , wealth producers . They impart to the commodities of the society which employs them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in society and may possess any degree of utility ; they may even be appropriable , as far as they are themselves concerned ; but if social causes in the society where they exist prevent their attaining the state of appropriation , they lack , in fact , the attribute of appropriability , and are not actual wealth . The production of social modifications which result in giving to commodities the attribute of appropriability is the function of legislative and judicial labor as far as it concerns property . It is as truly a wealth-creating function as the direct production of useful commodities . // Concerning this important class of laborers much misconception has existed . Mr. Mill , repeating the error of Adam Smith , classes them as " unproductive . " M. Bastiat and M. Gamier term their efforts " services , " but offer no satisfactory substantive conception of anything as a product of their labor . M. J. B. Say , one degree nearer to the truth , classes them as producers , on the ground that they enable the industrial classes to give their undivided efforts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their products . This indirect mode of proving any class of laborers to be productive , though plausible and frequently employed , is extremely objectionable . Every class of producers contributes in this manner to the products of every other . The shoemaker contributes indirectly to the productions of the farmer by saving him the necessity of turning aside from his labor to mend shoes : yet he considers that the shoes and not a share in the farmer 's harvest are the direct product of his labor . In like manner the farmer contributes indirectly to the productions of the shoemaker by saving him the necessity of turning aside from his occupation to cultivate the ground ; yet the farmer regards his grain and not a share in the shoes as the product of his labor . A direct product must be exchanged if any class of producers is to share in the wealth created by another , and every class must have a direct product if they are to be classed as productive laborers . The direct product which legal officers offer in return for their support is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They put , as it were , the finishing touch to the products of society , which finishing touch renders them marketable wealth ; and this modification , which constitutes a difference between potential and actual wealth , is that which they exchange for their subsistence . If the term productive were to be taken in a narrow sense , as meaning not productive of wealth but productive of specific useful commodities , there would be ground for classing these laborers as unproductive , and this is the origin of the misapprehension concerning them that has existed from the time of Adam Smith to the present day . These classes are protective of useful commodities but are productive of wealth . All labor creates wealth ; yet in every form of wealth nature // furnishes the substance and man only the modes . It has been shown that one general class of laborers create the attribute of appropriability ; the other general class create the attribute of utility . The latter is invariably accomplished by producing modifications in natural agents external to the laborer . Industrial labor is always the applying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modification produced enables the agent to satisfy a want which it was previously incapable of satisfying . The labor confers a want-satisfying power on the agent . This wantsatisfying power is a " utility , " and , if the attribute of appropriability be also conferred , wealth is created . A natural agent possessing utility and appropriability is wealth , and this only is wealth . The natural agent need not be of a substantial or permanent character . Any substance , force or activity whatsoever of physical nature external to the laborer which receives a want-satisfying power by means of his efforts , appropriability being presupposed , becomes wealth , and , though its duration be momentary and its character insubstantial or iutangible , there is no ground for its exclusion from the category so long as it retains the above characteristics . Mr. Mill and his followers would call a violin manufacturer a productive laborer , but the artist who plays the violin an unproductive one . The violin would be called wealth ; the music , the sole end of its manufacture , not wealth . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an indirect one ; the latter is an instrument for producing that which satisfies direct desire . The direct want-satisfying product is , if anything , more obviously wealth than the indirect one . Relative durability and tangibility are non-essential attributes . The mechanic who makes the violin imparts utility to wood , the artist who plays it imparts utility to air vibrations . One product is peiceived by the senses of sight and touch , the other by the sense of hearing . One is extremely durable , the other extremely perishable ; but both alike come under our definition . In both a natural agent has received a utility through human effort ; both products are wealth and both laborers productive . So the sculptor imparts utility to marble , the painter to colors , the photographer to chemical agencies and solar light . The designer and mechanical draughtsman impart a high utility to a small amount of // plumbago , and the writer to a small amount of ink . No utility of a higher order is conceivable than that which the writer imparts to ink and paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capacity of conveying intelligence . A bridge across a stream renders an interchange oF products possible between dwellers on opposite banks . Previously each side produced for itself ; after the building of the bridge they produce j ) artly for each other , and to the great advantage of both . Two isolated societies become , by virtue of the interactivity caused by the bridge , one organism . The writings of an author are mind-bridges . They render an intei-change of mental products possible , as the bridge over the stream does of material products . Mental interactivities take place by means of the mind-bridge , as physical ones do by the ordinary bridge . Minds ae united in organic life by the one means of communication as bodily activities are by the other . If the writings of an author are a mind-bridge , the words of a speaker are a mindferry . As the ferry boat conveys the agricultural products of a farmer to the market , so the words of a public speaker , floating on air as a boat on water , convey his intellectual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The mason imparts utility to the stone of the bridge and the boat-builder to the wood of the boat ; the writer imparts a higher utility to ink and the speaker to sound . All are pro4uctive laborers : their products , in each case , are utilities imparted to natural agents and fall within our definition of wealth . It is obvious that , in literary and oratorical products , the utility imparted by the human effort vastly transcends the natural agent which is its substantial basis . The articulate sounds of the speaker are the ferry boat ; the ideas are the cargo , and the latter may exceed the former in value to an indefinite extent . In this case boat and cargo are a simultaneous product ; the boat is fitted , in form , to every different lading , and the two , as an industrial product , are inseparable . This illustration affords the most searching test of our definition of wealth . The thought , as existing in the mind of the speaker previous to its utterance in words , does not fall within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under appropriability , and it only acquires this attribute when it // attaches itself to the agent , the vocal sound . This apparently trifling agent transfers it from a simple activity to an industrial product . Again , with the consumers , the audience , the thought continues to exist or , at least , other thought induced by it does so ; but , after parting with its material vehicle , the sounds that convey it , it loses again the attribute of transferability and , thus , of appropriability in the broad sense , and becomes again a simple activity , not an industrial product . To again become an industrial product it must be freighted again on vocal sounds . Then only cau it be transferred from hand to hand , receive its price in the market , and , for the brief period of its duration , be entitled its place on the inventory of social wealth . As the widest range of application is given to the term natural agent , so an equally broad application must be given to the term labor . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire man , physical , mental , and moral , and there is no industrial product so simple and so purely material that these three elements of the human agency are not represented in it . In proportion as the intellectual element in the labor predominates over the physical , and as the moral element predominates over both , the product rises in the scale of respectability and of value . The labor of a stone mason involves a physical effort in the simple moving of materials , an intellectual effort in their skillful combination , and a moral effort in the conscientious use of proper materials and methods . The result of the physical effort is seen in the position of the materials that have been moved in the construction , that of the intellectual effort in their strong and tasteful arrangement , and that of the moral effort in the certainty that , in ways not obvious to the eye , the interests of the owner have been consulted by the builder , at his own expense , and that the wall is , in all respects , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , professional , and educational labor , the intellectual element , of course , predominates to an indefinite extent over the physical , and the moral element is greatly increased . The latter appears , in the labor of the writer , in his general truthfulness ; in that of the lawyer and the physician1 in their disinterestedness ; and , in all the more intellectual kinds of labor , in their general faithfulness and conscientiousness. ileliability is an attribute of the // product in each case , and the moral factor in the labor is that which produces this attribute in the product . The debated question whether moral qualities are paid for is thus simply and easily decided . The product is paid for ; reliability is an attribute of the product which determines its value , and the laborer who can produce a product having the attribute of reliability can secure the enhanced price of the product in the market . All labor is indirectly paid for ; its compensation is in the market value of its product , and , in so far as moral efforts are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as truly as other activities of the laborer . No activities of man , physical , mental , or moral , are paid for when not embodied in an industrial product , and it is of importance to remember that labor , as such , is not paid for . No employer takes pleasure in the sweat of his laborer 's brow ; he regrets it , and would willingly pay the same compensation to the same person if that particular product could be produced , by that person only , without effort . The product is the desired object in each case and the labor , apart from its product , is not paid for and is never a commodity , and nothing but confusion results from so viewing and treating it . The statement so frequently met with in works on Political Economy that " labor is a commodity and is governed by the same laws as other commodities " is one of the mischievous errors that still cling to the science . On the other band , light is shed on the question of the relative wages of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between capital and labor , and on many other similar questions , by bearing in mind the above simple distinction . In view of the constant presence of these three elements in labor , the physical , the mental , and the moral , any effort in the supposed interest of the working classes to depreciate mental labor in comparison with physical is unintelligent . All laboiis mental . To a large and controlling extent the mental element is present in the simplest operations . With the laborer who shovels in the gravel pit the directing and controlling influence of the mind predominates , to an indefinite extent , over the simple foot-pounds of mechanical force which he exerts . The latter could be better furnished by an ox . It would take certainly three stout men to exert as many foot-pounds of force // as a single ox , and if such a laborer is able to secure larger wages than the third part of the cost of the labor of an ox , he may place the difference to the credit of intellectual labor . The numerical estimate has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the superior physical form of the man . Whatever possesses want-satisfy ing capacity and appropria - bility constitutes wealth independently of the source from which it is derived . Its origin is unimportant in the classification and it may or may not be the result of human labor . In some instances it is not so . The original and indestructible properties of the soil are not the result of human effort , and recent German thought has demonstrated that they possess an original value , from limitation in quantity , independently of the increased value which results from their artificial improvement . The original forest trees , water powers , minerals , some wild game , and many other things owe the value which they possess to their want-satisfying capacity , and their appropriability , not to the mode of their origin . That origin is not labor . The measure of their value is determined , in an indirect and general manner , by labor . A man might be willing to give for one of these spontaneous products of nature the amount of labor which would prodnee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the measurer , not the originator , of their value , and even as a measurer is indirect and tardy in its operation . The doctrine that labor is the sole originator of wealth is , perhaps , the central doctrine in the system of Adam Smith , and it was an efficient instrument in his hands for combating the Mercantilists and the Physiocrats . It was accepted as a grand truth , as opposed to these pernicious systems , and it has served the purpose of a truth in the history of the science . It is , in fact , a grand error and the time has abundantly arrived for its critical examination and essential modification . Few statements are more common in text-books of Political Economy than the assertion that " nothing can constitute wealth which is not the product of labor . " As the statement stands it can only mean that every commodity classed as wealth must have actually been produced by labor . In this form it requires but a single illustration to refute it . The original and indestructible properties of land are wealth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is less erroneous to say that , though commodities may be produced by nature , their exchange value is the product of labor . A diamond accidentally discovered does not owe its value to any labor actually expended in its production , but it does owe the measure of its value to a calculation in the mind of the purchaser as to how much labor would be necessary in order to obtain another like it . The seller will demand and the buyer will give what would purchase a similar commodity . Actual labor is not the criterion but supposed labor or mental considerations relative to labor . Moreover a farther distinction must be made between the simple fact of exchange value and its quantitative measure . The mere existence of exchange value is not due even to supposed labor ; its quantitative measure only is so determined . The variety of human wants is sufficient , independently of labor , to render a commodity exchangeable , and thus , to create an exchange value . It is only when questions of quantity are considered and the measure of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measure of the exchange value of all commodities is determined indirectly , approximately , and tardily , by considerations relative to labor . So much only of this doctrine can be maintained . A few simple illustrations will sufficiently establish this point . Suppose a chance medical discovery were to create a demand for some plant previously valueless . The plant would have value immediately and would at once be exchangeable for something ; but , ignoring the additional value resulting from gathering it , its value in the field would not be traceable to any labor expen ( ied in its production . For a time it would be unknown how much labor would be necessary for its production , and during this time , neither the existence of its exchange value nor the measure of that value could be referred to considerations of laboi- . Only after a time would labor determine this measure . If labor were the talisman which turned everything to gold the slag of a blast-furnace should have value as well as the iron . The difference between them is in their utility , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utility on the slags and they would then constitute wealth as well as the iron ; but they would have been a product of labor // before they became wealth as well as after . The existence of their newly acquired value could not be referred to labor , and for a time , even its measure could not be so determined . Aside from questions of measure , wealth and value are traceable , not to labor , but to the want-satisfying capacity and the appropriability of commodities . While all wealth is not originated by labor , all labor originates wealth . Man toils not because labor necessarily precedes wealth , but because wealth necessarily follows labor . The possession of want-satisfying products is what the laborer seeks , and desire is the moving force in the whole process . Labor is not to be conceived of as the vis a tergo that pushes wealth forward ; but wealth is to be conceived of as the siren that lures labor onward . Wealth is always the cause of labor ; labor is not always the cause of wealth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the earth may be selfsubdued or it may he subdued by labor . Nature subjected and appropriated is wealth ; man 's subjection of nature is labor . Labor imparts want-satisfying powers , or utilities , to natural agents . These utilities are of four kinds , and the values in use resulting from them may be arranged in four coi-responding classes , namely* elementary value , form value , place value , and time value . New matter can not be created by man , but by chemical and vital changes in existing matter new material may be produced . The production of new material creates elementary value and this is predminently the province of the agriculturist . Mining involves some change of place in the ore , but the labor of discovering and freeing it from the super . incumbent earth is , prominently , a creating of elementary value , and mining should , in general , be classed with agriculture . Existing materials generally require changes of form to fit them for satisfying wants , and the utility conferred by these changes is form value . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a large extent , of the merchant . The forming of wool into cloth , of iron into tools , of wood into buildings , of stone into walls , etc. , are obvious illustrations . The subdivision of articles purchased in bulk to suit the wants of the consumer is to be regarded as the creation of form value . The man who desires only a pound of a particular commodity can afford to // pay for it at a higher rate than if he were compelled to purchase a supply greatly in excess of his needs . The adaptation of the quantity to his needs creates an actual utility to him and brings many enjoyments within his reach which would be otherwise unattainable . Subdivision creates form value and its reward is legitimate . A material in the requisite form may need removal to the proper place to enable it to satisfy wants . Transportation confers on commodities the utility of being where they are wanted and creates place value . This is obviously created when commodities are brought to the consumer , bat is not less truly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Place value lies in the relative position of consumer and commodity and both freight and passenger traffic produce it . The fact that it is relative and not absolute place which determines this utility distinguishes it from form value as in manufactures . Manufacturing processes can be resolved , in the last analysis , into changes of place . The carpenter moves shavings and chips from the wood which he is shaping . The mason locates brick and mortar in contact with one another . The woolen manufacturer locates fibres of wool and coloring matter in certain positions . All these changes of place are irrespective of the consumer and result only in giving form to the product , while place value requires a relative position of the consumer and the commodity . A material in the necessary form and place may not be so at the requisite time for satisfying wants . Ice in winter , agricultural implements out of season , and , in general , all commodities at a time when they are not wanted are obvious illustrations of products requiring this additional utility to fit them for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is wanted gives to a commodity the attribute of time value . The creation of this value is the office of capital , and the nature of capital does not come within the limits of this discussion ; but it is sufficiently obvious that time value results from human effort and abstinence . Its cieation is a chief function of the merchant and it is of inestimable benefit to his customers . If every consumer were obliged to keep on hand a supply of what he requires for sustenance and comfort during indefinite // periods of disuse the number of comforts which individuals could enjoy would be reduced to a minimum . The idle capital of society would be increased a hundred fold and the list of its comforts proportionately reduced . The creation of time value by the merchant is one of the most beneficent of human industries and its reward one of the most legitimate . These ntilities are all different varieties of value in use . Value in exchange signifies the quantity of commodities in general for which a particular commodity can be exchanged . To an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value in exchange signifies an indirect value in use . The farmer 's supply of grain possesses , through the medium of exchange , the capacity to supply his want of shelter , warmth , and various comforts and pleasures . Value in exchange is a purely relative attribute , as ordinarily viewed , and is determined by the law of demand and supply , the operation of which requires a separate and extended discussion . It is only necessary here to notice that light is thrown on the discussion of this law by recognizing that the nature of value in exchange is an indirect value in use and that the law of demand and supply rests , fundamentally , on the nature of man and the relative intensity of his wants . Having defined our conception of Wealth , Labor , and Value , it may be well to apply to the definition a few of the cases most difilcult of classification under prevailing systems . All artistic productions are creations of form value and differ from each other only in the different agents to which this utility is imparted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sculptor to marble , the painter to colors . The musician imparts form value to the natural agent sound , and the public reciter and speaker give a different kind of form value to the same natural agent . The teacher is a producer of form and place value , more especially of the latter . The confusion which arises from considering that the product of the teacher 's labor is found in the mind of the pupil has already been noticed . The pupil is not the natural agent which the teacher uses ; he is the consumer of that which the teacher produces , and , in practice , he , or others in his interest , pay the teacher for his product . The acquiring of instruction is the consumption of // intellectual nourishment , as eating is of bodily nourishment ; both are facilitated by the labor of attendants . The waiter at the table gives place value to food by placing it within reach of the person eating ; and so , in like manner , the teacher gives place value to the materials of education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As it would be absurd to say that the waiter and the cook found the product of their labors in a utility imparted to the body of the eater , so a similar absurdity exists in supposing that the teacher finds his product in the mind of the pupil . Both eating and learning are acts of consumption . They each result in a capacity to labor on the part of the consumer , but this capacity to labor is not to be confused with the product of labor ; it is the result of consumption . The waiter at the table creates as has been said , place value ; but , in the carving of meat , the cutting of bread , etc. , there is a certain creation of form value . The teacher 's labor is chiefly the production of place value , but there is , on his part , a certain carving and cutting process which gives form value . The intellectual cook is , generally , the author of the text-books which the teacher uses , but , in the higher stages of education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less united . It is unnecessary to state that any natural agent not originally wealth becomes wealth when it receives , through the agency of labor or capital , either of the four utilities above noticed . Air has place value when forced into a mine or a diving hell . Water has form value in a fountain , place value in a street hydrant or watering cart , and time value in the reservoir of a manufacturing village , where it is retained for use during the dry season . If there are any products which , at first glance , appear as exceptions , they are , on closer inspection , clearly seen to be illustrations of our definition of wealth . Some classes merit more extended consideration than is here possible , but it is believed that the above classification will be found to cover the whole field of industrial labor . Wherever human effort pro . duces commodities it will be found to be conferring one of these four values on a natural agent , or , in other words , to be subjecting nature . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is old and familiar enough to have well attracted // the notice of those who have ransacked the classics for frag " mentary and erroneous allusions to economic science . In the picture of the origin of society found in the book of Genesis man is first represented in the primitive paradisaical state , conscious of no artificial wants arid supplying his few natural wants from the gratuitous productions of tropical nature . He eats of the tree of knowledge , and , by this means , becomes conscious of his simplest artificial want and of the necessity of supplying it by making nature serviceable . He passes to the state of actual development , with the primitive paradise behind him and a restored paradise , as the ever receding goal of his progress , in the indefinite future before him , and it is here that the injunction is laid upon him , or the law is written within him , the fulfillment of which involves his whole economic development , the command , namely , to " replenish the earth and subdue it .
