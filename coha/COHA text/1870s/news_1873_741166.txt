txt A convention of more than usual importance will be held at Springfield , Ill. , to-day . It consists of farmers of that State , who come together to consult concerning the injury they are suffering from the railway ! companies . We have already pointed out the source of this injury . The farmers complain , in brief , of extortionate freights and unfriendly discrimination . It is impossible to say at this time what direction the action of the farmersmay take on this subject . But we may be perfectly sure that their sense of wrong and . their determination to redress it will not flash in the pan . They will not immediately find the remedy they are in search of , but they will not cease seeking it until they do find it . The certainty of their persistence is a guaranty of their final success . Their grievances are not of a sentimental character . They can not forget them . The man who , year by year , sees the product of his labor rotting before his eyes , and knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the railways , will not let the railways themselves slip out of his memory . Moreover , it must be remembered that the men who are engaged in this matter have a strength far beyond that of mere numbers . The last census estimated the number of persons engaged in all kinds of paid employments in this country at twelve and a hall millions , ( 12,505,923 . ) Of this total , about six millions , ( 5,922,471 , ) or nearly one-half , are engaged in agriculture . So , in numbers alone , the farmers are powerful . But . especially in the West , they have also intelligence , energy , and practical experience on their side . They are not a crowd of ignorant laborers , excited by fear and hatred of a new force in industrial life . They fully appreciate the value of the railways , the management of which they now criticise so severely . Moat of them have followed the roads in their westward movement , and have seen the effect of rapid transportation on the value of their own land . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either by direct subscription to stock , or by the more roundabout , but equally burdensome , method of local taxation . The farmers , therefore , know the subject they are handling sufficiently well to be in no danger of aiming to destroy or even to seriously cripple the railways . The strong point with the farmers is that the railway companies get all the powers they abuse from the representatives of the people . The companies are not , in any sense , independent owners of their franchises . So fair as they have made real investments of money , they are entitled to a fair profit thereon . But that is the absolute and . final limit of their rights in the premises . Their franchises are in every case substantially monopolies . Every road preshmably occupies the best route between its terminal points . Even if there were a legal right to build other roads at will between those points , the first company has always an advantage , and free competition is so far impossible . Where it is not rendered impossible by the preoccupation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of combination which , sooner or later , ensues , and which is sure to be the rule in the future . ' Such vast privileges as these imply responsibilities . They have not been given for nothing , but in trust . There is a reserved right in the people to enforce the conditions of the trust . The profits of railways are but compensation for administering those trusts . It was in the discretion of the people to give or withhold the original permission of incorporation . It ' is still within their sound discretion to determine the conditions on which the incorporated bodies shall proceed . It is noW proven that the people 's trustees have robbed those who trusted them . They have exacted extortionate rates for service . They have evaded the law . They have corrupted Legislatures . They have become unscrupulous and defiant . The movement of the farmers is the result of a determination on the part of the people to assert their original rights in the railways . There is no doubt that in the long run the determination will be carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
