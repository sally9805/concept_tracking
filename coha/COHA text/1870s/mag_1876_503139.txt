VOL . XXIL-AUGUST , 1876. - No. 2 . NEW YORK IN THE CONTINENTAL CONGRESS . THE earliest proposal for an American Congress appears to have originated in the broad statesmanship of William Penn , who in 1697 submitted to the Board of Trade what he termed a " Plan for a Union of the Colonies in America . " This sagacious plan provided for a meeting of the colonies once a year or oftener in times of war , and at least once in two years in times of peace , by their stated and appointed deputies-two persons to represent each colony , and the King 's Commissioner to preside . New York , as the centre of the colonies , was designated for the place of meeting . This scheme provided for the settlement of all disputes between the provinces , a general law for the collection of debts , the regulation of commerce , and finally an equitable adjustment of the quotas of men and money for purposes of defence-in a word , every essential feature of our present form of government . A similar proposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Lieutenant Governor of Pennsylvania . In 1739 this gentleman recommended to the British ministry to unite the colonies by delegations of their representative assemblies in a form of general government for the American provinces . This plan was based upon the necessities of union for defence against the common enemy . While the English settlers of various 10 origin securely held the seaport towns from Cape Cod to the Savannah river , the French  --  the ancestral enemies of England-were gradually establishing a series of posts along the St. Lawrence , the Ohio , and the Mississippi rivers , which threatened , unless broken , to form a military girdle about the English settlements and isolate the seaboard towns from the riches of the boundless west . In opposition to this New England , as the whole of the English settlements might be appropriately termed , the old continental rival was establishing a New France . To this struggie but one result was possible : the powerful marine of England controlled the outlets of all the great rivers on the middle coast , while France only held the extremities of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this unequal contest lay in their hold upon the Indian tribes . Little fit as the Latin race has always shown itself for colonization , it can not be denied that its natural amenity and flexibility have always given it a superior influence over savage tribes . The pomp and beauty of the Roman Catholic forms , appealing to the eye and the sense , were rapidly alienating the affections of the Indians from the English Government . To this influence was added the generous devotion of the French missionaries , who even in the rough , uncultivated wilds always Ei*ered , according to Act of con*ess , In the year 1876 , by SHELDON &amp; CO. , In the office of the Librarian of Congress , at Washington . // wore the insignia of their sacred office , and took willing part in the common life of the rude tribes to which they were assigned . The peace of Aix la-Chapelle , which in 1748 cLosed the war declared by Great Britain against France in 1744 , was but a truce , and served as an excuse for the maturing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hastencd to complete their interior line of communication westward , by forts not more than twenty to thirty miles distant from each other , extending from the Ohio to the Mississippi , and eastward by similar posts on the Connecticut and Kennebec rivers . ' In 1754 the British Government , alarmed at the threatening aspect of affairs , and recognizing the necessity of the friendship of the Indian tribes , then chiefly under the control of the Six Nations , whose seat of empire lay on the New York lakes , recommended the calling of a convention of delegates from the assemblies of the several colonies , and appointed Albany as the place of meeting , this place being selected because it was here that the Indian treaties had been usually signed . The letter from the Secretary of State of the British Government was by order of the King addressed to the Governor of New York . In this assembly , the first American Congress , Benjamin Franklin , delegate from Pennsylvania , proposed a plan for a union of the colonies , and the establishment of a quota @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here , as later and indeed in accordance with the universal experience of mankind , the idea of union is found to spring from a sense of common danger , which , disregarding distinctions of rank or fortune , combines men in common resistance to enemies , whether within or without the body of the state . Franklin 's plan met the general , almost universal acceptance of his colleagues . In this first Congress , as in later assemblages , some of the delegates had full powers , while others were held to make report to their constituents . Yet it was found that no single colony , from Georgia to Massachusetts , was ready to part with power to a general Government . The details of the plan , though here out of place , are full of curious interest . It was essentially a revival of the Penn scheme of 1697 . Rejected by the colonies , it was equally distasteful to the British ministry , and fell to the ground . Virginia , though invited , was not represented in this Congress . She had a plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two parts , constituting a northern and southern district  --  a curious forerunner of the recent attempt at separation . Shortly after the dissolution of the Indian Congress , by which name the meeting at Albany is known , hostilities between France and England were renewed . The French war , as the long and bloody struggle which began in 1756 and ended in 1763 with the conquest of the Canadas , is called , was an era full of . suffering and of glory to the colonies . hardly had the smoke drifted from the last battlefield ere the British Government attempted to compel the colenies to pay for its cost . The British ministry , in spite of the urgent appeals of every province , insisting on their arbitrary measures , a Congress was called by the Committee of the New York Assembly . This body , which met in New York in 1765 , is known as the Stamp Act Congress . Its only measure was a bold declaration of rights and grievances . It is impossible here to recount the events which followed : the renewed exaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American assemblies ; their unequal observance and the determination of New York to consent to no other form of resistance except that ordered and enforced by a General Congress . When it was found that New York was firmly set in this resolution , Massachusetts at last consented to her demand , and the first Continental Congress met in Philadelphia in September , 1774. // The New York delegation to this Congress was nominated by the famous Committee of Correspondence of Fifty-One , and their nomination later ratified by a unanimous vote of the freehold ers of the city . They were Philip Livingston , John Alsop , Isaac Low , James Duane , and John Jay , three merchants and two lawyers . John Jay set out on this journey on the 29th of August without the inhabitants being apprized of his departure , and on the Thursday following the 1st of September the other four delegates took their departure . Isaac Low , being , as is stated in the journals of the day , under the necessity of going by the way of Powles Hook , now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the foot of Cortlandt street , by a considerable number of inhabitants , with colors flying , music playing , and loud huzzas at the end of each street . When they got down to the river , he , in a very polite manner , took leave of the inhabitants , six of whom accompanied him and his lady over with music , playing " God save the King . " The inhabitants then returned to the coffee house  --  the famous old Merchants ' Coffee I-louse , which stood on the corner of Wall and Water streets - in order to testify the like respect to the other three gentlemen-James Duane , Philip Livingston , and John Alsop , Esquires . About half past nine the procession began , and was conducted in like manner as above . When they arrived at the Royal Exchange , which stood on the water front at the foot of Broad street , the place at which ' they embarked , James Duane , in a very affectionate and moving manner , thanked the worthy inhabitants for the honor they had conferred upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had it in command from the whole of his brother delegates , to acquaint them that nothing in their power should be wanting to relieve this once happy , but now aggrieved country . When the gentlemen got under way they were saluted by several pieces of cannon mounted on the joyous occa sion , which was answered by a greater number from St. George 's Ferry . These testimonials and three huzzas bade them go and proclaim to all nations that they and the virtuous people they represented dare defend their rights as Protestant Englishmen . After the gentlemen had got a little distance from the town , a considerable number went to St. George 's Ferry to celebrate their departure-dating the salvation of the colonies from that hour-well knowing in whom they had placed the greatest confidence that ever men were entrusted with . There were many loyal , constitutional , and spirited toasts drank , sealcd with frequent discharges of cannon , and attended with this declaration , " That each and every of them solemnly avowed they would respect at the risk of everything sacred and dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worthy gentlemen of the other colonies , should think necessary to adopt for the good of the common cause . " ' The day was concluded with " God save the King . " From the general text of this description it would seem that the answering cannon were on the opposite side of the river , near the foot of the present Joralemon street , and the festivities were had at the house of John Cornell , who had opened a tavern on Tower Hill , near the new Ferry , a slight eminence on the heights , on Columbia street , between the present Middagh and Cranberry streets , Brooklyn . The same newspaper , Hugh Game 's New York " Gazette and Weekly Mercury " of September 5 , 1774 , announced the departure of the delegates for Orange county , the choice of Colonel Philip Schuyler as a delegate for the county of Albany , and the decision of the inhaitants of Ulster , that concurring in the sentiments of New York , they should not send any delegates to Philadelphia . The proceedings of this body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members of the British Empire , ended in a simple petition to the King . // As yet the thought of separation was foreign to the heart if not the judgment of all except the most radical of the leaders of the patriot party . So the first Continental Congress , confining itself to declarations and resolves , and providing for a strict enforcement of a non-importation act , dissolved October 26 , 1774 , but with sagacious foresight arranged for the holding of another Congress at Philadelphia to be elected by the different colonies , and to meet also at Philadelphia on May 15 , 1775 . This was the immortal Congress which declared the independence of America . While the ' entire population was at this period strong in determination to resist the aggressions of the ministry , they yet , in common with their sister colonies , looked confidently to the support of the great Whig party , and the able advocacy of their illustrious champions , Chatham , Burke , and Barr6 , to secure redress . The struggle in America was viewed as a political division @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popular songs of the day show that the Americans valued their birthright as Britons , and took pride and honor in their English descent . An instance of this may have in-terest : Let Britons , now sunk Into tyrants and slaves , Submit to be governed by fools and by knaves . Not so with their kindred on this side the sea : American Britons will ever be free . Indeed the shrewd Colden had notified the ministry that the speeches in Parliament and other inflammatory papers , published in London and reproduced iii America , were ruining the King 's c*luse . The state of affairs in 1775 was different from what it had been in 1774 . The petition of Congress to the King had been rejected , and the sanguine hopes of an amicable adjustment which had united all parties in one common union had vanished . The condition of the New York colony was peculiar . With a population not exceeding 200 ,  - -  000 souls , and a large and extended frontier exposed to the attacks of the powerful Indian tribes whose loyalty to the King @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appalling . As a natural consequence the interior counties shrunk frota action , and were even less ready than the year preceding , when only two of them either concurred in the choice made by the city or sent delegates of their own . The General Assembly , swayed by the influence of Governor Colden and the patronage of the royal government , refusing to carry out the request of Congress to appoint delegates to its second meeting , the Congressional Committee of Inspection summoned a provincial convention to choose delegates . This convention met at the Exchange in New York on the 20th of April , and after a complimentary resolution , reelected the delegation to the first Congress , with the exception of Isaac Low , who refused to serve . Francis Lewis was appointed in his place . Isaac Low had been one of the leading spirits in the earlier movements of resistance . One of the richest and ablest merchants of the time , he was chosen to preside over the Committee of FiftyOne . He was of the committee in Congress which reported the Association , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was termed , but like many others , he was not prepared to sever his allegiance to the crown . The powers of the convention being exhausted with the choice of delegates , this body dissolved . The Assembly of the colony continued in session , but confined its action to a moderate petition to the King , setting forth grievances , after which , on the 3d of April , it was adjourned by direction of Lieutenant Governor Colden . This was the last colonial Assembly . Though prorogued from time to time , it never met again . It had lost the sympathy of the people , whose sentiments it no longer represented . On the 23d of April the news of the battle at Lexington was received . The people rose at once , took instant possession of the city , seizing the arms // and stores , organizing military patrols , and occupying the public buildings . The Revolution was begun . The Committee of Inspection enlarged its members , formed a general committee which took control of public affairs , and invited the several counties by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York , on May 22 , to " deliberate upon and from time to time to direct such measures as may be expedient for our public safety . " Thus the first Provincial Congress of New York , and after it a second , third , and fourth , delegating their powers to a Committee of Safety during the recesses , controlled the colony until the adoption of the State Constitution in 1777 . Illustrious as was the second Continental Congress , the history of which is too familiar to every American for repetition , there was no delegation more influential in the direction of affairs , by reason of their own personal importance and capacity as well as the position of the colony they represented , than that from New York . It included in its number many distinguished characters . In addition to the city members already mentioned , the counties sent solid representative men - Colonel Philip Sehuyler from Albany , the brilliant and versatile Robert R. Livingston , second to none in talent and influence , from Dutchess , Colonel Lewis Morris of Westchester , the representative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the colony had stanchly defended popular rights against the encroachments of the Crown ; and with these representatives of powerful families , George Clinton , himself a host ; the man upon whom Washington leaned with entire confidence ; distinguished for gallantry in the field , for wisdom in council ; the first Governor of the State of New York , President of the New York Federal Convention , and Vice-President of the United States , in the tenure of which high office he died . He was a man of rare energy and decision of character . The city delegation was not less able , and in its members fully represented the various interests of the commercial capital . Of the three merchants , the veteran Philip Livingston was the most distinguished . The grandson of Robert , the first , and son of Philip Livingston , second proprietor of the manor of Livingston , he was born at Albany in 1716 , and graduated from Yale college in 1737 , soon after which he established himself in New York , with his counting house on Burnet 's Key , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At this period of her history New York was controlled by the merchants , who permitted little meddling of lawyers in their affairs , and thought themselves quite competent to govern themselves without interference from this aggressive class of the community . Mr. Livingston was early called to office . In 1754 he was elected alderman for the East Ward ( one of the seven wards of the city ) , an office which he held until 1762 , and from 1759 to 1769 represented the city in the General Assembly of the colony . This , it will be remembered , was an important era in the history of the colonies , em bracing the period of the seven years ' war and the Stamp Act Congress . During his latter term of office he was Speaker of the House . Thus it was eminently proper that he should lead the city delegation . John Adams , in his " Diary , ** bears witness to his great popularity , and in his plain manner of speech describes him as a " downright , straightforward man . " He seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a part in the most important committees . He was strongly on the side of independence , as was the large powerful family of his name . It was he , however , that made it illustrious by affixing it to the Declaration of Independence in 1776 . The same year he was also chosen by Congress a mem // her of the Board of Treasury , and the next year placed upon the Marine Committee , both trusts for which his education and experience thoroughly fitted him . In 1777 he was chosen a member of the convention which met at Kingston to form a Constitution for the State of New York , and was again re-elected to Congress by it . In May he was chosen a Senator for the southern district , and in October following elected by the Legislature to represent the State in Congress under the new Constitution . In May , 1777 , he again took his seat in Congress , which had been driven by Cornwallis from Philadelphia , and was then sitting at York , in Pennsylvania . Feeble in health , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to its close . Living , he had sold part of his estates to support the public credit , and dying , his last efforts were in behalf of his country . He died on the 11th of June , 1777 , and was followed to the grave the evening of the day follow ing by Congress in a body , with the usual insignia of mourning . His remains were placed in the cemetery of the German Reformed Church , and covered by an appropriate monument . The next in importance , and of an age not far different from that of Philip Livingston , was John Alsop . The date of his birth is not precisely known . He was descended from Richard Alsop , who emigrated from England to America toward the close of the seventeenth century , and settled at Maspeth Kills , now known as Newtown , Long Island . His grandson , John Alsop , was brought up as a inerT chant . At first he seems to have been in , partnership with his brother Richard , but this connection was dissolved , Richard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general importing business in his own name , rapidly accumulated a handsome fortune . He took an active part in the patriotic measures adopted by the merchants to compel the repeal of the stamp act , and in 1770 was one of the Coinmittee of Inspection to enforce the agreements which were still continued . When the news of the passage of the Boston Port Bill reached New York in 1774 , and the Committee of Correspondence was chosen to take measures to unite the colonies in resistance , he was the first named of the fifty-one members , and on the organization of the committee was chosen deputy chairman . In the summer of the same year he was elected delegate  --  to the first Continental Congress . In May he was chosen one of the Committee of One Hundred charged with the government of the city until a convention could be assembled . In 1775 he was re-elected to the Second Continental Congress . He seems to have been one of those who could not bear the thought of a separation from the mother country . On the adoption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and withdrew from the city with his family to Middletown , whe*e he remained till the close of the war . That his patriotism and attachment to his native land were not doubted by those who knew him best is shown in the fact that he was in 1784 one of the petitioners to the Legislature for a new charter to the Chamber of Commerce , of which he had been one of the founders in 1768 , and became the first president on its reorganization . John Adams describes him as " a soft , sweet man , " and amiability is certainly a marked trait in his descendants . He died in this city November 22 , 1794 , " at an advanced age . " He left one child , who was married to the Hon. Rufus King . It is not necessary to refer to the many and eminent public services of this distinguished family . The senior member of the delegation was Francis Lewis , a native of Wales , who was educated at Westminster , came to this country in 1735 , and here married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extensive career visited many European countries , among which was Russia . In connection with the extraordinary travels // of this gentleman , the following tradition may not be out of place . During the severe winter of 1742- ' 3 , Mr. Lewis is said to have driven a horse and sled upon the ice from a point a short distance above Hurl Gate through the Sound and as far as Cape Cod in Massachusetts . This remarkable feat stands solitary and alone in the annals of American travel . In the French war he was employed as a commissary , and was taken prisoner at Fort Oswego when it surrendered to Montcalm . An active son of liberty , he was the favorite choice of the radical party , and in 1774 was unanimously added to the Committee of Fifty-one . In 1775 he was chosen delegate to the second Congress , and affixed his name to the immortal roll . He was employed by Congress in the importation of stores and on secret service , for which his old experience qualified him . In the summer of 1776 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and library were destroyed in the fall by the British troops . His wife was taken prisoner and cruelly treated , but through the influence of General Washington was finally exchanged . The last twenty years of the life of Mr. Lewis were passed at Flushing in retirement and comparative poverty . He died December 30 , 1803 , in the ninetieth year of his age . The Hon. Morgan Lewis , Governor of the State of New York , was his son . Such were the merchant members of the New York delegation . The two lawyers were of equal distinction . Of these the elder was James Duane , who was born in the city of New York in 1732 . Of Irish descent , he was the son of Anthony Duane , a British naval officer who had married and settled in New York . He studied law in the of fice of James Alexander , one of the most eminent counsel of our colonial bar , and the father of General Lord Stirling . He was admitted attorney in 1754 , and soon acquired a large practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which have already been alluded to , and in 1774 was chosen delegate to the general Congress , an appointment renewed in 1775 . He was also chosen a member of the Provincial Congress , and in this body he was engaged when the Declaration of Independence was signed , which accounts for his absence at the time of its signature by the New York delegation . In 1777 he was again returned to Congress , where he served with credit and usefulness until June , 1782 , when he obtained leave of absence to serve as Senator for the southern district of New York in the State Legislature . In 1784 he was appointed Mayor of the city of New York . At this time the Mayor was in fact as well as name a judicial magistrate . In the Mayor 's Court , while presided over by Mr. Duane , many of the most important cases famous in our judicial annals , and establishing precedents in the Government , were decided . Rapid as was the practice , hi 's decisions were rarely ovcrruled by the Supreme Court . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the channels by which the legal lore of England and the colony was conducted to those who have distributed it in our State courts , and caused these to become the admiration of our sister States . " And to this it may be added that the statute law of the State of New York is now acknowledged to be the best known combination of civil and common law , and commands the admiration of the world . In this famous court , where the principles of law were so soundly set forth , arose that galaxy of talent in which Hamilton , Burr , Troup , Lewis , Brockholdst and Edward Livingston , and Hoffman were especially illustrious . Mr. Duane retained the office of Mayor for six years , until 1789 , when Washington appointed him Judge of the United States District Court for New York , which he adorned with his learning and judgment , until advancing age compelled his withdrawal from active life . He died suddenly Febr*iary 21 , 1797 . He married a daughter // of Colonel Robert Livingston , third proprietor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charming country residence near the pre*ent Gramercy Park . To no one of the distinguished men of the revolutionary period was New York more indebted than to Mr. Duane . To broad abilities and pleasing manners he united self reliance and consistency of character . Chief among his traits was that most rare quality of bold assumption of responsibility in every emergency , whether of personal or public danger . In private life he is described as " of a kind , cheerful , and social disposition , fond of society . There is no tradition of his ever having lost a friend . " The person of John Jay is familiar to us all . Tall and slight of figure , of easy carriage , and an expression of countenance in which the finest traits of human character were happily displayed , charity and generosity , piety and rectitude , he combined the graceful affability of the gentleman with the dignity of the statesman and the simplicity of the man-in a word , the highest types of the fine races from which he sprang . The fathers of the republic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : the massive majesty of Washington , the benignity of Franklin , the grace and beauty of the intellectual Hamilton , would have been remarked in any assembly of the great of earth in any period of the world 's history . Their features live in color , and awaken a dramatic interest . But in this American Walhalla Jay invites sentiments of a different order . As some Grecian statue of purest marble and faultless outline , solitary and apart in a gallery of portraits all warm in color and in life , so this figure , exquisite in its chaste purity and calm serenity , stands alone . It was proper to the completion of his history and the fitness of things that he became the first Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the nation his wise counsels had aided to create , and it is one of the incalculable blessings of our country that he will always remain to it an example of personal and judicial purity . His character may be best resumed in the words of that wonderful master of our language whose magic speech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the ermine of the judicial robe fell on John Jay it touched nothing less spotless than itself . " At the time of his election to the first Continental Congress in 1774 Jay was only twenty-nine years of age , ' the youngest in that remarkable body of men . Already he had reached the first rank in his profession , and met on equal terms the veterans of the law . The Address to the People of Great Britain , the most famous of those remarkable documents which won the signal praise of Chatham as " not inferior to the finest productions of the master States of the world , " and which was declared by Thomas Jefferson , while yet ignorant of the author , to be from the " finest pen in America , " was written by Jay . Re-elected , as has been stated , to the second Congress , he prepared the Address to the People of Canada , and a further Address to Our Fellow Subjects of Jamaica and Ireland , both of which were adopted . It is not proposed here to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple enumeration would be tedious . In April , 1776 , Mr. Jay , while still in his seat , was elected to the third New York Provincial Congress , and at once seeking the position among his immediate fellow citizens where his services could be most valuable to the cause , he left Philadelphia , and on the 25th of May took his place in the Provincial Congress , then sitting in New York . Here his influence was soon apparent , while his fellow members had the advantage of his intimate knowledge of the views and purposes of the distinguished men who had assembled in Philadelphia from all the colonies . The people of the city were already clamorous for stringent measures , and on the 29th of May circulated a petition calling upoa // the Piovincial Congress to " instruct their delegates in Continental Congress to use their utmost endeavors in that august assembly to cause these united colonies to become independent of Great Britain . " Before this petition was presented , a committee , of which Mr. Jay was a member , on the 81st of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommendations of the General Congress , to the assemblies of the several colonies , that they adopt " such government as shall in the opinion of the representatives of the people best conduce to the happiness and safety of their constituents in particular and America in general . " In their report , true to the old New York doctrine of obedience to the popular will , duly expressed , the committee , after stating that they " are in dozd*t as to whether the Provincial Congress are invested with sufficient power and authority to determine on so important a subject as the necessity of creating and constituting a new form of government , and a declaration that it appertains of right solely to the peo*le of this colony to determine the said doubts , " solemnly recommended the electors in each county to vest power in their present deputies , or others in their stead , to take into consideration the necessity and propriety of instituting such new government as in and by the said resolution of the Continental Congress is described and recommended ; each county was requested to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Inspection should determine , and deputies were urged to give punctual attendance in the city of New York the second Monday in July . The people , still chafing under the delay , again protested to the Provincial Congress , on the 14th of June , against the entertainment of any such doubts  --  and indeed , if the city only were concerned , no doubts could exist  --  but the delegates , true to their trust , required a formal vote of the whole colony . Popular rights had always been carefully maintained in the New York colony . As early as 1711 , when a second convention of governors was held at Newport , and a union of colonies proposed for defence , the General Assembly had expressly declared that the Governor not representing this colony as those of Connecticut , Rhode Island , and Massachusetts did their colonies , being their choice , he was not authorized to " oblige or charge the colony of New York by any Agreement whatsoever , " and they refused to vote his salary while absent . Thus the Assembly , representatives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act of a Governor who held authority from the King . On the 10th of June the Provincial Congress received a letter from their delegates , announcing that the question of independence would shortly be agitated in Congress , and asking for instructions . Their old instruc tions only authorized them to consent to measures which should be " effectual for the re-establishment and preservation of American rights and privileges and the restoration of harmony " between the colonies and the mother country . Independence was no new question . It did not originate with any of the illustrious men who brought it to its triumphant solution . Their action was but the achievement of a long familiar purpose , more familiar perhaps to the minds of the body of the people , from whom all revolutions spring , than to the educated and wealthier classes , whose sympathies are always with existing governments which secure their property and grant them place and power . Especially was this the case in the New York colony . From an early period New York had been accused by the home Government of aspiring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of popular resistance to arbitrary power . The letter of the delegates , read on the 10th , was debated the next day , when , on motion of Mr. Jay , the Congress declared its opinion that they had not the power to authorize their // delegates to ' declare the colony independent of the crown , and limiting their own session to the second Tuesday in July succeeding , or until a regular government should be established for the colony , they earnestly urged the election they had proposed in May of a new Provincial Congress with full powers . The election for the new Provincial Congress was held on the 19th of June , and the question of independence settled by the people-and settled , as every such question has always been in the city of New York , in favor of popular government . June 20 , the day after the election , the Provinciaf Congress adopted the articles of Association , as yet the only measure recommended by the Continental Congress , engaging themselves to defend the United Colonies against the hostile attempts of the British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be no further doubt as to the determination of New York in favor of absolute separation from the crown ; but it is also plain that this action placed it out of the power of the New York delegation at Philadelphia to vote for independence , or for the Provincial Congress in New York to instruct them so to vote . The popular will had elected a body especially charged to cast the vote of the colony  --  a sufficient answer to the charge of hesitation or delay on the part of New York . Hardly was the election terminated when a new turn of military affairs threw the city into anxiety and alarm . Lord Howe and Clinton , hemmed in by Washington and compelled to evacuate Boston , embarked the British forces on board of transports which sailed for Halifax to refit , and had long been expected at New York , where Washington , divining the aims and purposes of the enemy , had ab ready preceded them . Yet even he was not aware of the formidable preparations made by the ministry . On the 29th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in a few days was increased by later arrivals to one hundred and forty vessels , which at once commenced landing their troops on Staten Island . The Provincial Congress , expecting an immediate attack on the city , or-* dered the transfer of the papers , lead , powder , and other military stores belonging to the colony to White Plains . The Government never again returned to the city until the close of the war . The history of New York in the last century has never been written . Owing to its occupation by the enemy during the war , its records have been scattered , its newspaper files are meagre and incomplete , and its attitude on the great questions of the period is only to be learned by careful examination of numerous and separated authorities . When it shall be written in the light of faithful portraiture it will be found to be consistent and honorable , without spot or blemish  --  the record of a people which from the earliest beginnings of the American settlement recognized itself as the natural arbiter of sectional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While New York was impatiently awaiting the meeting of their new delegates , the resolution of independence , reported by Jefferson the 28th of June , was under consideration by the Continental Congress , sitting in Philadelphia , which had set apart the 1st of July for its debate .

The next day , the 2d of July , instructions arrived from Delaware , the dissatisfied members from Pennsylvania absented themselves from their seats , leaving the vote of that colony to the minority , and the South Carolina delegates changing their minds , the resolution was unanimously passed , and on Thursday , the 4th of July , the famous Declaration was published to the world .

The letter of the New York delegates was referred to a committee , of which John Jay was chairman , who in the afternoon of the same day reported a resolution approving the same , and engaging the New York colony to join with the other colonies " in supporting it at the risk of their lives and fortunes . " The original resolution , in the handwriting of Jay , is preserved among the records of New York . Thus was this great State , the enemy thundering at her doors , her capital deserted and given ovcr to military occupation , her trade and industry paralyzed , and her frontiers threatened by a savage enemy , with the near certainty of becoming the bloody field of contest , committed to the cause of American Union , and thus , as has been happily said , " was the finishing stroke put to the Declaration of Independence . " The purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shades of the actors in those heroic scenes . It is not for our wand to call up the presence - Of the great of old , The dead but scepter 'd sovereigns , who still rule Our spirits from their urns . Not such our ambition . Its sole object has been to vindicate the course pursued by New York in relation to independence , and to claim for it a record of full and perfect patriotism . It is not claimed that there were not many Tories in New York , although , if the recent correspondence of John Adams and his wife be correct , in which the number is stated as so great in Boston in 1776 that it was recommended that transports be advertised for to carry them to Halifax , New York was not alone in that respect ; nor yet is it for us to judge in our balance the motives or the conduct of those who in the face of danger and suffering clung to their allegiance to Great Britain . Enough if this statement have succeeded in directing attention to the honorable attitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boston , unexpectedly delivered from the bombardment which she had feared , and Philadelphia , not yet dreaming that the wave of invasion would ever cross her borders , could discuss the grave question of independence inquiet serenity , New York was forced to take her bold stand in the very hour of conflict , at the cannon 's mouth , awaiting each hour the signal of the attack which this adoption of the Declaration of Independence was sure to hasten . More than all is its purpose answered if it have contributed in something to redeem New York from the charge of indifference and hesitation , so carelessly made against her in the present day , and to show by contrast the manly and consistent independence of her character and her conduct .
