txt The rapid succession of crime and development of crime in the little State of Connecticut within a few weeks past has attracted wide attention , and revived the recollection of other tragedies of like character perpetrated within her borders within the year . The whole record is startling , and especially so when it is remembered that the population of the Nutmeg State is scarcely one ? half that of New-York City ; and that by reason of puritanical antecedents and training , higher education and rustic occupations , the moral tone of her people ought to be far above the average in the New World 's Metropolis . In the single County of New-London there have been no less than 20 homicides since 1870 ; while in the whole State , during the six months from last February to July , inclusive , there were at least 11 , not including in this last number the murder of Mackey , in North Stenington. by Goddard , who interfered to prevent the drunken assailant from abusing his wife ; for , although sentence was only pronounced on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year ago . The mysterious killing of Benjamin Muzzy , of Norwich , who had improper relations with a girl named Lovisa Bowen , by either her or her father , a year ago , also is not among the number . Nor is the murder of a prison keeper by a convict at Wethersfield , last Fall , included . The recent attempt of William Bromham , of New-Haven , to drown his brother in order to inherit his money , and of the people of Ansonia to lynch the negro Freeman for rape , having failed , they , too , are omitted from the awful catalogue , which reads as follows , the arrangement not being chronological , but rather in order of the enormity of the several deeds : William Moloney , of Norwich , a rum-seller , ' ticked Michael Kennedy in the abdomen so that he died . A farmer in Newtown named quarreled with a brother in a field , and drove the tine of a dune-fork through the latter 's brain.q Edward O'Brien , of Farmington , slew his own father in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his father fatally with a butcher-knife because that parent preferred to live with a married daughter instead of this son . An unknwn man was laid out with a blow from an axe at Patrick Hickey 's boardinghouse , in New-Haven , and thrown out of the window . There wa. , something like deliberation in this case . Mrs. Alexander of Bridgeport , who , with Frank Bassett , chloroformed the miserable Weinbecker , in order to sell his body for dissection for ' the paltry sum of $25 , has been 3onnected with two other like crimes in this State , to say nothing of her horrible connection with one on Staten Island . Mary Stannard , of Madison , a serving-girl , who , though not a " lovely woman , " nevertheless " stooped to folly , " andlearned " too late , that man betrays , " was cruelly butchered in broad daylight by a party unknown , who had enticed her into the woods . Last February Mrs. Wesley W. Bishop , of Norwich . was poisoned , and in June Charles H. Cobb , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growing out of a criminal intimacy that had existed between Mr. Bishop and Mrs. Cobb , and out of a conspiracy between them to get rid of their consorts . It might be remarked here , in order to illustrate another phase of the same popular demoralization , that during the single month of October just past there were no less than 16 suicides in the State , besides five or six unsuccessful attempts at self-destruction . The Bishop-Cobb tragedy was revived unexpectedly the last of September ' by successive and startling statements by one of the criminals , both of whom come to trial here to-morrow . Last June , when Mr. Cobb died , a post-mortem examination was had , and a chemical analysis made by Prof. Charles Doremus , of New-York , which showed that arsenic and other poisons had been administered . Mrs. Bishop 's remains were then exhumed , and similar:processes were instituted , with similar results . A protracted preliminary judicial examination was then held , which ended in the committal of Bishop and Mrs. Kate Cobb to jail to await the action of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for murder in the first degree , Bishop being charged with complicity in both murders , and Mrs. Cobb with that of her husband . But at the September term the Superior Court had two homicides to try besides these , and the new indictments were left until November for prosecution , and , until the remarkable series of confessions began , six weeks ago , the subject subsided from public thought . To a more perfect understanding of the approaching trial , a brief retrospect is essential : " Charlie Cobb , " as he was familiarly known , was a young man of fine character and ability , though perhaps not of high ? culture . He was Commandant of the local post of the Grand army of the Republic , Recorder of the lodge of Royal Arch Masons . and Collector of Town and City Taxes . He had two or three children . His wife is a small , good-looking , vivacious woman , given to quoting sentimental verses , and quite gushing " in hor manners . She is deep , and remarkably self-contained . During @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she affected a ; very languid and oppressed manner , which nearly everybody took to he shamming . She also made a pretense of fainting once or twice . It is narrated that , having been removed from the court-house to the jail one noon , and being left in a chair in the yard of the jail , apparently so weak that she could not stand alone , she jumped up in a very sprightly manner when she thought she was unobserved , and moved her chair back out of the sunshine . When the jailer reappeared she feigned great exhaustion once more . During this whole time , nevertheless , she is not believed to have exhibited any real emotion or weakness . She has had the good sense to secure altogether the ablest criminal lawyer in this section for her counsel , Hon. John T. Wait , member of Congress for this district . She has also had the judgment to maintain the strictest reticence except to her counsel and her mother , Mrs. Waterman . Wesley W. Bishop is a man of about 35 , unprepossessing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was a druggist , in which business he gained a familiarity with the character and use of poisons . He was intemperate in his habits , and is said to have more than once imperiled life by putting up prescriptions wrongly when intoxicated . He gave alp that business two or three years ago , and entered a grocery store as salesman and driver of the delivery wagon . His employer also kept a livery stable , and for fatally overdriving one of his horses he discharged Bishop about the time of Cobb 's death . Bishop had been a potty politician , like Ms brother , the ex-Deputy Sheriff , and had even served on a district board of education , though scarcely qualified for such service . Under Mrs. Cobb 's influence he had stopped drinking , and he and his wife and Mrs. Cobb all belonged to a Good Templars ' Lodge , where social exercises were held weekly . Upon the death of Mrs. Bishop . in February , Mrs. Cobb selected some touching obituary verses , which she read very effectively at Bishop 's funeral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicating the strength and tende ? - Iles of the attachment existing between the two ladies . The families lived tolerably near each other , and had long been intimate , visiting frequently . It should be added that Bishop also belonged to the Masonic ? traternity , and that Cobb seems to have reposed perfect confidence in him up to his dying moment . Two salient features of the affair , since CObb 's death , are Bishop 's inability to keep his ' mouth shut , and the deep interest which the Masonic fraternity take in the matter . Bishop was out of town the day of Cobb 's death , but immediately remarked , on hearing of the news , that Ile would not be surprised if arsenic wore found in Cobb 's remains . Two days afterward he sought a brother Mason to whom ho wished to impart a secret . Mr. A. H. Brower , the gentleman in question , and High Priest of the lodge , refused to listen at first . But , after several others had been asked in like manner , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had expressly stipulated not to conceal the revelation if the ends of justice would thereby be defeated . Bishop then confessed to having bought ? arsenic- at Cobb 's request , supposing the latter wished to use it to kill a dog . But as Bishop did not endeavor to communicate this fact until after the Masonic brethren had already instituted a post-mortem examination and chemical analysis , and as the circumstance confided did not seem to call for all the mystery and agitation attendant upon his actions , it was generally believed at the time that Ile had something on his conscience which forced him to make explanations to avert suspicion , but that his quasi-confessions were greatly distorted versions of the real truth , if not absolute lies . On Sunday , the 20th of September , having idreviously arranged therefor , Bishop made an extended statement to his uncle , S. B. Bishop , and Mr. Rufus . M. Ladd , which was written out and forwarded to the State 's Attorney . The following - evening he reiterated its substance verbally to these two men and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and John P. Barstow . At least two of these gentlemen are prominent Masons . The statement 's general tenor was that criminal relations had long existed between himself and Mrs. Cobh , but that she had made the first overtures thereto when be called at her house to take orders for groceries . Ho admitted that they had conspired to make away with their respective partners , but that the woman instigated and continually urged on the deed . He mentioned sonic of the circumstances of his wife 's illness , and stated that he bought morphine to substitute for her medicine , but that when he came to administer it his heart failed him , Macbeth-like , and lie threw it into the fire . He avowed that he knew not hoe- his wife 's death was caused . In both of these talks he admitted buying flitch poison at various times , and having bought strychnine for Mrs. Cobb a few days before her husband 's death , On Thursday he summoned the five who had at first listened to hint and made a second statement , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Mrs. Cobb the day before his wife died : that she came to his house in his absence in the early evening , and administered morphine to Mrs. Bishop instead of the prescribed aconite ; and that she met him an hour afterward at the Good Templars ' lodge , where'she mentioned this , and advised him to give his wife another dose at 10 o'clock , when the medicine next became due , Friday night he made still a third statement the first worthy the name of a confession ? in which he admitted that Ile did administer three grains of morphine at 10 o'clock in place of the doctor 's prescription . He also conversed about the visits which Mr. and Mrs. Cobb were wont to make him , and of the refreshments he served to them . He declared that Mrs. Cobb , congratulating him on his success in getting rid of his wife , urged him to practice on Cobh , but that he replied that he could get no chance unless he should resume drinking and so inveigle Charlie into a social glass . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave a little oyster supper at his house , which Mr. and Mrs. Cohn were to attend , and she suggested in advance that ho improve the chance to put poison in Cobb 's coffee . Nothing further was imparted that night , however ; yet his auditors , already summoned four times , went away with a secret conviction that this tragic narration , already continued like an Arabian Night 's tale , was still unfinished , and that something further would yet.be revealed by the tortured Bishop before many days . But ho has since strictly held.his peace . It is interesting to note , at this stage of the proceedings , the influences that probably operated on Bishop 's mind to impel these successive statements , and the bearing of Mrs. Cobb meantime . For some days prior to Bishop 's first confidential conversation , his Pastor , Rev. Hugh Montgomery , Methodist . and his uncle , S. B. Bishop , deacon in a leading Congregational Church , had pressed him to confess , if lie had anything to confess , for his soul 's good . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public as to his guilt , doubtless actuated him to his first statement . Certainly no offers of mercy came from the authorities . The contemptible meanness of his throwing all the blame on Mrs. Cobb in this statement , however , elicited from press and people denunciations which were quickly communicated to him . Mrs. Cobb had the so-called confession shown to her in print 1w her lawyer immediately , and she indignantly pronounced it false . She endeavored to communicate with Bishop thereupon , but the note was intercepted by the jailer . and its : contents are not known . Moreover , his friends frankly told him that he bad either told too much or too little , and that he had better reveal the truth , but to speak " as if in the very presence of God Almighty . " Bishop 's lawyer left hint at this stage of the proceeding , profanely terming him a "  --  fool " for talking so much . Under the pressure of these new circumstances , Bishop saw that he must try to mend matters ; and yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it . Hence the reserve of his Thursday night 's statement , which immediately evoked another storm of popular disgust and rage , the echoes of which penetrated the walls of the jail . But even then he was meditating further confidences , for that very night he arranged for Friday 's interview , the result of which has already been stated . This brings us down to the latest developments in the case . Last week the Superior Court came in at Norwich . Bishop 's counsel , Messrs . S. S. and S. H. Thresher , having withdrawn from his case at the time of the confessions , he was brought into court to make provision for his defense . He at first asked Judge Culver to assign Hon. Augustus Brandagee , ex-Mayor , of New-London , and a fine criminal lawyer , to him . But Mr. Brandagee 's engagements prevented his serving . Bishop then asked for Hon. Lafayette S. Foster , ex-United States Senator , and formerly on the State Supreme Court Bench . Mr. Foster was likewise unable to act . Thirdly , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Attorney , but with the same result . Finally , he secured A. F. Park , of this city , a brother of the Chief  --  Justice of the State . But the short time which Mr. Park had to prepare his case , and the utter impossibility of making a strong defense anyhow , after these confessions , renders his task almost hopeless . A great interest is felt in the result of the approaching trials , not only because of the features of the double murder involved , but because of the growing- sentiment in this section that the courts have dealt too leniently with those who have committed this class of crime of late . When , early in October , ChiefJustice Park sentenced Goddard to 18 months ' imprisonment and Moloney to 60 days ' imprisonment and a fine of $500 , there was much popular indignation manifested , and the press took the matter up very generally , and severely criticised his decisions . and Hoyt have gone to prison for life . Mrs. Alexander was convicted last week and sentenced to imprisonment for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her sex . Bassett , her accomplice , has not been tried . Neither has Hayden , the supposed murderer of Mary Stannard . Next on the list conic Wesley W. Bishop and Kate M. Cobb . Mrs. Cobb will ho tried first , as Bishop will be a valuable witness for the State . It is understood that when the case comes up to-morrow , Col. Wait , her counsel , will endeavor to secure a postponement , at first for a week , and . then until next March . The general supposition is that Judge Culver will confer with Chief-Justice Park relative to the matter , such consultation being customary , and the fear is entertained that the Chief-Justice will favor the adjournment . Inasmuch as one of the most important witnesses for the State is the mother of Bishop , who is in precarious health , there is a manifest advantage to the prisoners in deferring the trial until next Spring ; but for this reason the State will not be disposed to favor the project . An incident has just become known which constitutes a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her victim 's memory . . Wesley Bishop has a daughter , now about 11 years of age , who , since his arrest , has been in the " Rocknook Home " or orphan asylum . It appears that several years ago her father promised her a gold chain to wear about her neck on the ninth anniversary of her birthday . When that occasion arrived , the chain was not forthcoming . But last week Bishop requested a friend to bring the child to hint , saying that he had procured the promised ornament , on which was to be hung his wife 's wedding ring .
