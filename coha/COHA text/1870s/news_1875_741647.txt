txt It is not possible at present to foresee the acid of the mischief likely to result from le failures in the iron trade which are re ? ) rted by cable from England . It is said tat the aggregate liabilities are likely to nount to several Millions sterling , and , if to predictions of the London Dines prove ' Lie , we may anticipate a serious crisis in se English markets . A large amount of stress will inevitably be spread among the sople , business must receive a check which ? will require considerable time to recover om , andpossibly au injury of a much snore arable kind may be inflicted on the interits most immediately concerned . Where , then , does the responsibility for so uch evil mainly rest The case is iu no way parallel to that of the failure of JAY COOKE &; Co. and its consequences here . We have no reason to attribute it to overspeculation , or to speculation with borrowed or fictitious capital . It is only necessary to have followea the history of the iron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enable us to understand that it may be simply the inevitable result of a depression of business , and of unavailable striving against insurmountable obstacles . The existence of that depression has been a feature in the iron trade for a long time . Much of the business that used to be done in England and Scotland has been transferred to Belgium and other foreign countries . Plenty of contracts have been offering , but many of them could not be taken . Where they have been taken , the risks have been so great and the margin left at the end for profit so small , that manufacturers would , in many instances , have done better if they had closed their works . And the cause for all this has been with the workmen , who , striking for higher and impossible wages , have demoralized themselves , starved their families , and are now being taught to feel that they have also effectually ruined the sources of their own living . If the misery to which such great failures lead could be concentrated on the people to whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be called upon to offer anything in the shape of a protest . A man has a right to sillier for his own crimes , and no one need pity him . But when a wide circle , and perhaps an entire community , is made to pay the penalty , it is time that the public should begin to think whether something in self-defense ought not to be attempted . We have repeatedly pointed out the error committed by trades-unions in seeking to enforce a standard rate of wages which is not justified by the state of business , and in aiming at a despotic control over the private action of individual workmen ; and we have some reason to think that sounder views are beginning to prevail among the working classes . But after all , nothing is so likely to come home to their understandings as the evidence which is now afforded of the consequences of their own policy . When they find that large capitalists can not afford to despise market rulings , and that their own means of subsistence are taken away as a natural result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to realize the existence of a stronger argument than any that eau be offered by the pen . If such be the case , failures of the kind now reported will have their bright side and their usefulness . They will teach a lesson which is much wanted , and which , in all certainty , must be taught before trade organizations can be made to keep within their legitimate limits . Yet it is but a poor reflection ' on the intelligence of the modern working man to find that lessons of such severity are necessary before he is able to understand the simplest principles of political economy , or before he will allow himself to be guided by the plainest common sense . We will do them the justice to behove that very many of them do not bring their judgment or reason into exercise in these matters at all , or at least not until it is too late . They merely follow the lead of men more wily than themselves , who , for pay or notoriety , undertake to dazzle the eyes of their followers with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aspect , working men , as a body , do not gain by strikes . The chief of the staff of the Charity Hospital on Blackwell 's Island reports that every strike of any magnitude in New-York is always followed , after about ton days , by a considerable accession to the number of inmates in that institution . And experience tells the same tale everywhere . Strikes are a constant source of misery . They fail entirely of the object for which they are proposed , for employers are driven by them to a policy of self-defense which , but for strikes , would never have been contemplated . They ruin a great number of families , who are dependent upon weekly wages for their support . They injure business , and produce effects which , as in the instance before us , may spread into dimensions that at first can not be calculated . These , however , are statements which workmen have hitherto been very loath to believe , but which wilt probably be impressed upon them very effectually in due time . For if trade organizations have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the iron trade , they have certainly prepared the way by creating a condition of things which rendered them almost inevitable .
